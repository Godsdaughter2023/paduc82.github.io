<h2>            Problems installing or running TurboTax 2016</h2>
                    I'm trying to install TurboTax on my Windows 10 Home Version 1607 64-bit computer. It seems to run fine but TurboTax won't run. If I boot into safe mode (with networking) and try to install TurboTax (after having uninstalled) I get a dialog box that says
 "Error Code 1601: Windows installer is not accessible".

            I've done a bit more research. The 1601 error is not actually a problem. By design, the Windows Installer is not available in Safe Mode, so installing any software that requires the Windows Installer can't happen in Windows Mode.<br />
<br />
I want to clarify my original problem. As far as I can tell, TurboTax installed just fine, but when I go to run it, nothing happens. The people at Intuit, makers of TurboTax, decided that it must not have installed properly. After numerous iterations of uninstalling
 and reinstalling in various "clean" environments, they decided to try to have me install in Safe Mode. When a 1601 error was thrown, they concluded that it is a Microsoft Windows problem, not theirs, even though, as I pointed out, if that had been the case
 I wouldn't be the first to report problems. Clearly they don't understand what the 1601 problem is. And apparently they don't have technical people to analyze the problem<br />
<br />
So, my problem still stands. I can't get TurboTax Deluxe 2016 to install on my Windows 10 Home (1607 Anniversary Edition) 64-bit computer.

            Again, it is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NOT</strong></span> a problem with the installer CD or download<strong>!</strong> That all works properly. TurboTax just won't run. And
 thrown), so they've just washed their hands of it and decided that it's a Microsoft problem. I'm now guessing that something already running on my computer is interfering.<br />
<br />
Still, you'd think that Intuit would want to know what's going on so that they could improve their product.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hello Brittainy,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the issue description, I understand that you are experiencing a popping and crackling sound&nbsp;specially with downloaded and streaming music files and the system sound.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can imagine how frustrating it could be when computer behaves unusual.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This seems to be the audio driver issue. Let’s try updating the drivers from the computer manufacturer’s website and check if that fixes the issue. Before that, In order to understand this issue better, I would like to gather the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;What is the exact model number of your Dell computer?</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;What is the exact make and model of the sound card in the computer?</div>
<div>3.&nbsp;Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to perform these methods and check if that resolves the issue. First let’s run the “Playing Audio” troubleshooter and check if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the Audio Troubleshooter</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The “Playing Audio” Troubleshooter is an automated tool which will check the output audio devices connected to the computer for any known issues with it and provides the details on how to fix them. Follow these steps and run the troubleshooter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</div>
<div>3. In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</div>
<div>4. Click on “Playing Audio”.</div>
<div>5. Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.</div>
<div>6. Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the troubleshooter fails to find and fix the errors, then let’s disable the audio enhancements and check if that resolves the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Try disabling the Audio Enhancements from the speaker properties</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Click on the speaker icon on the system tray on the taskbar from the Desktop Interface of the computer.</div>
<div>2. Click on the link “Mixer”.</div>
<div>3. It will open up a small window named “Volume Mixer – Speakers”.</div>
<div>4. Under device, click on the “Speakers” icon to open the “Speaker Properties” window.</div>
<div>5. Open the “Enhancements” tab.</div>
<div>6. Disable all the audio enhancements by selecting the check box which says “Disable all enhancements”.</div>
<div>7. Click on “Apply” and then “Ok”.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may disable all the enhancements and check if that fixes the issue. If disabling audio enhancements resolves this audio problem, then this typically indicates that your audio driver needs to be updated. So, let’s try that and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: </strong>Update the Sound Card Drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong>Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</div>
<div>2. Type “Updates” in the search bar and click on “Install optional updates” from the left pane.</div>
<div>3. From the “Windows Update” window, click on “Check for Updates” on the top left corner to receive a fresh list of updates and install all the updates listed there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> Try updating the drivers from the Device Manager.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Press “Windows Logo” + “X”.</div>
<div>2. Click on “Device Manager”.</div>
<div>3. Search for the Sound Card from the device list and right click on it and select “Update Driver Software”.</div>
<div>4. Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the installation of the latest driver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If no drivers are available, then check in the computer and sound card manufacturer’s website for the Windows 8 audio drivers for your sound card. If they are available, then download and install them on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong> If the issue still persists,&nbsp;Place the computer in&nbsp;<strong>Clean Boot
</strong>state and find out if any application/service is causing this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. Perform a clean boot on the computer by following the steps given in the link:</div>

<div>Follow all the steps given in this link and try to figure out the application or service causing this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;The computer which you are trying to access is this on the same network?<br />
2.&nbsp;How many computers are there in the network?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try the methods mentioned below on a machine which you were trying to access.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> You may try to turn off password protected sharing and see if that helps:<br />
<div>Password protected sharing is on by default for computers on workgroups. When password protected sharing is enabled, people using other computers on your network can't access your shared folders or printers unless they have a user account on your computer.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow these steps:<br />
<div>a.&nbsp;Open <strong>Network and Sharing Center </strong>by clicking the<strong> Start
</strong>button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>Network and Internet,</strong> and then clicking
<strong>Network and Sharing Center. <br />
</strong></div>
<div>b.&nbsp;Under <strong>Sharing and Discovery</strong>, click the arrow button&nbsp; next to<strong> Password protected sharing.<br />
</strong></div>
<div>c.&nbsp;Click <strong>Turn off password protected sharing,</strong> and then click
<strong>Apply</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> You may temporarily disable security software and check if that helps:<br />
<div>Refer the link mentioned below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disable antivirus software<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a>
<div><br />
<strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />

    <title>Freeze, Buzz and Blue screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt_19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freeze, Buzz and Blue screen</h2>
                    <p>So i upgraded to windows 10 about a year or so ago. Everything was fine until around August of this year, i began experiencing random freezes no matter what application i was using, whether it be Chrome, Brackets, YouTube or other and when i have audio running
 during one of these freezes it creates this buzzing sound which is like a rapid loop of the last sound. Sometimes my pc will recover and continue with the video/application, other times the buzzing sound will last for up to a few minutes and then inevitably
 show the blue screen of death. This got severely bad around the start of September, to the point were i sometimes couldn't even get passed the log in screen for my pc, even if i did it'd only last for 30 minutes at most. Eventually, after multiple blue screens
 within a 10 minute period, it gave me the option to completely reinstall windows 10, getting rid of all applications that didn't come with the pc, while still keeping my personal files. This worked for a few weeks until i started getting the freeze and buzz
 again, but since it didn't blue screen i didn't want to mess with anything. It didn't blue screen until tonight.
</p>
<p>I'm afraid that it will go into total shutdown mode again which i can't have happen. Having to reinstall all my office 365, adobe and other such apps this deep into the college term would be a bit annoying to say the least. I've searched for updates on a
 handful of relevant drivers like processor, sound (a forum suggested it) etc. I've searched for updates to windows 10, my pc seems fine temperature wise.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be a virus either, i had both avira and windows defender the first time it happened, windows said that running another antivirus on top of defender could cause conflict so i tried it out but evidently it's not the antiviruses fault since it's
 slowly happening again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an asus manufactured PC;</p>
<p>AMD FX 8300 eight core processor (3.30 GH)</p>
<p>12GB ram</p>
<p>AMD Radeon graphics card</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have this problem on windows 8 (granted i was only on it for about half a year), so i assume this is a windows problem and not a hardware fault.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You could be talking about your standard taskbar, but what I will guess is the "taskbar with handy shortcuts" is most likely the dell dock from your description. You alsodidn't mention what computer&nbsp;manufacturer you have either, (all of this&nbsp;info by the
 way&nbsp;helps out to mention to give the volunteers a better chance to answer your question by the way)- but I'm guessing it's a Dell.&nbsp;If you don't supply any information to your system or the program a volunteer will have to&nbsp;either guess (extrapolate sounds better)&nbsp;or
 we ask you for&nbsp;more information so I'll just guess because it is the&nbsp;most likely scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So anyway, if you have dell dock (which installs itself by default on the top of your computer as a task bar on the top of the screen), &nbsp;and it disappeared- a couple things you can try:</p>
<p>First. Hit Ctrl-Esc on your keyboard, this brings up the Start/Search bar. Type "dell dock", this will load the dell dock if it is installed. Right click and choose "advanced settings". A&nbsp;couple things to take a look at from here: &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Change dock location button/ and make sure "Autohide to edge" is unchecked.</p>
<p>2. Make sure that "run at startup" and "lock dock settings" are checked.</p>
<p>If the program does not load when you type "dell dock" you can always re-install it. &nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't have a Dell and this doesn't sound like a Dell dock issue that is also a possibility if this occurs. Let us know...</p>
<p>At any rate to re-install, here is the install page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.delldock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.delldock.com/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;Here is some more info on versions of this software:</p>

<p><a href="http://alienware.ourtoolbar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://alienware.ourtoolbar.com/</a></p>

 about any of them is the download.&nbsp; $89 seems to be a fairly common price (I didn't see any lower but I wasn't looking for prices but for freeware so there may be some less expensive).&nbsp; There does not appear to be freeware to do this (or if there is, I can't
 find it though I&nbsp;didn't go through every listing but you can if you want).&nbsp; If it was me, I honestly would have spent more time and tried more sites but I didn't have any more time to dedicate to this one question and I did do a fairly thorough search.</p>
<p>Microsoft does not offer a product that does this - freeware or otherwise (I checked there as wel).&nbsp; I'm not sure I agree that 99% of the corruption is due to Microsoft bugs (a lot is due to already corrupt hard drives or ordinary file corruption that isn't
 a bug or the fact that the files are so big), but I do think that it would be convenient if Microsoft did release such a tool (even if they made people pay a nominal fee for it).&nbsp; If you're looking&nbsp;for a better answer than bkf files, then try Acronis True

 image backup (while only some versions of Vista offer that feature), and restores individual files from the image without a lot of effort (as is needed with Vista).&nbsp; I also hear a lot fewer problems.&nbsp; It isn't free ($30 last I checked) and has options like
 offsite storage which cost more, but many people say it is well worth the price.&nbsp; I've been considering it for a while now but the fact that I've had no troubles with Vista backup and it's free has held me back.&nbsp; This software will not restore a Vista backup
 and will not repair a bkf file (it doesn't use bkf files) - so it doesn't solve that problem but it may remove the problem so a bkf repair tool isn't required.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I can't give you the answer you're seeking, but it does not seem to be available - or if it is, it is much too difficult to find.&nbsp; I suppose they realize that people with corrupt bkf files are in danger or losing their data and so are willing to
 pay to recover it (since even the prices I saw are cheap compared to going to a data recovery technician).&nbsp; I can understand their thinking and I have to say that I agree with them.</p>
<p>I hope you find what you're looking for.&nbsp; If you do, please post the link back here so others can benefit from the information.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Tripeaks achievements won&#39;t unlock in Solitaire Collection</h2>
                    <p>My statistics show that I've cleared dozens of boards, but the corresponding TriPeaks achievements won't unlock.&nbsp; The achievements page shows no progress against these.&nbsp; Sync'ing is working fine, as my stats are correct on phone and various PCs.&nbsp; But playing the game on any of these devices doesn't make progress against the achievements.</p>

Because of that, I tested this out on both my personal account and this account. I'm definitely&nbsp;seeing what you're seeing.</p><p><br /></p><p>However, it's not just with TriPeaks.

Screenshots of your achievements section in game, and your Statistics showing you have won enough games to get the counters going, and&nbsp;a DxDiag from your PC.

<h2>            Canon printer won&#39;t print black text</h2>
                    I have a canon printer MP560, and suddenly it will only print the colour sections of anything I send to the printer, not the black print. I have run a deep clean of the black inkjet cartridges, but it hasn't changed. What else can I do?

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If this is not a driver issue then there is a setting, ink, or other&nbsp;hardware problem
<br />
and you will need to contact Canon.<br />
<br />
As OEM Canon is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with Canon Support, their on-line documentation, and <br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

            There are several programs available to convert Word documents to PDF documents.&nbsp; The following are&nbsp;free&nbsp;online methods that sends the converted document to your email address:
<a href="http://expresspdf.com/ConvertWordToPdf.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://expresspdf.com/ConvertWordToPdf.aspx</a>&nbsp;and
<a href="http://www.freepdfconvert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freepdfconvert.com/</a>.&nbsp; This is what I would do if the need was rare.<br />
<br />
Here's how to do it directly from Microsoft Word with the help of an add-in: <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/msoffice/?p=367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/msoffice/?p=367</a>.&nbsp; This is what I would do if you need to do it more frequently.<br />
<br />
Here's another way to convert Microsoft Word documents to PDF documents for free with special downloaded software:
<a href="http://technicallyeasy.net/2009/09/convert-word-document-to-pdf-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technicallyeasy.net/2009/09/convert-word-document-to-pdf-free/</a>.&nbsp; This is another way to do it if you want to have the capability within Word itself with an add-in.<br />
<br />
Here's a program that does the conversion for free (but it is a separate program).&nbsp; CutePDF:
<a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.cutepdf.com/</span></a>.<br />
<br />
Of course, the classic way to do it is to purchase Adobe Acrobat which is the program that converts Word documents to PDF documents (but it does cost money).&nbsp; There are some programs that do most of what you need to have done for much cheaper.&nbsp;

http://www.docudesk.com/deskPDF_PDF_writer_lp6.shtml?utm_source=msn&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=convert%20pdf</a>.&nbsp; This program also allows you to create PDF documents from scratch without first needing to make the documents in Microsoft Word or OpenOffice Write.<br />
<br />
There are many programs that convert Word documents to PDF documents that are shareware and are available at
<a href="http://www.tucows.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.tucows.com</a> or <a href="http://www.download.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.download.com</a>.&nbsp; Some come with free trials (either a period of time or a number of conversions).<br />
<br />
Microsoft Ofice does not come with a program to convert Word documents to PDF documents - you need an add-in or another program (like those mentioned above).<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps.

<h2>            Locked out of Notebook - Unable to gain access into computer</h2>
                    <p>This is my 87 year old father's new notebook we bought him recently as his 10 year old HP died. Windows 10 is installed on the computer. Although I customized his home screen with only the icons he needed, i.e., his bank, stock brokerage, etc., but he has
 now gotten brave and is venturing out and changing things. The first thing was the appearance of his screen and different colors of font, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest thing is after I was at his home last Monday evening is that he is completely locked out of the computer. The only thing that happens when you turn on the notebook is an icon that looks like the one for "Accounts". Underneath that is his name
 "Al Mayes" and a box for him to enter his password. I've tried entering his password using his wireless keyboard as well as the keyboard on the notebook and neither will let me in. Can you please help me?</p>

            Hi Doral.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this the latest Fall Creators Update Version 1709 which has the ability to reset the password from a link below the password box?  If so I'd pursue that first.
<br />
<br />Otherwise see the various troubleshooting steps here:   <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using whatever method given here that works:  <a href="http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enable-built-in-administrator-account-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enab...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options for Command Prompt.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Error connecting to wifi, yeah, but Windows 8, can you please be a bit more specific&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try to connect to some wifi network, I get a prompt for a user name and password in the charm bar. I enter my credentials and I get a message saying that "an error has occured". Yeah thanks, but
<i>which</i>&nbsp;error&nbsp;exactly? Care to tell me a bit more so I get a chance to fix it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As it turns out, I got some help on the error from...my iPhone. When I tried to connect it to the AP it signaled an error too. Thank god it was a bit more explicit: it said that there was a problem with the certificate and offered to ignore it and go ahead.
 Which I allowed and now my iPhone is happily connected to that wifi but my Windows 8 tablet is not.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone help me fix this? And more generally, tell me how/if I can get a more precise description of the error?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>J-L</div>

            Do you mean, while the user and password text boxes are displayed in the side bar, switch to a browser? I tried that, to no avail. I don't think that there my computer is connected to the wifi at that point yet.

    <title>My CPU Usage is at 100&#37;. What should I do&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyberdizzy  say:</h3>
<h2>            My CPU Usage is at 100&#37;. What should I do&#63;</h2>
                    I have <strong>Windows Xp Professional SP3</strong>, Last week my computer had a loop in it, that I wasnt quite sure how to fix, and if it wasn't a loop it was a BSOD.&nbsp; I reformatted, my HD and did a clean Install of Windows. Everything worked fine, and
 all of my drivers were installed, and I was able to use the internet. I had downloaded Microsoft Essentials so I could scan the computer and everything was still fine but then Microsoft downloaded "111 updates".&nbsp; After a few hours, my computer rebooted by
 itself, and&nbsp;since then has been stuck in a loop, the only way I can use the computer at all, is to disable caching in my Bios, and I can go into Regular Mode, or Safe mode. But in Both modes, my CPU Usage is at 100% even when there is nothing running. I have
 no USB's plugged in at this time. So I'm not quite sure what is causing the problem. I've looked online and have tried different things and as of yet nothing has worked. I'm not currently aloud to use my Wireless Internet "USB" adapter, due to the fact that
 it slows the computer down so much that its constant freeze, and can only move the mouse every few seconds.&nbsp; I would really like to solve this without reinstalling Windows all over again.

<p><span>a.Right-click

<p><span>c.Under

<h2>            Any games similar to Left 4 Dead&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I got hooked on L4D when it came out but now I'm getting a little burned out. It seems like most of the good players have all moved on. I tried L4D2 but I don't like it as much as the original.</p>
<p>Are there any games that are similar to L4D as far as the controls and strategy go? I like it because there's not much to it, you don't have to invest 90 hours to learn your way around, and you don't have a million controls to keep track of. Choose your
 weapon, shoot, protect your team. That's it.</p>
<p>I also liked the Walking Dead games but they were a little too easy. Thanks!</p>

<p>Payday 2 is your best bet. It's &nbsp;4 player co-op similar to both L4D games. It's a little more complex in that you level up, there's a skill tree to manage and you can choose a loadout before each mission but it's in the same co-op spirit of the L4D games
 in that you NEED each other to survive. You're presented with a scenario (rob a bank, jewelry heist) and you must work together to meet the stated objective and get to the getaway vehicle. It's similar to L4D in that lone wolves die and teamwork is key to
 success. You can go in guns blazing or you can work as a team to get in/get out with out ever sounding an alarm by hogtying bank employees and crown control. Very underrated game and an insane amount of fun with friends who all share the same goal.</p>

<p>Left dead 2 &nbsp; :) &nbsp; it's a similar game...... &nbsp; I don't quite follow the logic though...... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Getting some of the achievements in that game can take quite a while...... &nbsp;like a few hundred hours invested to get 54 thousand kills for example....</p>
<p>Max Payne 3 comes to mind if you want similar grinds that don't take much time.......... :) &nbsp; The same stratagey will work with most games anyway.</p>

<p>I don't see how Dead Island is in any way similar to L4D. Sure, they both have zombies, but that's where the similarities end. One is a 4 player teamwork based co-op shooter. The other is a melee combat, open world, mission based, action RPG. 2 completely
 different beasts. I think the OP was looking for games that have the same structure/strategy. I forgot about Evolved, MOSHED. That game looks sweet and will probably be right in the OP's wheelhouse.</p>

<p>Yea Dead Island is totally different than Left 4 Dead.</p>
<p>Scourge Outbreak, RIPD the game, God Mode </p>
<p>(all cheap arcade games that are great fun if you have a buddy that has the game as well)</p>
<p>Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City reminds me of L4D a little bit. &nbsp;Never played it though.</p>

<p>Thanks folks. I did try Dead Island and hated it. I also tried Dead Rising and hated that too. I'll look into Borderlands and Evolved. Essentially my issue is that most of the time I have maybe an hour or two to play Xbox and so I want a game that I can
 play alone until I learn it and then play online without needing 4 hours to get through a game. I like how simple L4D is too. Not just the strategy but the controls. You don't have 1,000 weapons to choose from or modify and you can pretty much just jump into
 any game and play. If L4D didn't have so many idiots playing it I would just keep playing.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Borderlands is closer in similarity to Dead Island as far as co-op, but nothing like L4D. Sounds like Payday is your answer. I didn't know Payday was like that. I might check it out now.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
- Are you getting any error message when you open it?<br />
- Is the computer connected to internet correctly?<br />
<br />
You need internet connection to play this game online. So, we first need to check If the internet is working fine.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>In Windows 7, I would suggest you to disable and then enable the game internet spades on expanding games – internet games feature from the Windows on or off features option and check if this resolves the issue. You will have to disable
 the feature then click ok. Now open the game check. <br />
Again you may enable the game (internet spades) and check if you face the same issue.
<div><br />
Refer the below link to view the window for disabling and enabling games -<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: You may perform a SFC (System File Checker) scan. It will list any issues and will also recover any files if needed. Follow the below steps to perform a SFC Scan.</div>
<div>1) Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow<br />
2) Type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
sfc /scannow <br />
A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time<br />
3) If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue<br />
4) If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"
<br />
5) After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.<br />
<br />
Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -<br />

<h2>            Dead Space 2 Hard Core &#8220;Hard to the Core&#8221; Achievement Guide Walk-through &#38;quot&#59;Spoilers&#38;quot&#59; Repost-</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Welcome to the Dead Space 2 Hard Core “Hard to the Core” Achievement Guide Walk-through</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Guide will help show the basic principles and some advanced techniques for those who are experienced in Dead Space 2 but seem to need a little help or request help with finishing a play-through while on Hard Core Difficulty Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Terms of Hard Core</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to play Hard Core Difficulty you must complete the Game on any Difficulty Setting prior.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Hard Core <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">cannot</span> be used with a Play-through+ Game or any previous or prior Game Save from any other Difficulty.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>It must be started from the very beginning of a “New” Game Hard Core Difficulty and the Settings cannot be changed at any time once started.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>There are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">No Check Points</span> while on Hard Core (but there is a work around for a “Check Point” while the Game is played on the Xbox 360- Discussed further down).</p>
</li><li>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Only 3 Saves Total</span> can be used throughout the entire Game
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The Saves can be made at <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
any</span> Save Station normally found in the Game but are at your decision “where”.</p>
</li><li>
<p>DLC (any Pack) can be used but is not required.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Pre-Order DLC can be used but is not required.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Disc 2 “Check Point”</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When playing on Hard Core any death will either send you back to the Title Screen and yes the Introduction Scene or back to your Save Files (if any on Hard Core at that time).
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">There is no Check Point System while playing Hard Core</span>, that is with one exception. Once you play through from Disc 1 and the Game ask for Disc 2,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">if</span> from that point you die it will revert to the beginning of Disc 2 by simply pressing the A Button for Load a Game Save.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Take note though</span>- there is an exception to this “exception”. If you either die and use the B Button to back out from the Load Screen (Load a Hard Core Game Save) or go to the Dashboard or turn off the Xbox 360
 at any time without creating a Save File first, it will loose and revert the “free” Disc 2 Check Point back to Disc 1 or your nearest Save File, if any.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Recommended DLC</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Martial Law Pack- For the use of a Force Gun much earlier in the Game than normally obtained and with increased damage and additional firing rate.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Super Nova Pack- For use with the Forged Engineer Suit with 15% Health Bonus from Health and additional Inventory Slots.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Feel free to always use more Weapons/ Suits (RIG) from any DLC Pack as they come free from the Store.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Once again though, DLC is not required in any way to complete Hard Core</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Weapons of Choice</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First and foremost, Weapons of choice are and can be always a personal preference to which you feel most comfortable using. The recommended Weapons that many Players have found to be excellent tools in completing a Hard Core play-through would be the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plasma Cutter- General all purpose Weapon for both ranged and close attacks.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Force Gun- Excellent Weapon for “clearing out” large groups of enemies in a tight situation or enemies of “lower” Health such as the Pack (screaming kids).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Detonator Mines- Excellent for laying traps and dispensing of the fast or difficult enemies such as the Stalkers and Leapers. Also great for “Pre-Ambush” events if placed ahead of time before triggering the event. In addition, DT
 Mines are powerful right out of the Store even with no Node Upgrade and can be used as Zero G Grenades on enemies such as the Nest (big “pillows” in space) or Guardians ("fat" things stuck to the walls).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Contact Beam- Very strong against one enemy with the Primary Fire and the Alternate Fire is excellent for knocking large “crowds” away from you.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now from this point it is recommended to pick two Weapons you are most comfortable with and primarily only use and carry them. Two Weapons only will make Ammo Count and management a lot easier given a limited Inventory System. If you ever need a Weapon that
 is suited for a specific enemy and you own it, you can always leave it at the Safe until needed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Health and Inventory</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always bring more then enough Ammo that you think you will need to get from one specific area to the next Store. Always bring enough Health that you are in the “Blue-Green” Health at all times (or better). One hit from many enemies will kill if you get to
 a Yellow Health Level. Don't be afraid of “using” and buying Items/ Ammo/ Health. It's only one Play-through. For the most part, your Credits should be going towards Ammo and Health (preferably Ammo by not getting hit).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A “good” idea of Ammo and Health for later in the Game would be 75+ of whatever Rounds you use most often, 50+ Rounds of a Secondary Weapon and 5+ Health of any given size. If you are forced into any situation that requires you to drop something, always
 first Ammo or Schematics you don't plan on getting the Weapon for anyways. If you need to make even just one free Inventory space and you're not at full Health, try using a Small Health Pack to make available space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Nodes and Upgrade</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nodes should be purchased very sparingly as the Game gives out enough (if all free ones are collected) that you will be able to get your RIG, Stasis and One Primary Weapon (along with a good portion of your secondary Weapon) fully Upgraded by the later Chapters
 in the game. If you find yourself with a “good” supply of both Ammo and Health (75-100+ Ammo and 5 or more Health for a given Size), only then purchase Nodes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the beginning, work on both your RIG (Health only, don't waste Nodes on Air as there is plenty of O2 Supplies throughout any “No Environment Zone”) and your Stasis (both Energy and Duration). Start with Weapon Damage and Capacity as soon as you can after
 Health/ Stasis are up to an “acceptable level” or what you feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Suits RIG</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're using a DLC Suit simply keep it until you get the Advanced Suit. If you're playing without DLC keep just the basic Engineer Suite until you can purchase the Advanced Suit. It's Item Management can be difficult but just make more return trips to
 Stores (where applicable). It's not impossible but definitely more time consuming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stasis and Kenesis</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Stasis and Kenesis will be your greatest assets while playing on Hard Core. Don't be afraid or forgetful of not using either or both. Unlike Dead Space, Dead Space 2 has a Recharge Rate for Stasis, even with liberal use you should always have a full
 charge after waiting somewhere safe for a few moments. Use TK (Kenesis) Impalement whenever possible to save as much Ammo as possible. It's better to use Kensis and have Ammo than to have no Ammo and be forced into only using Kenesis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Get Peng</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peng along with the additional Items are very "worth it" on a Hard Core Play-through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Play-Through</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Play-through is best to be attempted after going through at least once and knowing where you can, will or might get into trouble. Go through (if necessary) one more time on Casual just to make sure you don't forget anything (Nodes, Enemies, Locations, Semiconductors
 and such). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of the Play-through will be to get to Disc 2 without using any Save Files prior on Disc 1. By no means is this mandatory but a recommended path of where you might want to put your Save Files.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Save 1- Chapter/s 7, 8 or 9. Any of these are approximately 1 to 2 hours into Disc 2 (depending on Players Skill and speed of which you play). There are many hazardous areas in each of these Chapters and it would be a good place
 for a 1<sup>st</sup> Save. Whether you Save before or after the “Solar Array” or any other point up ahead is up to you and where you feel comfortable with.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Save 2- If you believe you can make it past the “drill ride” Chapter 12 or before is up to you but is generally a “good” spot for your 2<sup>nd</sup> Save.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Save 3- “Stick a needle in your eye”, Chapter 14, one of the most common places for ala “insta-death”. If you believe you can finish it with no problem Save afterward. Either way, it's “short” trip to the end of the Dead Space 2 and finishing Hard Core.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Final Run</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After your last Save and dealing with the aka Uber-Morph, it's simply a matter of being fast and saving as much Ammo as possible. All of those Stasis Packs you've been collecting (but hopefully not selling all off) will come in handy for the “last run”.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Nicole</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nicole is subjective at best. While some find her very easy to defeat even on Hard Core others find her extremely annoying. If you have problems with Nicole it is recommended either Stasis and shoot (just) her as quickly as possible with a Plasma Cutter
 (Fully Upgraded) or the Contact Beam (if owned in the Inventory). Don't even worry about or concentrate on the Pack. You should have brought at least 5+ (Mediums and or Large) Health prior to fighting Nicole and just use Health as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said, there is really no one cut way of completing Hard Core. It's a matter of Player Skill, luck and willingness to try something more than once. Never forget the “basics”, smash dead enemies, use Stasis or Kensis on objects that are required
 or to bring Items to you. Search and take your time, it's really only Disc 1 you need to be extremely careful in, after that it's all down hill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh and enjoy the Hand Cannon and the Achievement afterwards. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The way I see it people might as well throw in their two cents. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tips: &nbsp;Unplug your ether cable to eliminate unnecessary distractions from popping up on your screen. &nbsp;Close your door, turn off other devices that make noise, and duct tape people's mouths who may try to talk to you. &nbsp;Turn off the lights to increase focus
 on the game. &nbsp;Turn your volume way up so you can hear enemies easier. &nbsp;Allow 3-4 hours every time you play so you don't save when you don't need/want to. &nbsp;Make sure you save a save for just before the eye needle. &nbsp;It's too easy to die there and it's all chaos
 from beyond that point.</p>

<p>It's not that bad dude, you can get through the first disc easily, atleast make it to Ch. 5 and save to take the edge off, then you have the free save at disc change. I saved at 5, 8 and 11. I didn't want to use my 1st save that early but I had to go to
 work (I timed it bad lol) but anyways it's really not so bad and you can also get a DLC pack to give you a bit more of an edge. Martial Law Pack is nice, I think it's the one that comes with the Force Gun and that's really handy. Then you can get your special
 prize at the end and if you haven't yet, take that and run through Zealot and have a blast.</p>

<br />Type Sound in Windows Start Seach box &gt; Click Sound &gt; Under Playback tab, right click on an empty space and select, Show disconnected devices and Show disabled devices &gt; Select Speaker and click on Properties and make sure that it is is enabled &gt; You may also check if the Speaker that you are using is set as default.
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Hi Hann.  II'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You said you are trying to create bootable Windows 10 media.  Is this correct?  
<br />
<br />To do this you would install the Media Creation tool from this download page:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  following the instructions in the middle of the page which you can read by clicking the + sign to expand the information that pertains to your desired media.
<br />
<br />This is a process where it first downloads the ISO, then writes it to the flash stick or burns to DVD, until the media is reported ready.  
<br />
<br />At that time you will have bootable media to use to do repairs or installing Windows.  
<br />
<br />Everything else possible to get WIndows 10 to start is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To Clean Install follow these illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br /> To boot media:  
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose Repair Your Computer to access the repairs in link above, or if following the Clean Install click Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>That's strange. Maybe it is installing updates. Game to "my games and apps" and pause the download. Next power cycle your console by holding the power button in for a full 10 seconds to turn it off. Once off wait 30 seconds and turn it back on.</p>

<p>You may have to reinstall it from the beginning as there may have been an error while downloading it. If you bought the game digitally, go to the game and app section, push start on ryse and manage game. Erase any save files or any content on their and than
 uninstall the game. Now for the hard part, &nbsp;redownload it and see if that did the trick</p>
