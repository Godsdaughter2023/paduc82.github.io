<p>This has happened to my previous installation of Windows 10 and it is happening again. I am still not entirely certain of the cause, but according to what I remember, I used "Your Uninstaller" to uninstall Malwarebytes and Avast antivirus. After I uninstalled
 my Avast and restarted my computer the system tray displayed either bugged icons and some application icons are missing from the tray (it seems the expansion box of the system tray is also defected. The box appears deformed and too low, causing some of the
 apps to be invisible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't affect any functions severely, however, I would appreciate it if the accessibility is functional and not distracting. I had forgotten to create restore points so I couldn't turn back, if there are any solutions I would love to hear them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best.</p>

            Hi Krit.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what Your Uninstaller is but I'd see if I can System Restore to before you ran it if it caused this.  Then uninstall the Avast bloatware and Malwarebytes normally in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  You can then run the Avast Clear tool to get all of it's bloat out:  <a href="http://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility</a>
<br />
<br />If also needed you can re-register the Start Menu to see if it also reforms the Task Bar:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-menu-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-men...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<h2>            Xbox shuts off when I connect to the Internet. </h2>
                    I can sign into my profile when I am offline but when I try to sign in online or try to connect to the Internet while I am logged in, my xbox freezes and shuts down 100% of the time. I think this is a result of the new update released on 11-12-15 for the
 Xbox one dashboard. Any assistance would be great!

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>Are you's able to test using an ethernet cable to connect your console directly to your router? This will narrow down where the problem is, however I understand that you may not be able to do this if you don't have an ethernet cable etc.</p>
<p>Also, Halkara, has your console updated to the latest version (NXOE) as well?</p>

<h2>            Why gamers are destroying the industry-My final thoughts on Xbox One and the future</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">" NOW HOLD ON. TIME OUT....TIIIIME OUT!!!! Y'ALL TAKE A CHILL! YA NEED TO CUT THIS *** OUT! AND THATS THE DOUBLE TRUTH RUTH!"&nbsp; -Samuel Jackson, "Do The Right Thing"</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; Oh fellow gamers, this would have been a lengthy post, but of course, I forgot to save. So I will do my abridged version. We have taken gaming for granted in every aspect of its meaning.
 DRM has been brought apon us fro several reasons. 1. Gaming production costs have gotten bigger as well as the actors who were hired...not volunteered... but paid, to participate in an industry that is starting to blur the lines between Hollywood's "Industrial
 Light and Magic", and the video gaming industry.&nbsp; So, just like the music industry, game companies are starting to make a stand against losses that would hinder or reduce the capitol to make the next fantastic game that every gamer craves.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; Hence the DRM, Used Game, Borrowing/lending fiasco. Until all... AND I MEAN ALL... torrent sites are shut down, they are taking their own measures to prevent them from going bankrupt, or
 going safe (sequel, prequel, reboot, remake). Risk/reward is a harder gamble because they don't have the same backing as the Hollywood studios.&nbsp; I am sure you all know this, because we are smart, but shallow (I am sometimes...hate to admit it).</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; I remember when it was&nbsp;simpler. Games were games. Atari, Nintendo, Sega, TurboGraphix 16, and even Intelevision and Coleco Vision (oh Mattel, you awesome slick bastards...). But games became
 more complex with the likes of Sony and Microsoft entering. But lets go through a realization... It was all about the games.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; Until Sony PlayStation 2. DVD player. Cheaper alternative.&nbsp; You wanna know why I dislike Sony... Dreamcast.&nbsp; The death of Sega Dreamcast should have NEVER happened. Dreamcast was about
 the gamers and the games.&nbsp; And the passion for games.&nbsp; PS2 was gimmicks and DVD. Not games, just proving points that they are able to topple Sega, cripple Nintendo (and ALMOST succeeding), and dominating the market.&nbsp; But then came the Dark Horse....</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; Microsoft Xbox. Sony called it "Dreamcast 2" (Or was that XB360?) and&nbsp;said that they were no competition. But with the former Sega console developers, and PR Manager, Peter Moore they were
 able get ALOT behind it. First to have internal HDD. First to incorporate system cache for games to run better and faster. First to had broadband as STANDARD (a risk, but greatly rewarded). First to allow personal music in select games from your own downloaded
 selection. First to create a gaming network via LAN. And first to create a online gaming community called XBOX LIVE (in loving memory of Sega DC *moment of silence*..... SEGA!!!!!!!!)</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; I had a lot of arguments dealing with the policies about Xbox One- but they were erased. So I decided to put scenarios and bullet points with logic:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">- Always (mostly) on: Unless you don't have a PC, a tablet, or a Wi-Fi setup, why should this concern you? The 60% argument is non-valid, because it includes them.&nbsp; And if you are referring
 to trips abroad, I am sure by now there are at least 3 out of every five hotels that have free Wi-Fi.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">- Why am I forced to use Kinect?: Unless someone puts a gun to your head and tells you to say "Fus Roh Dah" in Skyrim, I don't think you are "forced" to use it. Required to have it&nbsp;but not
 obligated to use it, sounds better. These options, I have been told, can be manipulated to your own advantage. In plain English, make the Kinect your own. All it wants you to say is "Xbox on" and "Xbox off". Simple. Even that is optional. OPTIONAL.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">- Used games/lending/borrowing:&nbsp; Lets be clear. If movies are digital, and can't be resold (I don't even know anybody who does anymore), why are games different? This is a long topic so I
 will break it into parts:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; 1. Physical copies of games are digital in your system. YOU have the right to transfer to your best friend via family party. 10 family/friends. If he is not your friend anymore, take him
 of your list. Games can be erased from the main console (the proprietary owner of the game) thus the games on the family plan will become hour long demos for the others (in theory). But you have ultimate control.&nbsp; Sell your game, or give your game away...lose
 your rights. You have full rights, as long as you keep the game. The games being digital, should work just like the XBLA titles on the (now defunct) Family Plan. Two consoles, same game, play simultaneously, one time purchase. Yeah, it works....</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; 2. I am sure that Childrens Hospitals that have game rooms will have more than one monitor. But wait, little Johnny and little Sarah wanna play Forza 5! Oh...wait. 10 Family/System plan.
 One game, multiple consoles. Does it save money? Oh hell yes. And since I have my son upstairs who bug me to borrow game, after game, after game. He can just go into my system cloud under my "plan" an play whatever the hell he wants. Sound good to me.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;3. Military (God Bless you! And thank you for serving our country and fighting for our freedoms!):&nbsp; I know that this is making you despise the console. But I am so sure that Microsoft might
 make an exception for you guys overseas. Stay tuned...</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">- TV, TV, Sports, Sports: I love options. Sony gave us the option to watch DVD on PS2 (BluRay on PS3). McDonalds gave us a Dollar Menu "option". Verizon Networks give you Sport package "options".
 I love the option. I don't have to use it, but I have the option if I wanna change my mind.&nbsp; Why do I want to have TV through my console? Because I would rather do that then buy a $1300 Smart TV&nbsp; to replace my perfectly perfect 52" HDTV. And to have a cable
 "pass through", control is centered. No grabbing X remote to change the HDMI settings&nbsp;from 1 to 2 just so I can&nbsp;play games, and then from 2 to 3 just to watch BluRay movies. One stop entertainment intergraded&nbsp;seamlessly (starting to sound like a PR...moving
 along). But now there is Skype (I use that ALOT) and dynamic screens. Jump in and out of games without having to restart. Snapping things into what you are doing and/or watching. On and on, and on.
</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Do I have to get into gaming history? No, you guys already know.&nbsp;But the truth is this. Embrace change. Gaming can't remain stagnant. If Hollywood wants a piece, that should tell you that
 gaming is getting bigger than we could ever imagine. Once was a fad, a hobby. Now is mainstream, and soon to be standard. Peace, love, gaming...</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; It's All About The Games...</span></strong></span></p>

<p>....and it's also about the people who play them. I'm all for innovation, but good innovation, good change. Not BS sugar coated as change so we'll calm down and accept it. I agree, some of the console functions I can live with, may not lie it, but I can
 live with it, but they're&nbsp;turning&nbsp;the industry inside out ,and not just for the consumer but for all others involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retailers involved are now going to have to possibly buy more equipment to unregister games, and hire people to use the stuff. Small independent stores/businesses are more than likely going to have to stop selling games because they wont be a part of Microsoft's
 system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People that defend this movement keep saying that used games hurt the industry...i'm not sure if we were all watching the same reveal but I'm pretty sure he said it was a 65 billion dollar industry, and being able to buy used games and borrow them have been
 around since you could take a cartage in a console, the formula is simple Great game=Great revenue(not counting DLC) Poor game=Poor revenue, but most pubs wanna staple a giant *** budget on a game and when it's crap it gets traded in or they let their buddy
 play it and decide for their selves and they lose cash, that's a pub/dev problem not a consumer hurting the market problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for borrowing games, I can run down my list of games and pic out exactly which one's I've borrowed from friends, some I've bought after I played others I didn't, some I bought the sequel for, others I played the first, borrowed the sequel. Letting people
 borrow games freely is a good way to get your IP out there, for better or worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all how I stand on things, innovation shouldn't ever overlap simplicity and definitely never make things more complicated, change is good, but only if change makes things better for at least a majority of the targeted audience and as it stands, the
 X1, and the supposed "future of gaming" only makes things better for a select few. Unity, harmony, gaming.</p>

<p>Oh, budget. How much did it take to make Last of Us? How about Beyond: Two Souls? It ain't cheap. And it's because of gamers similar to you and your way of thinking which lead to half of the fallout of smaller developers. Ok, lets get into tech. The studios
 that use motion capturing is not cheap. And the actors/actresses are getting paid, too.</p>
<p>Do you want games to stay the way they are? And cookie-cut games until we get hungry for larger games, that last longer, and have more replay value? If not, your point would be valid. &nbsp;The passion for gaming and new paths are not in any gamers DNA anymore.</p>
<p>If you don't like it...make your own games/game system. Put everything you want inside of it, games you want to play, and you will always be satisfied. &nbsp;Just game in your world, let me game in mind. &nbsp;It just seems that everyone want to prove the world is
 flat, just so they can sleep better at night. Sweet dreams. Because your killing everyone elses.</p>

<p>All good points, what's worse is so called gamers have been ruining gaming since the beginning of this gen. Microsoft owned the beginning of this generation, it was ALL about games, good games, and all they got from so called hardcore gamers was complaints
 that MS was throwing around too much money and buying exclusives. People actually complained MS didn't have enough kiddy games like PS3, the 360 was "too hardcore focused" we were told by these same folks who are now complaining that Xbone has more features
 than just playing games. </p>
<p>The reality is the Xbox is now the market leader, Sony is the follower, Wii is almost irrelevant. These changes are coming to the entire industry, Xbox/MS is just the first to admit it. These are the needs of the publishers being met, and MS is doing everything
 they can to take some of the sting out of these changes, its obvious since this is all taking so long to be finalized. If it were up to publishers and devs folks, this would be even worse im guessing. And if Sony was still running things on the hardware front,
 we would just be getting lied to. At least MS is being open and honest as they can with the info they have so far. Open your eyes people, this was going to happen at some point, do you really think in 2019 we would still be buying disks and putting them in
 machines to play games, EVERYTHING is going fully digital, why would games be any different, why should game makers be the only ones not being paid for their work ?

<p>LOL WHAT!?</p>

<p>@ xero </p>
<p>Games like the last of us are expensive to produce, but guess what? It will sell millions, you know why, because its a great game. Most publishers want to half *** a game and expect to make millions. If a dev isn't up for it, release a smaller game for a
 lower price.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>@ aprentis </p>
<p>You do realize that the 360 was killing it in the beginning BECAUSE of core games. Hell, its the reason I bought the damn system.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And the reason the PS3 caught up in sales was because they realized this. They focused on core games in the second half while microsoft tried to take a bite of the wii cake with the Kinect. Losing focus on what built the 360 to begin with.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So much for the wii being irrelevant. Even Sony tried a go at it. Heard of the ps move?</p>

<p>Most likely you have bought games with DRM attached. &nbsp;Do you buy many steam or PC games? &nbsp;How about arcade/downloadable titles on the Xbox 360 or PS3? &nbsp;How about smartphone apps/games?</p>
<p>All of those are single use, with no ability to sell/trade them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Really the digital drm coming to next gen consoles is just the game industry unifying itself. &nbsp;As long as we can still buy used games (which we can with next gen) I don't really have a problem with it.</p>
<p>And about the online connection. &nbsp;I can't think of a single point in the past 4+ years where I've been without internet for longer than 24 hours. &nbsp;I also have NEVER taken my Xbox 360 to a place where there wasn't an internet connection available. &nbsp;People
 keep bringing that up, but it's like the rarest of rare things and it's not prudent for Microsoft to cater to the least common denominator, doing so would be a hindrance and not help bring the future of gaming to our livingrooms.</p>

<p>Save the "why am I paying extra" comment until after we see the price of the consoles. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the same topic, just about everything in life we buy we don't fully utilize, technically making those unused features a waste of our money. &nbsp;Even games themselves, you might buy a game that has a bunch of bonus stuff in it. &nbsp;A simple example being leaderboards.
 &nbsp;I don't care about leaderboards in games, but I don't complain "why am I paying extra for leaderboards" when I don't use them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>for example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I &nbsp;remove my T-Mobile Sim card and get a new Sim card from the country I'm visiting ( not in north america. Ex: France ) Will Skype number still work and people in the US can text me and call me as a regular call or text and I could call people in the
 US regularly ?</p>
<p>four instance my bank sends me a confirmation txt that i need to reply to. Will I be able to do that?.</p>

<p>The box is titled "ACCESS DENIED" with a red cross.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Graham,
<br />
<br />Is that the empty 2TB drive (Disk 1)?
<br />
<br />If so, it has no Drive letter assigned, right click the partition on that drive and choose 'Change Drive Letter and paths' and assign a drive letter
<br />
<br />You also seem to have another disk (Disk 2) with no drive letter under that, you need to assign a drive letter to that . . .

    <title>Adobe Creative and Web Design Suite CS6 on Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sd173  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adobe Creative and Web Design Suite CS6 on Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro with 128 GBs. I noticed right after I finished installing a trial of Adobe Creative and Web Design Suite CS6 on my Surface that my battery decreased by 2 hours. Before I installed the trial, I had around 6 hours of battery life with
 normal usage (Office 365, games, news, etc.) after changing some settings in the control panel. Is it possible for me to get my battery life back to 6 hours by changing the settings again, and if so, what should I change? Also, I know that the decreased battery
 has to do with the trial. It comes with: Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Flash, Fireworks, InDesign, Illustrator, Bridge, Media Encoder, LiveCycle Designer ES2, and some other things which I am pretty sure are plugins. I use Photoshop the most, occasionally
 Dreamweaver and Flash, and barely Fireworks. If I installed just these four programs after&nbsp;I uninstalled the trial, will my battery life still be limited to four hours, or will it be higher? If it will not change it much,&nbsp;how will it be if I just have Photoshop
 and Dreamweaver?</p>

            There is a known issue with CS6 components (Dreamweaver) using excessive cpu (thus the battery drain)&nbsp;when open and idle on some computer setups/configurations and may be graphic card related. Go to Adobe Forum and have a look-see.&nbsp;http://forums.adobe.com/message/4390761
<div><br />
<div>Use Task Manager to see which programs are using excessive CPU when they are open and idle. A program should not be using for than a percent or 2 and randomly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the off chance you are use the 'crack/patch' for this suite...there's a know issue with it causing Photoshop or Dreamweaver to run at 13% per cpu core pair at idle... thus the drain.</div>

 for a boyfriend. &nbsp;This is a gamer's forum. &nbsp;Did anyone stop to think that just maybe he's looking for buds with like interests? &nbsp;Get past the label and look at the person. &nbsp;Oh yeah and before I forget - ADD ME!! &nbsp;:oP</p>

    <title>Ethernet Port Disconnects Randomly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghost slayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ethernet Port Disconnects Randomly</h2>
                    So I have just installed Windows 10 on my computer and ive been having connectivity issues. I can connect to Wi-Fi fine but it cuts my internet speed in half according to Speedtest.net its only when I plug the ethernet cable into my router I get my max
 speed. When I plug in my ethernet cable it detects it and after a while it randomly disconnects and the only way I can reconnect is by unplugging it from the router and plugging it back in. I its not my ethernet port because when I had Windows 7 before I upgraded
 to 10 I had no issues with ethernet port. I checked if maybe my cable was broken which its not because I tested it on my laptop running Windows 7. I also did have a VPN installed but I uninstalled that as well. Im thinking it might be a bug since its a new
 OS. If anyone has tips that would help me with my issue I would greatly appreciate it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Colorservice.exe - System Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I have just upgraded to Version 10.&nbsp; Now after startup, I get the following message. Headed:</p>
<p>ColorService.exe&nbsp; - System Error</p>
<p>
</p><p>and next to the big red X I get the message:</p>
<p>The program can't start because MSVCP100.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something I should worry about?&nbsp; If I click ok and carry on, everything seems to work fine - I cannot find any symptoms from this issue.&nbsp; Did something go wrong with the upgrade, and is anything likely to go wrong in the future if I just ignore this
 matter? If it's not a problem, is there a way I can suppress this message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help, John</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is really a shame that people keep you waiting for this long!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across this post as someone who I am assisting with his computer from time to time has the exact same issue since he has upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway:</p>
<p>Right click the windows logo (the start button) or press windows key + x and from the menu you can select the command prompt using administrator rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if this works for you as I don't have the computer of my acquaintance at my disposal at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudi Hendrix</p>

    <title>ntoskrnl.exe causing blue screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ntoskrnl.exe causing blue screen</h2>
                    <p>ntoskrnl.exe 64 bit is causing my computer to go blue screen. What is the best way to fix this. I am running windows 7 pro, 64 bit with g4gb ram. I have run diagnostic test on my hard drives by Seagate and ran memtest on the ram. Everything on that end is
 okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have all the latest drivers from windows update. The mini dump says the above file is causing the crash. This is a new custom built computer. Can I just insert my windows 7 disk and copy the disk file into the system 64 folder to overwrite? Or do I need
 to do something else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<h2>            Updates were not configured correctly.  Reverting changes.  Do not turn off your computer</h2>
                    <p>I recently had to start my computer from factory start, due to my computer not shutting off.&nbsp; Since then, I've reloaded Norton and my Microsoft Office.&nbsp; I have had to update nightly, at the most 3 at a time.&nbsp; Last night it said I had 103 updates.&nbsp; This morning
 when I turned my laptop on, this is the message I received:&nbsp; (Updates were not configured correctly.&nbsp; Reverting changes.&nbsp; Do not turn off your computer.)&nbsp; It has been turning off and coming back with this message all day.&nbsp;

<p>Should I let it keep going?&nbsp; Is there a way to have the computer start working properly again?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            What does &#34;x 1&#34; mean&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to delelte IMs I received and sent and testing to see if a left click would give me a delete option, I left clicked on one of the IM responses in a conversation.&nbsp; It highlighted the Skype response and above the conversation there appeared a
 highlighted bar with "x 3" at the far left. So I clicked on the highlighted bar and it disappeared. I instantly wondered what I did. Did I send the individual IM response to someone? Did I send it to the person with whom I was conversing? Did I blow up the
 Internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Question: Does anyone know what the "x 3" mean?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(I use Skype on a Chromebook. In submitting this question, I am selecting the "Skype for Android" category. It seemed the closest to Chromebook.)</p>

<p>Hi Navman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When "Error 670" is displayed during the update of your Microsoft Silverlight program, there is a possibility that the file that you used is a corrupted one. In order for us to isolate things out, allow us to know the following details:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to download the correct file from the link given above?</li><li>You also mentioned about trying to uninstall Microsoft Silverlight and failing, what error message did you get?<br />
</li><li>After doing the Windows update, did you also update your PC device drivers? </li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

            Try following -
<br />
<br />1. It may be due to some program. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br />How to boot in Clean boot mode - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />3. Take actions related to Display Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Uninstall the Driver 
<br />Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer &gt; The driver will be installed automatically when you restart
<br />
<br />C. Update the driver
<br />Click Update Driver Software &gt; Click Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Click Let my pick from a list of device drivers on my computer &gt; Choose the driver &gt; Click Next to update &gt; If this does not work, select Search automatically for the updated driver in place of Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />D. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the display adapter's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, you click Update Driver Software, in place of this, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer

<p>1)&nbsp; It still occurs when in clean boot mode with all startup disabled and all services disabled, including all Microsoft services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; No problems detected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp; No display drivers have been updated between this issue and it previously working.&nbsp; However, I did have the system search for drivers and did download and install a found driver this did not solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
The next step I'm going to do if I don't receive valuable troubleshooting help is roll back windows, but I really don't want to do that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It sucks, I have rolled back before 1803 and everything works fine and cannot update because of the issues this causes. Nothing but silence from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does it in both my laptop and desktop which are entirely different, lenovo laptop and custom desktop, different video card manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>
