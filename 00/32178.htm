<h2>            Sage payroll update, Windows 8 and error code 80070002</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to download an update to my sage software, but keep getting the error code above. &nbsp;Everything I've found suggests this is normally an issue for windows updates. &nbsp;Is this the case, or should the other fixes suggested on here work?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Barbara,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How are you trying to download the update for Sage payroll software?</p>
<p>2. Are you downloading it from Internet Explorer from Desktop? Or it from Modern UI Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to contact Sage Support.</p>

            <p>Hi Hitoki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem occurs when you insert your USB drive in any port. It throws a message because it tries to get a drive letter which is already reserved .You can solve this issue by following either of two below given methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong>Insert the USB drive before starting the windows. Make sure that USB drive is not set as the priority boot device. It has been seen sometimes that due to USB, windows hangs a bit during logging on. If it happens with you as well
 then remove your USB immediately and insert again when the Windows starts. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:&nbsp;U</strong>se the Disk Management to change the drive letter and thus will assign a new drive letter so as to avoid overwriting. The steps are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R</strong> to open “<strong>Run</strong>”<br />
Now type “<strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong>” and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will now see the names of all drives. Select your USB drive there.<br />
Right click on the USB drive and click on “<strong>Change Drive Letter and Paths</strong>” and assign a new drive name to your USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now close the setting and check if you are able to use the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know the result, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

Yes, increasing the size and then decreasing it <em>does </em>fix it but it's not really ideal to keep doing this is it? In other words, it's a bug that Microsoft hasn't/can't be bothered to fix.<br />

            I also find this very irritating. But at least when I set it on "use small icons." the toolbar leaves enough of the bottom of my app&nbsp;dialogue box&nbsp;showing so I can click "OK" in it without having to move the damn toolbar. I think part of the problem is
 that when you have a dialogue box open in an app, or this app anyway, the toolbar doesn't respond to mouseovers by minimizing.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Takes a minute to work.<br />
<br />
1)Set AUTOHIDE on.<br />
2)goto taskmanager and kill the explorer.exe (end the process)<br />
3)start new task and type in explorer.exe<br />
4)should return back to normal otherwise set autohide off<br />
5)kill and restart the explorer.exe </p>

            1). Start Taskmanager<br />

3). End/kill explorer.exe<br />

            Well now I have longer experience with the newest driver from Intel&nbsp; HD (and disabling Panel Self Refresh) and I was forced to update back to Microsoft driver (9.3.2017 - 21.20.16.4627) as behaviour was even worse despite the fact that there was no so
 often screen freeze on battery. After some time of using regardless I'm on baterry or not there was a long freeze of screen. I was not able to determine what was the cause of this freeze and blinking. Does anybody faces similar issues with Intel Driver

            If you know what is best for you stay far away from that.&nbsp; Use skype for what it is.&nbsp; Here in the states they provide you with numbers that you keep receiving spam calls and there is no way to contact skype support to help.&nbsp; So find some other service.

<h2>            KB982312 &#38; KB983486. Error&#58; &#34;WindowsUpdate_0000057A_WindowsUpdate_dt000</h2>
                    <p>Windows Update will not install these update automatically... OR manually. I keep getting the same error (above).</p>
<p>I somehow think it has something to do with "Permissions" because I've also been getting a lot of: "Error 1402. Could not open key: UNKNOWN\Components (several long alpha/numeric strings). Verify that you have sufficient access to that key, or contact your
 support personnel."</p>
<p>I have researched this on the net and tried EVERY solution that I could find. At this point, I don't remember everything I've done... but, the list is very long.</p>
<p>Please Help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Oh, I forgot... Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. Preinstalled... so, no Windows 7 installation DVD.</p>
<p>June 17, 2010: Additional Info: I no longer think this error has anything to do with Permissions. I think the problem has something to do with Windows Installer. I am having the same problem with an update for QuickBooks Pro and an HP software update (HP
 SmartMedia Music/Video/Photo Application Update). I have download all these updates and tried to install them manually... no good. About half-way through installation, the two MS Office updates suddently stop and say that the "program has stopped working properly"
 with no trouble-shooting suggestions. I tried a clean boot... no go. I've run every diagnostics test I can think of and/or recommended on the net. I've reinstalled Windows Installer, run ScanNow and CheckDisk. I've cleaned out the registry, temp files, junk
 files, etc... still no good. I've turned-off UAC.</p>
<p>Something else strange: I have no problem installing a new program (and everything else seems to be running tip-top on my computer. This may sound stupid, but it seems as though any update that requires a "license acceptance" fails.</p>
<p>Well, my original post has been here a week now with no support replies (and I see that 5 other people also need help with this problem). I have a post in another place on here. A tech support person answered and suggested some of the aforementioned things
 to do. But, I've not heard back from him in almost a week. I guess Microsoft doesn't really care that much. This is totally unacceptable. Microsoft's slogan... "take their money and run!"</p>

<p>Hi Nikos,</p>
<p>This is what I get during first attempt at installation: <strong>Error 1402.Setup cannot open the registry key UNKNOWN\Components\1FA18F7974E099CD0AF18C3B9B1A1EE8\00002119710000000000000000F01FEC.&nbsp; Verify that you have sufficient access to that key, or contact
 your support personnel. </strong>So, when I get that error message, I open regedit right then, search for the first string and delete the second string. Then I close regedit and try the installation again. It usually works on the second try. Also, it's not
 just Microsoft updates: I had this problem with QuickBooks, LightScribe, SoundSoap, and Adobe Reader updates.</p>
<p>We're both, basically saying the same thing... just slightly different solution methods. What I find odd is that this doesn't happen with every installation or update; some go through the normal installation process and all is fine.</p>
<p>I'm very leery about deleting any instances of the VC++. Everything I've read in various forums, etc. tell you NOT to uninstall any of them. The reason being that each instance is installed with a specific program. So, I don't know.</p>
<p>I certainly appreciate your feedback, Nikos. Regards, Jon</p>
<p>Now that we have narrowed it down to a VC++ conflict, does anyone have a solution... shed any light?? Microsoft??</p>

<p>Hello Minvarin,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your suggestion and also including "damas7's" suggestion, as well. His (I'm assuming "he") answer led me to the right track. His answer is a little muddled and confusing. Also, I am relating my experience only. It turns out that Windows
 Update error code of 57A really has nothing to do with the problem at all. I found this out the hard way, but all is well now... at least as far as the actual updates goes. I'll try to explain it in detail... and this is going to be long-winded. Also, this
 is a new computer for me (about a month) so there was a lot of re-installing going on.</p>
<p><strong>ALWAYS CREATE A RESTORE POINT BEFORE DOING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING.</strong> When trying to repair Office Pro 2007 (with my CD), I got a bunch of Error 1310 (C:\Config.Msi\25f9ee.rbf (example number). Verify that you have access to that directory.)
 This happened about 4 or 5 times; however, each dialog had different numbers. I would click "Retry" and repair process would continue... until I got "Microsoft Office Professional 2007 configuration did not complete successfully". "Error 1402. Setup cannot
 open the registry key: UNKNOWN\Components\(long string of alpha &amp; numeric) \ (another long string of same). Verify that you have sufficient access to that key, or contact your support personnel." Okay, this is where clarification of Damas7's instructions come
 in. (BTW, I'm not really convinced that one would have to do the Office Repair thing before and after. In my case, Office repaired itself after when opening one of the applications). Open Regedit and Find the FIRST long string of alpha/numbers. The SECOND
 long string will appear on the right-hand side of Regedit as subkeys. DELETE the key that contains the SECOND string. Close Regedit and reboot. Try the installation again. Don't get discouraged... you may get a second Error&nbsp;1402 and must do exactly the same
 with Regedit, as explained. After removing the error-indicated key(s), the update installations went fine.</p>
<p>Now... I had several other updates (QuickBooks Pro, LightScribe, SoundSoap and something else; can't remember right now). I used the method I explained in the last paragraph and everyone of the updates installed. I was a happy camper... that is, until I
 tried to install Roxio Creator Pro 2010 (that is a whole different story... and it still won't install and I have tried EVERY suggestion I can find on the Internet). Anyway, I've figured out that this whole problem has something to do with MS Visual C++. The
 registry keys that I deleted had pretty much the same description... "msvcr80 (or 90).dll\Miscrosoft.VC80 (or 90).CRT,publicKeyToken="( string of letters and numbers)",version="8.0.50727.762" (different version numbers with different keys), type="win32",processorArchitecture="x86".
 So, I went looking. I found, installed on my computer, 2 instances of Visual C++ ATL Update (same version number, but 1 is x64 and the other is x86. I also have 5 instances of Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable AND 5 instances of Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable
 (some with the same version numbers but, some for x64 and some for x86).</p>
<p>I am savvy enough to know that all these instances were installed with various programs. However, they seems to be causing problems with installations/updates of other programs. Can anyone shed any light on this part?</p>

            Hi, Imnegi,
<br />
<br />It is currently not available as you stated. It may be "oming soon" and untll then, you will not be able to download the game. It is available for Android, ios and Windows phone.
<br />
<br />The game is not free and the Code refers to a Gift Card you may purchase from Microsoft Store or earn through Microsoft Rewards.

<h2>            Computer freezes and won&#39;t do anything afterwards</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I recently bought a new laptop (Monday) and I there's been an issue which has been annoying me. It happened to me three times now that the laptop randomly freezes and just doesn't do anything else after this. CTRL+ALT+DELETE doesn't do anything, the only option
 is to force shut it down by using the power button. <br />
It's worrying me because I've only just gotten it.</p>
<p>I looked in event viewer to see if I could find anything. I'm not great with these things so I might have overlooked things but the following warning comes up a lot:<br />
WHEA-Logger event 17<br />
A corrected hardware error has occurred.<br />
<br />
Component: PCI Express Root Port<br />
Error Source: Advanced Error Reporting (PCI Express)<br />
<br />
Bus:Device:Function: 0x0:0x1C:0x5<br />
Vendor ID:Device ID: 0x8086:0x9D15<br />
Class Code: 0x30400<br />
<br />
The details view of this entry contains further information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this has anything to do with it.<br />
<br />
My laptop is ASUS K501UW-AB78 and I'm running windows 10<br />
Can anyone help me? I'd rather not send it back again because I really need a laptop and if I can just fix it myself that's a waste of time.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why sometimes we experience slow to freezing performance of Windows 10. It could be because of high CPU usage, virus related or it could also be computer's memory related. For reference about the possible causes, you may refer to

<p>I'll give this procedure a try.&nbsp; Funny that it says you must have at least 10GB of space: my drive C: (a SSD) has 84.8 GB of space (91,149,266,944 bytes).&nbsp; And 8GB RAM.</p>

<p>This answer refers to not having enough disk space.&nbsp; The questioner is asking about memory.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; I am trying to install Windows 10 Creator Edition onto a tablet with a 32Gb SD card and 1Gb of RAM.&nbsp; After two attempts where it gave me various messages about disk space, I have made available at least 8Gb of space on the SD card,
 which is what it said it needs, though I have seen other posts elsewhere and information from Microsoft saying it needs 10Gb or 15Gb.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now after it restarts I am getting this new message about&nbsp; not having enough memory to create a RAMDisk.&nbsp; It is very frustrating, as each time it fails, I have to go back to the installer which does the entire download, then the preparation for the install,
 but doesn't allow me to go back to the point where it failed.</p>
<p>I have already successfully installed this update onto a Samsung N150 netbook, which only has 1Gb of RAM, so I don't understand why it won't work on the tablet.</p>
<p>I have tried the solutions on other sites about using bcdedit to remove bad memory records, and I don't have any to remove.</p>

<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet may not be compatible to receive the update, hence, the issue. To verify if it is so, and to properly isolate the concern, we would like to ask for the following details:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your tablet?</li><li>What OS is installed on the tablet?</li><li>Was it working fine before?</li></ul>
<p>We will wait for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

Since then, many users have been reporting issues trying to upgrade to the latest version; even though they are running a version of Windows 10, 1507 or 1511. The next version of Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703 is another release users will need to prepare for before upgrading. The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that. If you have been making attempts to upgrade without success, you probably need to check the manufacturers website for your computer model to find out if its compatible with the Creators Update or Anniversary Update or not.">Check

<p>Hi Liezl</p>
<p>The tablet is a Linx 8 originally running Windows 8.1 and upgraded to 1607, current build 14393.1593. It's a 32 bit OS, though the processor is 64 bit. Having upgraded two other machines that I used, I tried to upgrade this using Windows10Upgrade28085.exe.&nbsp;
 It says it will upgrade the build to 15063.&nbsp; It tells me that the CPU and memory are okay.&nbsp; The first time I ran it, it told me I needed more disk space, so I cleared out files to make 8Gb available.&nbsp; Each time it has failed, it has left files on the disk,
 so I have had to clean up again, but when it tells me there is enough disk space, then it starts the process.</p>
<p>The problem I am getting is specifically about RAMDisk.&nbsp; If that is not what the problem is, then it should be giving a different error message.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Simon</p>

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>The machine is a Linx tablet, so not on your list of manufacturers.</p>
<p>Support is largely through a Forum.&nbsp; They did have a problem with W10Creators on their 820 and 1020 models, but fixed that with a BIOS upgrade.</p>

<p>If the Linx tablet is not included in the list of manufacturers that support the update, it may be best to stick&nbsp; with the currently installed version on your tablet to avoid other issues. If you keep getting prompted with an update, you may have to block
 it for now while waiting for further developments.</p>

<h2>            After Windows 10 installs, should I uninstall Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As it stands right now (viz., 15h41 CDST Friday), the upgrade of my PC to Windows 10 from Windows 7 Home Professional is continuing (and has been since morning; is such perhaps normal, par for the course even)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, once the installation of Windows 10 unto my PC finishes, is it best to uninstall Windows 7, and if so, how would I go about this?</p>

<h2>            Skype - All contacts showing offline.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that all of my contacts in Skype are showing offline. This is the latest in a series of issues that I have had with Skype that began nearly a month ago in mid June. Initially, it was only my friends in Eastern Europe but now it is everyone.
 Because everyone is showing offline, I'm wondering if the problem is actually on my end. I'm in the central time zone of the US and I haven't seen signs of any problems. Is there some way to fix this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I refuse to commit to the latest version of the Skype app on my laptop. I simply do not like the layout of it. Thank you.</p>

                    OS: Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit<br />
<br />
Not sure what all is important to provide.<br />
<br />
Like in the title, I keep getting this message. It was "resolved" in another post on here but the OS was Vista and I wasn't sure if that would apply to mine.
<br />
<br />
I have not clicked accept at all but have tried restore. It will just keep coming back up every 3 minutes. I was afraid to accept, even though that may be the answer.<br />
<br />
I recently had what I guess is called Malware on my system, "Win 7 Security Alert" at least I believe that was what it was called.
<br />
<br />
I thought I got rid of that, but system hasn't run right since. <br />
<br />
I am not even sure what DNS is specifically and have no idea how to fix much of anything on a computer, so I would be most grateful if anyone could help. In layman's terms if at all possible.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much. <br />

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;When did the issue start?<br />
2.&nbsp;Do you have any antivirus program installed on your computer?<br />
3.&nbsp;Does the error message pop up randomly or when you use a particular program?<br />
4.&nbsp;Have you made any software or hardware changes to your computer recently?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To work with this issue, refer these methods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perform a clean boot of the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Clean boot</strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a process wherein you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.&nbsp; A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please refer the following link to obtain information on how to configure Windows 7 to start in a "<strong>clean boot</strong>" state.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if the issue persists in clean boot.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Ensure you perform the <strong>step 7 </strong>mentioned under “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>” after you check if the issue persists in clean boot, at the above link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to run an antivirus scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner to confirm that your computer is free of any virus infection. Please find the link below.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</div>
<div><br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program that provides ongoing protection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information is helpful.<br />

            I think you could usefully&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on the malware side of your problem first as you could not be sure of getting any meaningful results if you were not certain it had been cleaned up completely.&nbsp;&nbsp; The best advice I have seen is that given by

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Reinstall Windows Preinstalled On Computer</span></p>
<p>
<span>When Windows comes installed with the computer, OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ -
 check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it
 must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span><span><br />

<h2>            windows 10 app store wont work at home but does at work</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 10.&nbsp; I cannot access the app store or Microsoft edge on my home wireless network (the message says I am not connected to a network, but I clearly am).&nbsp; However, when I take my laptop to work, I have no problem accessing the
 app store and Microsoft edge.&nbsp; I had the same problem when I upgraded from Microsoft 8 to 8.1 and fixed it through "services.msc", but when I tried that this time, it does not fix the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an HP envy dv6 laptop.&nbsp; I had 0 issues with the install
 on my desktop computer. My co-worker and his $250 laptop has no issues with this.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Beck68,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try to check and see if you have VPN or directaccess enable when you are at home? That could block your access to Store. Also did you try the suggestion by Jesinta below?</p>

            <p>Not sure how I can tell. &nbsp;When I do a search of VPN it says I am connected</p>
<p>I tried the above mentioned suggestions to no avail. &nbsp;Like I said, I can get it to work at my office, but not at home</p>
<p>I shouldn't have to change settings between the two when I never did before.</p>

<h3> jakehqh  say:</h3>
<h2>            VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE on sleep wakeup</h2>
                    <p>When waking my computer up from sleep mode sometimes it works all right, sometimes it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Most of the times it works all right when at the time going to sleep mode there are no programs open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When there are many programs open when going to sleep, then waking up fails. The computer usually reboots itself and it takes very long time for Windows to load up. The hard disk runs at 100 % for long time. Sometimes Windows does not load up at all, but
 the hard disk just keeps running. Then I manually force reboot the computer is there a message: VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE. And again it takes long time for Windows to load up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never happened in Windows 7 Pro. In Windows 10 Pro it happens almost daily.</p>
<p>Exactly same computer and same hardware (a desktop PC) in both operating systems.</p>

            <p>Hi Jake,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let the following to assist you better:</p>

<p>- 1. No external drive is connected.</p>
<p>- 2. All the drivers after upgrade to Windows 10 have been updated.</p>
<p>Even so, the error was still present.</p>
<p>Latest graphics driver from NVidia's site has been installed. It didn't help to get rid of the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What new I have done now is that I ran chkdsk /f</p>

</p><p>I will report here more if the waking up from sleep mode issue still persists.</p>

</p><p>What new I have done now is that I ran chkdsk /f</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will report here more if the waking up from sleep mode issue still persists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Well, even after doing the chkdsk /f the problem was still there. On November 9 I had three programs open when the computer went to sleep. When I waked the computer up, it was just hanging, black screen, the hard disk was running. After then minutes I force
 shut down the computer and turned it on again. It appears that the wake up problem happens always when many programs are running when the computer goes to sleep.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I think that using system restore will not correct this issue. The issue started immediately after installing Windows 10 Pro and it has been present ever since. So there is no point in restoring the system to any previous state in this installation
 of Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is strange that in Windows 7 Pro this issue was not present. It cannot be hardware issue because the hardware has not been changed. Apparently it must be something with Windows 10 drivers. All drivers are up to date, but no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the graphics card (ASUS_GTX970-DCMOC-4GD5) I have tried the following three drivers available for Windows 10 from NVidia's site: 353.62, 355.82 and the latest one 358.87. All of them as a clean install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.</p>
<p>As a last resort I uninstalled the latest driver I had from NVidia's site and then installed the latest driver from the card manufacturer's site (ASUS). Their latest driver is version 353.62. I don't know is it any different from the same driver version
 what is available in NVidia's site. But anyway, I decided to try it too to see does it fix the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well, even this didn't help. The latest crash happened now as I had only web browser active when the computer went to sleep. When waking up the computer it was non-responsive. I saw the disk running but the display remained black. I had to force reboot the
 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled this latest driver (358.87) I got from NVidia's site. Then I installed the latest driver (353.62) available from the card manufacture's site (ASUS). The card model is ASUS_GTX970-DCMOC-4GD5.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are many factors that may prevent your computer from receiving the latest update. That includes incompatible software, device drivers, or hardware. So it is possible that the update is just delayed until everything is tested out or it may not come
 at all. But if you wish to update your computer now, you may do so by using the <strong>
Update Assistant</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the <strong>Update assistant</strong> through this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>DirectX End-User Runtime error&#58; A cabinet file necessary for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sentara  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectX End-User Runtime error&#58; A cabinet file necessary for installation cannot be trusted. Please verify the Cryptograhic Services are enabled and the cabinet file certificate is valid.</h2>
                    (Windows XP 2002 Home Edition). What happens is I go to the DirectX End-User Runtime download details website, and then I click on the download button.I download the "dxwebsetup.exe". After the download is done, I press the "Run" button. I check mark &nbsp;the
 "I accept the agreement" and then click on the "Next" button. Then it says "Installing Components: Initializing..." then a popup error comes up saying "A cabinet file necessary for installation cannot be trusted. Please verify the Cryptographic Services are
 enabled and the cabinet file certificate is valid." I am not sure what to do now, as I am stuck. Please help me, thank you!

<p>I had the same problem and tracked it down to a cabinet file that was downloaded by "dxwebsetup".exe that had been corrupted.</p>
<p>I deleted this file and ran "dxwebsetup" again, the file in question was downloaded ok this time and the program ran through with no errors.</p>
<p>The Cabinet files are held in "X:\WINDOWS\system32\DirectX\nnnn\"&nbsp;&nbsp; X is the drive for Windows, nnnn is the folder where the cabinet files are stored, I cant remember its name and the program deletes the files and folder after running! I had to search through
 each file checking the certificates to find the corrupted one. It may be quicker to delete them all and run "dxwebsetup" again. The cabinet files are obviously stored in this location until the program has completed successfully and "dxwebsetup" will only
 download any "missing" cabinet files for its successful running.</p>
<p>Hope this is some help.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good answer, I have the same problem and will give that a try, thanks.</p>
<p>One question, how did you check the certificates of the files?&nbsp; I think I will just move them all to a temporary location and run the dxwebsetup again but I was wondering how I could check the certificate if I need to.</p>
<p>Oh, in my case the folder that you named "nnnn" seems to be called "websetup".</p>
