<p>

</p><p>I have run repair for office, disabled addons from internet options, uninstalled skype, no effect what so ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really starting to annoy me.&nbsp;I am pretty sure this not desired functionality, although some outlook changes (office 2010-&gt;2013-&gt;2016) are so idiotic I cannot be sure what MS has been thinking. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 cannot delete recurring calendar events from imported - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 cannot delete recurring calendar events from imported calendar</h2>
                    I have a problem in Outlook 2010 where I cannot delete a recurring event that I set up several years ago. It's no longer necessary, so I'd like to remove it permanently.
<div>We moved from Groupwise to Outlook in Feb 2012, so the calendar got exported from Groupwise and imported into my new Outlook. This particular event doesn't even show as a recurring event anymore, and the only way I can delete the event is manually - one
 by one. Is there a way I can at least do a multi-delete?&nbsp;</div>

            How would that affect a broken recurring event? It's not a problem with reminders, it's the actual event that was a recurring event while on Groupwise but when it got sent over to Outlook the recurring part of it was broken and each event, though they're
 the same, are listed as individual events.

                    <p>I have had this laptop for a few years now. It has come with all the bells and wisthles. Visio was one of the programs that was included as part of a package. I had no

            <p>Hello Kid4eer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visio does not come installed by default on any computer. The only way would be if you purchased it at the time you bought the computer and had it pre-installed.
</p>
<p>Check these locations:</p>
<p>Visio if installed should have a record in Programs and features (Windows 7/Vista) and/or Add/Remove Programs (windows XP) You can find this in the Control Panel.</p>
<p>Also some computers come with a 30 day trial of Office. But usually not with Visio.</p>
<p>You could also check these folders for Visio.exe</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14 (Office 2010)</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12 (Office 2007)</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office11 (Office 2003)</p>
<p>If you find it just righ click and send to desktop that will create a shortcut on the desktop for you to use in the future.</p>
<p>If you don't find Visio in these locations it was not installed or was uninstalled at some point.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Bryn, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on our forum.</p>
<p>I have done the test, on our side, I didn’t meet the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally, the issue is not related to subscriptions, it only caused by Office client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you try safe mode to check if the issue occurs, it can help us determine whether a background program is interfering with Microsoft Office for Mac applications:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2398596/how-to-use-a-clean-startup-to-determine-whether-background-programs-ar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use a "clean startup" to determine whether background programs are interfering with Office for Mac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information for further analysis?</p>
<p>1. The detailed version of Office, such as 16.23.0 (19030902). (Click Word&gt;select About Word)</p>
<p>2. Check if other Office programs meet the issue, such as Excel.</p>
<p>3. When you edit other documents, the issue also occurs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<h2>            Email Addresses Not Being Added to Safe Senders List in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Sometime recently, a behavior changed in Outlook.com.&nbsp; Previously when I clicked "Wait, it's safe!" on an email that had been filtered to my Junk mail folder, it would automatically add that email address to the Safe Senders list.&nbsp; That no longer happens.&nbsp;
 Now when I click "Wait, it's safe" the email address isn't added to the Safe Senders list.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, I believe this problem is preventing the rule I added to 'Manage Rules' regarding said address from working correctly as the mail remains being filtered into Junk mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand I can manually add an address into the Safe Senders list, but my question specifically relates to the behavior wherein an email address isn't automatically added to Safe Senders when "Wait, it's safe!" is selected.</p>

swb_wls,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate all the information you've provided on the private message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to inform you that the option "Wait, it safe", only tagged the message itself to be safe but it will not automatically move the sender's email address to your Safe sender's list. The "Wait, it safe" option will automatically move an email to
 your Inbox if it is on your junk folder and also will show all the hidden attachments on the message. There is also an option to add the sender's email address to your contacts by clicking "Add to contacts".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to add the sender to your Safe sender's list, you need to manually add it. You can follow the steps below on how to go to your Safe sender's list:</p>
<p>1. Login to Outlook.com.</p>
<p>2. Click the gear icon at the upper right and select <strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <span>Under<span>&nbsp;"</span></span>Preventing junk email"<span>, click<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Safe and blocked sender</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I've clarify this matter. If you have other concerns or questions, don't hesitate to come back to us. We're always here to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Thanks for the reply Eugene.&nbsp; In the past, the "Wait, it's safe!" feature has always automatically added the email to the Safe Senders list.&nbsp; It's how I've managed my email for years, so I know 100% that this was the actual behavior.&nbsp; I've placed over
 200 email addresses into my Safe Senders list by doing that.&nbsp; I have never had to manually add them.&nbsp; If the functionality has changed, it's unfortunate, but I'll deal with it.&nbsp; I just wanted to make certain something hadn't broke.&nbsp; Thanks again.<br />

<p>I completely agree with the above. It is ridiculous that Microsoft just removes good functionality that is already there and provides no warning or documentation - and then calls this an UPGRADE!!! The upgrade would be to provide the USER the option to choose
 whether or not the Wait It's Safe button will add the senders address to the safe senders' list.</p>
<p>The bigger problem right now is - it appears that this Wait It's Safe option is only a ONE TIME FIX!!! The app is too stupid to learn, and I have found that even after I tell it that this e-mail sender is safe - the next time I get an e-mail from the same
 sender IT AGAIN GOES TO JUNK!!! This is completely unacceptable in today's world. When will Microsoft fix this?</p>

            <p>I have been a hotmail/outlook user since 1999 and it is true that the "Wait, it's safe" feature was changed without any warning. &nbsp;I used to manage my exclusive email list in this manner. &nbsp;It is disappointing that MS decided to change this feature. &nbsp;<strong>WHY?</strong>&nbsp;
 In my opinion, if Outlook wants to stay relevant there needs to be be an option to "Add to Safe Senders List"... then pop-up a a notice if that list is overpopulated. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>A long time since the original thread, but I hope someone picks this up. At present I seem unable to change my safe senders list at all, even by manually adding to it! I did wonder if there is a maximum number that can be in that list, so deleted one or
 two. But no, there seems to be no way I can currently add anything to my safe senders list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The detail - if I go into the safe senders option and type something new, I click on the "+" sign and it appears in the list. I hit the save button and it still seems to be in the list. But if I move away from the list and back to the list, it is no longer
 there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to mark a sender as safe after an email went into junk, did all of the above, and next time I got one from the same sender - it went into junk again. Having added it as safe before, I went back to the safe sender list,&nbsp;only to find it isn't
 there anymore....</p>

            I haven't had a problem with automatic or manual downloads before now.<br />
I am using the automatic download under settings.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I just went to the update and security page under settings to try to cancel the download.&nbsp; Apparently it had stopped on its own because the Download button was back.&nbsp; I clicked it and the download completed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now its sitting on Preparing to Install.

<p>Try changing your top setting from Basic to Full and see if that helps with your greyed out setting. Not absolutely positive but think it has to be Full on insider program</p>

<p>thanks that was the nudge I needed to the puzzle of why insider had stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case it was "Ashampoo Windows Optimiser" which I had let disable a whole lot of privacy things. Unticking that box in that program solved it. That box should come with a warning, I'll let them know :)</p>

<p>4) I do not have any software running that manipulates my registry or does any kind of system maintenance</p>
<p>5) I have tried the registry fix and added the key that was not there and set it to 1</p>
<p>6) I have tried the group policy editor fix</p>

                    Is it possible to install Maps 1.2 and Maps 2.0 parallel on the same device (N82)? For some areas the MapTech maps are more detailed and for others it's those from Navteq ...)?<br />

<h2>            Did Microsoft recently delete data of inactive Skype account&#63; My account has been wiped out and all conversations disappeared.</h2>
                    All of my old conversations with friends disappeared, last month I was still able to read it but today I opened my Skype app on my iPhone and all of my conversations are gone including the game account that I purchased in January 2017. Even though the
 Chats&nbsp;list is showing all recent message and the date but when I touched and enter the conversation screen I couldn't find anything, just a white blank space like I didn't talk with that person before. Is it possible to recover my old conversations? Sadly
 I didn't save the purchased game account and now it's gone.

            I swear five days ago I was still able to read the old conversations but today when I opened the app, which is upgraded to the new version, everything is gone. I tried to log in on my laptop and also found out that all recent chats are gone like I've never
 talked to anyone in Skype.&nbsp;

            I contacted support today and they were very helpful about another issue. I reported the issue of lost chat conversations. He told me to download the 'windows' version of Skype. When I did that, it asked if I wanted to 'try' the new version and I said
 no. I got the classic Skype back but, again, all past conversations were gone. Recent chats are still there. He said he would report this issue.&nbsp;

<p>I'm unsure about this but could it be the new version of Skype in ios that deleted conversations of the old version. I tried several methods of recovering the old data and chat logs from my phone and computer. The result of all recovering methods didn't
 work as it appeared that there are no data of conversation in my Skype application on iPhone. I also did a research and found out that Skype application on Windows pc would store conversation log in AppData&gt;Roaming&gt;Skype&gt;"Your Skype username"&gt;main.db&nbsp;which
 required SkypeLogView to open and view the chat log, I'd try this too but unfortunately it didn't work either, all of the conversations were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I concerned that the problem might be with the new version of Skype because on 6/8/2017 I received a message from Skype saying "From July 1, you may no longer be able to sign into the version of Skype on your iPhone. Update now for better call quality and
 messaging."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>GloriaK please feel free to contact me if you get any further&nbsp;information about this issue we could sort it out together.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t download entire messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> venture out tours  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t download entire messages</h2>
                    I just bought Outlook 2011 for Mac (upgraded from Entourage 2004), and I'm having trouble downloading the entirety of some email messages. When a message doesn't download entirely, I click on the button "get entire message." Sometimes that works, but about
 half of the time the spinning circle just keeps spinning and spinning and it says "Updating...", but the message just won't download entirely. Other times the message completely disappears from the inbox and can't be found anywhere after I click on "get entire
 message."<br />
<br />
This is very frustrating. I haven't been able to work properly for a few days now. Does anyone have any suggestions on this?<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Thanks for this advice, Prajwal K R.<br />
<br />
I did the first part. I created a new user account on my Apple computer and tested Outlook using that "Test" account. I sent myself emails with attachments. In the "Test" account the emails come right through, and they come through all in their ENTIRETY. They
 don't just download partially. They come through completely.<br />
<br />
In my "real" user account (whose settings were imported from my old Entourage program), the incoming emails download only partially, and there's a button in each email header that says "Get entire message." Whenever I click that button, various things can happen:<br />
<br />
1. The message disappears completely.<br />
OR<br />
2. The message still won't download completely. If this is the case, I wait a while and try again. Eventually, after a few minutes or after an hour or whatever, the message will finish downloading when I click "Get entire message."<br />
OR<br />
3. The message does finish downloading completely the first time I click on "Get entire message."<br />
<br />
Given this information, do you still suggest the second course of action that you mentioned in your previous post?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!<br />

                    <p>I installed Office 365 University a year ago on 1 PC.</p>
<p>It expires on 1/5/2018.</p>
<p>But today, I tried to open Words, then I found all office 365 program could not verify my subscription, even though I have logged in my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if it is due to Windows 10 upgrade &nbsp;yet there have no problem for using it in Windows 10 for around a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following do not work</p>
<p>Retrying - it just prompts a "connecting to account" msg box which very quickly disappears.</p>
<p>Disconnecting and reconnecting to the network</p>
<p>Sign out and sign in the Microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it related to Firewall? I don't know how to fix that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>

            you'll need to check the condition of your SIM card, and check network coverage and reception in your area. also check with your network provider if you have an active data plan on your service.

    <title>Facebook profile pictures being used by Outlook. How to disable&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sara_887  say:</h3>
<h2>            Facebook profile pictures being used by Outlook. How to disable&#63; Very unsettled by this.</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to&nbsp;Outlook from Hotmail.&nbsp;Outlook includes profile pictures of both myself and my contacts in&nbsp;outgoing and incoming emails.&nbsp;Said pictures&nbsp;change daily and are taken directly from my (and my contacts') Facebook&nbsp;Profile Pictures Album.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This
 is completely inappropriate</span>. I never consented to the inclusion of photos from social networking sites in my personal email. Two questions:
<strong>How did Outlook access these photos in the first place</strong>, AND <strong>
how do I disable this feature</strong>? I have seen no means of doing so in the "options" section of Outlook. I have also consulted a Microsoft rep. through chat and was directed to these forums. If there is no way to disable this feature,&nbsp;I will be deleting
 my Outlook/Hotmail account although I've had it in excess of a decade.</p>

    <title>&#61;COUNTIF formula with specific parameters is not counting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chelseab15  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#61;COUNTIF formula with specific parameters is not counting correctly</h2>
                    <p>I have a formula set up to count the names in the cell range below. I then subtract the E35 cell so it takes out the (P) cells. For some reason, it is adding in D22, which is the cell with 110 in it. I dont want to count this cell as it is a room number
 not a name. The formula is working correctly on all other sheets in this workbook, but I am not sure why or how to get it from counting the wrong cell.&nbsp;</p>

            Its because the 110 is a number stored as text as indicated by the little green triangle in the top left corner of the cell &amp; is therefore counted. Change this to a numerical 110 and the count will work fine.

            Making Skype to Skype audio and video calls are free. However Skype does provide paid Skype to phone services that are optional. You would have to explicitly sign up for such a service to be billed on a continual basis. A $2.99 monthly charge is the standard
 cost of some of the unlimited subscriptions offered in a particular country. If you want to check what subscriptions are active on your account, check

<h2>            Error code 2203 while installing Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a copy of Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise edition from my workplace to use on my home computer. After trying to install it numerous times I keep getting the "Error Code 2203" and the product fails during the set-up process. Eventually, I simply
 downloaded it for about the 10th time and saved it to my desktop.</p>
<p>The error code solutions I have found are telling me to grant permssions, which, to the best of my knowledge, I have done. Still no luck.</p>
<p>Can someone please help me figure this thing out? I really need to get this software up and running and I am at the end of my rope with it.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joe Murphy/Nags Head, North Carolina</p>

<p>None of the previously mentioned fixes worked.</p>
<p>It turns out that the problem was the fact that Carbonite was running on my computer and was preventing the Microsoft Office software from installing. Once I disabled Carbonite everything&nbsp;installed and worked just fine.</p>
<p>The canned answers that Microsoft puts out on their support pages seldom solve specific problems, from my past experience. This was just another of those instances.</p>

    <title>Help&#33; Need Help with Timeline View in MS Project 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m141  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#33; Need Help with Timeline View in MS Project 2013</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been tasked to create a timeline&nbsp;in the middle of a single&nbsp;standard MS PowerPoint slide using MS Project 2013,&nbsp;but I have a lot of questions since I am new to using MS Project 2013 and it seems very different from MS Project 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; How do I change the size and colors of the milestone diamonds to look like the typical diamonds you see in MS Project 2010?&nbsp; The diamonds in MS Project 2013 are tiny and I am unable to change them from the default color (black).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I set a specific start&nbsp;and finish date for my timeline?&nbsp; I&nbsp;do not need the project start and finish date to show.&nbsp; I'm only looking to represent FY15, not the entire project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Is there a "wrap text" option&nbsp;for each of the text/date&nbsp; boxes in the&nbsp;timeline or is my only option to use Size 8 font and have the text display on one line?&nbsp; I selected '2' from the "Text Lines" drop down box, but it didn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; How do I bold just one date in my timeline?&nbsp; I went to the "Text Styles" dialog box and it appears when I change one, it changes them all.&nbsp; I even selected orange and it changed them all.&nbsp; How do I change them individually, or is that not possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; The timeline&nbsp;with all titles and dates&nbsp;needs to precisely fit on a single&nbsp;Standard PowerPoint&nbsp;slide within a 1.63" High x 9.16" Wide image block.&nbsp; Is there a way I can enter these dimensions into&nbsp;MS Project so it knows the space I have to work with and
 will copy over nicely and not look distorted?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have so many specific requirements, would it be best I open a new&nbsp;blank Project&nbsp;file and create a start date of 10/1/2014 and&nbsp;an end date of&nbsp;9/30/2015, and then manually type in the milestones I want to add?&nbsp; Can I even type items into the timeline&nbsp;manually?&nbsp;
 I have create several timelines for different projects within a short amount of time, so any help you can provide ASAP is greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Thank you so much!!</p>

            <p>Hi m141,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The choices for formatting the timeline view within MS Project are fairly limited.&nbsp; However, if you copy for presentation and paste into a PPT slide, each object can be formatted.&nbsp; You can shorten the timeline to just show the range you are interested in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of your questions can be handled within PPT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Resize the Outlook window to full screen (not via the Maximize button) and then close Outlook in this state. The next time it will start in the state as well. Sadly, setting the shortcut property of Outlook to always open maximized does not work.</p>
