<p>I don't think they did that, and if they did it's not in my download history. The only thing I can think of is maybe I got an extra reward for being in the update beta, I'm not sure though.</p>

<p>Of the two DLC packs, I'd recommend you at least get this one.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard software missing.</h2>
                    No keyboard keys work, so I'm using the On-Screen Keyboard.&nbsp; Hewlett Packard wants me to send my HP Pavilion g6 laptop to them to have the keyboard software installed.&nbsp; I haven't done this because I don't want to be without my computer, and I seldom type.&nbsp;
 But it bugs me when I occasionally do have to type, and that I can't seem to fix this over the internet.&nbsp; It seems that C-Cleaner, or Fix Me Stick, or Turbo, or Slim Cleaner, or Driver Update, all of which I recently used on laptop, and apparently deleted
 or disabled my keyboard software.&nbsp; This maybe because key logger software was detected.&nbsp; There is no sign as far as my software is concerned, that a keyboard even exists.&nbsp; There should be a way to download and install this software over the internet.&nbsp; After
 allI must download new software every day and don't know it.

            <p>Hi Pim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick question before we proceed<br />
1.&nbsp;What is the exact Make and Model of your Keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check the status of Keyboard in device manager. Please follow the below steps and check if it helps,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
1.&nbsp;Press "<strong>Windows + X"</strong>, click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Check for any exclamation marks in there.<br />
If exclamations mark are present, on which drivers it is present try to update them by right clicking on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Run inbuilt hardware and device troubleshooter.<br />
1.&nbsp;Press "<strong>Windows + W"</strong>, Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;From the Search list, click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;On the left panel, click on <strong>view all</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;From the list click on<strong> Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
5.&nbsp;Follow on screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case we have to install the drivers in compatibility mode with Windows 8.1 and see if it works fine with Windows 10.
<br />
To install the drivers in compatibility mode, first of all download the mouse and keyboard drivers from manufacturer’s website on to your computer.
<br />
Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This link also applies to Windows 10.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>why no new version of windows movie maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loribeck  say:</h3>
<h2>            why no new version of windows movie maker</h2>
                    <p>Not sure how Microsoft plans on continuing to keep people from not going to Apple, Mac's for all those who use and purchase Windows PC's to use for making DVD's that are easy without having to figure out , waste time, on figuring out alternatives that we
 would have to buy and take a chance how well and user friendly it is.&nbsp; I have spent so much time researching reading hundreds of forums and you must be aware Tons of people complain about this one thing.&nbsp; That must tell you something.&nbsp; It also says Microsoft
 &amp; Windows do not give a s_ _ t what a huge percentage of their loyal customers want?&nbsp; I wonder why Mac, and Apple are so much more successful and sell ? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should seriously listen and give back what so many bought and stuck with you guys for certain reasons. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally took the time after hating my computer and I have another new HP and I'm furious my husband bought it for me when ive told him I hate windows 10.&nbsp; Apparently lots of people do and Windows is very aware that a huge percentage not just a few thousand
 complained about not having movie maker. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend knows how I feel and shipped her computer with wind XP on it so I can get back to making my special DVD's that I love and for those I love but my husband hasn't hooked it up actually I have to pay someone to . &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way that you changed so much and so confusing not user friendly which even PC gerus say and they repeat over and over it's not just me there isn't one person who doesn't complain about how horrible windows 10 is but since its the only choice they just
 continue to bitch about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to be one more that complains and hopefully windows will get smart and hire better programmers that aren't focusing on who knows what but rather what the people who spend their hard earned money want and use all the time instead of dropping it
 and making life hell if you have a windows 10.&nbsp; There is not one person who likes it ask every Best Buy , the best compliment you guys have received is that the previous version was so bad they had to work on it but unfortunately they made a few changes but
 only if you upgrade to the essentials now that is obsolete to . &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            I totally agree with you on everything you stated. I am a Windows and Mac user. I'm scratching my head as to how Microsoft expects to compete with Mac's iMovie by taking Windows Movie Maker away. My older Windows laptop had Movie Maker, but because the
 thing was so old, it ran extremely slow, which slowed my work progress. I went out and purchased a brand new windows 10 machine only to realize movie maker was replaced with the photo app. Well I tried to make do with the photo app only to realize it no longer
 has all of the nice transitions movie maker had. To get something like that you have to use a few of the themes they've provided and I didn't like any of them! Plus with the themes you can't use your own music. I am also a Mac user so i returned the windows
 machine, pulled out my mac, open iMove and got to work. I use to perfer Windows Movie Maker over iMovie but Microsoft killed that!&nbsp;

<h3> jschow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 lost internet</h2>
                    
<p>Thanks for the help. I have a Windows 7 Professional. When I first got the computer I plugged right into the internet without any problem.</p>
<p>Then, I set up a home network in order to transfer files from my old PC to my new one.</p>
<p>Once I detached from my old computer and plugged everything back into the new one. There is no internet connection.</p>
<p>I found the following thread and tried some of the information there but nothing worked.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/thread/09e692ea-eddc-4677-8e70-44ca2936919c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/thread/09e692ea-eddc-4677-8e70-44ca2936919c</a></p>
<p>When I follow this path: Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center I see that I have a Home Network with "No Internet".</p>
<p>In order to set up an Internet connection, I'm asked for a password and user name which I'm trying to get I've had this DSL for 6 years and don't remember ever needing a username and password.</p>
<p>Is there not a way to totally remove the existence of any network from&nbsp;my PC? Since I have only one computer to use, I don't need any sort of network and it seems that this network, is the cause of all of my trouble.</p>
<p>BTW, I have no trouble connecting to&nbsp;the internet&nbsp;when I hook up my old computer.</p>
<p>I got my PC in November and have restored it all the way back to the day it was built but this is still an issue.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>From what I read, it seems to me that you are connected directly to a DSL Modem.</p>
<p>While it is working, it is a bad choice.</p>
<p>1. It is not very secured, your computer is directly connected to the Internet with no external protection which make it easy target for hackers..</p>
<p>2. It needs PPPOE software authentication done and supported by the Computer, which provides mediocre (and at times unstable) Internet performance.</p>
<p>The solution is to use Cable/DSL Router even if you are using only one computer and No Network.</p>
<p>This page will tell you a little more about the issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/PPPOE.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/PPPOE.html</a></p>
<p>Currently your User ID and password are embedded in your old computer so it can connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Depending on how it was set 6 years ago, and the software used by the ISP. Itimight be that the ID/PW cannot be retrieved at all from the computer, or they might be retrieved by someone that is familiar in the way that your DSL ISP used to configure the
 connection 6 years ago, and he/she is sitting in front of your computer.</p>
<p><strong>My recommendations.</strong></p>
<p>Get yourself a Cable/DSL Router. Call you ISP and ask them to reset your account. They will give you the ID a new password<strong>. Write it down</strong> .</p>
<p>Configure the with it the WAN side of the Router, and your DSL connection will not be anymore computer dependent.</p>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>P.S. I hope that you understand that it is Not Win 7 fault that you forgot your ID and password.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade trashed my PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vicrider2006  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade trashed my PC</h2>
                    <p>I did the upgrade to Windows 10 yesterday. PC is a Gateway desktop that was running Windows 7. After the upgrade I was having issues with the screen cycling to black then back on then cycling again. Kind of like screen refreshes. It was happening about every
 3 seconds and would eventually stop after about 15 minutes of this. I assumed it was having problems with something it was trying to load on start up. I decided to try to disable start up items and test it by starting each one in turn but before I got to do
 that the PC rebooted itself and got back to the start up screen where you log in. After typing the password the Welcome screen just seems to get stuck with the balls going round and round. I went bed last night with that happening. This morning the balls were
 still there. Did a hard reset, same thing. Doing a Windows 10 reset failed (no reason given) it just said no changes were made and reset could not continue.
</p>
<p>So now I am trying to restore Windows 7 and it appears the boot sector of my drive, which was running fine is now trashed. CHKDSK is running and making lots of repairs, it's up to 534000 repairs at this point LOL.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens if my previously running fine PC is completely trashed by this upgrade. Is MS going to replace my computer??</p>

Hello again Mr Harry Potter , </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To restart your Surface, from your Start screen go to Charms/Settings/Power, select Restart. You can also select the Power icon in the lower right side of the Login screen and select Restart there.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selecting Restart is the only way to install and configure Windows updates, Shut down doesn't do that.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Surface RT the closest thing to a different browser is the Google search app.

<h2>            Xbox One Playing Xbox Classics&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm just wondering, Will Xbox One ever offer Classic Xbox game titles? example: To be able to buy crash bandicoot/simpsons hit and run etc from the store on the console? I've been trying to do some research but can't seem to find anything unfortunately :(</p>

<p>Reason given for no backward compatibility to 360 was the difference in architecture. As original xbox was basically a cut down PC and the xbone is based on that line of chips it should be a much easier task to port stuff across.
</p>
<p>Not sure how many games I'd re-buy though unless they at least do an HD make over. (my original xbox still works, I'd just need to plug it in!)</p>

<p>I posted this on your other thread but due to licences etc. this would not be possible it is more likely and promising if Microsoft made a Xbox Handheld.</p>
<p>The Xbox Handheld could have the power of the 360, run 60fps 720p or 1080p and just be a hardcore gaming machine with the xbox one type interface.</p>
<p>The Xbox handheld would be easy to develop for as it would have the same develop process as the 360, achievements etc. would all be there but now remote play would be possible off the Xbox One.</p>
<p>That is more likely but still would never happen.</p>

    <title>My keyboards thinks it&#39;s American. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My keyboards thinks it&#39;s American.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been bothering me for sometime however every time I try to sort it out I can't work it out. It first started when I&nbsp;upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked by keyboard settings and it tells me that I am using English UK settings however the keyboard acts like its a English US setting. (for the '@' symbol I have to press 'shift' and '2' which isn't standard on a UK keyboard.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier this week I did work out the problem by going through the control panel region settings and removing&nbsp;all options for English United&nbsp;States as a language&nbsp;however I've turned my laptop on today and the problem is back as well as the settings for English
 US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say now that English UK is the default language and the selected language.&nbsp;I have also tried changing the override for default input method to English UK but this doesn't make a difference either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me please!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Al</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've have tried this before but the option to remove is 'greyed out'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try and completely remove the English US language then it disappears but as soon as I reload the Language panel it reappears. It's really frustrating as I work in Accounting and I don't have easy access to a pound symbol!</p>

<p>Probably not. &nbsp;Last walkman I had was oh, wow, about 1992. &nbsp;LOL. &nbsp;Really cool Sony, and it was really small. &nbsp;Top of the line at the time. &nbsp;But yeah, doubt u can use a walkman with xbox360. &nbsp;I do not advise tampering with your xbox either; &nbsp;Your account

<p>I still have my walkman, it records as well! &nbsp;Never thought of plugging it into an XBOX though, I doubt that it would work, you need a USB adapter patch cord and it may not be as simple as that, you're talking about plugging a device that's "transmitting"
 an ANALOG signal into a DIGITAL console, a simple patch cord will not translate that signal into a "language" that the XBOX can present as a wave form, you'd definitely have to do some research for it wouldn't be an endeavour for a novice...:-)</p>

<p>Actually, Walkmans nowadays are MP3 players. But yes, plug it in, and see if it works.

<p>I strongly suggest you look up walkmans. They evolved into digital media players, and the OP indicated his was digital when he said his was the E series.</p>

<p>If his is in fact a digital "walkman", if his only output option is a headphone jack, you still have to translate that signal into a digital one, if he has a USB output option, then that isn't a problem but the XBOX itself has to have the proper drivers

<p>Yes it would depend on the version. However, as modern Walkmans are manufactured as MP3 players, they therefore have the ability to connect to a PC via USB (and thus an Xbox- though it's hard to say if the Xbox will 'read' the device). The Walkmans of today
 are not the same as those from the 80s. They're more like iPods. </p>

<h2>            BSOD - nvlddmkml.sys Failure - Can&#39;t run Windows with an nvidia driver</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the 20th, I've been having massive problems with BSODs. I have an older build on Windows 10, and a GTX780 as the gpu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had two BSOD errors that I think are related to the core issue: DPC_Watchdog_Violation &amp;&nbsp;DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dump that directly calls the latter, I can't find a dump that states DPC Watchdog, though that's my own fault I believe, what with those being overwritten.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I can post the event log, or really anything else. I've had no VIDEO_TDR failures, and I don't think the unit is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attempted installing both the newest, and 'stable' drivers as recommended online, plus what I know to have been running on for a while. All just black screen &amp; BSOD, or just BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a full chkdisk and a few of the other recommended troubleshooting steps I've seen on these forums for what I've experienced, and no dice. It all seems to revolve around the nvlddmkm.sys</p>

            Hi Aku.  I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See the this for DPC Watchdog fixes:  <a href="https://thewindowsplus.org/dpc_watchdog_violation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://thewindowsplus.org/dpc_watchdog_violation/</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Blue Screen troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.
<br />
<br />In particular you want the steps to update all drivers including BIOS, Chipset, Display, Sound, etc - to the latest from the Support Downloads webpage for the PC or device model, not just Windows Update search done in Device Manager, where you should compare to see what driver versions/dates you have.
<br />
<br />You also want to check for infection and System file damage in the checklist steps.
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Hi akubaking, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br /> 
<br />nvlddmkm.sys is the NVidia video drivers. So you need to update that driver. If no newer are available you may need to revert back to an older stable version.
<br />
<br />Check with Nvidia Support, their online docs and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.

<br />
<br />Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low-level chipset drivers, antivirus/antispyway/security programs, and other drivers can also cause this. 
<br />
<br />BCCode: d1   0x000000d1  &lt;-- read this link

<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br /> Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - 
<br />check manually by model.
<br />
<br /> Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />
<br /> ====================================================
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />
<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics at top of the list - click it. in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows Memory 
<br />Diagnostic".
<br />

<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run 
<br />Driver Verifier.

<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen and done everything on that initial link, as I've seen that posted on another similar issue. The only thing I couldn't complete was manually updating the chipset driver as mine apparently is set up different (I dont' have anything that says Standard
 SATA ACHI Controller, they're all AMD specific) I did however run Driver Booster to check for all out of date drivers, and that did fix a few.<br />
<br />
Per the second link, which I've seen before too, I've done the DISM/sfc checks per another thread, I've done a refresh as you called it, and ended up system restoring back to a crap restore point that at least allows the use of the computer outside of safe
 mode. The Microsoft downloads area for drivers is garbage (I had to use Google to get results that weren't surface pro related), and didn't have anything for me that's more recent than 9/2016 and nothing there says Windows 10, though I bet some drivers work
 just fine from 8. I'm no expert there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I didn't have a system restore from before the issues occurring, else I'd have just used that.<br />
<br />
I don't want to do a full Windows reinstall. I'm not trying to be that guy, but I shouldn't have to.<br />
<br />
It's quite clearly the driver the way I see it.<br />

            Hello,
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

<p>This is a dump specifically for a BSOD I got while trying your driver verification. I don't know that it's relevant, but you asked for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AusQ79VZEiKPhFK2QfMYCwlcu6Ki</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, I've done much research in all forums, including Nvidia for my issue, and nothing had a fix, or was explained as thoroughly. All drivers have been updated, aside the Nvidia one, which is what I view as the culprit.</p>

<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just completed this. Rebooted into Safe Mode, ran DDU, and came back to Windows Proper to install Nvidia's most current driver. Currently, I have this message in the Device Manager:&nbsp;Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code
 43)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was interesting though, because this was the first time it didn't automatically blue screen when the driver is installed. However, I also wasn't prompted to restart upon completion of that install, which I would expect.</p>

<p>I can't find anything that states my SCP Virtual Bus Driver is out of date, much less a place to download this if there's something newer(that I trust anyways). ASUS doesn't have anything on their site. The maker of that driver doesn't have their own website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My BIOS is up to date.</p>
<p>

<h2>            No sound when playing audio files or some videos &#40;mp3., avi., mp4. ...&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have no sound when reproducing audio(and video) files from my hard disc, but what is killing me is that I have sound (working perfectly) when I go to youtube for example! Now, I have tried reinstalling my audio driver (several times) and it didn't help me!
 I'm on Win7 64bit and I use 5.1 sound system, and I use Realtek High Definition Audio driver (tried the downloaded version and the one from my motherboard CD, both showed same problem). The sound level indicators in the system mixer move when you play a sound,
 no sound is physically emitted. Windows is updated, and I really don't know what to do because I've tried to search all sorts of solutions...
<br />
<br />
Any help?<br />
<br />
<br />

Method 2: <br />
Step 1: <br />
a. Click Start, type Sound in the Start Search box. <br />
b. Click Sound in the search results at the top of the Start menu. <br />
c. Click the Playback tab. Notice the check mark next to the default device. For most users, the default device is internal Speakers. Make sure that your audio settings are configured as expected.
</p>
<p>Step 2: <br />
Follow these steps: <br />
a. On the Playback tab, <br />
b. select the playback device.<br />
c. click Properties, click the Advanced tab and make sure that the Default Format is set to the value that you expect.

<p>a. On the Playback tab.<br />
b. Select the playback device.<br />
c. Click Configure and then make sure the configurations are set correctly. <br />
If the sound settings are set correct, and your internal speakers are already set as the default device.

Select the sound device that you want as the default sound device, and then click Set Default.
<br />
Click OK to save your settings and to close the Sound dialog box.<br />

<h2>            Burnout CRASH&#33; Forum</h2>
                    
<p>The XBLA titles don't seem to have changed on here for a while. There is no forum for Burnout CRASH! so, I guess this will have to do for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might not be true Burnout, but it is a lot of fun! It's quite addictive trying to beat your friends high scores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm nowhere close to finishing it yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other CRASHERS! out there?</p>

<p>If you want to add your high scores over at www.BurnoutAholics.com we put a leaderboard up there, so you can compete with people who aren't on your friendslist! :)</p>
<p>It really is nothing like the previous Burnout CRASH! modes, but as an arcade title, it does enough for me, it's got quite a lot to it really.
</p>
<p>It took me a little while to get my head around the 3 different game modes, you really have to play each mode differently to do well.
</p>
<p>... and I still haven't tried it with Kinect yet!</p>

<h2>            Windows XP restart not working, regular shut down button works but not the restart button.</h2>
                    Whenever I have to hit the restart button after installing any updates, etc it will not shut down the computer.&nbsp; It hangs at the Windows shutting down screen and I have to press the button on the computer case to shut it down.&nbsp; The regular shut down button
 works fine but not the restart button.&nbsp; I have searched the forums and MS info, have tried different things but cannot solve the problem.&nbsp; It will not work in Safe Mode either.&nbsp; Have not recently installed any new hardware other than a Logitech wireless LX310
 keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; I had a slightly different Logitech model installed before this one and everything worked fine.&nbsp; Could this be causing the problem?&nbsp; The other problem is it won't let me uninstall this hardware in Control Panel so I can't see if this is
 the problem!

    <title>Xbox money in GBP, not AUD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hatchdog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox money in GBP, not AUD</h2>
                    My money in my XB account turned into British pounds, not Australian dollars when I changed it from ms points to real cash Now I can't buy anything with it, cos I live and have always lived in Australia. (Never had any game/console/address/ anything to
 do with Britain) How can I get my money back to AUD so I can use it? Tried xbox support, it's been 2 months now of them "trying" to fix it....but they said they just can't. Brilliant. Any other ideas?

</p>
<p>Maybe your money is in another country like GB you can see that info in there, and if you confirm this, then i recommend that you change the region of your Xbox One so you can buy content, or change the region of the account if you are on Xbox 360.</p>

<p>It's on Xbox One. &nbsp;When I migrated the MS points I had in my account, it, for some reason, created a secondary GBP account and put all my migrated points (now money) &nbsp;into GBP. Even though I've had nothing to do with GBP ever.</p>
<p>So now, I have 2 Microsoft payment accounts, but can only spend the money I put into/already have in my AUD account...because i have a AUD xbox and everything else.</p>
<p>Basically, MS randomly invented and put my money into a GBP account that I can't spend....All i want is that GBP account shut, and my money back in my regular AUD account.</p>

            <p>Hey there HatchDog.</p>
<p>It sounds like at one point you may have set your account to the UK and then back, which explains why your points were transitioned to that region. Unfortunately, any Microsoft Points that were transitioned to local currency are now expired as of June 1st 2015. </p>
<p>So long as your account is set to Australia, all future currency added to the account should show as AUD. If you are purchasing pre-paid codes, make sure to purchase from a verified retailer from the region you're physically located in. </p>

    <title>win 10 skype app shut down for good - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            win 10 skype app shut down for good</h2>
                    <p>hallo</p>
<p>i can´t shut down skype for good, People of my contact list are always able to let it ring on my desktop computer even on the start screen they do so. what i really need is skype just activate if i like so. That means. If i like to call people or liked to
 be called i switch on skype and if i close skype, just normal end the skype programm it should be really deactivated. Sadly this is not the case, &nbsp;I have deleted skype in the autostart and it doesn´t help also to shut down skype &nbsp;i have to kill the process
 over the taskmanager. I know skype is part of ms win10 now but i should have the freedom to switch it on and off to my liking and the program &nbsp;shouldn´t do things in the backround without my knowlege.</p>
<p>Maybe there is an solution for this. I hope&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can I get my computer to talk to me&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Several years ago I saw a movie on television, where some young kid almost started a war on his computer. The movie may have been called "War Games." Anyway when the kid went to his computer and hit a button, the computer said, "Good morning, Richard, what
 do you want to do? (something to that effect anyway). I thought it was pretty neat.</p>
<p>I am just wondering, was that television special effects at play or can computers actually do that? Is it a program you can buy, or is it just something that a computer technician can do but others cannot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>There's a lot that do this. &nbsp;Google Chrome browser lets you say "OK, Google" and then ask any question like "how much horsepower in a 2015 Mustang", or "What's the weather going to be like this weekend?" and it will reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10, a free upgrade for all Windows 7/8 users, will have this also, due out later this summer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use programs like Dragon Naturally Speaking to do the same.</p>

<h2>            Sound device could be malfunctioning, used by another program, or not there&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The night before, I was watching a movie and my laptop (Acer Aspire v5-471G, Windows 8.1) has been playing sounds normally. The next day, I tried to edit a video and it didn't allow me to playback the video because it couldn't play any sounds. I thought
 that it was a problem with the program but when I watched a YouTube video, I couldn't hear a thing. I also tried playing some music using the Windows Media Player and it said "Windows Media Player cannot play the file because there is a problem with your sound
 device. There might not be a sound device installed on your computer, it might be in use by another program, or it might not be functioning properly".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have already tried:</p>
<p>*Letting windows automatically troubleshoot my pc for any audio problems. (It didn't find any issues)</p>
<p>*Tried testing my audio devices. Audio Devices &gt;&gt; Speakers &gt;&gt; Properties &gt;&gt; Advanced &gt;&gt; Test (Then, ERROR failed to play test tone.) I even set it back to its default settings</p>
<p>*Set my speakers as my default audio device</p>
<p>*Updated my drivers automatically through windows. (And no, it doesn't have the yellow exclamation point at all)</p>
<p>*Uninstalled my drivers (both Realtek HD, and Intel)</p>
<p>*Reinstalled my drivers</p>
<p>*Tried plugging in my headphones to see if some sound could come through it (Nope)</p>
<p>*Yes, I'm absolutely sure it's not on mute</p>
<p>
