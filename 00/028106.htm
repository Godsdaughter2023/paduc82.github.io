Hi Raman,
<div><br />
<div>If the new workbook is to include your macros, change:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>&gt; ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs NewFN, FileFormat:=xlOpenXMLWorkbook</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>to</div>
<div>ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs NewFN, FileFormat:=xlOpenXMLWorkbookMacroEnabled</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the workbook is to be saved without the macros, change</div>
<div><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; NewFN = "E:\VARMA\Varma Group of Companies\Herbal\Receipt\" &amp; Range("F9").Value &amp; ".xlsm"</span></div>
<div>to</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; NewFN = "E:\VARMA\Varma Group of Companies\Herbal\Receipt\" &amp; Range("F9").Value &amp; ".xlsx"</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>===</div>

            I just figured out the issue. The table handle doesn't appear when I have the Touch settings enabled (I have a touch screen computer). Reverting to Mouse mode causes the handle to reappear.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to show&#47;hide specific rows in excel when selecting a drop down</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to create a drop down list in cell A3 that hides and shows specific rows when each option is selected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1-&nbsp; show rows 9,10,12,13,15 and hide rows 7,8,11,14,16.</p>
<p>Option 2- show rows 7,8,12,13,15,16 and hide rows 9,10,11,14.</p>
<p>Option 3 -show rows 7,8,12,13,15,16 and hide rows 9,10,11,14.</p>
<p>Option&nbsp;4 -&nbsp;show rows 9,10,12,13,,15 and hide rows 7,8,11,14,16.</p>
<p>Option 5 - show rows 7,8,11,12,13,14,15 and hide rows 9,10,16.</p>
<p>Option&nbsp;6 -&nbsp;show rows 9,10,11,12,13,14,15 and hide rows 7,8,16</p>
<p>Option 7 - show rows 9,10,12,13,15 and hide rows 7,8,11,14,16</p>
<p>Option&nbsp;8 - show rows 7,8,12,13,15,16 and hide rows 9,10,11,14</p>
<p>Option&nbsp;9&nbsp;- show rows 11,12,13,14,15 and hide rows 7,8,9,10,16</p>
<p>Option&nbsp;10 - show rows 7,8,12,13,15,16 and hide rows 9,10,11,14</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>I'd like the row hiding / showing to be automatic based on what is selected in Cell&nbsp;A3 - without the need to rerun any macros.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Is it possible to write a code for this?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Disabling Invasive OneDrive and Word Password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling Invasive OneDrive and Word Password</h2>
                    Every day when I turn on my PC it happens and the same bummer. When I try to open a Word document, is a password requested to edit the document? If I do not insert the password, Word is disturbing me until I put it on. If I want to save the document in
 MY directory I can not do this because I did not insert the password. Who invented this brilliant rule that disturbs your customers?<br />
<br />
Let me try to explain. If I use Ms-Word I do not want to be disturbed by online monitoring intrusors. If I use onDrive is just because I only want to save my documents in the cloud. Now, getting password management to edit and save document in Word is non sense.
 Stop that nuisance!

<p>Hello 091805245,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to clarify few information in order for me to better assist you with your concern. Kindly provide the answers to the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you opening the Word document from OneDrive?</li><li>Is it also happening when opening Word directly?</li><li>Is it happening on other Office apps?</li><li>When did the issue start?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure you've signed in to the Office apps with the correct Office 365 account. You can check it by opening Word &gt; File &gt; Account &gt; User information. If so, sign out and re-sign in again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To notify me about the status of this issue, simply reply to this post.</p>

<p>Hi Regie Reb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your return. Please see below the answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are you opening the Word document from OneDrive?</p>
<p>I'm using Explorer in a synchronized OneDrive folder. I don't like to use OneDrive directly from browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is it also happening when opening Word directly?</p>
<p>Yes. This happens when I need to use the file (OneDrive folder) actions opening, saving and closing the document. When I click to open the file in Explorer and the file is opened the Word immediately ask me for a login.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is it happening on other Office apps?</p>
<p>No. Sometimes I need to use OneDrive for IOS but that problem not happen. Perhaps because I don't edit documents in Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When did the issue start?</p>
<p>I think 2 or 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I followed your recommendation sing-out/sing-in but this didn't solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Is there an off-line mode in Word that can I use just OneDrive to synchronization my files in Explorer to cloud?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I appreciate your response. I would like to ask few more questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Regarding my second question,&nbsp; does it also happens when opening Word directly. What I mean is, if you open Word &gt; Choose
<strong>Blank document</strong> / <strong>Open the file within Word</strong>. Does the issue still occur?</li><li>Since you've mentioned that you're opening the files from the OneDrive folder in File Explorer; I would like to ask if it also happens on other Word document/s saved locally on your computer and not in OneDrive?</li><li>What changes have you made prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly check if your Office product&nbsp; is activated, to do this, Open <strong>Word</strong> &gt; Click
<strong>File</strong> &gt; Choose <strong>Account </strong>&gt; You should see <strong>
Product Activated</strong> under <strong>Product Information</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update me with the status of this issue.</p>

<p>Hi Regile,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer the questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) No. When I open a new doc in Word, it's doesn't occur. But, if I try to save that new doc in OneDrive folder, the login is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) No. When I use other local folder in my computer, the problem doesn't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I didn't make any changes. I think te computer updated automatically and the problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Yes. The Office is activated.</p>
<p>

<p>I appreciate your patience. Kindly check if you're using the same Microsoft account in your Office apps (specifically Word) and OneDrive. This issue usually happens when you're using a different account in Office and OneDrive. If you're not sure of the Microsoft
 account you're using in OneDrive, you may unlink your account then login again. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the OneDrive icon in the Taskbar.</li><li>Choose Settings.</li><li>Go to Account tab &gt; Under OneDrive, select Unlink account.</li><li>Re-add your account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the same Microsoft account for both Office and OneDrive, I suggest that you use our in-app support for in-depth assistance. We have a dedicated support handling OneDrive issues/concerns. To do this, sign in to OneDrive.com from any browser
 &gt; Click the ? help icon on the top banner of the page and select Email OneDrive support. Submit your question and follow the prompts to request support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, feel free to message us again.</p>

<h2>            Attachments disappear in email chain</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am using Office 365 Outlook.</p>
<p>After replying to an email containing an attachment, I can no longer view the attachment. I have tried setting the inbox to show individual messages, not as a conversation (by going to Inbox, filter, show as, messages), but it still seems to be keeping the
 messages in a conversation (for example, the email with the attachment that has gone missing shows up in the email chain, but when I scroll down to the date it was received, it is missing.</p>
<p>Can you please tell me the best way to resolve this?</p>

<p><span>Hi EKel89,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you mean that after you reply an email with an attachment and then the attachment will be missing? Could you find the attachment in the initial
 email when the sender sent the email to you?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you find the attachment in Outlook Web App (If you are using Office 365 account)?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please provide the detailed version of your Outlook for us to further investigate. Please go File &gt; Office Account &gt; Product Information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            Reinstall Office 2013</h2>
                    I know that Microsoft are pushing users to use Office 365 instead of regular Office 2013, but I would rather use Office 2013. Is there anyway that if I install Office 2013 I can reinstall it if I need to (rebuild computer or new computer)?

    <title>SharePoint Online Modern Lists Add Attachments link missing on Add - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philip caldwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Online Modern Lists Add Attachments link missing on Add</h2>
                    Today, when my users or myself add an item to a list using the Modern List experience, the link to add attachments is missing. &nbsp;It is there when Changing a list item. &nbsp;This needs to be fixed asap. &nbsp;Otherwise, I have to either go thru my tenancy and switch
 all the lists to default to the classic experience or do it at the tenant level. &nbsp;Why was such a buggy interface rolled out. &nbsp;It seem not really ready for prime-time.

I've been having this exact same error about one particular tab or section within a notebook. &nbsp;Copying that tab and deleting the old one fixes the sync error... for a while. &nbsp;It always returns. &nbsp;This section is for a note-intensive class, so for the last few

<p><span>Hi JWK010,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the steps below to reset your notebook that won’t sync and check if the issue occurs:</span></p>
<p><span>If the notebook that contains the problematic section is stored on OneDrive for business or SharePoint Online, try opening the problematic section in OneNote Online. This can help determine if the problem is caused by the server or by your OneNote
 application</span></p>
<ol>
<li>In your OneNote application, choose<strong> File </strong>&gt; <strong>Info</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the URL shown below the name of the affected notebook, and choose Copy.</li><li>In your web browser, click inside the address box, and press Ctrl+V to paste the copied URL.</li><li>Press Enter to load the notebook in OneNote Online.</li><li>Find the problematic section and click to open it.</li></ol>
<p><span>If the notebook loads successfully in your browser, the problem may be caused by your desktop version of OneNote application. Closing and re-opening the notebook usually clears and successfully resets the connection. Please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>

    <title>Outlook for Mac 2011 will not use Kerberos authentication - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard turner - rea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2011 will not use Kerberos authentication</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
We want to roll out Outlook 2011 Mac, version 14.1.3, and we have found on our testing Mac that it refuses to connect to the Exchange 2010 server using Kerberos. The error message says "This Exchange server does not use Kerberos authentication. Click OK to
 turn off Kerberos authentication for the account".<br />
<br />
I have confirmed with our Exchange admin that service pack 1 has been applied to the Exchange server and the servers that hold the mailbox stores. When he configured Outlook on his PC to use Kerberos, there are no errors and everything works successfully for
 him.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions for resolving this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I accessed it a few days ago, it is a personal account. I went to access it on my phone and it said to re-enter my password then said 'we think someone may be using your account'. It then gave me the option to have an email or text to my old details (wish
 I'd updated them but only changed recently). When I ticked the box saying I don't have these any more. I then had to fill in the security form. I've filled this in multiple times with correct details, using both my phone and work laptop, but each time it has
 said 'recovery failed'. Both are new but all my devices are new as I've recently changed jobs. The last one said it was final and I could open a new account but I need the emails in my current account. I've had it for about 20 years I imagine and there are
 thousands of emails in there. It is making me really stressed and has really ruined my Christmas break. There is no contact number or actual person to email for support or I would prove I am who I say I am.</p>
<p>Please help me.</p>
<p>Eve</p>

            <p>Thanks Kem, but the only thing they could tell me was to fill in the form again. They were no use whatsoever. Looks like I am never getting back into my hotmail account that I have had pretty much since hotmail began. This is causing me so much stress and
 upset that I am in floods of tears, but also ANGRY. How can it be that Microsoft teams can't talk to other Microsoft teams because security is so strict they don't know who those teams are? That's what the chat responder told me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not the secret service, and the security protocols certainly &nbsp;cannot be infallible if a genuine user cannot access their own personal information. Not even to be able to close down a live account that is currently receiving more personal information
 that they are now unable to access. I literally don't know what on earth I can do except keep filling in the form and getting it rejected. I will never, ever use microsoft again unless forced to. I cannot believe such a large company can be so totally, utterly
 useless and uncaring about its consumers. I NEED ACCESS TO MY EMAILS. I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME. I said I could supply ID, the details that were set up for my security (even though I can't access them), whatever they wanted but he couldn't do a thing. What
 on earth is the point of the chat.</p>

    <title>ActiveSync&#47;MS My Phone deleted my contacts&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hurre84  say:</h3>
<h2>            ActiveSync&#47;MS My Phone deleted my contacts&#33;</h2>
                    Im so tired of this worthless ActiveSync or Windows Mobile Device Center ____ (what is the difference anyway?). I have had both installed for a while b/c there is no simple/clean option with a windows phone. I have been trying to backup my contacts to
 my PC but it so non-sensical, there is no save my contacts to a excel sheet button, or similar, anywhere easy to find?
<br />
Today I downloaded MS My Phone in hopes that it could do it for me instead, however it complained that I had a exchange server sync running and told me to uncheck its sync contacts option in order to send them to my MS My Phone instead. I did this and it deleted
 every single one of my contacts!? And now there is nothing, nothing to sync to MS My Phone..<br />
What is wrong with this software Microsoft? Are the developers for different apps aware of each other, is there any collaboration between them? Is there any research done to figure out what the basic functions (copy contacts) most users need and how to make
 them easily available?<br />
<br />
Can I get my contacts back? Can I back them up to my computer with a click somewhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Hi Johan,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear about your frustration with Active Sync, WMDC, and Microsoft My Phone.&nbsp; As a design decision, Microsoft My Phone will not sync contacts, calendar, tasks, or other data if the software detects that a WMDC or Active Sync connection is set up
 on the device.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In order to get your contacts back, open the My Phone application and uncheck those data types (Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, Text Messages) from the Sync Options screen.&nbsp; You will then need to resync your phone with WMDC or Active Sync.<br />
<br />
There is a big difference between Active Sync and WMDC.&nbsp; The former (Active Sync, or sometimes referred to as EAS) allows your phone to synchronize certain data types (Email, Contacts, Calendar, and Tasks) over the air to an Exchanged based email server.&nbsp; The
 later (WMDC) will sync those data types through a tethered connection between your phone and your PC.&nbsp; For more information on EAS and WMDC, I suggest using one of those forums or searching online using your search engine of choice.<br />
<br />
Richie Weldon

            Actually there are two types of ActiveSync syncing that can be performed on a windows mobile device.<br />
<br />
</span>&nbsp; <br />
If you sync between a personal computer and a windows mobile device you'll connect the windows mobile device to the computer via USB&nbsp; cable (or via Bluetooth connection).&nbsp; If the computer runs:
<ul>
<li>Vista or Windows 7: you'll install Windows Mobile Device Center to the computer, set up a partnership and sync your data;
</li><li>XP: you'll install ActiveSync to the computer, set up a partnership and sync your data
</li></ul>
If you sync Contacts, Appointments and Tasks between a personal computer and a Windows phone, you can also sync this data to My Phone.<br />
</span>:<br />
Another type of sync occurs between an Exchange Server and a windows mobile device.&nbsp; In this instance, you sync via wireless connection to an Exchange Server to sync Contacts, Appointments and Tasks.&nbsp; If you sync this data from an Exchange Server, the assumption
 is that the Exchange Server and the data on the server does not "belong" to you (since most of the time this is a work-related arrangement).&nbsp; When you end that partnership, the data is removed from your device because it never belonged to you.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you sync to an Exchange Server, you can still sync to your computer (as described in number 1 above), but you will not be allowed to sync any Contacts, Appointments and Tasks that are stored locally on your computer.&nbsp; If you sync to an Exchange Server, you
 will not be able to sync Contacts, Appointments and Tasks to My Phone. <br />
<br />
It sounds like you sync to an Exchange Server.&nbsp; You can back up the Contacts, Appointments and Tasks that are on your windows phone to your computer by copying the PIM.vol file from the root directory of the windows phone to your computer, but you will not
 be able to do anything with the data (it is not importable to Excel or viewable by any other application).&nbsp; If you terminate the exchange server partnership the data will be removed from your windows phone, but then you could copy the PIM.Vol file back to
 your phone to restore the data back to the phone.<br />

            Yeah, Activesync is completely ridiculous.&nbsp; Last time I tried to sync my phone with a new computer, as many people have already experienced, it deleted all of my contacts, replacing the phones contacts with the empty outlook folder.&nbsp; I was able to restore
 the phone that time since I had another backup on another computer.&nbsp; So when I had to do a system restore on my computer (with a backup) I made sure that when I went to sync the phone up that the contacts were not to be sync'd&nbsp; until I chose the option "If
 there is a conflict, Replace with item on Device".&nbsp; Tried this several times using "tasks" and other less important things until I was sure that the program was doing what I wanted and guess what?&nbsp; When I went to sync the contacts, it erased all of them. 9
 years worth of contacts and now they're all gone after I did everything that I possibly could to prevent this.&nbsp; I figured that there would be a backup of my .pst file somwhere in "my backup" folder after

Hi venaka, <br />
<br />
I believe that Google Sync using an Exchange Active Sync connection for synchronizing data from your device to their service.&nbsp; Because of this, Microsoft My Phone will not be able to be used for synchronizing certain data types (contacts, calendar, tasks).&nbsp;
 However, you still will be able to synchronize text messages, pictures, videos, and music with Microsoft My Phone regardless if you're using Google Sync.<br />

            I am so sorry to hear what happened to you I just had the same thing happen to me. Microsoft really gets to me. I do not trust them at all and never have. The first time I got a program from them and found out I could only use it once, could not share,
 and I had to install just their programs and it had to have their "outlook" did it for me. You have to have their passport to do anything or “lol”&nbsp; go anywhere. What nerve these so-called geniuses have. They may as well just say the Internet in our property
 and we are in charge of who goes where.&nbsp; In my opinion none of them has any common sense because they create elaborate programs with no thought of any other situation happening than that of you and your computer being in perfect working order and no variables
 exist. They of the mind set that if you do not have the state of the art you should just stroll down to the store and buy it. Most Americans cannot do that. Mankind is just too selfish and greedy to share. Excuse me Microsoft, I know share is a dirty word
 to you. We each not only have to get our piece but take more than we need. My grandma used to say if u haven't anything to give to another give them a smile.

            Just the same happened to me this morning, to be honest I think it happened a few years back as well I just forgot about it and had a backup at the time.
<div>I agree though with the fact that the sync rules is totally screwed up. lets think about this??? you have been syncing for a few years, all your contacts is in your phone and you ONLY back them up in Outlook to keep a safe backup (thinking people use their
 phones more than outlook to call their friends)</div>
<div>Then you change your old laptop with a new one, fires up windows sync and your presented with only ONE question - - &nbsp;will you delete your old computer from the sync list??? - OFF CAUSE I will - I do not have that old&nbsp;piece&nbsp;of S... anymore so go ahead.....
 &nbsp;Now the&nbsp;beauty&nbsp;of&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;comes into play - - &nbsp;lets take this blank computer with the empty contacts list and replace the phones extended list with this empty one...??? yes that makes&nbsp;sense?? and lets NOT ask if this is what the paying customer wants. ???</div>
<div>Then I&nbsp;thought.... Lets be smart I DID make a backup on MyPhone. I just go and sync my phone on the net? &nbsp;BIG mistake... since the new wiped outlook phonebook is the latest on it takes priority and now I have wiped my backup....&nbsp;</div>
<div>I LOVE MICROSOFT</div>
<div><br />
<div>I simply can not comprehend the lack of info and&nbsp;transparency&nbsp;to the end user, it is a big and&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;piece&nbsp;of software and I DO like the way you can save a lot of&nbsp;useful&nbsp;information in the contacts folder just do not really means that much if it delete
 it all "by mistake"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another well thought out feature of Outlook Contacts is the lack of recognizing duplicates. Being Danish working in an English speaking company has given me some&nbsp;grief&nbsp;as well. Having a Danish language phone and English Outlook or vise versa is a&nbsp;disaster.
 Outlook then call Contact "Kontakter" and&nbsp;everything&nbsp;is duplicated. For some strange reason&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;then&nbsp;decide&nbsp;to ad a little square in a&nbsp;column&nbsp;I do not know what means in the contact or Kontakt database and all contacts is then regarded different all
 though all data is the same? if you go in and do the search for duplicates it will not highlight any even though the name, number, email ECT is&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;the same?? Then you end up with a&nbsp;phone-book with all duplicates (having app 500-600 contacts in my phone
 makes this a VERY large phone list on over a 1000 contacts???)&nbsp;</div>

<div>I think I just bought my last Windows Phone and I will only use Windows at work and for stuff where it is impossible to use another OS.</div>

<p><span><span>I would like to understand what is the design decision, Microsoft My Phone will not sync contacts, calendar, tasks, or other data if the software detects
 that a WMDC or Active Sync connection is set up on the device. I have been researching a problem I have had with Microsoft My Phone deleting my contacts on my phone. Trying to get the contacts from back from Microsoft My Phone through sync aways fails. Contacts’
 being deleted seems to be an issue with Active Sync, WMDC, and Microsoft My Phone. Contacts are probably the most precious item on a mobile device and having them deleted through human or application error is probably the worse thing that could happen. Snyc
 needs to be bullet proof and recoverable in the event of a problem. Why has not this been given more of a priority over the years? Why is there not more options that work together, if there are constraints that users need to understand, Microsoft has not spend
 enough time explaining these constraints before there are user problems. Too many users have lost information and time, leading to frustration and lack of trust. Having multiple computers and multiple devices and multiple methods and multiple sources of contact
 choices. I don’t need more choices; I need choices that are bullet proof, and recoverable and flexible in the event of a problem.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Continuous Malware detection...</h2>
                    For the past one week windows defender runs continuously on the background and keeps showing the message "windows defender has found a malware and removing it". This message pops once in a minute&nbsp;in my laptop and since then my laptop's exhaust feels like
 a chimney. It literally burns and temperature is so high that you cant touch the exhaust. Charge used to last for almost 2 hours and now not even for 30 mins.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d4daaf6-8f89-43c5-97f3-15ce1a619987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d4daaf6-8f89-43c5-97f3-15ce1a619987" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bea086f-93a8-447d-bc09-00f1df30c2a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bea086f-93a8-447d-bc09-00f1df30c2a5" /></a>

<h2>            Where did IE 11 go after last night - March 15th&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft pushed an update for Windows 10 yesterday (my laptop says it did anyway). When I booted my system this morning, it ran a repair on my C: drive which took forever and then when Windows finally booted up, the system locked up completely.&nbsp;I couldn't
 even perform a normal shutdown so I had to hold the power button down. After I restarted, Windows finally seemed to boot normally but IE is gone. I can't even find the exe file for it. Edge works but QuickBooks won't work with Edge. I have Chrome and Firefox
 but have been using IE 11 a lot more. I don't know if anything else was trashed in the process which worries me. I know I can do a reinstall of Windows but I just rebuilt this laptop in January and had to go through the pain of reinstalling all my applications,
 etc. and I really don't relish the idea of doing this again.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what happened and how I might fix it?</p>

<h2>            Excel crashes continuously on galaxy tab s3</h2>
                    <p>Since Excel has been updated to version 16.0.8730.2050, and now also with the latest update 16.0.8827.2054 Excel on galaxy tab s3 with Android 7.0 has become unusable, as soon as you try to enter a text field crashes causing reboot of the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the same file and the same versions of Excel 16.0.8730.2050 and 16.0.8827.2054, it works perfectly on LG G6 with Android 7.0 and an old samsung galaxy tab A with s-pen of 2015 with android 7.1.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an office 365 customer and it's been a month since I've been able to use Excel on the tab, when I used it on a daily basis, you're making a big deal of trouble.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue you are experiencing may have something to do with the app itself or with the device you are using. Since you mentioned that Excel is working fine on a different device given that the version of Excel and the device are just the same, it is possible
 that this is a compatibility issue. However, we need to perform some troubleshooting steps to isolate what's causing the issue. That being said, we advise uninstalling the Excel app on your device and reinstall it again. Once done, check if you will still
 experience the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the result for further assistance.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>already done all these operations when the problem started about 1 month ago, when I contacted the Italian assistance service ia email.<br />
<br />
I repeat Excel also worked on galaxy tab s3 before the update 16.0.8730.2050<br />
<br />
it is absurd that it now works on a smartphone and on a much older and less powerful tablet (galaxy tab at 2015) and does not work on the galaxy tab s3 (2017)</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect to internet, Dns server May be experiencing problems</h2>
                    Signal is fine and my other computer connects just fine but I keep getting "Can't display webpage" no matter what web page. When I click on Diagnosis connection problem&nbsp;it says contact your network administrator&nbsp; DNS server may be experiencing problems.
 Then when I troubleshoot is says DNS might be unavailable. I got rid of all ad ons, and flushed the DNS cache but still not connection. My internet provider is working just fine as it is working on this computer.

<p>That doesn't mean that it is correctly set on the other computer. In any <br />
way, it doesn't look like an IE problem. IE is not doing DNS.</p>

    <title>Unable to Update Windows 10 Insider Preview on Virtual Machine - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to Update Windows 10 Insider Preview on Virtual Machine</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello My Virtual Machine (Parallels) installed versions of Windows 10 will no longer update. They get stuck somewhere during the update process and end up rolling themselves back to the installed version. 11099 is the version is is stuck on. Then I went
 back to a saved backup which is 10547 and it also will not receive the new Fast Ring updates to 14xxx versions of the Windows Insider Preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this and how do I get these Windows 10 VM to take the update.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sounds like a problem I had with an earlier build.&nbsp; My workaround was to remove all printer support before doing the update (since there were some clues in the Event log which pointed to registry entries that made that tack look plausible.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>
