<h3> begley.dr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Export recent activity</h2>
                    <p>How can I export the list of recent activity that appears in the security and privacy section under recent activity for my personal outlook account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see&nbsp;the activities&nbsp;and it nicely displays if my account logon was successful or not. I can expand each item to see the details of the activity&nbsp;but it takes forever to&nbsp;expand each item, expand whats under it, and view the details of each one individually.
 And since it stores alot of activity I have to manually go to the next page and next page, etc and do the same until I find what I am looking for.&nbsp;I need to be able to export all the activity that is available&nbsp; so I can easily and efficiently search through
 it. I cannot find a way to do this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: I want to see when someone attempted to log into my account from a certain IP address. It took me 20 minutes of hunting and pecking through each activity item before I found the first instance.......then another 10 minutes to get through the rest
 of the activity to determine that someone has been trying to (unsuccessfully) access my account from an IP address that belongs to my workplace, during times I was not at my workplace. Its 2016, there has to be a more efficient way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas on how I can export this activity?</p>

</p><p>We're currently validating if this is happening on other users, but upon checking if there's an&nbsp;ongoing issue with launching the Skype on Microsoft Lumia 550 mobile phone, we currently have none. However, to further investigate the issue, please provide
 the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When launching Skype, is there an error message?</li><li>What is happening when launching Skype? is it stuck in the sign in page, or it shows a blank page?</li><li>What is the exact version of your Windows phone.</li><li>When did the issue happened? after updating Skype or etc?</li><li>Have you tried using a different Windows phone device and check if the same issue happens?</li></ul>

<h2>            How do I open saved groups of tabs in favorites&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>I saved a group of tabs per the help directions.</span></p>
<p><span>I then tried to reopen the same group of tabs per help directions.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>The pages do not open individually.&nbsp; Just the folder I saved them in opens.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>What is wrong?&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>How do I open a saved group of tabs in favorites?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how they are listed:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Favorites</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Favorites Groups</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Groups of Saved Tabs</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Groups of Saved Tabs</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Folders</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Folders</span></p>
<p><span>-----------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><u><span>How do I save a group of tabs?</span></u></p>
<p><span>To save a group of tabs, click the
</span><span>Favorites</span><span> button, click the arrow next to the
</span><span>Add to Favorites</span><span> button, and then click
</span><span>Add Current Tabs to Favorites</span><span>. Give the tab group a name, and then click
</span><span>Add</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;How do I open a group of tabs that I've saved?</span></span></p>
<p><span>Click the
</span><span>Favorites</span><span> button and then click the folder that you want to open. Click the arrow to the right of the folder name
. All of the webpages will open on separate tabs. When you open a group of tabs in this way, Internet Explorer groups those tabs by displaying a color band at the top the tabs.

<h2>            One Note Capacity</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I use OneNote at work a lot....I was wondering if there was a limit to the amount of sections/pages/etc. that could be placed in OneNote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not been able to find this information anywhere. I don't use it with the email transfer feature from Outlook but instead use it like a note book for how to do things in our computer system and general information.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Agree with Rena Yu.</p>
<p>To give you an idea, my biggest notebook has 1277 pages (all of them A4 with templates, some of them with pictures, some of them with video or audio recording), and it works smoothly.</p>
<p>I have 4 main notebooks open simultaneously (+ some other smallers), with the current one having 875 pages.</p>
<p>I try to create a new notebook, every 9 month (or 1000 pages), because its quicker to re-open a smaller notebook in another device (or after a fresh install), than a heavy notebook. Also, if you have synch issues, one troubleshooting step may lead you to
 close your notebook, so again, when reopening it, it's better to keep the number of pages "low".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            Tips for upgrading to Windows 10 and navigating through any issues you may encounter</h2>
                    Hello, as a person who has been testing Windows 10, I want to share my&nbsp;tips and suggestions for getting around issues that one may face at any time whether that be during the upgrade process itself or after the upgrade has completed and you are test driving
 Windows 10. For anyone who may&nbsp;be using a build of Windows 10 whether it be the latest build which does not have the watermark and expiration date or an older build and are having problems, try the insider quest in which you are asked to connect to chat with
 a Microsoft tech to try and solve the problem via trying different troubleshooting steps. If this does not work or you just want things to work as you feel they should, restore your backup which you should have made right after you installed whatever build
 of Windows 10 you installed. This method of getting things back working the way they should has proven to be very successful for me. While I have had to do this time and time again for each build starting with build 1

<h2>            font in Bing typing bar has suddenly become too small</h2>
                    the font in my Bing typing bar has suddenly become too small. I found, within the system, a box for this purpose, however, when I set the font-scale to a larger one, a notice appears in red saying that font size cannot be changed. My question, of course,
 upon reading that is: why have the feature there, if its purpose cannot be utilized? I've tried everything else I can think of.&nbsp;

 the password (when necessary) the Zune tries, but can't connect. Any suggestions?</div>

            <p>Hello Mark3785,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this kind of issue, I would advise you to try in another Wifi zone if possible to see if it works somewhere else. If it works, I would advise you to check the settings of your Wifi. You need a &nbsp;802.11b or 802.11g wireless network.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In which country do you live?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't work in another Wifi zone, I would advise you to hard reset your Zune player by following the last step of this link :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Trouble with bookmarks and formulas in MS Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken_1979  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble with bookmarks and formulas in MS Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I work for a research institution in the finance department, specifically in the&nbsp; 3rd party funding department.&nbsp; I am responsible for a very large project</p>
<p>which has 16 external partners.&nbsp; Each partner must prepare a proof for our financial backer showing how the funds were spent.&nbsp; The form must be sent to all of our partners.&nbsp; The problem is neither Excel nor Word are exactly suited to our needs.&nbsp; The form
 has a lot of text (think a tax form).&nbsp; The form must fit on standard sized paper and have different sized tables on one sheet (which is why I can't use excel, no merging cells won't work as it won't make standard sized tables).&nbsp; So when I try to set up a table
 in Word I keep having the following problems:<br />
1) The table won't calculate correctly.&nbsp; I get a "syntax error".&nbsp; What's extra frustrating is sometimes it works, some times I get the error.&nbsp; It's really irritating.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2).&nbsp; When I try to transfer data from one table to another, I set up a formula and reference a bookmark.&nbsp; Then randomly Word deletes the bookmarks?&nbsp; That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.</p>
<p>I am seriously at my rope's end.&nbsp; I need to know how to set up a document in excel on a standard size piece of paper that would look something like this:</p>
<p>Table 1: 3x4</p>
<p>Table 2: 5x4</p>
<p>Table 3 4x4</p>
<p>Table4 8x18</p>
<p>Table 5 8x18</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or tell me how to set it up in word so that the formulas don't screw up at random, the table auto calculates (a macro would be super), and for Christ's sake the bookmarks don't disappear on me.&nbsp; Seriously microsoft you find ways to make my blood pressure
 rise every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for the tip.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am still no closer to solving my problem.&nbsp; I check the Maths file.&nbsp; First of all some things like the union opeator don't work at all, I get a syntax error.&nbsp; Ridiculous!&nbsp; I had my document open and the command fields
 open at the same time.&nbsp; There is no way I entered it wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then redid all the formulas and it calculates with an error message.&nbsp; Ridiculous!!&nbsp; I have sanitized a copy of the document so that I can keep it confidential.&nbsp; I had to translate it into English
 as the original was in German, which is fine as I have English partners as well.&nbsp; Can you or someone have a look at this?&nbsp; Essentially what is the Personnel Costs to be added up and entered into table 1 from the two Personnel tables on page two and I want
 the FTE values to be added up and entered from the two tables into table 2.&nbsp; Finally I need the value from column 2 table 1 to be forwarded to table 3.&nbsp; Then I need it to be subtracted from the sum of the next two boxes.&nbsp; I have entered the formulas and nonetheless
 it screws up in typical microsoft fashion.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now how in the world do I upload a document?&nbsp; Is microsoft really so stupid as to not provide this opportunity so I can show exactly what I am doing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Without knowing what formulae you're trying to use or under what circumstances they mis-behave, it's hard to give specific advice. That said, if bookmarks are being deleted, that suggests something is being done to cause it (they are easily deleted by accident)&nbsp;-
 Word doesn't just delete them of its own accord.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to see how to do a wide range of calculations in Word, check out my Microsoft Word Field Maths Tutorial, at:<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know it's been some time but I recently had the same problem in word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several tables in word document in which I calculate some values, next one</p>
<p>depending on one or more previous values in different tables, i.e. averages, sums,</p>
<p>multiplications, percentage and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered my mistake - I tried to add bookmarks to specific fields of a table (like 'measurment1'</p>
<p>and 'measurment2') instead of adding bookmark to whole table (like 'measurements') and then use</p>
<p>reference to a cell like 'measurements b2' (I simply misunderstood online tutorial).</p>
<p>Seems like I was overriding my own bookmarks and breaking formulas by this.</p>
<p>Another thing is that word keeps deleting space characters between "measurements" and "b2"</p>
<p>and that also breaks formula. Reopening it and adding spaces fixes this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 6 hours my document works for 20 minutes;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well, better late then never, hope this helps anyone else but me.</p>

Giorgosstn17pardalos</a>. Can we the exact model of it? Note that in most cases, it is normal for your&nbsp;phone to feel warm. For example, when you are using multiple high-performing apps, listening to music for an extended time, or when it is charging. But to
 avoid it getting warm and to protect itself, try minimizing apps and functions you are using at any one time. Check if there are&nbsp;any pending software update or app updates. You may also try restarting the device and see if that makes any difference. We'll
 wait for your reply.</p>

    <title>What we Expect about Windows 10 on the Interface, Design, and other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diego kant  say:</h3>
<h2>            What we Expect about Windows 10 on the Interface, Design, and other things..</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;<strong>Hello All Insiders</strong>, and also Everyone :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I had the idea to talk with us about <em>What we Expect About Windows 10</em> when it Releases.. whenever it does, about the
<strong>Design, User Interface and these things</strong>.. Lot of us expect different kind of things, like waiting to add features, or remove them, or also change and modify lot of things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Most of us may doesn't expect anything, but I want to share my Ideas about What Windows 10 should get, remove, improve, and change. starring with the..
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Personalization and User Experience on Windows</strong><strong>. </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lot of us knows that one of the Biggest changes on Windows is the <strong>System Interface
</strong>(UI) and its one of all these things people like, but also dislike One of these things its the Metro interface which was added with Windows Developer Preview. Most of people
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">doesn't</span> like it because wasn't so useful for PC's which hasn't a Touch Screen, which was something Microsoft forgot about, and also I think It should get better, for the use of all the ways possible, like Mouse
 Keyboard, Touch, Voice, Smart Moving recognition (Useful for people with great <strong>
HD</strong> Cameras, or Kinects), and also a Xbox Control. The Idea of the Start Screen was a merge between the Windows Phone 7.5 and 8 Start Screens, and a little apport from the Xbox Dashboard, but most of people dislike it, in the was wasn't so useful in
 non-touchscreens. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In My Opinion Microsoft Should merge more the Xbox One Dashboard with the New Start Screen, and also a little with the Start Menu, adding more useful Tiles, and removing the word "Start Screen" Replacing it with you Microsoft Account tag and replacing the
 actual Microsoft Account tag (where you can Find Lock, Change Picture, and Sign Out) with the Windows Flag and the Icons for Turn Off, Search and Notifications, I mean, think about it, how many people would not like to run something on their computers which
 would looks like an Xbox? (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>yes I know lot of people may doesn't because the may doesn't like Xbox or Prefer PlayStation but still)</em></span> and replacing the horrible
<strong>Squared Notifications</strong>, by the ones like they appears on the Xbox One, like when you get a new Achievement, or a message on Skype, using the "<strong>Home</strong>" key to access easily to it, or the XBOX Key from an Xbox Controller, or the
 Hand or Mouse just clicking it, would it be amazing no? a amazing combination from Xbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing Microsoft should do its make the <strong>Notifications Area </strong>
better, Actually (on <em>Build 9879</em>) the Notifications area its so Empty, and its only good when there's notifications, and these things, but would be a good thing Idea to merge some of the things that appears on the Charm bars there, like "Mute Notifications"
 (and let you decide how many).</p>
<p>Smart Notifications (to get only from some apps), (a link to get on the "Settings" app directly to the Notifications section, and also an area to decide if you want to display the System Tray outside of the Taskbar or inside the Notifications Area, would
 it be amazing no? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft also shouldn't let people<strong> modify where they want the System icons on</strong>, because lot of people
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">mess up </span>with that, and some apps fills so much the System tray the System icons sometimes gets confused with the, One of the Important things on Windows which its also the best things that any OS can replace or
 copy its the Windows Taskbar, useful for everything, everyone, but since Windows 8 came, its loosing lot of things, and here its my ideas of what to Add, or remove to the..</p>
<p>
</p><p>-<strong>Taskbar</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Starring by (<strong>On Metro Apps</strong>), To convert the Taskbar into the Metro Menus (you know.. on Windows 8/8.1 these menus which appears on bottom and sometimes on topmost of the Screen while on Metro apps, from right-clicking the app, or just swiping,
 and make the taskbar the new Menu for them, in the way they would replace the whole buttons and everything in the taskbar, and make them all the options for the apps, like on Camera App, the "Switch camera" option, and these things, and since the menu its
 used, the switch back to taskbar with everything on it like it was before making the menu appear. Also replace the actual Search Button, and put it on the final of the taskbar, the button for the "Show Desktop/fade desktop" would now be the "time", which would
 display a clock in a side, with time and everything about time and date, if you click it, would display the calendar like it does when you click the clock, and there would be a button for display the desktop, and also for Metro Apps, as everyone knows when
 you open a Metro App, it displays the horrible square for the thumbnail on the taskbar, and then blank space around it, they should be more like fill the whole Button with the color the Publisher selects.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another Important thing lot of us Missed on Windows was the Start Menu and not talking the actual one, We're talking about the
<strong>Win7 Start Menu</strong>, which now its an hybrid merging Windows 7 with 8 about the Menu, there is where i want to go, The Start Menu (like I would do it), Lets take the Actual Windows 10 Menu (<em>Build 9879</em>), and lets replace the "All Apps"
 button, taking half of it, and making the another side (the one in opposite way to the arrow) to another menu I'd call "All Tiles", where the Start Menu would expand a little more, showing all tiles from where we can drop them into the actual Metro Tiles side
 of the Start Menu, the <strong>Win7</strong> Menu would contain <strong>5 </strong>
<em>Recent apps</em>, <strong>5</strong>&nbsp;<em>Built-In apps</em>, and in the topmost the Account tag, where you can easily switch from users like Xbox One does when you switch user.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Lets talk about the Windows Intro, the Login Screen, and the Lock screen.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>-<strong>Intro</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>the Actual Windows Intro its the Metro Windows Flag, a little upper than the center, in light blue, with a "Loading" animation under it, in my Opinion, Windows Should Start Like
<strong>Xbox One </strong>Does, and also its like all Apple Devices does (iPhone, Mac..) centering the Windows Logo on White Color on the center (as I said, like<strong> Xbox One
</strong>does), or making an animation where the flag separates from lot of tiles, and making the 4 Windows flag ones keep on screen, than from the flag the flag moves saying next to it Windows), and then keep there 5 seconds, and then back to the Flag alone
 in the center.. <em>would that looks better</em>? </p>
<p>
</p><p>-<strong>Login Screen (Logon)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very important on Systems like Windows, where actually looks disgusting, in my opinion, For Multi-Accounting PCs the Default background should be a solid-black background, and then when you press a user, the background should changes to a
<strong>blurred version of the actual Background </strong>for the selected<strong> User</strong>, the Blurred background doesn't really needs the Aero App, can be easily a already blurred picture, and then when you succefully logger in, put the Normal background,
 the Taskbar appears from the bottom, and icons on the desktop fades on. In my Opinion this is how i'd do it like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-<strong>Lock Screen (from Windows 8/8.1)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>the Lock screen on Windows 8 was a good thing introduced and also missed, but can be even better, if the clock where on the center, on the bottom, like its already, but on the center, with the Date next to the clock (Like in
<em>Tetra Lock Screen </em>for <em>Windows Phone </em>it looks like) all the missed notifications would display down the date-time, without asking you for which ones you'd like to see, there icons can be clickable, and if you click them, the password screen
 will appears, after unlocking, the App you clicked on the lock screen of the missed event would automatically appears with the missed event.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>now lets talk about the Windows Explorer, Layouts of Windows and Metro-Windows, and Apps Windows miss.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-<strong>Explorer</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>we All know the Windows Explorer, some of us may experience it since XP, others from Vista, others from 7, or others doesn't know what Older versions of Windows Explorers was like, but we all know the Explorer is the only thing that never get worst on Windows,
 it always got better and better, but there's lot of things it keeps missing, or more to add, like the new HOME Section Microsoft just added, that Section, should display your Microsoft Devices connected or Active, like a Home Group, but this way, would it
 display's an example, a Windows Phone if its On, and if it has a Data Connection, Where you can move stuff, translate, or delete from, even if isn't connected to the PC, a Xbox One if its Online, to move or Install Games and move Music and stuff there, like
 Xbox One SmartGlass does, another PC if its Online, to move Stuff you want (Of course if both PC's are Online) and also install Programs, and ALSO if Both PC's has the same App Installed and the same Architecture, and lot of requirements more, to move a Window
 from one PC to Another, like WPM, from a Laptop, to a Desktop, without having to close it, or even restart it, Making the Home a Real HOME for Move Stuff Across ALL your Online Microsoft Devices.</p>
<p>there would also appears a tab for 5 (or more) recent stuff, and a tab for frequent stuff (like Music or Apps). on My PC a Tab for Libraries (Music, Pictures, Etc..) Inside these System Folders, an Icon for (if the App its installed) Launch the App (like
 on Music, it would Launch Xbox Music), a tab for CONECTED DEVICES, and a Tab for Disks (or USB's)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-<strong>Layouts</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Always changes the UI for Apps every time a new System Operative Releases, except for Windows 8 to 8.1, but as well its the same thing, but for Windows 10 Should be like an example, making, at least the Taskbar with Aero back, and Changing the
 Buttons for Close, Maximize/Restore and Minimize, and also adding a new one called Full Screen for resizable Apps like IE, and not changing the UI for the Metro Apps, making where the little thumbnail on the topmost of a window is, replacing it by the "Charm
 bars" new menu, and that same menu for Windows than inside has a "Menu bar", so there could be more space for the Windows, and when you click it, it will shows around the title bar (where buttons and these things are) the menu, and you can double click so
 it won't hide. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And Finally.. -<strong>Windows Apps </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft deleted lot of apps since the new "Metro Apps" were launched, but they should improve these Metro Apps and make them more stable, like Skype, the Windows Store, and lot more, and making ALL Devices able to have their own Desktop for run Desktop
 Apps, (like on a Surface RT, or on a Windows Phone) and making these apps even better.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so Guys this is one of all the things I except that should be added to Windows 10, What you think about it? Do were good ideas, or bad ideas on my Expects? If you Guys have interesting Ideas to add feel free to add them :)</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft needs to make Windows Better and we can make them open their eyes and see what users waits for.</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Comment what you think about Windows 10, what you expect, what you liked of my ideas, and what not, and also what I missed, or should change :)
</p>
<p>

            Another thing I would add would be to have progress bars or a percentage shown - either way, too often windows is doing something (such as downloading or installing an update) and as far as I can tell maybe the computer has locked up. &nbsp;I generally look
 to see if the hard drive light is flickering to ensure it's actually doing something and not just frozen. &nbsp;It would be better if there were some sort of progress indicator.

            Hi Adam,
<br />What happens when you try to add the account? Do you recieve any error messages? 
<br />
<br />If it's an office 365 business account, you can use SaRA to diagnose the problems.

            Hi Adam,
<br />
<br />
<br />I’m Independent Advisor willing to help you, I can understand how frustrating is when the product is not working as expected. 
<br />
<br />Do you receive any error adding the account? 
<br />What exact steps are you doing when adding the account?
<br />Can you attach some screenshots of the errors?
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
<br />Angel.

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, to isolate if the issue is related to your own Outlook Client, please try to configure your Office 365 account to another computer which doesn’t have problems at your convenience, and then see if it can make any difference. Please
 note, if your email account is Office 365 account, please directly use the email account and password to sign into Outlook Client and don’t use manually Setup feature, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, if it works on other computers, you can refer to Diane’s suggestion above &nbsp;to download and run SaRa. When you open it, please click Outlook &gt; I need help setting up my Office 365 email in Outlook. After that please see if it
 can help you to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the suggestions above don’t work, I’d like to collect some more information for the further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The version of your Outlook Client, please click File &gt; Office Account and then take a full screenshot about it to me.</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Did you receive any errors when you tried to configure your Office 365 account to Outlook? If so, please take a screenshot about the error to me.</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Please provide your Full Office 365 account ( No password) which can’t be configured to Outlook Client to me via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message (PM)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply and patience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the screenshots you provided, first the version of your Outlook Client is not the latest version, please try to update it to the latest one via File &gt; Office Account &gt; Update options &gt; Update Now in the Outlook Client, and
 then see if the issue disappears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, based on the error message you received, the problem is likely related to the Outlook .ost files, in this case, you can try to run Outlook data file repair and then check if it can make any difference. For your reference
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the date file repair doesn’t work for you, as you said you have configured some other accounts into the Outlook ( may be they are in the same profile). In this case, please try to create a new Outlook Profile and then directly use
 your Office 365 account and password to sign into the Outlook Client with new profile. After that please double check if you could configure it to the Outlook, for more details, please refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create an Outlook profile</a>.&nbsp; <strong><span>Please note, when you create the new profile, please don’t delete the old ones for preventing data loss, thanks.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists after you trying all the suggestions above, I’d like to collect the Autodiscover configurations of your Office 365 account, you can test it via
<a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/#&amp;&amp;5h0EH6NxCawN3VMXWlIbMlXyMx4i0xmUK4uLlI+J3fse1v4XpLFVel1dOB5Hepr+19YVlhm+0lRFB05+bl+bchafeURrJxYDtVRE4gYXkVIRnf1Y1fppLxpwfjbb3GX5Ds5oKgfmSSD5aDDEqjlRRuhY/B6Q2lyRpLFiaDAjlDnm5KrXW4kwAC8BmVdL4IiPGRSHexS9DPH7d98FgwH14Xl48Kg=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Adam,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply with patience.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the autodiscover file you provided, the autodiscover configuration of your Office 365 account is OK. And the blocked error you found in the test result, it just some normal errors in the test process, so you don't need worry about it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, as you have tried to repair and run SaRa in your own computer, and they are don't work for your problem. May I know have you tried to create a new Outlook Profile in the Outlook Client? If not, please refer to our previous talk to have a try and
 then directly use your Office 365 account and the password to sign in the Outlook&nbsp;with the new profile to see if the issue disappears.&nbsp; Please note when you create the new profile, please don't delete the old ones for preventing data loss, thanks.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that if you got any further updates, please feel free to let me know.<br />

<h2>            於Excel 2007如何為圖片加入公式</h2>
                    <p>於其他Excel版本，於其中一個工作表設立一系列圖片，設定OFFSET，MATCH公式後，將圖片複製到其他工作表內，選取該圖片，於公式列上可輸入=picture1 連結至原始系列圖片，圖片可隨着選取而改變。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>我於Excel2007建立同樣工作表，當選取圖片後，公式列內卻不能輸入任何資料，如果Excel2007沒有為圖片加入公式功能，請問應如何為圖片加入公式?</p>

<p>First of all, don't make the mistake I did and upgrade the 4700.&nbsp; It became almost unusable and has been sitting for the past 9 months unsed.&nbsp; Too bad because it was an absolute favorite device!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course if you do decide, make sure you save the ability to revert back (something I mistakenly did not do).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quickest way I can have you get rid of that "attention required" is to make the decision to hard reset and setup a new partnership.&nbsp; It should take care of the issue ... it did for me on one of my devices that was giving me the same message
 after I upgraded to 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just my thoughts....</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm happy to address your&nbsp;your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that when Hotmail migrated to Outlook.com, it&nbsp;only&nbsp;changed the&nbsp;interface&nbsp;of your&nbsp;mailbox which is why you retained your old email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to use an @outlook.com address to access your account, you can add it as one of your alias and set it as the primary email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have any other questions or concerns, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Brettf.cityservicevalcon.com，</p>
<p>We can help you remove the credit card only if it isn’t associated with any Office 365 subscription purchased from the official site. This means if you are paying an Office 365 subscription via a credit card A, please add a credit card B to pay for this
 subscription, then we can help you remove the credit card A.</p>
<p>When you finished that, please provide the information I asked for in the private message. To access the message, you can follow the steps below:<br />
a) Go to the your details section on the right side of the community site. <br />
b) Click Private messages. <br />
c) Click the subject title of the response to read the message. <br />
d) You can reply by using the form in this display. Click Submit Reply.</p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

 being sent.&nbsp; I moved all but one of those msgs to my draft folder prior to rebooting.&nbsp; One msg would not move because it had begun to send and could not be moved.&nbsp; The condition has remained for several days despite all efforts on my part.&nbsp; Thank you for any

<p>&nbsp;Under the Address Books tab, it shows my address book as MAPI and there is no designation for either internet or published calendars.&nbsp; My Outlook address book is not available when I access my e-mail directly from my internet provider.&nbsp; Is there a way to
 sync my addresses to both internet and Outlook?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to be dense but not sure how my account should be set up--POP vs MAPI and how to change the settings if necessary.&nbsp; Thx for your patience.</p>

            <p>Yes, Outlook is setup as POP3 account which is nothing but POP/SMTP.</p>
<p>Address book information is stored in the format as MAPI and is not the same as the Outlook connector (MAPI) account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contacts and calendar are synced only if the account is setup as Outlook connector (Live Account) or an Exchange account.

<h2>            Send&#47;Receive hangs in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi, can anyone help please?</p>
<p>I have Office 2010 on Windows 7 and my Outlook has just stopped receiving emails. When I hit send/receive it just hangs there and the progess bar sits at about 90%. The outgoing 'task' completes ok but the incoming just sits there 'processing' (forever!)
 I am using an IMAP account to get my Hotmail emails and have got the Hotmail connector ok. I have completely un-installed Office 2010 and the connector and re-installed both but it is still the same!</p>
<p>I can go into my hotmail account directly and everything is fine I can send and receive ok and I even get the tests I sent from Outlook ok.</p>
<p>It only happened after I tried to send a large jpeg!</p>
<p>Can anyone help please???</p>

            <div>How many accounts have you setup in Outlook? </div>
<div>Have you setup Hotmail using IMAP or MAPI (Outlook connector)?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try Outlook safe:</div>
<div>Click on Start &gt; All programs &gt; accessories &gt; run &gt; type ‘Outlook /safe’ without quotes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note: There is a space between Outlook and /.</div>
<div>If Outlook works as expected then disable the add-ins using the link below:</div>
