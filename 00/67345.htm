            Also, consider obtaining a user mode dump of the crash to see if any other modules are involved in the crash.
<br />
<br />You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.
<br />
<br /> If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as dump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file at the time taskhostw.exe crashes should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br /> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\taskhostw.exe]
<br /> "DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\
<br /> 00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00
<br />
<br />
<br /> After Host process for Windows Tasks (taskhostw.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>

<br />
<br />To stop the creation of the user mode dump files run the following registry file:
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />
<br />[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\taskhostw.exe]
<br />
<br />You can delete the C:\CrashDumps folder anytime.

            What are you using now ?<br />
A mouse that is good for one person is not good for another. This is<br />
partly due to the size of your hand, but also due to playing style ( 'claw' grip or<br />
'palm' grip ) and other software requirements for and how you your PC when<br />
not gaming.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, mouse acceleration is good for many applications as<br />
it reduces the need for a large mouse pad, but&nbsp; when playing fps games<br />
mouse acceleration is not such a good thing.<br />
Many Pro gamers use older mice (MS Intelli mouse) and other mice with<br />
'Optical' sensors rather than laser (Logitech MX510 &amp; MX518 )&nbsp; <br />
They may&nbsp; use low speed settings,&nbsp; but they also use very large<br />
mouse pads and make large sweeping movements while playing, but using<br />
one of these mice&nbsp; will not make you a pro gamer.<br />
Choice of mouse also depends in part on the games you play. CS does not have tanks (BF- BC&nbsp; as above) or Helicopters ( Just Cause 2) that need a high speed for quick turns.<br />
<br />
Basically - a lot of mice advertise very high dpi setting, up to 5000dpi. <br />
This speed is far higher than one needs for gaming. A mouse with a maximum speed of about 2000 is fast enough for most games (but I use about 3500dpi for quick tank turret turns), and for accuracy many fps gamers use speeds closer to 500, even less if playing
 as a sniper.<br />
You will see in the links at the bottom of this post that you don't need to spend<br />
a lot of money on a mouse for CS.<br />
<br />
The best thing to do is read reviews for various mice, an go to a shop where<br />
you can feel some of the mice.<br />
But I will say that the Razer Death Adder is very popular. <br />
The Logitech MX518 is also a good choice.<br />
I have been using Logitech for a long time. I've used MX510, <br />
G5 (If I knew what I know now when buying a G5 I would have bought an MX518) G500 (which I did not like the side button position on so only used it for one month. For this reason I would personally avoid any mouse with more than two side buttons as it can make
 griping the mouse awkward. ). <br />
I now have a second hand G9x which I like a lot. When I got the G9x I found that I am a 'claw' grip person (I have long fingers) but I had always thought I was a 'palm' grip person before. The G9x&nbsp; has a low profile and a small 'shell' option that works very
 well with finger control, but many people dislike the G9x for this reason. I'm not a serious online fps gamer, so I'm not concerned that the G9x<br />
is not recommended by 'Pro' gamers.<br />
<br />

            What mouse are you using ? Does the mouse have software that you can <br />
create mouse speed profiles in ?<br />
Does the mouse work well with other games ?<br />
If you are wanting to play CS with an old MS Intelli mouse like the pros do<br />
you should visit the forums dedicated to CS for details.<br />
<br />
I'm not really sure what you mean. I assume&nbsp; your cursor movement<br />
is too fast. This is the first time I've seen the commands you show, but -<br />
<br />
<span><span style="font-style: italic">-noforcemspd </span>-&nbsp; makes the game revert to desktop mouse speed .<br />
So if you are using mouse acceleration with&nbsp; your mouse desktop setting the<br />
second command may override the first.<br />
Equally, if your desktop mouse speed is higher than what you want in the <br />
game it may override the speed you set in the game.<br />
Using commands like this require a bit of experimentation. Maybe using<br />
noforcemaccel after noforcemspd&nbsp; may work better.<br />
</span><br />
Mouse acceleration is a good thing when in Windows but not<br />
so good when playing first person shooters because the cursor movement<br />
speeds up&nbsp; when you move the mouse quickly.<br />
<br />
If you are&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">not&nbsp;</span> using an old MS Intelli&nbsp; mouse or other mouse with no profiling<br />
software, and like us non pro gamers, use a mouse with&nbsp; buttons&nbsp; that can<br />
select different speeds while playing and has software with settings that can<br />
override Windows settings,&nbsp; then&nbsp; you should be able to make a profile for when you play CS&nbsp; that does not have mouse acceleration enabled.
<br />
The mouse software will then switch to this profile automatically when you launch CS.&nbsp;
<br />
For example I have a profile for Battlefield Bad Co with three different speed&nbsp; settings that I can change while playing the game. One is very slow (like the pros) for accurate aiming, the second is a little bit&nbsp; faster for running around
<br />
but still slow enough to be accurate, and the third is very fast so I can spin the tank turret quickly when driving a tank. Mouse acceleration is also off,<br />
but my standard desktop setting has mouse acceleration enabled.<br />
<br />
If when you say&nbsp; ' little bit smooth' you mean it is too slow or lags then there may be another problem. You could have a speck of dirt over the lens on the bottom of the mouse. Dirt spots on your mouse pad can also cause lag when the mouse runs over them.<br />
Software conflicts can cause lag as well.&nbsp; Sometimes lag can be cause by too<br />
high Anti-aliasing settings in a game, but that is doubtful in you situation as the<br />
GTX680 should have no problem at all running CS with maximum settings.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 not recognizing external drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinlambchops  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not recognizing external drives</h2>
                    <p>Custom PC build: Asus Prime B350 Plus Mobo, Ryzen 7 1700, WD 1TB Hard drive, Sandisk 120gb SSD, EVGA 1050 GPU, EVGA 600 watt powersupply.<br />
</p>
<p>Installed Windows 10, Installed motherboard driver(downloaded from Asus website). Can't seem to get my usb ports to read my external drives. The ports work because my mouse, keyboard, and wireless internet adapter work in the usb ports. Just not reading
 an external hard drive and a microSD card. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Checked device manager, no yellow exclamation point. Tried to update drivers and it comes back saying they are up to date.
<br />
<br />
2. Went into disk management, assigned a different drive letter. Still not working.<br />
<br />
3. Before I was able to see it in the folder next to my SSD and internal HD but then I was running out of ideas on what to do so I reformatted my whole computer. It's new so I didn't have much on it anyway. Now it won't even appear in "This PC" page. Before
 I was able to view it but not open it. <br />
<br />
4. I've tried two different hard drives. One is a WD 1tb external drive that I previously used on a MacBook air. Not sure if this has anything to do with it not reading. I have a lot of pictures and videos on this drive so I stopped messing around with it because
 I don't want to accidentally lose all my pictures. I also have a MicroSD card that I used in my GoPro that doesn't work either. I figured maybe since I used it on a Mac before it was causing the issue. Stuck it back into my gopro, reformatted the card and
 still have the same issue.<br />
<br />
Before I reformatted my computer I was able to see it in the "My PC" page, wasn't able to open it though. After I reformatted it, it doesn't even show up in that page. Potentially because I had a lot of different drivers installed before and maybe one of them
 helped. Not really sure. One thing I haven't tried is plugging it into another windows PC. I only have a MacBook air laptop. Please help, I've tried googling it and have tried almost everything people have suggested online. I built this computer for photo/video
 editing and it's frustrating because I can't even get the photos/videos onto the computer to edit them! Thank you in advance!</p>

            Booted in safe mode. MicroSD card appears in folders but when I click on it. Comes back with, "Please insert disk into (J:)" Same issue I was having even before I reformatted the computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In disk management it appears as Removable (J:) but directly under it it says No media. This was the microsd card. Plugged in my 1tb WD and it says Online. Healthy (Active. Primary Partition). The WD doesn't appear in my folders page and it doesn't allow me
 to assign a drive letter to it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Nothing happens when I plug in my drives. The light on my hard drive lights up and the computer beeps but no messages appear on my screen to open the folders or anything. I have no tried booting into a lunix live CD/USB. I am still new to computers so I am
 figuring out all this technical stuff as I go. I have tried all the usb ports. The ones in the back that go directly into mobo as well as the ones on the case itself. None seem to work.<br />
<br />
I guess my last two options are to check BIOS settings as well as try to boot into a lunix&nbsp;live CD/USB. Which im&nbsp;not really sure what that even is but I will google it right now!

<p>I've heard of some LED display having this issue. Have you tried all the TV's settings, to see if there's one that resolves the issue? Many TVs have a 'Game' setting, so see if that exists on your display.

<h2>            This computer is not running genuine Windows</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
PC working with windows 7.<br />
<br />
Started getting a popup window stating that "This computer is not running genuine Windows". &nbsp;I've been running windows on this machine for over two years so I thought it was a virus, but none of my five different virus scanners was able to detect it. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've been removing the window for about one month by ending the task with the Task Manager, while searching the internet for a way to get rid of this nuisance. &nbsp;Then a couple of days ago instead of using the Task Manager I X'ed out of the window. &nbsp;Now I see
 a message in the lower right of my screen stating, “This copy of Windows is not genuine”.<br />
<br />
Now the computer is starting to lose some functionality, like loading photos from a camera. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I called the Microsoft help line and they told me to enter the Product ID in the activation window, but there is no place for me to enter one there. &nbsp;They then told me to call Microsoft support. &nbsp;I called 31 times and the line was busy each time.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to try next, so here I am.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Sangeet,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your issue description I understand that, you are unable to install game, and getting&nbsp;isdone.dll
</span>error<span>. </span><span>I&nbsp;can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s follow these methods and check if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The issue, generally arise due to .DLL file corruption in Windows settings. So, in order to scan your system health, I would suggest you to run a System File Checker tool (SFC) scan to check for any files corruption:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows 8.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong><span>Windows key</span></strong> and
<strong><span>X</span></strong> at the same time.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Choose <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></strong> from the context menu.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the command prompt, type <strong>
<span>sfc /scannow</span></strong> and hit Enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Exit <strong><span>command prompt</span></strong>.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>For more information refer to this link: </span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>If after performing both steps issue persists t</span>ry to <strong>
perform clean boot</strong> and <strong>disable security software temporarily</strong> and then check to
<strong>install the game</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong><span>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disable anti-virus</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:&nbsp;<em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. <span>If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox One controllers are stressing me out like crazy, someone please give me a simple answer that I can understand in order to fix it &#40;which does not involve buying a new one&#41;</h2>
                    So I had to buy a new Xbox controller because my first one was ok, it just kept looking up with one of the D-pads. For example, if I'm playing a game like Slime Rancher, my character would look up, even though I never make it do so. I've been dealing with
 this problem for years. It's really stressing me out. Another example would be NBA 2K19. Whenever I shoot, it would make the meter thing, which controls the release, go all the way to very late. I've really been pissed off about this problem and really just
 want help. If anyone, mostly asking for Microsoft, to please answer this so I can try to fix it. I'm tired of having to deal with this for years. I bought a new Xbox controller, which is white, so I wouldn't have to deal with it. But guess what, it came back.
 So I beg of everyone, so please, give me a very simple response on how to fix it. I would very much appreciate it. The D-Pad that keeps acting this way is on the right, bottom one, that would be used to look around in video gam

<p>Hello Popeye,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. I understand you are having an issue with your controller drifting? Is this doing it on the new controller you got also? Have you tried
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
updating the controller</a>? Also, make sure the console itself is plugged directly into a wall outlet. This sounds like a silly troubleshooting step. But it does affect a lot if it isn't plugged in that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these and let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

    <title>Xbox Bricked after Microsoft mandatory update. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Bricked after Microsoft mandatory update.</h2>
                    <p><strong>I have condensed&nbsp;and modified the original post to make it less long and more readable.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like you guys pushed another update out. I had a similar problem the last time this happened but was able to work around it by resetting the xbox with the "keep games and apps" option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this time seems different. Last time it got stuck and failed partially during the last stage of the update process, this time it is stuck on the "preparing console" stage at 0 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the troubleshooting steps found at&nbsp;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However they were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a loyal customer for over 8 years now. This is not my Xbox malfunctioning, this is you forcing an update that breaks it. Part of me thinks this must be a way to force me to go out and buy a new one. I am heart broken and feeling helpless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot understand how it is acceptable to force us to pay for a 140 dollar repair or buy a new console simply because the new update you force out breaks our system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help. I need a work around that doesn't cost me a fortune.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, I don't want to give up on Microsoft, I don't want to give up on Xbox. But this is insanity, this is wrong, this is messed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT/Update:</strong> </p>
<p>I have tried all troubleshooting steps outlined at:</p>
<p>https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even went out, bought an new flash drive and tried updating offline with that just to see if there may have been a problem with the drive I was using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every USB port on my console to see if maybe one was not working and another would work better. I have soft and hard reset my console a couple of times now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have literally tried everything I possibly can.&nbsp;<strong>Nothing works, it is dead.
</strong></p>
<p>I will be driving to a Microsoft store tomorrow for more help. I am sure all they will do is tell me I must send it in for the $140 repair or I am out of luck. If they are nice maybe they will repeat the troubleshooting steps I did myself. Either way I know
 I am out of luck and the update bricked my console. At the moment it seems there is nothing you guys will do. I don't have much hope in this, but please, please create a solution to fix this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep everyone posted on any updates I experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit/Update #2: </strong></p>
<p>Yeah so I went to the Microsoft store today and spoke to a nice fellow named John. He looked at it, did exactly as I suspected and tried all the things I had tried already. He was really nice and instructed me that I should call 1800-4my-xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give this a try tomorrow and see if they will offer any help. If my experience and presumptions are correct. I doubt I will receive any help. I was correct on the Microsoft store, they were nice, but were not able to do anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep leaving feedback on this thread if you are experiencing the same issues. Hopefully someone of influence might see this and see how many people are being affected. Maybe with a 1 in 2,345,234,583,945 change, we can make something happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit/Update: #3</strong></p>
<p>So today I contacted support. I spoke with someone over the internet chat room as well as talking over the phone and even being forwarded to a manger of the department.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained my issues, they were all very kind and supportive however they all instructed me that there is nothing they can do. They told me it is not within their power, they have no ability to wave the repair cost or even forward me to someone who has
 that ability. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems, as I suspected, that I am out of luck and even though some of these guys may want to help me, they do not have the ability to. It is really sad and disappointing to know that when it comes down to it, Microsoft does not stand behind its product
 and offers no avenues of recourse. This is the end of what I can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be attempting to contact Microsoft headquarters tomorrow when they open. I have read they charge 39.99 for any conversations over the phone. I will not be paying that and likely will receive no service. I will try none the less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is sad, I feel hopeless, abandoned, and betrayed. If anyone comes across this thread who has the ability to change these circumstances please do. I am not the only one experiencing this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Anyone experiencing this or a similar issue please up vote and comment on this thread. Bringing awareness of the issue to light is the only hope we really have now.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you to all of you who have tried to help and given sympathy. </p>

<p>Hi NV,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting, the latest update released is a version of the Xbox operating system that is built to run as well as possible on ALL Xbox One consoles. Unfortunately, sometimes issues with updates occur when either a drop in the internet connection during
 a download or just a misprocessed event occurs on the console itself. To resolve this, we do recommend attempting a full factory reset when the option for a soft factory reset (keep my games &amp; apps) is unavailable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a factory reset does not stop the issue, then we recommend the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Offline System Update</a>, to download the latest update on the website, and load it onto the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding and I hope this information helps.</p>

<p>If I "hard reset" or "remove everything" do I lose my Minecraft maps and other game saves? Or is it backed up on the cloud?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what do I do about games that are not available online anymore like Minecraft?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I send my console in for free service? It worked fine before the update, why should I have to pay for something caused by your update?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello NV Urban Ninja!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The factory reset that you're talking about should not remove any of your progress or digitally purchased content.
<br />
If you bring it back up and you sign back in with the same gamertag, you should be able to continue from where you were.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any digitally downloaded game will also be available for redownload as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, you should be able to get your console serviced for free if it is within it's 1 year warranty.
</p>
<p>If you do want to get your console repaired, you can either go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device support</a> or contact <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox support directly </a>and see if they can help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how helpful this info was in resolution of this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Well, I hard reset my console. Went online, downloaded the update file as instructed in the link I provided originally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has not worked. When I click the "offline update" option, it goes to the update screen for about a second then my screen goes black.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel so very betrayed. It costs me 140 dollars to get it repaired by you guys. Honestly, that is unbelievable to me considering this was caused by your update. My console did not fail or break on its own, it worked fine until your update was forced on
 it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Urban,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the frustration with the console. Do you happen to have a Microsoft store near you? If so, you can go there and see if they are able to help you out. Otherwise, you can

            &nbsp;Same here man. The new update will break your console. And then you get told "there is nothing we can do if unplugging it and plugging it back in doesn't work." In over 15 years I've had the original Xbox, 4 360's (2 broke), and now on my 3rd and final
 Xbox one. Now if I neglected my console or if this was my fault I wouldn't be angry. Just a little coincidental that it happened IMMEDIATELY after an update... But yeah charging your customers to repair your error is low, immoral, and absolutely pitiful. If
 this is how you treat loyal customers since the absolute day 1 of Xbox then it's the last dime I will ever spend on your overpriced garbage.

<p>Yeah man, this is pretty messed up. I am not going to go out and force up money to buy a new one. This is pretty shady stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to be honest, it almost feels like it's on purpose. I have a console from like day 2 of launch. I think it's so old they are just trying to get us to get a new one already. I don't know, just feels like it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't understand how it is legal or acceptable to force an update that actually breaks something I payed so much for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is literally their fault. They force us to download an update that truly, it itself, broke my xbox. My console was fine yesterday, it is broken today. Nothing is wrong with my console, the update is what is broken.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to hear any sound from my Toshiba Satellite C855D</h2>
                    Hai!
<div>I am using&nbsp;Toshiba Satellite C855D with Windows 8 - 64 bit.</div>
<div>AMD E-300 APU with Radeon HD graphics. (1.3 GHz and Dual Core) (x64 based processor).</div>
<div>RAM: 4.00 GB</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a brand new laptop and the OS was pre-loaded.</div>
<div>I am unable to hear any sound neither from speakers nor through headphones.</div>
<div>I have tested the sound from sound properties, gone through device manager and did every thing that should be done.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The laptop came up with pre-installed Realtek High Definition Audio Drivers.</div>
<div>I have re-installed the same by downloading the drivers from Toshiba official site. Then also the sound didn't work.</div>
<div>I have uninstalled the Realtek Audio so that I thought the default Microsoft High Definition Audio might work.</div>
<div>It wasn't happened too. I've gone through Toshiba support and didn't get any help in the desired way.</div>
<div>Then I've moved onto Windows forums, gone through them, downloaded a troubleshooter and done troubleshooting. It also said no problems with Sound. But still I'm unable to hear any sound.</div>
<div>Please help me.</div>
<div>Thanks and regards,</div>

<h2>            error reporting will not delete when trying to free up disc space&#47;Other concerns since recovery</h2>
                    <p>Can't delete error reports or set up files when trying to free up disc space.&nbsp; Searched for errors and believe they might be Java.&nbsp; Not actually a program I have and not sure how java works.&nbsp; Just plugged in errors in C: Drive and that is what came up.&nbsp;
 Not sure what to do with this and don't understand.&nbsp; Wonder if it has to do with the fact that I just recovered the&nbsp;PC and it is now back to Windows 8.&nbsp; Since recovery getting pop ups/block in email and cannot change settings.&nbsp; Just one of the things that
 is going on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>On certain sites when I switch from one item to the next, I will see large blue print to the left of the screen very briefly.&nbsp; Wonder what that is.&nbsp; Java script?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went onto Java website reluctant to download.&nbsp; Got blocked anyways.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting locked on certain safe sites since recovery.&nbsp; Have to go into Task Manager to shut down IE.&nbsp; Never happened before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went into Event Manager and just updated one device.&nbsp; Sound/Speakers.&nbsp; Didn't appear to be any other issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Malwarebytes and Windows Defender.&nbsp; According to both, all is ok.&nbsp; Errors with Mcafee and deleted.&nbsp; May still be hanging around somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Did gremlins take over living quarters in my computer?</strong></p>

<h2>            Open app that I can&#39;t find in order to close</h2>
                    <p>Working with windows 8</p>
<p>I have an app that I can not find to close.</p>
<p>When I shut down my computer I am asked if I want to close the app.&nbsp; I show no apps open and can't find the app that the computer is telling me is open.&nbsp; Due to this I can't download any updates from Microsoft/windows.&nbsp; I have used the Microsoft security
 scan to see if I have&nbsp;malware, virus etc.&nbsp; The scan shows that I have none of this.&nbsp; I use WebRoot as&nbsp;my security.&nbsp; The app is still open and is hiding somewhere in my computer.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; Windows 10 will autodownload at the end of the month
 but I'm sure it won't seeing as I can't even get the updates to download.&nbsp; If anyone has any ideas I'm open to anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also to clarify, how did you sync your non&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;contacts with Skype? Did you use your phone?
</p>
<p>

<p>When I upgraded to the latest version of the desktop app, running on Windows 7, all non-skype based contacts disappeared from my contact list. Fortunately when I rolled back to Classic Skype, my non-skype based contacts were back in my contacts list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My non-skype contacts are not synced in any way w/ skype. They were simply entered as contacts in Classic Skype w/ the menu pick: Contacts - Add Contact - Save a Phone Number...</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;you will be using the new Skype, you need to&nbsp;manually re-add those numbers.

</p><p>The photo app does not recognize the video camera at all. Guess it does not bother to look at imaging devices in the hardware profile?</p>

<h2>            How much safe is a folder protect by locking apps&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am trying some apps bearing in mind protect my computer. I found 2 apps: <br />
<br />
- Folder Protect: http://www.newsoftwares.net/folder-protect/<br />
- BitSec Secure Folder (<span>Free Edition</span>): http://erfasoft.com/products.html
<br />
<br />
Basically, both promise "uses Windows Kernel-level protection that makes it unbreakable, and if and when activated, the items protected with Folder Protect can not only remain secure even in Safe Mode, but can also be protected/unprotected using right-click
 operation as well as from the Windows Context Menu". (quote from Folder Protect, but similar feature is offer by BitSec).<br />
<br />
a) How much safe is a folder protected by locking apps like these? Consider I lost my computer, or even it be stolen, by using this apps do I have some REAL protection from important information like credit card numbers, work files, etc.?<br />
<br />
b) Besides Windows Bitlocker, does Windows provide by its own system resource similar (folder locked by password) than these offered by simple locking-folder apps?<br />
<br />
c) Is there any way to just lock a file/folder of being deleted, even without password? I mean, the file could be accessed, but not deleted. I couldn't see nothing in folder/file properties...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

            <p>Hi: <br />
<br />
That depends on the software. If the software is utilizing Windows Kernel APIs and low-level code, it can be unbreakable, however, remember that just because I am saying this, it doesn’t mean that you are fully protected. I usually recommend, TrueCrypt which
 is very famous, and well known. TrueCrypt from Wikipedia:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>“<b><i>TrueCrypt</i></b><i> is a free
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
software application</a> used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-the-fly_encryption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
on-the-fly encryption</a> (OTFE). It can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file or encrypt a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
partition</a> or (under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Windows</a> except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 2000</a>) the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
storage device</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-boot_authentication" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">pre-boot authentication</a>).</i>”
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I recommend it, however, it is your own choice. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps...<br />
<br />

please feel free to contact me and let me know.<br />

<p>Vista - Photo Gallery</p>
<p>Tried to download a .jpg image from a SD card (the image&nbsp;was&nbsp;scanned with a Pandigital Photo, Slide, Negative Converter (Model # PANSCN 05). This message appeared in Photo Gallery, "Photo Gallery can't open this picture or video. This file format is not

<p>=====================================<br />
Just a question...when scanning and saving the scans...did <br />
you choose any options to reduce file size by compressing <br />
the photos?</p>
<p>If you only have a few of these scans...you could open them<br />
one at a time in Windows Paint and go to...File / Save As...<br />
and enter a new name, choose a save folder&nbsp;and choose .jpg. <br />
This will create a new version of the same photo and I suspect <br />
it will be compatible with Windows Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>Also...it may be worth a try to&nbsp;install Windows Live Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)</p>
<p>Download Windows live Photo Gallery<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-photo-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-photo-gallery</a><br />
(There are other apps included in the download...<br />
uncheck the ones you do not want)</p>
<p>No guarantees...but there's a possibility that reinstalling<br />
DirectX may&nbsp;improve this issue.</p>

<h2>            DISM Errors &#38; SFC Sannow Errors Source FIle &#47; SOLUTION FOUND</h2>
                    <p>I have already read the current post to this and i see it has no activity since December, so i am having the same issue i can run All DISM Commands and all have issues the RESTOREHEALTH is the biggy, i also had this problem back in December and was told
 how to burn iso and direct the DISM to that disk for and repair files needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>that also failed to locate needed files since then i have reset my computer and updated Windows 10 to current updates ran this again today and same issue, files needed or directory cannot be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so maybe its time yall get some one in the USA to get to the root of this i have had no luck with any tech from india or spain,</p>
<p>
</p><p>also remeber this was never an issue until version 10586 was released and updated up until then all DISM Commands ran with no issues with or without finding problems as well as the SFC Command .<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bd91ec0-62ac-4a88-b89e-597f7bc2310d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bd91ec0-62ac-4a88-b89e-597f7bc2310d" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Greenva,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>For better understanding of the issue, <span>please reply to the following questions.</span></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>May I know the reason behind running the DISM tool?</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Did you restart the system after running the DISM tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error<strong> 0x800F081F </strong>occurs when there is corruption in the Windows system files. Let’s run the system file checker scan and check if there are any corrupt system files.
</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as "<strong>System File Checker</strong>" or "<strong>sfc</strong>". This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions. Here's
 how:<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
<strong>2. </strong>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, <strong>sfc /scannow
</strong>and then press <strong>Enter</strong>. <br />
<strong>3.</strong> Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk and takes
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive. <br />
<strong>4. </strong>Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, <strong>restart</strong> the system.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with requested information and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

            <p><strong>This seems to be your standard response I would like a real solution to this issue, since SFC Command also has errors that files cannot be found which was in my original question but I see it has been edited.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am running DISM because I am having various issues and before the 10586 update in November I was able to run DISM and fix any glitches I was having.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>so the reason I am running it is because going back to july 2015 that's what tech support told me to do or they themselves did it on a remote support session.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>so dism cannot find needed files and either can sfc scan so please send me a real resolve to this issue.</strong></p>
<p>

            <p>You may want to be a bit more specific about what you are doing that has caused the need to continually run DISM and/or SFC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also want to post the specifics concerning the hardware/software combination you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Continual corruption is not a normal behavior in Windows 10. Your continuing need to resort to these repair tools signifies a fundamental problem that your vague responses are not going to allow anyone here to get a handle on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, the only intelligent response (given the information you have provided) would be to tell you to retire your current system in favor of a hardware/software combination that works.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>What would I like you to add??? I think I said that already... "You may want to be a bit more specific about what you are doing that has caused the need to continually run DISM and/or SFC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also want to post the specifics concerning the hardware/software combination you are using."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your screen shot simply shows that your system is not updated to the latest level, though your text states that you have done such...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I also said; "Currently, the only intelligent response (given the information you have provided) would be to tell you to retire your current system in favor of a hardware/software combination that works."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I would recommend retiring your current system. However, if you would like to continue trying to troubleshoot it and want some help... You are going to have to give us some information to work with.</p>

            <p>Ok, it is like pulling teeth... H50-what?? What processor was installed? How much memory&nbsp;was installed? What hard drive&nbsp;was installed? What OS came on the device and was it the Home or Professional edition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you running the Insider builds on this device or the general release of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention "NEW BUILT 09/2015" yet, earlier you said&nbsp;"going back to july 2015". Are we talking about the same device throughout this thread?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention "I am running DISM because I am having various issues and before the 10586 update in November I was able to run DISM and fix any glitches I was having." What are the various issues you are having now and what were the glitches you were having
 previously that prompted you to run DISM or SFC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened when you ran DISM with the "Source" option?</p>

            If this is a recent problem then this variant of System Restore might fix it:<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Repair PC" from the menu.<br />
5. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
6. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
7. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />
8. When finished, remove the CD before rebooting the system.<br />
In Step 2 you could also use your Windows 7 installation DVD. The subsequent steps are similar to the ones above.<br />

            If your trying to install a 64 bit copy it can only be installed to C: drive which must be the lead drive in your bios.&nbsp; After you've loaded your drivers and partitioned and formated your drive exit the install and reboot. Go to your bios settings and
 arange the order of your disk to ensure that the first disk drive recognized is the drive you've just partitioned and formated. This is a good idea regardless of wether 32 or 64 version, unless of course you're doing a multi-boot environment.

<h2>            light buzzing noise coming from my surface book</h2>
                    <p>Recently got my Surface book w/performance base no more than about a week ago, and been extremely pleased with it so far but just now I've began to hear a light buzzing noise coming from it that I haven't heard before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know too much about the subject or what the problem may be, I've had it on for a long period of time unsure as to weather that may be the problem and it simply needs to be switched off for a while or its a larger problem. I'm about to turn it off and
 will update on the situation another time but would anyone be able to enlighten me on the situation?</p>

<p>Just updated my system so yes its fully up to date now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>seemed to be fine for the first hour of use, or could have just been the fact I couldn't hear it over other noises, but its doing it again like a light vibrating/buzzing. happens every time the laptop begins to work hard on something not affecting any performance
 but slightly annoying nonetheless.</p>

<p>We're glad to know that everything is up to date. By the way, it seems that the buzzing noise you're hearing is just but normal. If a Windows application or services uses lots of CPU for an extended period, the processor will get warm and will automatically
 turn on the fan.</p>

    <title>Windows XP reboots repeatedly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viiirve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP reboots repeatedly</h2>
                    After reading a lot of advice I need some help:<br />
<br />
My Windows XP machine is caught in some reboot loop where it will start loading Windows (show the flag and the status bar) for a little while, and then suddenly reboot.<br />
<br />
I haven't been able to bring up safe mode or anything like that. <br />
<br />
Following some advice I found on the internet (I know, I know ...), I made a "slipstream CD" with Service Pack 3 and my installation CD. It was a lot of work and a lot of downloading.
<br />
<br />
And it led nowhere. <br />
<br />
I could boot from the slipstream CD and get to the point where it tried to fix the installation. It then wanted to reboot to continue the installation but instead it repeats the above pattern with the single change that it now tells me that the installation
 continues (or something to that effect; it is not an English language version).<br />
<br />
The only additional piece of information I have is that the problem started when I tried to copy the contents of my one (out of two) harddrives to a third harddrive as a backup. I physically installed the third harddrive in the PC, tried to boot up in Windows,
 got a sudden reboot (as above). However, I have physically removed the third harddrive and the problem remains. Incidentally, I made my backup with a "live" Linux CD but that can't be the problem because that happened after the first incident.<br />
<br />
And ideas on how I can troubleshoot and solve my problem? I really need my computer up and running.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks!<br />

            Hi Tom,<br />
<br />
Thanks for getting back to me.<br />
<br />
With the Linux Live CD it seems to work as it should. Definitely no rebooting. Similarly, with the XP CD, I can get into "recovery console". The problem is that I don't where to go from there.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure that it is a problem with the XP setup on disk.<br />
<br />
Oh, one more thing. Before proceeding with the "slipstream CD" I had tried to go back to the last known good configuration by pressing F8 after boot up but it didn't make any difference.<br />
<br />

            <p>I was considering rhe possibility of a hardware problem such as bad power supply, overheating of CPU or chip set, or bad memory. Sorry to say, I am left somewhat puzzled.</p>

            The reason I copied the contents of my one harddrive is that the hardware is showing its age.
<br />
<br />
Is there someway to get some logging information instead of the nice Windows splash screen during boot up? That way I might learn exactly when the boot happens.<br />
<br />
I will try to experiment with F8.<br />
<br />
Could Windows get confused because the sudden appearance of an extra harddrive? <br />

            I tried to activate logging in Win XP but I don't know where the log file goes.<br />
<br />
Then I tried booting into Linux again and let it run for five minutes -- no problems.
<br />
<br />
Could it be some configuration I could delete? Somehow fiddling with the registry (ouch)?
<br />
<br />
I might have to reinstall XP from scratch but the problem is that I have some software that I cannot get easily again (free, legal stuff, just very exotic). :-(<br />

<br />
Are you able to use the <span style="font-weight: bold">Disable automatic restart on system failure</span> when in the boot menu?&nbsp; That should (hopefully) let you see if there is a blue screen of some sort showing before the PC reboots itself.&nbsp; You might be
 able to research its error code from there.<br />
