    <title>Num Lock On By Default After New Users Log In - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Num Lock On By Default After New Users Log In</h2>
                    The Num Lock always turns on after a new user logs in on my Windows 7 system. I know how to adjust the Num Lock settings in the registry so it is either on or off at the log on screen, but not sure how I can get it to&nbsp;always be off after a new user logs
 in. If the user turns off Num Lock it will be off the next time they log in, but I would prefer to have it off the first time someone logs in. This is the only system I have ever seen this happen on. Every other Windows 7 system, the Num Lock does not come
 on after someone logs in for the first time (unless they intentionally turn it on).
<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The status of the NUM LOCK key is specific for each user on the computer, and it is disabled by default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it would be great if you can let me know the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue. Do you remember making any changes in the registry entries on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please get back to us with this information.</p>

            <p>This happens immediately after installing Windows, so someone must have done something to the original Windows load prior to creating an image. I thought it could be something with the default user profile (C:\Users\Default). So I deleted the default profile
 and created a new one that had a profile with the Num Lock off... but that didn't fix the problem. The only other setting that I'm aware of is in the registry (HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Keyboard\InitialKeyBoardIndicators). From what I understand, if
 you change that setting it only affects the Numlock status when the system boots up, i.e. Numlock status at the Log on screen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know of any others settings that could cause the Numlock to be on after users log in for the first time?
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justin</p>

<p>The default Number lock key status might also be set in the BIOS.&nbsp; Not every BIOS has this setting [my current PC does not but my previous one did].</p>

<p>Hi Annette. I had this problem on my spare laptop. The name that shows is your Microsoft Account name, not your Community name. (Here your icon is AN on a green circle but when you power-up to sign in you see your Microsoft Account icon.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a easy fix: Left click on your AN icon top right of the screen, You'll see in the Menu View MS Account - click on that.&nbsp;<span>&gt; More help with your Microsoft Account &gt; Change name</span></p>
<p>You might need to click on More Help link there but that depends on how well you're doing!</p>
<p><span>You'll need to sign in to your MSA at many of these stages. This is for Security reasons - MS needs to know it's you not someone else so they'll send you a four-digit code (by phone/text, depending on what you set up.
 If phone have it handy - if email watch your Inbox.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It's such a relief when you've finished!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hoping this helps - let me know how you get on please.</span></p>

<h2>            My Keyboard keys take multiple strokes to produce a letter.</h2>
                    <p>Here's the story: For Christmas (2011)&nbsp;I recieved a HP Pavilon G6 series laptop installed with Windows 7. Two days ago, I spilled a small amount of Fruit juice on the M,J,K and spacebar area of the keyboard. I swiftly wiped it off and it seemed fine. The
 next day My spacebar was hard to move, so I looked online and found that WD-40 was an exelent lubrication for keyboards, many people had success with the product so I decided to try it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Like Magic, the spacebar moved again and all was fine, until the A, S, and D Keys&nbsp;had problems. I have to type&nbsp;these keys&nbsp;2-10 times before a letter ever appears on screen. I, again, looked online and found it could be due to the repeating fuction on the
 keyboard, I looked and changed some things, but nothing improved. The thing is, when I hold down a letter it works fine, it's just the single touch of one that never responds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm wondering if this is a bizzare&nbsp;physical problem, or a&nbsp;problem I can fix with a few clicks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>-Russell&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Download and install the latest driver for HP Pavilon G6 series from the link and check if the issue persists:</p>
<p><a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html</a></p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>if the above step fails power cycle the laptop and check if the issue persists. Follow the steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Shutdown the laptop and Remove the battery, hold in the power button for a few seconds.</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>This resets the motherboard, Replace the batter and startup as normal.</p>
<p>If the issue still persists I would suggest you to contact HP for further assistance.</p>

<h3> fs reloadz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help with xbox live membership&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So basically i use my mums credit card for xbox live, which had auto renewal on, but she got a new credit card, which meant that when this months membership had finished, i would have to update the card information to start my gold membership again.</p>
<p>Well that happened a few days ago and i decided to try and renew it today, so i attempt to add a new credit card, that works fine, but when i go to cancel the old one, it doesn't let me. saying that it can't be cancelled and i should go to the xbox website
 for more payment options. So i go to the xbox website, sign in and click manage payment options, a message comes up saying uh oh, that shouldn't of happened. It appears you have found a glitch in the system.</p>
<p>So i go back onto my xbox to see if i can get my gold membership back again, it doesn't let me, i tried to redeem a code that i got with halo 4 that would let me connect to xbox live, it says the code was invalid (not sure whether this is due to xbox or
 the code cannot be redeemed anymore). I also can't seem to get a silver membership</p>
<p>I don't know where to go from here, i can't find anything on google apart from people saying that when they ring up support they are put on hold for 30mins then disconnected, so i really need help on this.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>If you did not turn auto-renewal off before getting the new card, then our subscription has renewed which is why you're still showing as gold. Since you're having issues removing the old card on the website, you would need to try contacting phone support
 and talk to billing directly.</p>
<p>You can't remove a card while it's attached to an active gold subscription, which could be why it won't let you cancel the other one. Normally you would have to turn auto-renewal off, wait for the subscription to expire and revert to silver before you can
 remove it. Since you've added a new card, phone support should be able to remove the old card.

That right click at taskbar method SELDOM works.The box at the icon is almost always&nbsp;grayed out ( unclickable ).<br />
<br />
Use this tutorial :</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scroll down to Option Two &gt; start at &nbsp; #7 - to enable the Power icon &gt; click that download button and follow the instructions at #11 to #15.</p>
<p>Note : Don't delete that desktop reg file as insrtucted. Keep it there so that you can use it next instead of fishing for the tutorial again.<br />
Believe me, you'll need it again. Those 3 icons, clock, power and network have the habit of disappearing for no apparent reasons.</p>

<p>I had the same issue today, I typed "Device" into Cortana's search field, found device manager, clicked the drop down for "batteries", then disabled/ re-enabled AC Adapter and ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery. The battery icon appeared almost immediately
 after doing so and it is still there after restarting my computer. It is also no longer greyed out like it was before doing so.</p>
<p>I am uncertain as to why it was turned off to begin with since I ever mess with those particular icons, but I understand the frustration of having that icon gone especially while playing PC games. I hope this helped.</p>

    <title>Non-Aligned Display in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marvinadhikari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Non-Aligned Display in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10. I changed my monitor and used my older monitor's VGA cord as that was longer. Now There is a little gap on the top part, and my taskbar on the bottom sank by the same length as that of the top gap. Also, my whole display screen slightly
 moved left. The total effect is - my display moved (sunk) by around a quarter of an inch towards the bottom-left side. There is a flickering line continually jumping in the blank space on the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this alignment issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Marvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue with your screen alignment can be due to incompatible display driver. As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you update your display driver. Keeping your drivers up-to-date will ensure the quality performance of your device.
<span>To update your display driver, you'll need to start your PC in safe mode, uninstall your current display adapter, and then check for driver updates. Here's how:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your PC in safe mode</a>, then right-click the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp; button and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li>Expand the <strong>Display adapters</strong> section, right-click the listed adapter, then select
<strong>Uninstall device</strong>. Select the <strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong> check box, then select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>&nbsp;and restart your PC.</li><li><span>After your PC restarts, press the Windows logo key &nbsp;+<strong> I</strong> on your keyboard to open Settings. If that doesn't work, select the
<strong>Start</strong> &nbsp;button&nbsp;and then select <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>From Settings, select <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once done with the updates, check if the screen alignment is back to normal.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Should you need additional assistance, do let us know.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the actual problem, we need more information. Please provide the following information below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you receive any error message when you try to open the project file in Windows Live Movie Maker?
</li><li><span>Are the files used in the project stored locally?
</span></li><li><span><span>Did
 you check if the files used in the project are still on the same location? If they were moved from a different location or deleted,&nbsp;it will cause an error on your project file and all the files that has been moved/deleted will change it appearance to a&nbsp;yellow
 triangle with an exclamation point. It is an indicator that the file has been moved or deleted. To fix&nbsp;it, just simply double-click on it. A Fix Item dialog box will appear with several options. Click Find to locate the missing file from your computer to complete
 the storyboard. If you can't find the file needed in the project, you need to edit the affected frame to complete your project.</span></span></li></ul>

<p><span>2. Click
<strong><span>New Folder</span></strong> to insert a new folder in your SkyDrive files then name it.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Once you've successfully created the folder select the target folder and click Add files then a new window will appear and asking you to Drop files here or Select them
 from your computer. You will see a new window that the file is being uploaded and it will be automatically added to the selected folder.</span></p>

            Hi dougefresh1111,<br />
<br />
Thank you for providing us those information. I would like to confirm if you still have the original files you have used on your movie project? Have tried to double-click the yellow triangles and look for the missing files on your movie project? Please note
 that if the files are moved&nbsp;in a different location,&nbsp;you will encounter the yellow exclamation error on your project file.
<br />
<br />
You have mentioned: "the project folder was completely empty." if that folder contains all the media files you have used on your movie project, then we recommend that you check if you could still recover those files. You might want to check your<strong> Recycle
 bin</strong> and recover those files if they are still available. If not, then what we could recommend is that you start your movie project again.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<h2>            Why is Internet Explorer on the 360 so useless&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Seriously... The rendering speed is terrible. My crappy old Samsung Galaxy Europa with a 600Mhz single core, and 184Mb of RAM renders much faster than IE on the 360. It also regulary refuses to load pages, and won't again until you exit to the Dashboard
 and restart IE. It also sometimes randomly crashes back to the Dashboard.</p>
<p><br />
Why does it suck so badly?</p>

<p>It's bad not because Internet Explorer&nbsp;is&nbsp;inherently bad, indeed it works&nbsp;very well on PC's. The&nbsp;slowness is&nbsp;probably because&nbsp;IE likes&nbsp;lots of RAM and the Xbox 360 is pretty deficient in this area.&nbsp; IE for Xbox 360 looks like&nbsp;was built around IE 10 - well
 it looks the same at least.&nbsp; I'm guessing the RAM issue is the reason why IE for the Xbox 360 can't even have multiple tabs, well it couldn't do it last time I tried.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, IE on Xbox One is a much more pleasurable experience.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 will not let me upload pictures from my camera.</h2>
                    <p>Win 10 will not let me upload pictures from my camera. It says I lack privileges. I am the only user of this computer. In all my previous versions of windows this was never a problem.</p>
<p>I've tried a couple different programs and neither worked. One program wanted me to sign up for some android phone app and now it always appears when I try to re-upload the pics, not giving me other options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I log on to Win 10 with the privileges needed to use my computer?<br />

            <p>Thank you for replying so quickly.</p>
<p>No error messages in device manager or yellow exclamation marks, with or without the camera attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said the only message I've gotten was that I lacks sufficient permissions.</p>
<p>Although now I can no longer access the Nikon program I've been using to up load and manage pictures. I am directed to a Win 10 phone app, "phone Companion".</p>
<p>It does give me an option to transfer other files using file explorer, but that doesn't recognize the picture files on the camera. That&nbsp; is if the files are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should say here that this is a computer and while I do have a smart phone I have no interest in connecting the two as Win 10 seems to want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trouble shooting said both that it had fixed a conflict and that there was no conflict found. It then told me to try the device again. The result was the same as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The File System Checker found no problems. </p>
<p>Here I found that Win 10 wouldn't let me run FSC untill I had right clicked and clicked run as administer. Once again I am the sole owner and user of this computer, By definition that makes me the administrator and yet Win 10 disagrees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr Da Costa'scomment has to do with syncing. That is not my problem, the camera and computer were in sync as they had been under Win 7 and Win XP before that. The picture files had been happily scanned by the Nikon program and were just waiting to be up
 loaded. As you know that didn't happen..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question remains: How do I get sufficient permissions to run my computer?</p>
<p>

            <p>OK I finally opened Nikon Transfer 2 "as administrator". As NT2 is a program that opens automatically rather than from the start menu, I had to find it with windows explorer on the C drive then right click and click run as administrator.
</p>
<p>After closing the Phone Companion I was able to get NT2 to scan and up load the pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a cumbersome and time consuming process. I hope you will agree that this should not be necessary.</p>

            <p>I was sent an Email asking me to reply to this thread if I had not resolved the problem or had my question answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer is that the specific symptom of the problem was solved by a inefficient work around, but the problem itself has not been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since found that I do not have sufficient permissions to "save image as" when I right click on an image on the net. I have yet to find a work around for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 needs to have a one stop method for the owner/administer of the machine to log on with full permissions and then put whatever usage restriction they choose. It is silly in the extreme to ask your customer to find work a rounds for to do thing
 which formerly took one or two clicks.</p>

    <title>Windows app store balance vanished&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markodinho  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows app store balance vanished&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>I had a gift card worth €25 for the windows app store, I spent about €10. My balance is now €0 with no record of any transactions in my account transaction history. I am certain that I had a balance
 of around €15 remaining, but when I tried to purchase an app I was told I had no available payment options. I only redeemed the gift card in late December so I was surprised to see that there was no evidence of my gift card ever existing and I was quite disappointed
 not to be able to purchase any apps. After two hours dealing with a clueless customer service worker, I was told that without an email of confirmation to say that I redeemed the gift card, my issue could not be resolved. I have email receipts of some purchases
 that I made with the gift card and a receipt for my initial purchase of the gift card from the microsoft store, but apparently this is all insufficient. After redeeming the gift card my account balance read €25 and I disposed of the used gift card. I am quite
 frustrated because I have been told that because I dont have an email which was never sent to me, I cannot resolve an issue that is not my fault in the first place.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So my question is has anyone else experienced or know how to resolve an issue of your microsoft account balance diappearing with no trace? Also does anybody know the address of a complaints department
 that I can contact?</span></p>

 restart and has been like that for a couple hours. I've tried force shutting down but as soon as it comes on it asks me to restart again. Any ideas?

    <title>Recover live&#47;Skype account - need more flexibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlstt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recover live&#47;Skype account - need more flexibility</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
After the most recent update to Skype, I was logged out of my account. I couldn't remember my password and now my account is locked. I have had my account for about 15 years. The account recovery questions are not very flexible, and even though I provide answers
 that I know are correct (credit card #, contacts in list, etc), I am told it's not sufficient information to prove I own the account. Then it recommends I create a new account. That's great, except:&nbsp;<br />
1. There is a $$ balance on my locked account&nbsp;<br />
2. I have a Skype-in number on my locked account&nbsp;<br />
3. I have 15 years of contacts in my locked account</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
I moved around a lot when I created the account. I'm not sure what country I was living in, let alone the postal code. I never use my real DOB, so I can't remember what I used when I signed up. However, I can provide the credit card that has been regularly
 charged to add $$ along with at least one password that I am sure of (and that I used for years).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
I can also provide 5 years of billing details, the numbers I call most often, my habits with skype-to-skype calls (even specific days of certain skype to skype calls). The zoomed out photo of my profile pic, the physical credit card associated with the account,
 emails from skype to my registered (but not recovery!) email account, yadda yadda yadda. But none of those is more compelling than my postal code from 15 years ago. There is no flexibility in the questions - name, DOB, country where signed up and credit card
 number. I know 50% of that info for sure. There needs to be more flexibility in what information needs to be provided.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
Meanwhile Microsoft gets a nice little cash grab on my remaining balance.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
Then trying to contact "customer support" which is in effect an endless loop of dealing with bots pretending they are human. Even when you click "talk to a person" you get a bot. Or another link that starts another loop. I've tried calling the customer support
 number and get lost in endless menus of options. That is not customer service. There should be other options, especially for long time account holders or those that have credit balances on Skype!&nbsp; Is there any other way?</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d98bf265-babe-4576-aba7-75b809a26643" title="CarlStt">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We feel for your frustration. Please make sure that you use the same credentials you've used when created the account (<em>Skype name, email address
 or phone number</em>). </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be advised that the
<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account recovery process</a></strong> is fully automated and the only way to lift the restriction of the account is to provide the correct and matching information for the account
 you are trying to recover. </span></p>
<p><span>We suggest for you to revisit the answers provided on the form, change whatever is inaccurate; then resubmit the form.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can try filling out the form as many times as you wish, 2 times per day. If all things fail, we suggest for you to create a new account instead.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not offer phone support. You may however, reach out to our <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live chat support</a></strong> for real -time assistance.
</p>

<p>Yes, your bots have told me this. But I am suggesting that perhaps you could ask other questions, considering some people have had their accounts for 15+ years. I don't even think I provided a DOB when I signed up, but it requires one to fill out the form
 and move to the next screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why my credit card, which I use to pay for things on my account (I have a list of all of the charges for the last 5 years) is not good enough - I know I am entering the right one because I've double-checked , or the skype in number that is associated
 with my account is not worthy information. Also, I&nbsp; know that my current email address is associated with the account because I have received emails from Skpe to that address in the past, about my skype account that I am trying to recover. But it is defaulting
 to the email address that I had 15 years ago when I signed up when I try to get a password reset. I know that I changed the associated email at least 2 years ago because I have emails dating back to that time!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is extremely frustrating because, as I mentioned, there is still credit on my account and a phone number that people use to call me, but I can't answer! Microsoft needs to up their game.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that Account recovery from process (ACSR) takes into account whether the profile information entered in the form matches what we have on record.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since profile information is readily discoverable online, the system takes other factors about the request into account as well. This being said, profile details alone is insufficient to grant the password reset.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rest assured that we appreciate your suggestion and feedback. We&nbsp;will look into your concern.

<p>I was able to recover my account. You know how? I signed up for an email account (web based provider) with the same name as was shown as the recovery screen for skype. I was able to do this because that recovery email hadn't been used in over 10 years and
 had become available again. I fail to see how this is secure. Any clown that was trying to get into my account could have done that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I have access to both my live account and my skype account, I can see why there are issues. The information between the two accounts are different. For example, my skype account has no DOB (because skype never required it back in the day) and microsoft
 has a different one. The countries between the two accounts are different&nbsp; because I signed up about 10 years apart. The credit card info is on my live account, but the receipt email is on my skype account which is different from live. No recovery email option
 in skype but only on live. Perhaps Microsoft should focus on getting the information between accounts aligned so that passing your ineffective security measures is at least possible.</p>

<h2>            automatic repair srttrail.txt error</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Norton Security on my new computer that had Windows 10 factory installed. However, after installing it, I updated the windows software and when I resttarted, I got the automatic repair loop where it would not start windows but instead
 kept going into the automatic repair. I did the repair I found online of the bootrec.txt /rebuildbcd, /fixmbr, and /fixboot. I eventually had to reset the pc to a previous time which finally fixed it. This finally got windows working. It worked fine for a
 week, then last night, after restarting for another microsoft office update, the computer did it again. I was able to get it running again, but I need to make this stop. Is there another way to fix this so that it does not happen again? I cannot keep resetting
 my computer. I have posted my srtrail.txt text below.</p>

            Hi afwolf130_1 ... check your o\s for corruptions.
<br />FYI, do a backup of your data if you haven't already.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<h2>            Flickering, static, scanlines and so much more...</h2>
                    
<p>The first time it happened I dismissed it. This Xbox is about a month old and aside from the constant minor issues everyone else is having (also doesn't play music in the background like our old friend 360) I turned on my Xbone today to see this annoyance
 again. The screen will flicker and show static and scanlines. In the background you can see the game you've loaded but just barely and it's squished or constrained to the top left corner hidden behind the madness. All the static and scanlines are white in
 color and change orientation from vertical to horizontal. I can't find anyone else who has posted about this and I'm beginning to think it's my burden alone. It's on a 4k TV if that helps and the settings are perfect. My picture when it's working is phenomenal.</p>

<p>Same exact issue, sometimes in-game, sometimes when going to dashboard from in-game, can go back to game and it goes away, back to dashboard, comes back. Only fix is to hard reset. Sometimes comes back right away....sometimes it's fine for weeks. Happens
 on many different titles.</p>
