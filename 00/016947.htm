<h2>            Cannot see certificate file</h2>
                    I copied a .cer file to both my storage card and the My Documents folder and I cannot see the files when I browse using My Stuff on the Samsung Jack running Windows Mobile 6.1<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t access Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyone alive here? Not a robot? I can't access my skype, which is sending out viruses and spam messages like a mad dog&nbsp;left and right. I want to get back my account, but skype has made it literally impossible to prove that I am the owner of the
 account. This is very frustrating. I have rarely used skype, and it is linked to an email which i used a decade ago, and now i can't recover&nbsp;my password.&nbsp; Please please&nbsp;help me to get my account back. I feel like ever since Microsoft and Skype merged everything
 went crazy in my account. Please help, i need to recover my contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 linked files Bug Report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris marron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 linked files Bug Report</h2>
                    <p>I'm emailing in as I've found an excel bug that has a high impact on my work and I'm hoping someone has a better workaround than I do, or even more ideally, a fix to the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of spreadsheets that link to other spreadsheets. These spreadsheets are reporting on annual data and looking at past trends. As such I keep a copy of each year's spreadsheets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part of my work I will update the source data spreadsheets which will then link into the reporting spreadsheets. Often I will then open the spreadsheet from the previous year to compare the data. To make it easier to explain I will call this year's reporting
 spreadsheet current.xls and last year's previous.xls. I will then call my source data files source1.xls source2.xls source3.xls source4.xls and source5.xls</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current.xls links to source2.xls in column B, to source3.xls in column C, source4.xls in column D, and source5.xls in column E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>previous.xls links to source1.xls in column B, to source2.xls in column C, source3.xls in column D and source4.xls in column E.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bug occurs in the following situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have current.xls open and have updated the values in the source data files. I have made sure that the links in current.xls have taken the information from the source data files . I do not have the source data files open as there are many source data files
 and excel does not run smoothly and often crashes if they are all open at once so I have gone through the process of opening the source files one by one while I have current.xls open and then making sure the data has fed through correctly before closing the
 source file again. Current.xls is now showing the correct information for this year. I then open previous.xls to allow me to compare the data between this year and last year. All the values in columns B, C and D on current.xls will update to the values in
 columns C, D and E on previous.xls leaving current.xls showing the values that were in files source2.xls, source3.xls and source4.xls last year rather than the values that are currently in them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that when previous.xls is opened the values that excel pulled through from the linked files last year are being taken and are being used to overwrite any cells that link to the same files even though the data that is overwriting those cells is
 much older than the data currently in those files. This occurs even if the cells are not in the same place in both spreadsheets.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As another example if G23 in current.xls links to A24 in source3.xls and AS197 in previous.xls also links to A24 in source3.xls then when previous.xls is opened the value in G23 in current.xls is changed from its updated value to the value that was in AS197
 in previous.xls when previous.xls was last saved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found four possible work arounds for this. All cause their own issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first is to have all source files open any time I am working on current.xls and on previous.xls. Unfortunately this causes huge lag when using excel and the program often crashes which takes a lot of time to then fix. It also means that I can't compare
 how previous.xls looks with the data we had last year to how previous.xls looks when updated to this year's data as the data in previous.xls updates with the data in&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is to take previous.xls and to copy everything in each sheet and paste it back as values. This is not ideal as it prevents previous.xls from updating to show the latest data and as such makes comparison between previous.xls with last year's values
 and previous.xls with this year's values impossible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third is to have both previous.xls and current.xls always open when I make any changes to the source files so that both update at the same time. Unfortunately this runs into the same problem as the first workaround where excel runs extremely slowly,
 often hanging and crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fourth is to create a pivot with the data from current.xls and then to open previous.xls and to use the data in the pivot to compare what I have in current.xls to previous.xls By not refreshing the data in the pivot I can get a comparison but unfortunately
 this doesn't allow me to make a change to the source data and see how that would affect both files. Also it is laborious to create the pivot for each of my files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is further compounded where I have particularly large and complicated sheets where it's very easy to miss if certain cells have reverted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem? Is there a fix?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Mark and Rena,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates. I am clear on the proposed solution. It works in very simple cases. It doesn't work in more complex situations where the risk of forgetting to manually calculate when you update something is so high and you have multiple tiers of
 linked sheets. This seems a pretty clear bug to me but if as you've said Microsoft doesn't view it as a bug there's really nothing I can do about it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me though this has a serious impact. The proposed solution of manually recalculating values after every update is hugely impractical on any scale and it just feels like poor design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Chris&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

<h2>            How to activate hidden battery for 6288.</h2>
                    Does anyone know the code to activate the hidden battery for 6288 when it is low on battery? i tried *3370# to activate it but the word "Result Unknown" out. I searched online for it but all of the codes for activating the hidden battery gave me the Result
 Unknown notice when I dialled it.

            Hidden battery ? You must be referring to the Half Rate Codec. I'm sorry I do not know how to activate it, but keep in mind that it reduces the overall audio quality of your calls.

            *3370# activates EFR (enhanced full rate) which results in 5% battery talktime reduction. #3370# deactivates this and activates EHR (enhanced half rate) which in turn causes talk time to increase by 10-15%. Doing these does not activate "hidden" battery,
 it just causes the handset to use less power and therefore extend talk/standby times. AFAIK, these codes only work with older/oldest generation handsets (i.e. 5110, 3310, 3210).<br />
<br />
By the way, for 6288 (as well as my 6233) there is no keystroke command to activate or deactivate EFR. :(

            <p>How was the password applied in the first place?&nbsp; Did you apply it to the file when you did a "Save As"?&nbsp; If so, you can remove the password by doing another "Save As", and when the file dialog box comes up, select the "Tools" drop-down at the lower right
 corner near the "Save" button, select "General Options", and then remove any passwords that are in there.&nbsp; After that, the new file you just created should no longer have a password associate with it.</p>

<h2>            Episode will not play</h2>
                    I Purchased the 9th season of How I Met Your Mother and the 16th episode is available to play, however, every time I attempt to watch it, it gives me an error saying "Sorry, we can't play this. Please try something else". This has been going on since it
 first came onto the list on January 28th 2014. It is very frustrating as I am in the military and this is really my only way of being able to watch this episode and further episodes.

<h2>            Please provide export to .gpx format</h2>
                    Given the recorded instability of ms health sync with third party sites such as Strava, mapmyfitness, etc, I strongly urge Microsoft to provide an export to .gpx file available in ms health dashboard. This will allow individuals to repair some of the damage
 Microsoft's poor quality of service has caused. Given the failure of the sync services, Microsoft has failed to provide individuals with full access to their personal data: this is a serious breach, which needs to be addressed immediately and safeguards put
 in place. Export to .gpx would help provide the safeguard which is clearly lacking at present.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Terry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of reasons why you run into this issue. One of these is device configuration conflict. For us to better assist you, provide more details by answering the listed questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which device are you using?</li><li>Is the keyboard connected wired or wireless?</li><li>Are there any other accessories connected to it when you encountered the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest unplugging your keyboard (if it's detachable), rebooting it, and reconnecting the keyboard. Kindly check on other accessories/external devices plugged on your computer and disconnect them. Try logging in again afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you so we can investigate on this further.</p>

            Thank You for your help, but it is a Laptop I should have stated that first. A Toshiba C655. I am hoping that I do not need to open up the Laptop and and disconnect the keyboard, I hope there is something else I can do.&nbsp;

<p>There is a possibility that a certain key was hardly pressed without being noticed. We advise that you check all keys on your laptop to verify this is not the one causing the issue to persist. Additionally, we suggest that you reach out to the laptop manufacturer
 for them to physically check your device.</p>

<h2>            How to change a selected font from whole document</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am writing a thesis document. So its a large document. Still divided in five different files for each chapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text is written mostly in Arial.&nbsp; Normally, I would go to Replace, select format and select Arial from font menu and replace. That should work.&nbsp; Problem is, word does not detect all the text that is in Arial and replaces only few sections of the document.
 When I checked on home ribbon, the font displayed is&nbsp;Arial (Body CS). Maybe, word does not detect it as Arial, there is no option in the Replace-format menu to select this '(Body CS)'. I tried to put it manually there, but it didn't work. Of course I can manually
 select all the text in my document and change the font but that is really problematic b/c I have some different fonts here and there in every paragraph, e.g. symbol and arrows which get converted as well, which is a big headache to convert them all one by
 one to symbols. There is a pretty good change I would miss many of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be really thankful if there is an easy solution. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using office 2016 , version 1803 on windows 10, 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            Sorry, for the answer.
<br />
<br />The steps below you can changes the font in Word:
<br />
<br />How to change your Word 2016 default font
<br />Open Word.
<br />Open any document or create a new document. It doesn't matter which, but a document needs to be open to access the required menus.
<br />Click the Home tab in the top left corner.
<br />Under the Fonts block, click the expand button. It's a small arrow icon in the bottom right corner. This will open the Font settings window.
<br />Select your desired Font.
<br />Click Set as Default in the bottom left corner.
<br />Check All documents based on the Normal template.
<br />Click OK to confirm your changes.
<br />All new Word documents will now use your font of choice by default.
<br />
<br />
<br />On the Format menu, click Font, and then click the Font tab.
<br />
<br />You can also press and hold  COMMAND + D to open the Font dialog box.
<br />
<br />Under Font, click the font you want to use, and then under Size, click the size you want to use for the body text.
<br />
<br />Click Default in the bottom left corner, and then click Yes to apply the change to all new documents based on the template. Click OK when finished.

<h3> venkatsarya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nested VLOOKUP</h2>
                    <p>I have a certain array of data in two columns of my sheet. Data in both the columns are variable in a specified range. [Say values in Column E can vary from 0 to 1 and values in Column F can vary in a drop-down list (4 variables)]</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/889454da-b56a-4391-a16b-1d2c35a1590f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/889454da-b56a-4391-a16b-1d2c35a1590f" /></a></p>
<p>I have separate tables [4 tables for each value in the drop-down list] comparing columns E and F to produce a result in Column G. For example, for a value of 0.8 in column E and Manual On/Off + automatic sweeping in column F the lookup/any proposed tool
 to search in the relevant table (among the 4) to produce a result 0.5 in column G. Can anyone propose me a better solution for this? Thanks</p>

<p>Perhaps more detail on what is on your 4 tables. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to automatically update the value in column G based on what is entered in columns E and F?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, start with a table that contains all possible combinations of the data in E and F and the result that G should be. Once that is done, a lookup of the two values can be used to return the result in column G.</p>

</p><p><span>We all obviously want to go see it but we also want to leave what's open open. Internet Explorer has always had a Setting at Tools &gt; Internet Options on the General tab after clicking the TABS button

</p><p><span>Did the EDGE Windows 10 Desktop &amp; Mobile design staff &amp; management not get the memo or read all of the user polls?<br />
I'll add this in the Internet Explorer category forum since there isn't any EDGE forum listed yet for some reason. That's weird.

<p><span>I mean for this to apply to the forums of both normal computers and Windows phones like my Nokia Lumia 950-XL with is my 2nd. My first was a Lumia 635.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get Word 2013 macro-enabled template to work</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guy's,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a macro-enabled template, .dotm, which includes a button on the Quick Access toolbar. Clicking this button runs a macro which saves the files to a location on the user's machine with a generated file name and also gives the user the option to open
 the folder where it is saved to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The template was created in Word 2010 and is stored in Word's STARTUP folder for each user, C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP</p>
<p>all of whom are running Windows 7 professional with a mix of Office 2010 and Office 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no problems in Word 2010. However when opening a new document in Word 2013 the button appears on the Quick Access toolbar as expected but when clicked the message "The macro cannot be found or has been disabled because of your Macro security settings."
 is displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why this is as all the macros settings are fully enabled, plus</p>
<p>
</p><p>- startup folder being a trusted location</p>
<p>- Macro security set to "enable all macros"</p>
<p>- Template loaded and ticked in the Templates and Add-ins property window</p>
<p>- Protected view turned off</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I fixed the problem and will post it here as it may help someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was that the dotm template had references to my normal template which contains my macros.</p>
<p>To create the dotm template successfully I had to open Word</p>
<p>File/New/My templates</p>
<p>Then in the dialog choose Blank Document (macro enabled) and Choose Template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reference to Normal was then missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then added my macros and did Ctrl+S in the VBA editor and saved as a dotm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then added the button to the Quick Access Toolbar, specifying the dotm I'd just saved. If not already saved then only the "For all documents" is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did File/Save As to and overwrote as a dotm with the same name.</p>

 right is "Caret symbol" and notification icon. None of these work (respond to left or right mouse click).</p>

            Thank you Pawan. I could not trigger a repair. As a last resort, I created a bootable Windows 10 USB drive. It did remove everything and put a clean OS.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand that you want to know if it is possible to sort your emails on Outlook.com on different columns according to your preferred classification. Let me help you with your concern.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that on Outlook.com you can only arrange the emails on your mailbox by size, Date, Subject, Conversation. To be able to do so, click on Arrange v located beside View: All&nbsp;v from your Inbox. Creating columns is not possible however, creating
 folders then email rules is also one way of sorting your email on Outlook.com. You can visit this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/conquergraymail/automate-your-inbox/scheduled-cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for additional information. Kindly choose Automate your Inbox from the choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, there is Quick views section on your account which will classify the messages that you have on your account if it has Documents attached to it, Photos or if you have flagged a message.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that this was helpful. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>We appreciate your time and effort for posting back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that the feature to add more columns to&nbsp;your Outlook.com&nbsp;inbox and sort items on different columns (like file size &amp; type) is currently not available. However, your comments and suggestions are important to us. Feel free to post on our
<a href="https://feedback.live.com/default.aspx?scrx=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Feedback page</strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can still use this feature (managing columns) on a mail client like Microsoft Office Outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions or clarifications, don't hesitate to post back.</p>

                    <p>I am running Office 2013 Word on Windows 8.1. Until recently it was trouble-free, but now there is a big problem when opening any Word document. Although it initially opens, as soon as you click on the document, it is replaced by a black&nbsp;blank screen, except
 for the 'Welcome back - pick up where you last left off' icon, which remains. Eventually the 'Microsoft Office is not responding' message appears; and when the program is shut down and restarted the same thing happens. Often it takes several goes for the document
 eventually to open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting very worrying, so any suggestions as to the cause, or what the remedy might be, would be gratefully received.</p>

            I am assuming that you are double-clicking on a document with Word closed. If so, what happens if you have Word already open (for at least a minute) when you try opening a document by double-clicking. If the same problem appears, what happens if you use
 File&gt;Open from within Word?<br />

Yes I did&lt; It fixed the category button is present but is not available (grayed). I used it all the time in the 2007 version. I had to reactivate my office installation and that took a lot of time and MS chat line.

 in the future, we are not&nbsp;going to&nbsp;use the hybrid server, can we convert the users to cloud users, so all the mailbox modification will be only be administered through the office 365 portal? may I know how to convert them to cloud users? &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Hendri,<br />
<br />
In a Hybrid environment, the mailboxes can be located in on-premises and cloud.&nbsp;Dirsync syncs the user objects from local AD to the cloud. An synced object can only be managed on the sync sources (here your on-premises AD and Exchange).&nbsp;When you want to decommission
 your Hybrid server, please move all the on-premises mailboxes to the cloud. After the migration is completed, they will be converted to mail enabled users automatically. You don't need to convert the users or mailboxes manually.<br />
<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, you cannot manage the objects in the cloud if Disycn is enabled.&nbsp;If you want to manage them in the cloud, you need to deactivate your Dirsync.&nbsp;If you want to manage the objects still, you should keep Dirsync and at least one Exchange server.
 Here is an article that explaining <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vilath/2015/05/25/office-365-and-dirsync-why-should-you-have-at-least-one-exchange-server-on-premises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>do you mean that if the hybrid server is still there, we are not able convert&nbsp;the user manually into the cloud&nbsp;users?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created two test account, one created from&nbsp;AD and sync with DirSync to the&nbsp;Office 365 and another one is created directly from Office 365 portal. Below is the picture. one mailbox is Synced with AD and another one is In Cloud. In Cloud mailbox is I refer
 to as Cloud User. Meaning that it didn't require AD to manage. so, we as administrator can do whatever admin stuff by just login to the Office 365 portal without the need to login to AD or on premise exchange server. This is what I actually want to achieve.
 Why? because Our company entity at the other country would like to decommission the AD and Exchange Server since their clients computers are actually not joined to the AD domain as the exchange server did. They have their own internal AD. so once they login
 to their computer, they will still need to key in password in order to access their email since we are into different forest of AD. So, once all mailboxes are already migrated to office 365, their requirement is to decommission all Exchange server and the
 AD, so they just need one place to manage, which is the&nbsp; Office 365 portal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So one way I can think of is to convert the mailboxes to&nbsp;cloud users. in this case, there is no AD required since&nbsp;it will be using&nbsp;so called "Azure AD".&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Hendri,<br />
<br />
No, manually converting the users into cloud users is not an option in Exchange Hybrid.<br />
<br />
When you want to create a cloud mailbox in Exchange Hybrid, the suggested way is to create a remote mailbox for Office 365 in your on-premises Exchange server. This will also create a mail-enabled user in on-premises Exchange with a<strong> targetAddress</strong><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>
 that is used<br />
to configure the coexistence with Office 365. If you create the user and mailbox directly in Office 365 admin center, the on-premises cannot recognize him and the<strong> targetAddress
</strong>is missing, which will lead to mail flow and autodiscover issues between on-premises Exchange and Office 365.<br />
</p>
<p>In Exchange Hybrid, the on-premises mailboxes and data need to migrated to the cloud. When all the mailboxes are in the cloud, you can decommission your on-premises Exchange server and Dirsync. After Dirsync is disabled, the source authority will be changed
 to Azure AD and the user status is In cloud, and you can manage the users and mailboxes in Office 365 Online.<br />
<br />
If anything is unclear, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Alex<br />

</p><p>thanks for your advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp;indeed trying to create&nbsp;2 users, one from on premise and sync it to the cloud by creating remote mailbox (e.g.
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;and the other one is creating a mailbox directly on the 365 portal (e.g.
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no problem of sending email between these two mailboxes since both are in the cloud already. however, issue will come when I am sending the email to the mailboxes that not yet been migrated to Office 365. is this the issue that you mentioned earlier?
 is this due to when email is flowing back to the on premise server, it can't be recognized by on premise servers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>About decommissioning the DirSync Server, then how about our on premise AD? because our clients computer are&nbsp;joined to the domain which is the same domain as our email. So if we are decommissioning the dirsync&nbsp;hybrid server, meaning that we&nbsp;need to authenticate
 twice?&nbsp;once when&nbsp;users login to their computers and another one is when they&nbsp;are accessing their cloud mailboxes. meaning that when they change&nbsp;password on their laptop, it won't be sync with their&nbsp;mailbox's password&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            Hi Hendri,<br />
<br />
Yes, that is the case. On-premises Exchange server doesn't know the newly created cloud user.<br />
<br />
For your second query, your understanding is correct. After decommissioning the DirSync Server, the local password is not synced to the cloud.
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Hendri,<br />
<br />
No, manually converting the users into cloud users is not an option in Exchange Hybrid.<br />
<br />
When you want to create a cloud mailbox in Exchange Hybrid, the suggested way is to create a remote mailbox for Office 365 in your on-premises Exchange server. This will also create a mail-enabled user in on-premises Exchange with a<strong> targetAddress</strong><em>***
 Email address is removed for privacy ***</em> that is used<br />
to configure the coexistence with Office 365. If you create the user and mailbox directly in Office 365 admin center, the on-premises cannot recognize him and the<strong> targetAddress
</strong>is missing, which will lead to mail flow and autodiscover issues between on-premises Exchange and Office 365.<br />
</p>
<p>In Exchange Hybrid, the on-premises mailboxes and data need to migrated to the cloud. When all the mailboxes are in the cloud, you can decommission your on-premises Exchange server and Dirsync.
<strong>After Dirsync is disabled, the source authority will be changed to Azure AD and the user status is In cloud, and you can manage the users and mailboxes in Office 365 Online.</strong><br />
<br />
If anything is unclear, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Alex<br />

</p><p><strong>After Dirsync is disabled, the source authority will be changed to Azure AD and the user status is In cloud, and you can manage the users and mailboxes in Office 365 Online.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this still true? I have a few cloud-only users and around 300 on-prim synced users in a exchange 2013 hybrid environment, the only problem is that the cloud-only users don't seem to be able to receive external mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This and the fact that I've seen references stating to disable Dir-sync to remove users synced with office 365. I'm trying to find specific documentation stating that this can be done without the users being deleted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Deepak,</p>
<p>Here is an article for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-and-use-site-templates-60371b0f-00e0-4c49-a844-34759ebdd989?CorrelationId=c317c5c8-d8f6-4c98-bc1c-0b1af99adfbf&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create and use site templates</a><br />
Note: If the "Save site as template" option isn't available, please make sure the<strong> SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure</strong> feature is deactivated.</p>
<p>In addition, if you want to&nbsp;transfer a site in the same site collection, in fact, we can use the<strong> Site Content and Structure</strong> feature.
<br />
Here are the steps:<br />
&nbsp;a. Enable this feature:&nbsp; Go to the root site-&gt; Site Settings-&gt; Site collection features-&gt; enable SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure.<br />
&nbsp;b. Go to Site settings-&gt; under Site Administration, click Content and structure.&nbsp; In the pop-up webpage, choose the specific site. In the drop down list, click Move, specify the destination to move the site to the destination site.<br />

<p>If support was honest they'd tell you this isn't really possible except for an empty site, which you wouldn't need to save. It's a flawed feature that should either be removed or reworked so it's useful.</p>
