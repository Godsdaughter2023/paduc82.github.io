<h2>            Access Case Management Capabilities</h2>
                    Can Access be used as an effective case management system. &nbsp;Our agency has a variety of forms, designated to specific clients which we enter into access. &nbsp;We are trying to avoid buying a case management software and are exploring all the options Access
 provides. &nbsp;In an ideal world we would like to link several forms to one client's ID number, is this possible? &nbsp;I have seen the classroom management template which looks as though it might suit our needs, but we would need that type of set-up on a much larger
 scale. &nbsp;Any thoughts?

<br />
<div>the main differences between Access 2003 and 2010 is the interface. Instead of a database window there is Navigation Pane, instead of menus and tool bars there are ribbons. Once you get into Design Mode for tables, forms, reports and reports you will be
 in familiar ground. And the VBE hasn't changed at all.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>That being said the first thing that needs to be done is to design the tables. Again, Forms are just a way to interface with the tables. A proper, normalized table structure is the foundation of a good database application. So you first need to understand
 Normalization. A Bing search for that term will get you a lot of info.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The way I start designing is to identify each finite piece of data that the app needs to capture. These finite pieces of data are then organized into a normalized table structure. From there you start designing your forms etc to integrate with your table
 structure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Whether you should outsource or not depends on your budget. Its possible to outsource pieces, for example you can outsource the table design, but do your own forms and reports.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Naor,</p>
<p>Based on my tests, it is not feasible to directly delete all items from a public folder via PowerShell. Since the amount of your deleted emails may be very large, I understand that it will be very inconvenient to do so. However, to achieve this goal via
 PowerShell, creating scripts may be required. Since our forum only focuses on the single PowerShell command, it is suggested you post this question in our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/scriptcenter/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PowerShell scripts Forum</a>.</p>
<p>Meantime, from our side, as a workaround, you can delete the public folder and re-create it again (if you want to delete all items in the public folders). Here are the steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Type in the following commands:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/aa997202(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remove a public folder</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>New-PublicFolder -Name Reports -Path \test1\test2&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Note: This example creates a public folder named Reports in the path test1\test2.</p>
<p>If you want to change any permissions for the public folder, you can check the following cmdlts:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb124743(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add-PublicFolderClientPermission</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Get-PublicFolderClientPermission "\My Public Folder"</strong></p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come up to a problem when my onenote 2016 suddenly stopped sync days ago. It says no Internet connection so that I cannot log into my account. I'm located inside a company network with proxy connecting Internet, and I use proxifier to manage the proxy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked other answers (removing credentials or disconnecting VPN) in this community but none worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got Onenote 2010 installed, it worked fine. Any idea to fix the problem? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice. The troubleshooter tool does not help to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering whether the incapability of Onenote to recognize Internet is due to a "No Internet Connection" indication shown on my network connection icon (a yellow exclamation mark)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16f76430-c82d-468b-9085-0d28f9d8b2e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16f76430-c82d-468b-9085-0d28f9d8b2e2" /></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually the Internet is connected via a proxy server, but it blocks the Windows NCSI services, which is used to detect active Internet connections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Yes, it's possible that OneNote stopped syncing because there is no Internet connection detected. We suggest that you check that out to further isolate the issue.

    <title>PowerPoint Slide Master Behavoir - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lerxst  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint Slide Master Behavoir</h2>
                    I find the behavior of PowerPoint master slides to be quite peculiar.&nbsp; There's probably something simple that I'm missing that can be explained rather quickly, but I just can't seem to cross that gap on my own.<br />
<br />
1) When viewing the master slides, it seems as if the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Title Master</span> is always the second thumbnail/page.&nbsp; Seems like it would make more sense for it to be first.&nbsp; Can anyone explain the reasoning behind this?<br />
<br />
2) What does the gray connecting line between the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Title Master </span>and the<span style="font-weight: bold"> Slide </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Master</span> indicate?<br />
<br />
3) When I go to use the new slide master I have set up (<span style="font-weight: bold">Title Master
</span>and <span style="font-weight: bold">Slide </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Master</span>), when I insert a new slide and use the Title Master layout, it puts the 2 text placeholders on the slide that are indicated by the thumbnail for<span style="font-weight: bold">
 Apply Slide Layout</span> on the right side of the screen, but it seems to ignore the
<span style="font-weight: bold">Autoshape </span>that I have on the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Title Master</span> page.<br />
<br />
4) I am trying to create a slide master template that has one <span style="font-weight: bold">
Title Master</span>, and at least four different <span style="font-weight: bold">Slide Masters</span>.&nbsp; I have created all five of the slides in the
<span style="font-weight: bold">Master View</span>, but when I close the Master View and insert a new slide, only the first of the four
<span style="font-weight: bold">Slide Masters</span> is inserted.&nbsp; Is there a way to set this up so I can choose which of the four slide masters to use?&nbsp; (The layout of the four slide masters is the same--the only difference is a different customer logo on each
 of the four).<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic">This seems to apply to both PowerPoint 2003 and 2007.</span><br />

            In 2002 / 3:<br />
<br />
Every Slide master MUST have a slide layout, OPTIONALLY you can also have a Title Layout with that Master. I guess this is why the slide layout is first.<br />
<br />
The grey line indicates that the layouts are part of the same Master<br />
<br />
If the autoshape&nbsp; from the title master is missing then you may have.<br />
<ol>
<li>Chosen the Master without a Title Master Layout<br />
</li><li>Selected background &gt; Omit graphics from master</li><li>Done something wrong!<br />
</li></ol>
<p>When you insert a new slide you should be able to go to Format &gt; Slide Design and choose the master needed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Masters and layouts in 2007 are totally different to 2003 so i don't understand this bit,<br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to think abut this slightly differently.&nbsp; As John's explained, a presentation can have many Slide Masters.&nbsp; Each Slide Master may or may not have an associated Title Master.</p>
<p>If you choose Slide Master A for your new slide and give it a Title layout, one of two things will happen:</p>
<p>1) If Slide Master A has an associated Title Master, PowerPoint will use that to format the new title slide.</p>
<p>2) If there's no Title Master, PowerPoint will apply its own default formatting for the new title slide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I have created all five of the slides in the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Master View</span>, but when I close the Master View and insert a new slide, only the first of the four
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PowerPoint never shows you the Title Masters.&nbsp; It simply applies them automatically(if they exist) when you choose to add a title slide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; Is there a way to set this up so I can choose which of the four slide masters to use?&nbsp; (The layout of the four slide masters is the same--the only difference is a different customer logo on each of the four).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You either insert a new slide and then choose the slide master you want&nbsp;it to use ( Format | Slide Design ) or duplicate an existing slide that has the master you want to use, or insert a new slide; PowerPoint will use the same master for the newly inserted
 slide as the slide you're currently viewing.</p>

<p>Hi Christos,</p>

    <title>Excel - How to sort data in columns while keeping rows intact in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hamzaezeldin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel - How to sort data in columns while keeping rows intact in several sheets simultaneously</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have data on four sheets that I would like to keep intact. Such that when I sort a column in one sheet it does not mess up the data in the other sheets. Currently, I have a sheet for general information summary, production, delivery and installation data
 of an item. I have a column for item name in every sheet along with the date that that item was last produced delivered and installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I sort the dates on my general sheet from newest to oldest production for example, It resorts my columns of item name and date in the production sheet, however all the other data that feeds into each item remains the same. So that when I enter new data
 being produced into one item, it is still inputting it into the item that corresponded to it when the formula was initially made before the sort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically my question is, how to keep rows intact no matter what. It sounds like a simple concept to me to have rows linked or build a relationship between cells in a row such that excel knows they are connected and should stay together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making rows stay intact within the same sheet is simple. My issue is with data that is connected between 2 or more sheets that rely on each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            There was an error opening this document message</h2>
                    <p>I've built a number of PowerPoint presentations with links included. I usually build them and transfer them to USB and a notebook that's used to carry to our presentation site. While doing a trial run on the most recent presentation, I found that an error
 message pops up when attempting to execute the links. The error message states, "There was an error opening this document. This file cannot be found."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting thing, when I select "ok", the document connected to the respective link appears. In a nutshell, I'm having to acknowledge (ok) the error message before the document appears. What may be the problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Dropdown compatibility issues for IE 8 to IE11</h2>
                    <p>I am making compatible my Asp.net 4.o web application from IE9 browser to IE11. some times as per program logic I have only one item to display in the dropdown list. I am using &lt;asp:DropDownList ID="DropDownList1" runat="server"&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IN IE9 Browser:</strong><br />
when I click on the dropdown , the list is displaying in the browser as I mentioned in the screen below (We can observe that for one&nbsp;item&nbsp;the&nbsp;list is appearing)</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0cc7968-e96b-419f-9937-a5c416c36d46" height="166" width="386" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>IN IE11 Browser:</strong><br />
When I click on the dropdown, the list is not displaying for one item in the browser and it is appearing as it got stuck. In screenshot we can observe the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f0ac71e-cd62-4a3f-acb8-a5eeccd0941c" /><br />
Now the client wants the functionality <strong>of IE8 dropdown list to appear in IE11</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>should not force from the application to use IE8 browser compatibility.</p>
<p>Please suggest<strong> how can I get the functionality</strong> of dropdown in IE11 as same in IE8.</p>

<h2>            Virus that Wouldn&#39;t Allow Browsers to Open and System Restore Claims it Failed</h2>
                    <p><strong>I was attempting to download a file off of an internet website. I had used the site previously and never had any issues. The download looked a little odd, and I should have listened to my instinct, but I had never had a problem before, so I okayed
 it. Bad idea.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suddenly, Microsoft Security Essentials pops up that I have a problem. I delete the file everywhere I can find it and start running Microsoft Security Essentials. I have Google Chrome and Internet Explorer browsers on my computer, though Google Chrome
 is the only one I typically use.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I opened my task manager, and all of a sudden, my Chrome disappeared as if I hadn't just been using it. I attempted to reboot it, but it said something to the extent of, "Cannot find file. Must have been renamed, moved, or deleted". I attempted to
 use Internet Explorer, but it just said the same thing. The only way I could access internet was hitting the "?" button on the top right of my Security Essentials page. Everything started running incredibly slow and all these pop-ups were coming up on the
 internet. I never have pop-ups!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I looked up the basic problem quickly, and decided to do a system restore to 5 days ago. I thought the problem would be over and done with.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When the computer started back up, it said,&nbsp;<em>"System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed. Details: An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. &nbsp;</em></strong>(0xc000003a)&nbsp;<strong><em>You
 can try System Restore again and choose a different restore point. If you continue to see this error, you can try and advanced recovery method. For more information, see&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What is Recovery?</span>".</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am running another scan with Microsoft Security Essentials, and almost 75% of the way in, it hasn't encountered any problems. My computer is running fine and my browser (Chrome) will open now. I just don't quite understand. If the System Restore
 failed, wouldn't my computer still be in a really messed-up state, like it was before? Is it possible at all for a virus to be lying dormant and not be caught by my Microsoft Anti-Virus program? I apologize, I just don't want to assume it's over and start
 having issues again.</strong></p>
<p><strong>--The only thing I did notice that is different... I had a "Theme" on my Google Chrome. Now it is gone. Everything else seems ok so far.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Any help/comments/suggestions/ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thank you very much!!</strong></p>
<p>*Please, try not to be too crazy technical about it. I am no computer genius. I just know a little.</p>

You didn't say if you did something to/in Windows or Office before the Analysis thingy went missing.<br />
<br />
My take is that the "template" may be a third party Excel add-in.<br />
Have you checked the Excel add-ins list to see if it is shown there?<br />

                    I have once chosen an image I would like to see on the lock screen (you know, the one you should slide up to unlock the phone)<br />
But recently sometimes when I turn the phone display on after locking it I see different image?<br />
I tried to go to the phone settings and to explicitly set my image as a wallpaper - it didn't help<br />
Is this a windows phone bug or what?<br />

Thank you - I was able to connect using another profile - the data file was new. I tried to add the old data file and it gave me the same error message along with an indication that there is a registry problem. It suggested to close Outlook and restart and
 if that didn't work to re-install. I have already re-installed 4 times - the problem still persists. I was able to rename the old data file and I can work with this - but that doesn't solve the problem. What is your recommendation to fix this registry problem?

            this seems to be a data file file corruption and that is why you are not able to use the old data file. Run a repair on the old data file thats a possible fix and then import the data into the new data file. Refer to this link to repair data file:

    <title>Microsoft Store shows wrong movie languages for Brazilian customers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fernacolo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Store shows wrong movie languages for Brazilian customers</h2>
                    <p>Today I wanted to see a movie at home, and my Apple TV is lent to my aunt, therefore I decided to try my XBox One. I went to Movies &amp; TV application, and watching the Wonder Woman trailer, I decided to buy it (not just rent). The trailer shows English audio
 with Brazilian-Portuguese subtitles, which happens to be my only choice for watching foreign movies (and also for many Brazilians AFAIK, which prefers more natural acting). I even paid the priciest HD version, another absolute requirement for my movies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my surprise, the purchased movie only shows dubbed audio in Brazilian-Portuguese, and without subtitles. That is something completely different from the trailer! I can't watch that movie - it hurts when I see character's lips moving along with a completely
 unnatural speaking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, I tried to get a refund. R$49,90 is a big value for any Brazilian. And found there is no such option!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will have to call to support at business hour, probably waste hours trying to explain the entire situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come-on, Microsoft! You had the opportunity to take money that would go to Apple! How could you just waste that in such poor experience?!?</p>

<p>This option was not available to me before. I then updated XBox One system along with all apps, and now the store/movies app displays a different purchase experience, which much more clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, when I go to my purchased items, the title only shows the wrong version (purchased due to the bad UI of previous app version). I can't simply switch it to use different audio/subtitles. I tried to remove that purchase and go back to the item in the
 store, and it only shows the "Play" button with grayed audio option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, I'm stuck with the wrong version, and I'm not even able to purchase the right version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a terrible experience compared with Apple TV, Netflix and others. I'm OK with charging more for HD (versus SD), but all audio/subtitle idioms should never be a purchase option.</p>

            <p>Adding or replacing a SIM just changes the provider and does not require a new backup.</p>
<p>Your phone will continue to do auto backups to your OneDrive as before.</p>
<p>The only thing you need to backup to the PC is documents, videos, pictures and music. These are not part of phone backup.</p>

<h2>            Publisher 2010 - Print fails and we get &#34;Publisher cannot complete the operation.&#34;</h2>
                    Just started after 2 months of working ok. Also, sometimes publisher crashes after this or loses all the network printers (there are no local printers). Publisher is a stand-alone on this machine, though there is an older version of Office on the machine.
 We're running no add-ins, and I've tried a new printer driver. I've done a repair and most of the other fixes I've found on here, but nothing works.

            Thanks, Daniel. I have seen that thread and tried the items in it, with no success. This was a single file that had several pictures in it (it was rather large). We removed the pictures and still had the problem. Then we took some of the more complicated
 graphics and merged them into jpegs to cut the size even more. Same issue. The work-around we have found is to turn the whole thing into a jpeg, but that is a work-around, not a solution.

            <p>I was able to do something similar - basically saving the file as a PDF and then printing (however color hues were shifted; nothing terrible, but not ideal either: for example, a light grey background became light pinkish greyish). Another workaround is
 to print less pages at a time. My file is not final yet (graphics intensive) so not sure that workaround will continue to work once I finish adding all the imagery across many pages, but I suspect that it should. The funny thing is that I am able to print
 with no issues in a B/W printer or a different color printer at letter size (my document is tabloid size 11x17).</p>

            <p>I know this is a year-old topic, but I ran across the same issue myself recently&nbsp;and wanted to share my experiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought it had to do with a large number of images (I'm creating a temporary in-company catalog with 4500 items), however it worked fine before even though I recently added new and larger size images.</p>
<p>After some retries I&nbsp;noticed that the problem seemed to have&nbsp;first started to occur in the version in which I added pagenumbers. However I only found the option to add them, not to remove them and clicking header/footer even gave me the same error even when
 working in the non-data connected version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went back to an earlier version, <strong>without pagenumbers</strong>, and now it generates my print/pdf without issues!</p>
<p>So, at least for me, the issue is now solved.</p>

    <title>Lumia 530 corrupt apps in SD Card - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lumia 530 corrupt apps in SD Card</h2>
                    <p>Hi, guys from MS.<br />
<br />
I bought a brand new Lumia 530 Dual SIM two weeks ago, with Windows Phone 8.1 preinstalled at factory.<br />
<br />
Since It has only 4GB of internal storage, I had to add a MicroSD card to achieve more storage space for my apps &amp; files</p>
<p>Unfortunately, If I move ANY app to my SD Card, it becomes corrupted after the first boot I perform.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried many times, reset the phone, it´s always the same: even when I manage to install the apps into phone memory and then move it to SD card, it only works until the next boot. After the boot, just blank tiles and non-launching apps. I tried even with
 MS apps: minesweeper, mahjong, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I can´t even CONFIGURE the SD Card as the default target for new downloads: doing this prevent the store app to install new apps. The store keeps the downloads at "Pending" forever, it's just UNABLE to write the app to the SD card.<br />
<br />
I tried MANY different SD cards, all the same. Currently I'm using a brand-new SanDisk 8 GB class 10 card, but I tried with others (2 GB, 4 GB, class 4, and so on)<br />
I AM RESTRICTED TO THE MINIMAL 4GB PHONE MEMORY FOR MY APPS!!!!<br />
<br />
Nokia Care (Brasil) says that it is a Windows problem. My colleague at work (who is also a Microsoft MCP too) is facing exactly the same problem, with another Lumia 530 Dual SIM.<br />
<br />
What can we do???? Seems to happen ONLY with Lumias 530 Dual SIM. What is the matter?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Format the SD in FAT32 in your PC, then try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If problem persists use the nokia software recovery tool here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If problem persists you will need to bring the phone to repair or ask for a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Email Signature not reflecting Active Directory settings</h2>
                    In a business environment, I have a user whose email signature is displaying their cell phone number. In active directory, the "mobile number" is blank. In Office365 admin center I go to delete her cell phone number and an error states I need to edit in
 active directory. Any suggestions? I have tried using N/A in Active Directory in place of a number but still no luck
