<h2>            Certificate error on military websites.</h2>
                    <blockquote>
<p>The above instructions tells me in order to download the DoD certificate, I need to go to the above web site.&nbsp; the above web site won't let me on because I don't have the DoD Certificate that I'm looking for.</p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p>

Sorry, Win XP ver 2002 Service Pack 3. and IE 8.0.6 128 bit cypher streanth.&nbsp; To add to the above message, I noticed that when&nbsp; I go to the site it&nbsp; won't let me on due to certificate error as a sub account, but if I go to the same site and I'm logged in as
 Administrator, it warns me but lets me in.&nbsp; Do you know why?</p>

            <p>What type of threat is ESET detecting the file as....an actual virus, Trojan, potentially unwanted program (PUP)?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.herdprotect.com/vibersetup.exe-cb1701fe6ee6c070ae1d2a29fb6a1b061780d6eb.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>herdprotect analysis of vibersetup.exe</strong></a> indicates the detection most likely is a "false positives."
<br />
<br />
The most recent <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/31cee7f33440d9e09a5548948dfbb74e304b3fc453c47650975f869d307b9dae/analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>virustotal analysis of vibersetup.exe</strong></a> indicates the detection is a variant of Win32/Toolbar.SearchSuite.W.gen (aka adware, aka potentially unwanted program).<br />
<br />
A <strong><a href="http://www.techterms.com/definition/pup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)</span></a></strong> is a very broad threat category which can encompass any number of different programs to include those
 which are benign as well as problematic. Thus, this type of detection does not always necessarily mean the file is malicious or a bad program. PUPs in and of themselves are not always bad...many are generally known, non-malicious but unwanted software usually
 containing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">adware</span></a> or
<strong>bundled</strong> with other free third-party software to include toolbars, add-ons/plug-ins and browser extensions. PUPs are considered unwanted because they can cause undesirable system performance or other problems and are sometimes installed without
 the user's consent since they are often included when downloading legitimate programs.
<strong>PUPs may also be defined somewhat differently by various security vendors and may or may not be detected/removed based on that definition</strong>. That fact adds to confusion and a lot of complaints from end users asking why a detection was not made
 on a particular file (program) they are having issues with. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some programs falling into the PUP category have legitimate uses in contexts where an authorized user or administrator has knowingly installed it. Since PUP detections do not necessarily mean the file is malicious or a bad program, in some cases the detection
 may be a "<a href="http://antivirus.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-false.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">false positive</span></a>". Anti-virus/Anti-Malware scanners
<strong>cannot distinguish</strong> between "good" and "malicious" use of such programs, therefore they may alert you or even automatically
<strong>remove</strong> them. Usually, if you installed or recognize the program and it is not causing any issues, you can ignore the detection or add to it's exclusion list. If not or you downloaded it from an untrusted site, then you need to investigate further.</p>

    <title>Old Hotmail avatar and description in recipient e-mails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Old Hotmail avatar and description in recipient e-mails</h2>
                    <p>Making overdue efforts to tackle an unfortunate problem that seems irreparable since change from Hotmail to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E-mails I send display an incredibly old profile picture and a basic information quote that was ironic &amp; juvenile at the time, but is now inappropriate in professional circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These profile features were edited back in the days of Hotmail, and since the change to Outlook there does not appear to be a function to edit them now in order to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Hotmail has, is, and I hope will continue to be my primary personal e-mail address, but under the current circumstances I can't consider it as a long term option.</p>

            <p>Hi Andria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid that advice is not solving the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is to do with recipients of my e-mails and the content they see on my contact card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they receive my e-mails, they see an old photo I uploaded years ago when it was Hotmail, not the one that is currently set as my profile picture on Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when they hover over this picture they see an unfortunate and inappropriate short bio on my contact card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have screenshots to illustrate this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the change from Hotmail to Outlook, I have not been able to edit these fields.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing inconvenience and if there is any detailed way of how to rectify this problem I need to find it immediately.</p>

<br />
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you're running 64-bit Windows 7, you have both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer installed. They both install on 64-bit systems.</p>
<p>You can determine which version is open by hitting Alt to display the Menu Bar, then going to Help&gt; About Internet Explorer. If 64-bit isn't specified, the 32-bit version is open.</p>
<p>This may be as simple as the target of the IE icons being the 64-bit version.</p>
<p>When you right-click the IE icons in the Quick Launch area, the Start Menu and the desktop then choose Properties, what's in the Target field?<br />
<br />
Targets should be either:<br />
(32-bit)&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"<br />
(64-bit)&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"<br />
<br />
Modify those Targets to be&nbsp; "C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"&nbsp; (include the quotes) and the 32-bit version of IE8 should open.<br />
<br />
To create a shortcut to 64-bit IE8, for occasional use, browse to the iexplore.exe file at C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe. Right-click iexplore.exe and Send To&gt; Desktop (create shortcut.) Rename that shortcut so you know it's the shortcut to
 64-bit IE8.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />
Don</p>

    <title>Manually Adding Shared Mailbox to Outlook 2013 Issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Manually Adding Shared Mailbox to Outlook 2013 Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hello All,<br />
<br />
The issue that we are currently experiencing is a shared mailbox has not automatically appeared in the Outlook Profiles of any of the users assigned to it. The Shared Mailbox was created approximately 21 hours ago as of this writing. When attempting to add
 the mailbox manually, Outlook 2013 becomes unresponsive for upwards of 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I have been trying to find a solution to this all morning. Here are the procedures I have done so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>I created a new shared mailbox in Exchange Online. I have added myself and three other users both as "Full Access" and "Send As" permissions. All users are able to add the Shared mailbox in OWA using this method:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-Outlook-Web-App-bc127866-42be-4de7-92ae-1ef2f787fd5c#__toc374009393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-Outlook-Web-App-bc127866-42be-4de7-92ae-1ef2f787fd5c#__toc374009393</a><br />
<br />
All Users can successfully receive and send email through the Shared Mailbox Address in OWA without issue.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I attempted to add the Shared Mailbox manually in Outlook 2013 by going to File &gt; Account Settings, then double clicking the primary email address that had been granted permissions, and clicking More Settings. On the Advanced tab, I clicked Add, then added
 the SMTP address of the Shared Mailbox. Clicking Apply or OK results in Outlook 2013 becoming unresponsive for at least 15 minutes. After restarting Outlook 2013, the Shared Mailbox appears, however attempting to expand the folders results in Outlook 2013
 becoming unresponsive indefinitely. This is the case for all users.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I have tried removing and re-adding the user permissions with no change in behavior. I have also attempted to apply the users as "Full Access" OR "Send As" instead of both permissions with no change in behavior.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I have attempted to create a new profile in Outlook 2013 with no change in behavior.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I have attempted to add the Shared Mailbox as a separate account as outlined in this method:
<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msoutlook.info/question/841</a><br />
However, the continues to search for server settings indefinitely. </li></ol>
<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi ArianaPagano,</p>
<p>Since you have deployed a hybrid environment, I’d like to confirm whether the Autodiscover record is pointed to your on-premise server.
<br />
If so, this is a normal behavior.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, please create a new shared mailbox on-premise, then get it synced to Office 365, and grant Full Access permission of the shared mailbox to the users on the cloud side.</p>
<p>After that, please check to see if the issue can be fixed.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Vivian</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Hello Vivian,</p>
<p>Thank you again for your help.</p>
<p>Yes, in our hybrid deployment, the Autodiscover record&nbsp;is pointed to our on-premises server.</p>
<p>Your suggestions&nbsp;did solve my issue, however I also needed to migrate the newly created On-Premises Shared Mailbox to Exchange Online after syncing it. For posterity, here is the procedure I followed in order for the Shared Mailbox to automap in the Outlook
 Client within our hybrid deployment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the Shared Mailbox in the Exchange Admin Center on our On-Premises server.
</li><li>Perform a DirSync in order for the Shared Mailbox UPN to be synced to Office 365.
</li><li>Migrate the On-Premises Shared mailbox to Exchange Online. </li><li>Assign the "Full Access" permission to users. </li><li>The Shared Mailbox automapped to the Outlook Client for users in question within an hour.
</li></ol>
<p>Thank you again for your insight on this. It was greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Hotmail not receiving emails on ipad mini</h2>
                    <p>Since yesterday one of my ipad minis has stopped receiving emails. It goes to "checking for mail" then says updated yesterday. My ipad mini 2 is fine and I have verified that the setings are the same on both machines.</p>
<p>I can send email on the one with the problem.</p>
<p>I have re-entered password but that doesn't work. I have switched the account on and off, switched wifi on and off, gone to airplane mode and re-booted. Powered down also to no avail.</p>
<p>if I delete the account will all my saved emails disappear and will it also delete the hotmail account on my ipad mini?</p>
<p>i am not very computer savvy.</p>

</p><p>No, your emails will remain intact. Go ahead and remove your Hotmail account and set it up again in your iPad.</p>

            You can, but I advise you leave them alone as they're used for notifications also. Most of them are stored in the phone's main memory. Again, I would leave them alone if I were you. That is what I do.

            so you could delete them and if you ever really needed them a hard reset will bring them all back if you didn't save them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were to decide to do that, I would look to see what ones are needed for reminders etc.<br />

<h2>            EXCEL 2010 tick marks on horizontal axis.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span>I have an XY chart, and the data on the horizontal axis spans from 4,998 to 11,001.&nbsp; Through the "Format axis", "Axis options", I made the minimum and maximum values on
 the horizontal axis fixed at 4,000 and 12,000, with tick marks at every 1,000, as in Plot 1.&nbsp; But that leaves a large part of the plot area unused, between 4,000 and 4,998, and between 11,001 and 12,000, and I do not like its appearance.&nbsp; If I set the minimum
 to 4,998 and the maximum to 11,001, and set the major units to 1,000, there are tick marks at 4,998, 5,998, 6,998, etc., and end at 10,998, as in Plot 2, which is not what I want because I want ticks at easy-to-read labels, as in Plot 1.&nbsp; In other words, I
 want to set the minimum to 4998, maximum to 11,001, tick marks at every 1,000, but put tick marks on the horizontal axis at 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, etc.&nbsp; Does anybody know how I can do that?&nbsp; I am using Excel 2010 with Windows 7.&nbsp; Thanks.</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/316a9143-d757-4867-88d9-a547f789cb6e" /></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this can only be done with a helper series. With your second chart screenshot, add a data series whose Y values are all 0 and the X values are 5000, 6000, etc. Remove the X axis labels, tick marks and grid lines. Make the data marker of the new series a
 + sign, so it sits on the X axis and looks like a tick mark. Add data labels for the value below the marker. Add error bars to emulate the vertical grid lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot with values that are not just 2 but 50 ticks off the full 1000 grid. Vertical grid lines are error bars, not chart grid lines.</p>

            <p>It's official - I'm an IDIOT!&nbsp; There is a missing line of code in the DoRecalculate() routine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right before the End Sub we need to restart the timer!!!&nbsp; So it should look something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Private Sub DoRecalculate()<br />
&nbsp; Application.Calculate ' recalculate all open workbooks<br />
&nbsp; 'you can be specific as to what sheet to work with<br />
&nbsp; 'Worksheets("sheetname").Calculate ' change sheetname as needed<br />
&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;'We MUST restart the timer so it will trigger again later!!!!</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; Run "StartTimer"</strong><br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, on to your questions:&nbsp; the timer settings as to what to run and when to run it are stored internal to Excel, much like a scheduled event in Windows Task Scheduler.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, the "run what" is the routine named DoRecalculate.&nbsp; The StartTimer routine sets up the NEXT time to run the named process.&nbsp; But when it runs, the 'scheduler' promptly forgets about it - that is why we need the added line of code in that process,
 so that it gets placed in the scheduled events list to run again when you want it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the StopTimer() routine does is take it out of the Excel scheduled events list if it is in it.&nbsp; If you don't do this, it will actually try to run again and force the workbook to be opened - that's why we call it when you close the workbook.&nbsp; But if you
 happen to have manually run StopTimer, it won't be in the list to be stopped and Excel would throw a run-time error - that's the reason for the On Error Resume Next statement: to ignore that error if it takes place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for not having provided proper code initially.&nbsp; My only excuse is that I was cleaning out old, unrelated things in that section and just went a little too far in that cleanup.</p>

            <p>No - if you started it at 11:44 it will run at 12:05</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll work up changes so you could make it run every 5 minutes or even every 30 seconds - but I specifically rewrote the code to do as you had asked: run at 5 minutes past the hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 places in the StartTimer routine where you will see this code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>RunWhen = DateSerial(Year(Now()), Month(Now()), Day(Now())) + _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TimeSerial(Hour(Now()) + 1, 5, 0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>change both of those to become</p>
<p>RunWhen =&nbsp;Now() + _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TimeSerial(0, 5, 0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>and it would run every 5 minutes beginning 5 minutes after you open the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In TimeSerial() the first value is hours, the second is minutes, the last is seconds.&nbsp; So if you wanted it to run every 30 seconds:</p>
<p>RunWhen = Now() + _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TimeSerial(0,&nbsp;0, 30)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember to either save, close and reopen the workbook to start the timer&nbsp; OR you can go to the code and click anywhere in the StartTimer code and press the [F5] button to run that code without saving, closing and reopening the workbook.&nbsp; You can then close
 the VBA editor by pressing [Alt]+[Q].</p>

            <p>Dear Glenneave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your posting, there are a few reasons this could occur.&nbsp; The first is if you have your targeting settings set to show based on intent.&nbsp; These settings can be found when you go into your campaign or ad group level targeting settings and check
 the advanced options at the bottom.&nbsp; Make sure you have selected to only show in your targeted location and that India is excluded in the targeting settings.&nbsp; Another thing we find sometimes is having targeting set at the ad group level.&nbsp; This will over rule
 the campaign level and could cause the ad to show in places you may not want.&nbsp; If you would like to have us personally take a look at it for you please chat in with us, or call us at 1-800-518-5689.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            Create XSLT to edit XML file importing to Access</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to import a XML file into an access database. The XML file looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;customer&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;fname&gt;aaa&lt;/fname&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;lname&gt;bbb&lt;/lname&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/customer&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;contact&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;phone&gt;111&lt;/phone&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;address&gt;1234 Main st.&lt;/address&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/contact&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;personal&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;dob&gt;1/1/11&lt;/dob&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;gender&gt;F&lt;/gender&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/personal&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is causing Access to import three tables: Customer, Contact, and Personal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to create a XSLT file that will flatten this so it imports as one table. I want the XML file to look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;fname&gt;aaa&lt;/fname&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;lname&gt;bbb&lt;/lname&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;phone&gt;111&lt;/phone&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;address&gt;1234 Main st.&lt;/address&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;dob&gt;1/1/11&lt;/dob&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;gender&gt;F&lt;/gender&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried all sorts of various codes and nothing seems to be working. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi jcpecht,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help get a better understanding of your issue, what application are you using to create the initial XML file?<span>&nbsp;
</span>The reason I ask is because I would assume you need to adjust how this application exports the data to xml in order for Access to import it correctly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Or are you trying to also use Access to modify the structure of the XML file before importing it?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks Nathan! The data is pulling from an Adobe PDF form and I've tried adopting the form but it is still exporting with different children/levels. I'm hoping by creating a transformation file, I can use the filel in Access to modify the strucutre of
 the XML file.

<div>I have the same question.</div>
<div>I have thought to creating an ID column into Customer table to work like a primary key and creating the corresponding foreign key into the others tables. All could be created in &nbsp;runtime using SQL language. What do you think about? Maybe it could not run
 fast enough.</div>

</p><p>But, today, I didn't do that (my bad). &nbsp;I had a lengthy email composed, about ready to send when &nbsp;(I think) I may have hit a hotkey that completely deleted the message. I know about Ctrl+Z, but that doesn't undo whatever I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am writing an email in Hotmail (Outlook), the web based program saves draft every so often. In my case, it appears that &nbsp;as soon as the long email disappeared, Hotmail(Outlook saved a blank email because that was all that remained in the drafts folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is that draft saved? If it is saved onto a Hotmail (Outlook) server, how can a keyboard mishit delete the saved draft as well as the message on screen? If it is saved somewhere on my hard drive, what accidental keystroke could cause a delete?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not using a laptop so it can't be inadvertently hitting the track pad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accept that the situation is a result of my typing inaccuracy but it ought not be so easy to completely erase something with a single errant keystroke. At least, in a word processing program, the software will ask "Are you sure you want to delete this?"</p>
<p>

            Hi <strong>Jerry</strong>,<br />

Regarding your concern with the deleted composed message, we'd like to verify if you're still experiencing the same issue. Also, we'd like to know how many instances you were able to experience such. Kindly let us know if you need further assistance.<br />
<br />
We hope to hear from you soon.

<p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not experiencing the same issue (which is NOT the same as "I am no longer experiencing the issue").</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Not experiencing" implies that the problem no longer exists. "No longer experiencing" only speaks to the fact that FOR SOME REASON (not necessarily related to the source of the problem) it is not recurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been avoiding using the Hotmail/Outlook window to write my emails. &nbsp;I compose them in a word processing program that, at least, with give me a warning (and ask me "Are you sure?) before it is about to delete something. Once completed, I copy/paste into
 the Hotmail/Outlook window. It is a workaround but not a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past I've experienced the issue a handful of times and, no doubt, would have experienced it further without the workaround.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mother, on the other hand, has had it happen more often. She doesn't use Hotmail/Outlook but I'm guessing that two PCs using a similar OS (mine is Win7 Home Premium hers is Win7 Professional) share the same hotkey commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further assistance ? To be honest, that implies past assistance and the only responses I've received are one asking me if anyone had responded (no one had) and the response you so kindly sent me, today 08/26/2017. That being the case, yes, I would like to
 find out which hotkey not only deletes an unsent email but removes it from "Drafts" so that recovery is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Eileen, I'm tagging onto this thread since I posted a similar problem several weeks ago.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I experience it every time</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; With me, if I take a break from typing for more than 2-3 minutes, MS shoves my email into drafts.&nbsp;&nbsp; It took me months to figure this out.&nbsp; In drafts, once you open it, your doc is ready to go.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I don't want MS to second guess me as to what I want to do with my work.&nbsp; Who is MS to day I've stepped away from my computer for too long so we're going to punish you.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;I compose most of my email communications in my office computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not have this problem with my Dell home computer as much which is a bit older machine by 12 months or so and my compositions seem to be a bit shorter,</p>

<p>The browsers that you're using when you compose the email can be a part of the reasons for the email deletion. There's no specific hotkey that can be used to permanently delete a composed email. However,<strong> Ctrl+Z</strong> is the most common command
 to undo changes in many computer programs and that may help in recovery in some cases. When it comes to the keyboard shortcuts in Outlook, you may check on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keyboard-shortcuts-in-Outlook-on-the-web-63df572e-1078-4562-b45e-b93e07a76ffb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for more information.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Outlook</strong> will automatically attempt to save any email message every three minutes that you create but don’t send. This is to ensure that you don't have to recompose any messages. To isolate your issue, we'd like to know which version of Outlook
 you're using. <br />

<p>The problem now is when we try to turn off Focused inbox feature for individual user through power shell but&nbsp; user still gets in their mobile devices and FI works fine in devices.

<h2>            Windows 10 unable to detect secondary display</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two Dell 24" monitors on my Win10 box. The monitors both worked perfectly as dual until an update or either Win10, the AMD video drivers, or both.<br />
<br />
Now, Windows sees one big screen rather than two monitors and "cannot detect" a second monitor. The AMD Radeon Settings app, correctly identifies both monitors.<br />
<br />
So what changed is one question, but most importantly, how do I get Windows to "see" both my monitors?<br />
<br />
TIA.</p>

            <p>Hello Tia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to understand the issue better, let us know what do you mean when you say 'worked perfectly as dual until an update or either Win10, the AMD video drivers, or both.'</p>
<p>Also, which Windows settings did you refer to when you say "cannot detect" a second monitor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that currently Windows&nbsp;is set to use
<strong>Extended display</strong>. In this case, you would like to set display to
<strong>Mirrored</strong> or <strong>External Display only</strong> or <strong>PC Screen only</strong>.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Next, check if updating/rolling back the video driver helps to resolve the issue. Follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>First of all, Press <strong>Windows logo + R</strong> from keyboard. It will open
<strong>RUN</strong>.</li><li>Now type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and press Enter to open Device Manager.</li><li>You will see all the driver list of your PC. Expand <strong>Display Adapters</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update driver&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are still unable to get the secondary monitor detected, then you may try to update the latest display drivers from manufacturer websites and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Rollback driver&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If all above recommendations fail, this would be the final step before reinstalling the drivers.</p>
<p>Double click on your video driver in <em>Device Manager</em>. Then Click on <em>

            <p>Thanks Sayan.<br />
<br />
Let me clarify. Before last Friday my Windows 10 system was using the two monitors in dual monitor mode exactly as expected. I stretched my desktop over the two monitors and was able to have my task bar only show on the left (primary) monitor.
<br />
<br />
Then something changed on Friday or Saturday. The change was not intentional by me. I suspect an update from Windows or AMD as both have had updates over the past few days. Regardless of the cause, I now have either mirrored monitors (1920 x 1200 resolution)
 or I can stretch my monitor over both screens (5120 x 1600 resolution). Needless to say this is less than ideal.<br />
</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below, Windows does not detect the second monitor so there is no option to select "duel" or any other option. This same lack of detection occurs at any resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e11de46b-84a8-48a6-ac2b-3a72be973cd3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e11de46b-84a8-48a6-ac2b-3a72be973cd3" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as you can see from the second image, the AMD software correctly identifies two monitors. When using the 1920 x 1200 resolution the monitors overlap (pictured below) and when in 5120 x 1600 resolution, the two monitors are correctly numbered one
 and two.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ff7609b-672c-40d1-a1ba-83819cfc9fd1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ff7609b-672c-40d1-a1ba-83819cfc9fd1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I went through the troubleshooting that you provided and have the same result.
<br />
<br />
And other thoughts on how I can get my dual screens back?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

            <p>hi, similarly here.<strong><em>it's been working fine </em></strong>with my extended monitor until early this week. tried everything - mine is a HP touchscreen Sleekbook 4. with a hdmi out to a vga monitor. however, somehow, 2 days ago, noticed this option
 appearing on the built in display + monitor option. I have this additional "Digital SyncMaster" option appeared. I selected that "Built In + Digital SyncMaster" &amp; viola it worked. Didn't think anything about it until the next day when I powered up my laptop.
 this option disappeared &amp; back to same problem again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried: rollback, disabled &amp; enabling again, even installed HP Intel Drivers Update Utility 2.6 &amp; updated everything. it's driving me nuts.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When a Skype account is merged to a Microsoft account, you will use a single password to sign into a Microsoft service that is not Skype (eg. OneDrive, Outlook.com, Xbox, etc.). This means you will no longer use your Skype password to sign in, even for Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're sign in to Skype but don't see your contacts, you probably just signed in to a different account. Here is what we can do:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Identify the account name you use to sign in to your phone. Is it via an email address, phone number or Skype Name? You can refer to this link
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here. </a></li><li>Sign out of Skype, and then sign back in. </li><li>Still don't see your contacts? Try signing in using any email address you have previously used to sign in to any Microsoft services. Use our
<a href="http://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">account diagnostic tool</span></a>&nbsp;to enter your phone number and find out if you have more than one Skype account. We can also help reset your password if you need to.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <title>Workaround to limit in space in the criteria box in query design - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> w.m.mitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Workaround to limit in space in the criteria box in query design view&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>(As quick background, I inherited a db in its most raw and basic state. &nbsp;There is very little automation in it, i.e., only a handful; of forms. &nbsp;There wasn't even a switchboard until I created one! &nbsp;Phew!)</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I ran into a limitation today. &nbsp;I was required to filter out about 44 companies from our database in one of the queries. &nbsp;I used this type of syntax below (I'll use some electronics companies here as examples):
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not like "*philips*" AND not like "*Samsung*" AND not like "*Sony*" AND ...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and so on down the long line.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I ran out of space. &nbsp;I was typing along and then hit a wall and couldn't enter any more criteria text. &nbsp;I haven't developed so intensely in Access since 2005 and this isn't something I've run into before. &nbsp;Because I ran out of room, I ended up having to
 give a miss to the last 5 companies on the list which meant I had to later go to the Excel exported output sheet and delete all corresponding records which turned out to be about 80 rows in total.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Until things change, since we have to use this method for now, what other options do we have when filtering in the query to work around the limit in text that can be entered? &nbsp;Are we truly limited by a set number of characters in one sole criteria box
 or is there something else that can be done, as well??</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>p.s., I consider myself a beginner-intermediate Access developer, not a complete novice but not very advanced either, so hoping there's something that I can manage to do within the query until we fix the db probably some months down the road.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>p.s., Eventually I'd like to build something that the users can perhaps use pulldown boxes (or whatever) to draw upon the names already in the db and that way I and other users will be able to filter out companies using a very easy method without all the
 typing and real possible user errors that can happen with the method I had to use today.</div>

Take a look at the file MultiSelect.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
In the Click event procedure of the frmEmployeeDlg form which is opened from the <i>
'Filter Report by WhereCondition Argument'</i> button on the opening form, change the string expression for the criteria to exclude rather than include the selected employees from:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = "EmployeeID In(" &amp; strEmployeeIDList &amp; ")"<br />
to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = "EmployeeID <b>Not</b> In(" &amp; strEmployeeIDList &amp; ")"<br />
<br />
The report will then report the employees not selected.<br />
<br />
Note that when building the value list for the In operator when looping through the ItemsSelected collection earlier in the code in the same procedure you will need to delimit each value with quotes characters if the values are of text data type, rather than
 a number data type as in my example.<br />

Well, it's not quite so bad. &nbsp;It's a large text field with one company per record but, yes, your example is spot on - i.e., Philips Inc., Philips AG, Philips Electronics, that sort of thing. &nbsp;And then there are multiple members per each company ... so quite
 a task to filter out different sets of companies twice a week!

<div>Youch. &nbsp;I hate to say it but this seems beyond me at this point. &nbsp;A whole new table with a numeric CompanyID for Access's use (behind-the-scenes??) sounds great but I can't picture all the details of what to do to accomplish this. &nbsp;And the time involved
 ... &lt;sigh&gt;. &nbsp;My boss will definitely not go for any sort of re-structuring at this time. &nbsp;That's part of the problem, needing to work with what I have at this time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>----------------------</div>
<div>Bottom line, until such time as I learn enough to fix some of the db's design flaws or I convince my boss to bring in a developer to do that (not sure how well that will go across ...), is there absolutely _no_ workaround to the maximum character limitation
 in the query criteria box??????</div>
<div>----------------------</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've found out, as I mentioned above, that I need to do 2 output files a week from the db and they'll involve different exclusions for different reasons each and every time. &nbsp;I can figure out a way to create the exclusions outside of Access. &nbsp;A simple
 gui using a scripting program I know very well will streamline and speed up that part of the query - getting the exclusions into the criteria field - but having to manually edit the data output in Excel to finish filtering out the relevant companies adds too
 much extra time to the process; disheartening esp. when knowing that it takes Access milliseconds to do!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Pls advise.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>----------------------</div>
<div>p.s., what is the maximum number of characters the criteria field can handle in a query, anyone know?</div>

            <blockquote>The only alternative I can suggest is to switch to SQL View and tpe your string directly into there.
</blockquote>
I've never gone into that view, so that was pretty neat seeing how that works.<br />
<br />
The syntax adds some extra wording to accommodate the table name.&nbsp; However, no worries.&nbsp; Until such time as my boss approves having a proper and bona-fide developer come in to help with this db (if at all), I've got an external gui written in a scripting language
 where I just type in the company names to filter out and will get a text string that can then be copied to the clipboard with the push of a button.&nbsp; Then that can just be dumped into the criteria box.&nbsp; That'll save a lot of typing time and will help eliminate
 user error during the typing process.&nbsp; If there are any missing companies in the filter due to the maximum-character limitation in the criteria field, I'll just add manually to the SQL view.&nbsp; Will still save loads of time since the exported data in the Excel
 sheet will be ready to use with no editing needed after the fact.<br />
<br />
To that end, my script apparently can have a set ceiling on the maximum number of characters entered.&nbsp; It would be nice to know what is the maximum allowable (including spaces between words, I imagine) in the criteria box in any query design view - does anyone
 know?<br />
<br />
Thx much!!<br />

            <p>If you have a file (or a spreadsheet, or best of all a Table) of the names you want to exclude, you can create a Query to do so. Note that this Query JUST would use a JOIN - no criteria at all! Did you try the Exclusions table I posted upthread?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have one big red warning though. Any time you have uncontrolled vocabulary and wildcards you WILL - not may, but
<strong>WILL</strong> - get erroneous results. Suppose you wanted to exclude a company named API with a criterion of
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOT LIKE "*API*"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This criterion will also exclude <strong>"Api</strong>culture" and <strong>"</strong>R<strong>api</strong>d Graphics" and "C<strong>api</strong>tol Press" and any other name containing that text string!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get around this by making the criterion a lot more complex:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOT LIKE "Api *" AND Not Like "* API *" AND NOT LIKE "* API"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to set the name off with blanks and allow for it to be the first substring ("API Limited"), embedded with flanking blanks ("Boise API Inc.") or at the end of the string preceded by a blank... but this isn't perfect (there might be other punctuation, not
 just blanks); and the query will be inefficient and a pain to maintain!</p>

Yes, thank you - good to point that out as other people use these boards as research, like I do.&nbsp; Good to know the pitfalls.<br />
<br />
I did run into that when I first did the exclusions when I ran across a completely different company than the one that I needed to exclude and it got dumped in &lt;g&gt;.&nbsp; With 18,000+ records, it's bound to be an issue but I'm confident that once I learn the data
 better, I'll be able to keep that to a minimum.&nbsp; Fortunately, when in doubt, we can minimize the errors but putting in more specific characters to get the results we need like when I knew we had subsidiaries that needed to remain even as the main were to be
 excluded (since the parent company was a sponsor and the subsidiary was not - needed to exclude the sponsor).<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

&lt;sheepish grin&gt; Um, sorry, no.&nbsp; As I posted on Jun.10, since some of the things I couldn't wrap my brain around yet, I'm tabling that idea for a bit.&nbsp; I have no extra time at work to do this and I'm already putting in 1-2 hours daily of overtime to clear up
 the backlog my predecessor left since he left without notice and things languished until I was brought on board.&nbsp; Soon I'll stay after work to try that idea out and hopefully I'll be able to make heads or tails of it then when I'm actually working on it (I

Can anyone tell me the maximum number characters the criteria box allows in a query design view?&nbsp; I've continued to google but haven't found an answer.&nbsp; The answers go off on all sorts of tangents with nothing revealing the answer to this specifically&nbsp; ...

            What windows mobile device do you have?&nbsp; OS upgrades a typically delivered from the device manufacturer.&nbsp; Have you checked the support pages for your device to see if any such OS upgrade exists?

            The best bet is to do a search for your actual device. For instance, search for "HP iPAQ WM5 Upgrade". If the device manufacturer provided an upgrade for that path, you should have no issues finding a legal upgrade link. There are "unofficial", unauthorized
 upgrades out there too, so watch out for those.

    <title>Cortana voice commands - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin 520  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana voice commands</h2>
                    <p>Is there a list of voice commands for Cortana?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you can ask Cortana anything, but mostly this just results in Cortana showing a Bing search.&nbsp; What I'm interested in is which voice commands will let me deal with messages handsfree while I'm driving and the phone is in my pocket.&nbsp; Even more
 specifically, is there any way to command Cortana to read out a new text message if a first attempt failed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Cortana always* responds wrongly when I ask for a new message to be read out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana: <em>"You have received a text from &lt;whoever&gt;.&nbsp; Would you like me to read it, or ignore it?"</em></p>
<p>Me: <em>"Read it!"</em></p>
<p>Cortana: <em>"Sure.&nbsp; Who would you like to send the text to?"&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Me: <em>"Cancel!"</em></p>
<p>If I get to that position, is there any voice command method to get Cortana to try again to read the message?&nbsp; (Apologies for asking the same question twice.&nbsp; I did post this question in another thread a week ago but thought a more relevant title might get
 a specific response.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*Okay, <em>almost</em> always.&nbsp; Last week, for the first time in ages, it worked and I got to hear one message.</p>

 that many people would spot it if I did go back and change the title of the original post.</p>

<p>You did not say which version of Nokia Maps you are using. You can certainly set the backlight to stay on all the time from the settings within Nokia Maps. I cannot give you the key strokes without knowing which version you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the keypad lock is not as simple. You can either disable it completely or do as I used to when I had an N95 which was to unslide and reslide the phone to unlock the keypad. Remember the gps anttena in under the # key on the N95 so you should
 have the slide open to optimise signal reception.</p>

<p>I will investigate the option on the map, though I don't think it gets around the security locks. I wish profiles had more options so that we could quickly switch between them for various activity....</p>

<p>For me, the easiest way to change is profile is using Voice Commands. Another easy way to change profiles is to briefly stab the power button which will bring up the list of profiles allowing you to select the one you wish.</p>

    <title>sound and app questions with W10 mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j.s.j.  say:</h3>
<h2>            sound and app questions with W10 mobile</h2>
                    <p>(1) There are about 40-50 text tone options in Settings/Personalization/Sounds. When I go to Contacts to set up text tones for individual Contacts, there are only 22 options...and they are more appropriate for ring tones, not texts. How can I get all the
 tone options in Settings to show up in Contacts, like they did on my previous W10 phone?</p>
<p>(2) In Settings/Personalization/Lock Screen, Facebook and (FB) Messenger do not show up as options to show in quick status (but Uber does). FB showed up on my previous phone in quick status. (The FB tile does consistently and correctly show the number of
 notifications, an improvement from my previous phone.)</p>
<p>(3) When I click on a FB link from a FB notification email, it does not take me to the FB app, but to FB in Edge. Not a big deal, but the app is nicer.</p>
<p>(4) A sports team app I have from MS Store (that was on my previous phone) does not notify me of scores, as I requested it to. It did not do that on my previous phone either... Is it an app problem?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>With regards to your inquiries, we can suggest the following:</p>
<p>1. You can set up the tones for contacts from People app. From there you have plenty of tones to choose from.</p>
<p>2. One important thing to check is the apps you want to show on the lock screen need permission to run in the background, by default they have this right but it might have been turned off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Start / Settings / Privacy / Background apps</li><li>Make sure the apps you want to report on the lock screen have the&nbsp;switch set to on.</li></ul>
<p>3. Email links are supposed to open on Edge, otherwise, notifications from the Facebook app itself will open on the app.</p>
<p>4. App settings, or functions may differ for each app. We would suggest that you reach out to the app developers as all apps are launched only by Microsoft.</p>

<p>1. I went into the People app again just now, as I have been doing, and went to the text tone option for three different contacts. For each contact, only the 22, phone-like options were available for text tones. Obviously a flaw in my phone... :-(&nbsp; (BTW,the
 exact same, limited options are available for ringtones in People.) I was hoping to reuse the same text tones I had on my previous phone (Lumia). Some of the tones are in Settings/Personalization/Sounds, but none in People!</p>
<p>2. Thank you for that info. However, I checked, and FB and Messenger were already on... I turned them off, restarted my phone, and turned them on again. Not fixed. Restarted it again. Still not fixed... I'll check again tomorrow or this weekend. Maybe it
 needs some time to hit...</p>
<p>3. Good to know. Thank you!</p>
<p>4. I will check with the app developers. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are some features available on Lumia Phones but are not available on third party OEM's. Some of the ringtones from the Settings may not be available for contacts ringtone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your concern about app notification on your lock screen, when did the issue start?
</p>
<p>

<p>Ok. BTW, my previous phone (Lumia) had to be reset multiple times (3-4?) over the approx. 1.5 years I owned it. After one of the resets, I had the EXACT same problem I am having now with text tones in People. After another reset, it was resolved... I prefer
 not to have to reset this phone. I think I'll just put up with this problem....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the phone for Christmas, so I noticed it as soon as I started setting things up Dec 26 or so.</p>
