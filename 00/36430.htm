            I would suspect a damaged install disk. You will have trouble contacting support for a week or so, but you need to send them E-mail. Go to the site you ordered it on, and use the Contact link.

    <title>Skype Half-Duplex - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rclore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Half-Duplex</h2>
                    <p>When Skype goes into half-duplex mode it becomes almost unusable and prevents my mic from working when:</p>
<ol>
<li>Other users talk excessively, especially on calls with many anxious participants.</li><li>There is background noise from&nbsp;other participants.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that going to half-duplex might temporarily solve an audio disturbance, but leaving the call in half-duplex is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Part of the problem seems to be that Skype is hyper sensitive to microphone sensitivity.</p>
<p>My Bose QC30 causes this all the time.</p>
<p>I've seen suggestions to use the PC mic or other mic but that is not a reasonable work-around.</p>
<p>I'd really like to use my QC30's but can't.&nbsp; I see others report the same problems with the newer QC35's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is&nbsp;there any way to be notified when Skype goes half-duplex other than realizing no one is hearing what I am&nbsp;saying?</p>
<p>Are the&nbsp;ways to prevent or cancel half-duplex?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll start by&nbsp;posting this as question, but I am guessing it might really be a discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p><span>Hi GenIke,<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>How you have tried updating the display adapter drivers?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to uninstall the display adapter driver completely &amp; install the latest driver from the
<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Legacy/Pages/radeonaiw_vista32.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
manufacturer’s website</a>. </span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span>To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>a.&nbsp;Type ‘devmgmt.msc’ in the Start Search box &amp; press Ok.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>b. In device manager, expand display adapter &gt; right click on it &gt; click Uninstall (Put a check in delete all driver files).<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>c. Install the downloaded driver files.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

    <title>Rise of the Tomb Raider crashes at load up screen after applying - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sezicoolcat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rise of the Tomb Raider crashes at load up screen after applying controller update</h2>
                    
<p>Strange one. Plugged in the stereo headset adaptor into controller.</p>
<p>Xbox one told me I needed to update the controller in order to use the headset adaptor. So I apply the update.</p>
<p>Go to try my favourite game,e, Rise of the Tomb Raider and every time it now crashes with humming after getting to the stats screen (60%through) etc.</p>
<p>Tried many things to try and rectify.</p>
<p>Turned off powered off console.</p>
<p>Logged out and back in on sons profile (incase my save file ***)</p>
<p>Deleted my save file on the console, and it redownloaded from the cloud.</p>
<p>Deleted the game from the console and reinstalled</p>
<p>Restored xbox (kept previous apps and data)</p>

<p>Nothing I have tried has helped. If I re,ever rightly, when I got to that bit before the controller used to rumble. Well now the TV just hums at me.</p>
<p>Sometimes the console restarts itself after this.</p>

<p>Anyway I can undo the update to the controller?</p>

<p>I did take a video of the fault.. Not sure if one can post it on this forum.</p>

<p>Sarah</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Language Pack causing problems with search getting error &#39;Search Results aren&#39;t quite ready yet, but we&#39;re working on getting them together.&#39;</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original title:</strong></em> Windows 10 Language Pack causing problems
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just setting up my new sparkly Dell laptop with the 'marvellous' Windows 10 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to have my language set to English (UK) as, well that's where I'm from... However in doing this it seems to cause issues!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search bar to find settings will become totally useless. Just comes up with 'Search Results aren't quite ready yet, but we're working on getting them together.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the language pack back to English(US) removes the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Having a search on the internet shows this is a disturbingly common problem that dates back to over a year ago...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems a shame that the OS they are heavily pushing is just so buggy, both for people trying to upgrade older systems and those buying brand new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help available. </p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Start Menu, Store, and Settings are not showing up or working, and misssing icons.</h2>
                    <p>So I downloaded Windows 10 on Wednesday and installation went fine. The next day, I&nbsp;turn&nbsp;on&nbsp;the laptop and the start up seem a bit slow. Didn't&nbsp;think to much of it. But as the desktop started up, I noticed some of the icons on the taskbar weren't showing
 up (mainly Explorer Edge and the Windows Store). I figured that they were just loading, but after waiting 30 minutes&nbsp;to an hour, they still weren't showing up. I tried clicking on the Start menu to see if I could access the apps from there, but the Start menu
 wasn't working and I couldn't turn off or restart my laptop from the Start menu either. After several attempts, I decided to reset my laptop through settings. After the reset, everything worked fine. Earlier this morning, the same thing happened again, and
 I tried to reset it, but it kept failing each time. I tried both the Powershell and the sfc/scannow methods and both didn't work. I have also tired rebooting my laptop and leaving it off to see it would do anything, but after turning it back on again, Settings
 started not to work either, so I can't reset my laptop no more as well. </p>
<p>If someone could help me out with this, it would be most appreciated. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I realize can right click on the Start menu and shut down and sign out from there, as well as others. But still no luck.</p>

            <p>Hi Porzeus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved the problem, but I don't know whether it applied to your issue. What I did was that I deleted my current user account and then setup another one. After that everything works fine. The price is that you have to setup a new user account from scratch
 and that takes time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. You can first switch to another account to see if it works. That's what I did.</p>

<h3> jasoncollege246  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I copy permissions from Program files to another folder on a different drive&#63; &#40;Windows 8 32-bits&#41;</h2>
                    First a little background...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Dual-Booting between windows 8 and windows 7 on 2 separate hard drives with windows 7 being the default operating system. Games for both operating systems are installed on a 3rd internal hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 games path D:\Program Files 7\Game Name</div>
<div>Windows 8 games path D:\Program Files 8\Game Name</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is so that if I have to reinstall either operating system for any reason, I still have access to all my saved games, and other configuration files for those games (as long as they are stored in those game folders)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because I'm using these folders as installation folders (both folders already exist with programs installed in them) I'd like to copy the permissions from C:\Program Files to D:\Program Files 8 for security reasons. I tried doing this manually, but found
 that permissions for the principle called TrustedInstaller could not be added since the system doesn't recognize this as a principle when I attempt to add it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For clarity on this subject, I'm using an administrator's account, and have elevated permissions at the time of attempts.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Even if games or any other programs are installed on a separate drive, if you have to reinstall any o/s those games/programs will still have to be reinstalled as installing any programs writes many entries to the win drive.</p>
<p>Any games settings/data files will usually be created/saved in the Game/Programs installation folders on whatever drive. And if the installation process created by that program has been correctly written/created, any uninstall should offer you the option
 of leaving the data/configuration files intact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there is no advantage with what you seek, and if you manipulate permissions that could open up a complete can of worms</p>

            almost all games I install on the 3rd drive do not ever give me that option if i have to uninstall them. Normally, the reason for &nbsp;reinstall is if the operating system, or the hard drive that OS is installed on gets corrupted.
<div><br />
<div>I can put the drive into a swap caddy (Black widow) and using the other computer, I can take ownership of the program files folder to get what I want from it if the drive itself is not corrupted, but that's time consuming as I have to weed through ll the
 other things installed there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All I want to do is make "D:\Program Files 8" behave exactly like "C:\Program Files"</div>
<div><br />
<div>The advantage it gives me is that if I need to reinstall the OS, I have all those games installed in a place where the OS was not installed, thus allowing me to backup those files, reinstall the programs, and then restore the needed configuration/saved
 game files that are stored there without having to go through all those extra steps... The advantage is a convenience that is not offered by installing in C:\Program Files</div>
<div><br />
<div>As well I should note that there are some games that once they are installed, can have thier installation folders moved at will to any location and run from the new location (or even on a completely different computer) without having to do a reinstall
 of the game in that location or on that computer (A few examples of this would be World of Warcraft, Star Trek Online, Perfectworld International, and Forsaken World) This is the main reason for this convenience.</div>

<h2>            Not enough server storage is available to process this command. Please help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, my clients just switched their old "server" (shared folder on a workgroup pc) with windows XP pro to a new regular HP desktop with Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; Everything is working great except for the error I'm getting after the computer has been on
 for a while.</p>
<p>Not enough server storage is available to process this command.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the Norton that came with it, changed the IRPStackSize to 50, and installed Avira.&nbsp; That worked for about 2 weeks, but after Memorial Day weekend, when the computer had been on for a while, it happened again.&nbsp; I told them to just turn off the
 computer every night for the time being, but this never happened with their XP pro computer.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what may be causing this and how to fix it?&nbsp; I know what the error means and I thought changing the stack size to the maximum should have solved the problem, but I have no idea what to do now.</p>

<p>This error message can be misleading. It might indicate a lack of memory but it could also indicate an internal error. To see what I mean, try this:<br />
1. Click Start / Search<br />
2. Type this command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wscript&nbsp; c:\test.vbs\ wscript&nbsp; c:\test.vbs\<br />
3. Press Enter</p>
<p>You will get the same error message. Unfortunately this makes your search much harder as the error might be caused by anything that runs on this machine. I would run msconfig.exe and disable everything under the Startup tab that can be disabled without causing
 a problem. Note that Windows will run happily without any of the tasks shown there.</p>

<p>That is an hour and 16 minutes of my life I will never get back. The issue is I am a new Xbox One user, and chose to take the one month free Xbox Live Gold option, then input my credit card details to auto renew the following month.</p>
<p>The problem was I couldn't download the two&nbsp;free August games, and I didn't know if this was due to it being a trial, or there was a problem with my account, or something else. It didn't give me the option to get it free, just to download for money.</p>
<p>I contacted MS support and the following is the copy of the conversation!</p>
<p>(I subsequently paid for a 12 month Xbox Live Gold membership and hey presto I then got the option of downloading for free. Why didn't MS support tell me this, instead of reading a website, misunderstanding what is written in plain English, then accusing
 me of not being able to understand plain English. Argghhhhhhhh.</p>

 I am sorry if the statements seem to be confusing but I would like to let you know Dominic that if it has price corresponding to it, it means that it is no longer free to download. You can keep on checking the link I provided for further updates moving forward.

<p>Very very frustrating and confusing. Not only is the info wrong (getting confused between 360 and One games) as well as being told the games are only available for one day but what the hell does this mean?</p>
<p><strong><span>Alexandra:</span> It can only be downloaded for free on August 1 but not until August 15.</strong></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>I accept the fact that the free trial month may be limited, but if I was told that after 1 minute, I would have gone and bought the years subscription.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Instead an hour and 16 minutes of my time was wasted. MS paid for their employee to chat rubbish to me for 1 hour 16 mins and I got off the chat session feeling mighty angry!<br />
</span></p>
<p>Anyhoo all good now. If anyone else out there gets a one month trial gold account, and you can't download the games for free,&nbsp; I hope you find this site and don't go to the chat option!!!!</p>

            <p>Wow. &nbsp;I really must apologize on her behalf. &nbsp;It's like she wasn't even reading what you were asking.</p>
<p>Xbox One Games With Gold games are available to download on the first (unless otherwise stated) and then will continue through the whole month. &nbsp;Not really sure where she was getting her info from.</p>
<p>However, a one month Gold trial membership is a trial and only offers some aspects of a full Gold membership. &nbsp;You would need to purchase a Gold membership (as you have already done) to take full advantage of all that the service has to offer.</p>
<p>Again, sorry you had a bad experience at the start but things seem to be working for you now which is good.</p>
<p>BTW, you should check out EA Access. &nbsp;It costs $5 per month or $30 per year and will give you free access to games in the vault (Battlefield 4, FIFA 14, Madden NFL 25 and Peggle 2 currently) as well as a 10% discount on other games and DLC.</p>

    <title>Slow wifi speed after windows 10 November update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bhushanbhagat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow wifi speed after windows 10 November update</h2>
                    I have an Acer aspire v3-574g. It used to have seamless internet connection and speed with "Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4 Wireless Network Adapter" with driver ver. 4.0.0.115. I updated my windows with the November update and the problems started. It updated
 the driver to ver 4.0.0.137 and not allowing me to go back to previous version. The wifi speed is very slow. But if I start a high speed download ex. "Java development kit from Oracle site", it gives m proper speed and if I run another download side by side
 it also takes proper speed. But after stopping the fast download the other download gets the creepy slow speed again. I am not able to figure out what is the exact problem. Please help.

Hi guys finally I found the exact problem with the help of service engineer</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The problem was with power settings. When the laptop was plugged in it was taking the full speed and on battery mode slow. The solution is :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Goto settings -&gt; system -&gt; power and sleep -&gt; additional power settings -&gt; change plan settings (of selected plan)</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>OR</strong></p>
<p>
Goto Search -&gt; type&nbsp;Control Panel -&gt; Hardware and Sound -&gt; Power Options -&gt;&nbsp;<span>-&gt; change plan settings (of selected plan)</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Then</strong></p>
<p>
change advance power settings -&gt; wireless adapter settings -&gt; power saving mode -&gt; Set&nbsp;<strong>On battery</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>maximum performance</strong></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Check your speed now(restart if required)</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I am now using the updated driver 12.0.0.191 and internet speed is proper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Cindy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error might have something to do with the boot sequence of your computer. Boot sequence is the order of devices listed in BIOS (Basic input Output System) that searches for nonvolatile data storage devices containing program code to load the operating
 system. That said, we suggest that you <strong>coordinate</strong> with the <strong>
manufacturer</strong> of your device to check the boot sequence or lists of your computer that can be access through BIOS.</p>
<p>

            The crash dump does not indicate anything faulty.
<br />Was it a one off BSOD? If so, I would not worry because one-off BSODs can be safely ignored...

<h2>            Can&#39;t open windows live mail following an automatic windows update</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I can't open Windows Live Mail

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Mail are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<div><b>How long have you not been able to Sign in ? </b></div>
<div>More than a day</div>
<div><b>Enter the exact error that you are experiencing : </b></div>
<div>.</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
About three days ago my laptop downloaded and installed a windows update automatically after that I was unable to open Windows Live Mail (and it slowed my system down completely when I tried to open Live Mail), I did a system restore to before the automatic
 update and Live Mail then&nbsp; worked fine.&nbsp; Of course the automatic update ran again and again Windows LiveMail wouldnt work.&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Live Mail, but it wouldn't open at all when I did this.&nbsp; So I have temporarily turned
 of Automatic updates.&nbsp; Is there anyway of fixing this so that I can turn on automatic updatest again.<br />
Many thanks<br />
<br />

            Thank you for your help, I followed your instructions though did not have option to repair all Windows Live Programs it said to uninstall and reinstall, which I did.&nbsp; I reconfigured my e-mail account by deleting it and then configuring it again.&nbsp; It seemed
 to work fine until I ran the Windows updates and allowed them to install and I then had real problems.&nbsp; Tried to open Windows Live Mail following the windows update (had restarted computer after updates) and Windows Live Mail would not load again, nothing
 would load at all so shut down and restarted and got message 'Failed to connect to Windows Service.'&nbsp; Only way I found to sort this was to do a system restore in safe mode (it would not let me do anything at all in normal mode).&nbsp; So I am now back to square
 one.&nbsp; <br />
I don't have this problem on another computer as I don't use Windows Live Mail on any other computers, the issue is constant from the point I install the windows update until I do a system restore.&nbsp; My Firewall is enabled.<br />
Regards<br />

            Hi <span>Jammie1,</span><br />
<br />
<span>We would like you to do a clean uninstall of Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
To do this, we'll first need to remove the registry keys associated with the previous Live Mail installation. Before you edit the registry, please make sure to back it up. It is highly recommended that you know how to restore the registry just in case a problem
 occurs. <br />
<br />
For information about how to back up, restore, and modify the registry, please read this
</span><strong><span>article</span></strong><span>.<br />
<br />
Then, please follow the steps below on how to do the <strong><span>clean removal</span></strong> process:
<br />
<br />
1. Open Registry Editor (Click the windows icon also known as the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, on the Start Search box, type
<strong><span>regedit</span></strong>, and then press ENTER to open a Registry Editor window)<br />
2. Click <strong><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>SOFTWARE</span></strong>, and then click <strong>
<span>MICROSOFT</span></strong>. Right click <strong><span>Windows Live Mail</span></strong> and then press
<strong><span>Delete</span></strong> to remove the registry key.
<br />
3. Click <strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>SOFTWARE</span></strong>, and click <strong><span>MICROSOFT</span></strong>. Right click
<strong><span>Windows Live Mail</span></strong> and then press
<strong><span>Delete</span></strong> to delete the registry key.<br />
4. Exit Registry Editor and then restart the computer. <br />
<br />
Once done, you could download the latest Windows Live Mail </span><strong><span>here</span></strong><span>.
 Kindly download Windows Live Essentials. Afterwards, please install it. After doing so, you'll have the option to download all the application available or you could only download Windows Live Mail by choosing it.<br />
<br />
After installing WLM, please follow the instructions in the article below on how to reconfigure your account:<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>How to configure a Windows Live Hotmail account in Windows Live Mail</span></strong><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b><span>If you're using a non-Hotmail account, please follow the steps provided in this
</span><strong><span>link</span></strong><span>.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks,<br />
<br />

            Thank you, I have now done all of that and still have the same problem.&nbsp; Windows Live Mail works perfectly fine until I allow the automatic updates to download and install and then Windows Live Mail will just not open until I do a system restore to before
 the updates and then it will work again.<br />

            This is the problem, when the updates are pending everything works fine (though a little slower that usual often getting not responding when online), as soon as I download and install the updates Windows Live Mail will no longer open.&nbsp; Though everything
 else seems to work fine unless I try to open Windows Live Mail and then everything becomes unresponsive.<br />

            Thank you, I am only running the Windows Firewall, so am assuming that is not what you mean by a third party firewall.&nbsp; I have followed the instructions for the FiddlerCap Trace, and have uploaded the file created.&nbsp; I did start capture - then tried to
 open Windows Live Mail, which would not open and then pressed stop capture, so I hope that is right.&nbsp;

<p>On top of what Maxen13 said there are no real product keys available to end users with the way the 360 is designed. &nbsp;You also only licensed the game for use on the 360 so a product key for a PC version would technically be a separate purchase.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I end up with the extensions .dmss (a Roxio priority format) and a .wpl. </p>
<p>These extensions are unreadable by any other media players.</p>
<p>I can't see where I can choose which format to save a slide show in.</p>

            Brian, Thanks for your input. I am currently using Windows 8 pro.&nbsp; I like the transition effects in Media Center and the fact that you can add multiple music scores. But I would like the ability to compile in alternate formats ie. 1080p MP4, etc. Any ideas?
 I want to mention that as for as the .dmss format, I have installed Roxio Easy Media Creator. I first compiled the slide show in it, but didn't like it. Somehow it carried over when I started from scratch in Media Center... now, figure&nbsp;that one. I started
 again and Media Center and it formatted as .wpl. I finally compiled the project in Adobe Lightroom.... Whew! So, what do you all suggest?

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can edit the .wpl file to .m3u file, which is supported in most media players. You can do so by opening the playlist file in Notepad. It'll resemble something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#EXTM3U<br />
#EXTINF:10,Sample.jpg<br />
Sample.jpg<br />
#EXTINF:10,Sample 2.jpg<br />
Sample 2.jpg<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, note that the location of the files should be in mention in the line next to
<strong>#EXTINF</strong> line, for eg, C:\Users\Samle.jpg, with no quotation. But since you are using a media player, it cannot recognise the C:\ or any other drive letter. Therefore, mention the file names directly, like mentioned above, and place the playlist
 and the picture files in the same folder. For eg, place the files Sample.jpg, Sample 2.jpg and the .m3u file in the same directory if you consider the above example playlist file. Similarly, you can add as many extensions you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply if your issue is not solved.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Money</h2>
                    I have been using Microsoft Money for a long time and upgraded to Windows 10. Shortly afterwards when I open up Money, it repeatedly minimises itself and I have to then keep maximising it. It then randomly continues to minimise as I move the cursor around
 or try to input information. I called Microsoft but they said they don't support Money any more. Does anyone have any idea as to what is causing the problem. I am no expert with computers or software so clear, simple answers would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>There have been other posts on MS Money and I use it myself. The main problem was it expected IE 6 and when it didn't find it would shutdown. It doesn't sound like you have that problem. What version of Money are you using. (might help other suggest a fix)
 My only suggestion is running it in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click the shortcut you use to start Money and select Properties. Select the Compatibility tab and try select your previous OS in the compatibility setting. You can also try Run as Administrator.</p>

            <p>I'm using Money Plus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a couple of things:</p>
<p>Clicking on the shortcut shows only 'Run as Administrator' so clicked on this and it asked if I would allow an app to make changes. Tried clicking on yes first, tried opening Money to see if there was a difference, but there wasn't. Then tried clicking 'no',
 again there was no difference to Money.</p>

</p><p>Went to File Explorer and found the Money&nbsp;file. Right clicking here showed me 'Properties'. In there I found my name listed and the administrator. Both had the same rights it seems but couldn't see a way to make me the administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also couldn't find the Compatibility tab, either my right clicking on the shortcut or the file in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help though!! Any reply is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>With the option to Run as Administrator you should select Yes for it to make a difference, so using that setting doesn't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to see a Compatibility tab for the shortcut you use to run the program. Are you using a button in Start to run Money. If so right click the icon and go to More then select Open File Location. That will highlight a file in File Explorer
 in the Money folder. If you right click that file and go to Properties you should see Compatibility. Tick the box and select your last operating system.</p>

            <p>Questions about any version of Microsoft Money should be asked in <a href="https://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=money" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=money</a> .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first step is to uninstall Money, reboot and then reinstall it. The second post in the Money forum gives links to installation files if you no longer have your installation disk.</p>

            Thanks. Took advice of another reply and eventually managed to change the compatibility settings. Money now uses Windows 8 and it seems to be working fine.
