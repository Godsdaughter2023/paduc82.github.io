<h2>            0211 keyboard error press F1 to continue</h2>
                    I was running a spybot check &amp; when I returned to laptop it was blank. Nothing worked so I let electricity run out &amp; when restarting got the message 0211 keyboard error press F1 to continue so I did. When I tried to log onto my user account nothing happens
 when I press a key. As system administrator I mostly get the same result when I think I've found solution yet in a couple of other places system administrator accepts the password. I am able to use as normal other user accounts

<h2>            Windows 10 Scan app dies with HP LaserJet M1522nf</h2>
                    I have had the subject all-in-one for a number of years, with a few different computers. Ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, I can not use the scanner. When I launch the app it looks fine, and I can go through Setup, etc. Once I click Scan, the app immediately
 closes. &nbsp;Any ideas on how to get this to work?

            The app I used was the HP Scan app. It turns out I needed a new printer/scanner anyway, and the new one works after downloading the full driver set. &nbsp;Your solution did not solve my problem, &nbsp;but it was very comprehensive and much appreciated.

<br />
Windows Movie Maker has the ability to use your existing webcam to capture video.<br />
<br />
If you're having issues with doing that…<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the webcam work in other applications like MSN, SKYPE or other applications?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Live Movie Maker does have issues detecting and using some webcams.<br />
<br />
But other things to check/do…<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure the drivers for the webcam are up to date.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a laptop and your still having issues, you may need to check in to some firmware<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; updates; see they're available. <br />
<br />
Just trying to help... <br />
<br />
Until next time,<br />

<p>1.) Windows Live Movie Maker Version 14.0.8091.0730</p>
<p>2.) I have an external, USB Webcam (A "GIGAWARE"), and whenever I boot up WLMM, it
<strong>DOESN'T </strong>even give me the option to record directly from it. It (my webcam) works fine when I use it with CyberLink YouCam, though.

    <title>Vista Home Premium Screensaver Aurora and Windows Energy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akatnt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista Home Premium Screensaver Aurora and Windows Energy</h2>
                    
<p><span>In past 3 weeks I have had really bad luck with 2 of your screensavers and my 4 graphic cards. I am not sure what kind of screensavers are you guys making but 2 named Aurora
 and Windows Energy should never have been released to public without testing, including impact on you GPU and overheating.
<br />
<br />
In past 3 weeks I have been troubleshooting Windows vista Home Premium 32-bit problem and freezing issues. Card that came with computer was GeForce 6150 SE worked for about 2 months and then computer started doing wrong things freezing, shutting down, only
 working sometimes and few other issues. I figured it was bad GPU so I replaced it with my HIS ATI Radeon X1950 Pro, this card was giving me warnings 12h after it was installed that card is running little hot and that ATI software will lower card freq.. This
 card lasted for about 2 days and it died too but this time comp would just have weird dots and not whole screen was unreadable. I installed program called Speed Fan to monitor and record what is actually happening with this card. Computer was used for business
 so only IE and few other small programs where ran, no games or nothing. Since my last card was fried I replaced it with my GeForce 7900 GT OC, this card gave me nice amount of needed data but at the same time this card lasted only 3 days.
<br />
<br />
I figured since fans are running full speed and case is getting nice cooling maybe it's PCI-E slot that's shorting out or something, wrong.
<br />
Today I went to local store to buy PCI card, got nice $65 GeForce 6200 and plugged it in, Speed Fan was ready to record everything, Idle temperatures where 41C for GPU and 47 for CPU. I was doing some defragging and virus scanning trying to run CPU to 100%
 and record what is happening I was also running Media player and other programs with Visual effects to see if I can push this cards Temp. above its limits, after 2h of messing around with this I gave up and went to smoke a cigarette, came back screensaver
 was running(Aurora btw) turned it off and checked temp. log. <br />
<br />
Speed Fan was showing warning and GPU temp at 85C. Then I went on and tried same thing on Windows energy screensaver and got same results, just going inside Screensaver section and clicking on Aurora screensaver will bring your cards temp at least 5C in a second.<br />
<br />
Since I do not use Vista(and never will)&nbsp;on my personal computers I was wondering if anyone with GTX 200 series could try and test this out and see how much temp. changes on his rig while doing this. I do have my rig with windows XP pro and not sure if I can
 get Aurora or Windows Energy for XP to test it out on my sli 260 GTX.<br />
<br />
Thank You</span></p>

            I would check his PSU. A screen saver will NOT cause three cards to burn out.

    <title>A Warning to those who buy the Regular RE5 and Platinum Hits - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A Warning to those who buy the Regular RE5 and Platinum Hits</h2>
                    
<p>RE5 has something wrong with it where some copies will not work. Essentially it wont load the buy screen after the first two cut-scenes in chapter 1-1 making it where you cant get far enough to be able to upgrade your weapons. And it seems to fail at 48%
 and i have plenty of proof.</p>
<p>There is TWO (Separate) problems, one has a fix. the other might*</p>
<p>1. You have the gold Edition, and Mercenaries Fails</p>
<p>FIX: Delete the Figure DLC (the free one that shows you the pay for costumes like sheva's business outfit)</p>
<p>2.you fail at 48% on install, and you immediately&nbsp;crash to dashboard with disc read error right after the first two cut-scenes in the game.</p>
<p>SOL: ya well some people have "fixed" this by really wierd ways.</p>
<p>1. Delete RE5 Demo? it worked for one</p>
<p>2. remove HDD put back several times and keep trying to install to HDD each time</p>
<p>3. remove HDD use fresh 8GB Flash drive and itll probably update your 360 too and install it to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Clear Cache and keep retrying.</p>
<p>5. Buy Games on Demand Version (STILL dont download the figurine DLC, ive read reports it STILL gives you "disc" read errors...(lol no disc..its downloaded)</p>


<p>I have read this happening to:</p>
<p>LE Red 360's</p>
<p>Slims</p>
<p>Elites</p>
<p>Phat 360</p>

<p>so basically ive come across someone saying this exact scenerio (1-1 failing, 2-3 failing, and fails around 30%-48%) in every one of these xbox's</p>

<p>Ya heh my whole story is i bought a copy preowned on Walmart.com.I wasn't expecting it in perfect condition though really it was all immaculate, pristine. So i got to install it, and it fails at 48% every-time so i go to play it thinking it was a fluke and
 fail at the load-out screen to chapter 1-1. it hard crashes out saying a disc read error sayings its dirty or damaged.
</p>
<p>So i send it back for a return, get what seemed to be another copy and it did the same thing, needless to say i gave a talking to Walmart.com support saying they sent me the same bad copy... So i returned it again, but this time they expedited my copy, AND
 i signed an agreement online where they'd send their copy before they even got mine. And the copy i got this time was the platinum hits version. It does the EXACT same thing. So I'm pretty sure that second disc i had WASNT the same one.</p>
<p>So in fact, i tried 3 separate copies. And i randomly installed a game to see if it was my xbox and it worked perfectly.</p>
<p>After being frustrated i went on a research spree, and came up with many many instances of the same symptoms.
</p>
<p>My theory is the new XBG3 update is what caused this, as others have stated their copy ran just fine some time ago(half a year or so) and then sudden has these symptoms. Its clear while there was alot of testing involved with the new update, this one slipped
 by. I wish i didnt have to buy a Games on Demand version when i essentially paid 20$ already on my unusable copy. 10$ for the game, 2$ shipping, and like 6$ for shipping it back 2 times.

    <title>I get a loud noise during video playback. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikebresnahan53  say:</h3>
<h2>            I get a loud noise during video playback.</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop computer, 64 bit, loaded with Windows 7 Premium SP1. During any video playback, whether streaming online or a video on my computer, I get a very loud noise periodically. It sounds almost like an audio feedback noise.
 At times the video freezes up at the time of the noise. I have up-dated the audio drivers; I deleted the audio driver on Device Manager and reloaded it; I've tried another sound card and different speakers. Nothing helps; I still get the noise and occational
 freezing. I've read many articles online from other Windows 7 users, stating the same problems, so I have to believe it is a problem with Windows 7 itself. If you go on Bing and just type Windows 7, this site and others comes up, talking about the sound and
 freezing problems. What is the problem with Windows 7 and what is Microsoft going to do to correct the problem? I often connect my laptop to my television for movie playback, but the loud noise is very discouraging. HELP!!!<br />

<p>This has happened to me aswell. The rechargable batteries in the controller (like every other rechargable battery) eventually goes dead over time and cannot recharge anymore. Your best bet is to buy a new charge pack.</p>
<p><br />
Also, might I suggest you remove that from your signature. You may get a suspesntion for that.</p>

<p>They don't use very high quality cells in the play and charge packs which are just a couple of rechargeable NiMH AA cells. If you look around you can find tutorials on cutting the case open to replace them with better off the shelf rechargeable AA cells
 so you can keep the charging functionality without having to buy a dedicated battery charger or a new play and charge pack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would personally go with a set of good rechargeable AA cells with a dedicated charger you can plug into a wall socket. It will charge them faster and more thoroughly so they don't lose total storage capacity as fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmm just noticed I can't find the accessories forum if it even exists anymore.</p>

<p>well it costs me about 10$ a month for batteries. Ive had my first plug and play for about a year, no problems. &nbsp;My second plug and play I've had for about 6 months, it dosen't seem as good as my first one but I have deifinatlly gotten my 40$ out of them
 both. which means I've saved close to 140$. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I usually let my PnP run out twice before pluging it in.</p>

<p>the charge bases are the way to go. Ive had 1 battery quit charging in the last 5 years. It seems it doesnt matter which charge base you use. I have a nyko, which i bought first, had for a few years, and I have an energizer now for a couple of years. I always
 have my controllers on the base when not in use. I can play for hours on any controller and it wont die.</p>

                    <p>Restart my computer this morning, and now we cant get back in. It makes you reset your password every so often so now we forget it. Although we have tried everything it could be, it keeps saying wrong password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i hit reset password i get a message saying “No drive”. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f28dfda-44c1-46bc-a419-a0638fd24a58?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi, DaintySine91106 
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network function to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            If reset doesn't work, you will need another pc to create an installation media
<br />it is the easiest solution.

            Hi Dainty.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's a hint there Elvis.  Does that not jog your memory?  If it's a Microsoft Account you can change it online and then wait overnight for it to sync to your PC.   If it's only a Local Account then you can set up test questions to get in.  You must not have done that yet since it prompted for the USB drive which is the other method using a password recovery drive.  
<br />
<br />Forums are where we help you perform steps to save the $150 minimum that a shop would charge.  If you don't want to work with us to perform the steps then you'll need to take it to a shop.  
<br />
<br />These steps are more complicated for forgetting password so that nobody can talk their way into your PC using our help.  Essentially the only way to get in without a password is to create bootable WIndows 10 media on another PC to boot into Repair Mode to Reset the PC saving files.  
<br /> 
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Troubleshoot Options, then  Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span><span>If your Internet Explorer seems to be crashing frequently, I suggest that you<strong>

<h2>            Trying to get an HP Photosmart b209a-m printer to work wireless</h2>
                    <p>I've been able to get my printer&nbsp;to&nbsp;work wirelessly on my new to me company laptop&nbsp;but I'm getting the famous open port 427 error message.&nbsp;The printer is already online and has been for a few years. Other laptops on my network halve no problem printing through
 it. I've turned off any firewalls and it has made no difference. I know that the IP is 10.0.02 but the search doesn't find it. I've done the install where the software asks me to plug in the USB to set up the wireless, but that is when the port 427 error shows
 up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also done the windows update search and nowhere in the HP drivers list does my model b209a-m show up. I've loaded the install disc onto my desktop and tried to point to it when it asks if I have the disc, but its looking for an .inf file for the driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any easy suggestions?</p>

            <p>Yes, I've <strong>NOT</strong> been able to get the printer to work wirelessly with my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Window's 7 Pro, 64 bit,&nbsp;and the install CD says good for Windows 7. Its the original install CD of about 2 years ago and it is in very good condition without scratches.&nbsp;I do not have a CD drive in my laptop, therefore I copied the install CD that
 came with the printer onto memory stick and then onto my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is "Your computer is unable to communicate with your printer at 10.0.0.2. This may be caused by firewall software. If you are using firewall software, verify that UDP port 427 is unblocked for both inbound and outbound traffic."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My firewall is Bit Defender Endpoint Security Tools version 6.2.17.876 with all recent updates, corporate installed and managed. I am however able to disable it during this install, yet it has made no difference. To me this possibly negates the port 427
 being the&nbsp;cause. I also confirmed that Windows firewall is OFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the printer working as long as its plugged into the USB port, and it does work wirelessly with other laptops in the house. Obviously that's not ideal since the printer is in a different room.

            <p>Thanks for the information.&nbsp; It eliminates a number of false paths that I otherwise might have led you down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's my understanding that BitDefender Endpoint Security incorporates its own firewall.&nbsp; I don't know whether temporarily disabling the antivirus functionality of the software also disables the firewall.&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume from your statement that the printer "does work wirelessly with other laptops in the house" that although your laptop is using corporate-managed security software, you're trying to connect to the printer on your own, personal home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you follow Greg Carmack's advice (I asked about the age of the CD because the software available on the HP website may be newer and have fixed some issue that is causing your problem), do the following and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that you know that the printer's IP address is 10.0.0.2 because you checked it on the printer's front panel display or by printing a network configuration page using the printer's front panel controls.&nbsp; Open a web browser and enter 10.0.0.2 as the
 address.&nbsp; Do you get to the printer's web configuration page?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can print with the printer connected by USB, then the proper printer driver has already been installed on your computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect the USB cable</li><li>Go to Devices and Printers</li><li>Start the "Add a printer" wizard</li><li>Click "Add a network, wireless, or Bluetooth printer"</li><li>Does the printer not show up?&nbsp; Is this what you meant by "the search doesn't find it"?</li><li>Assuming the printer doesn't show up, click "The printer I want isn't listed"
</li><li>Select the radio button for "Add a printer using a TCP/IP address or hostname" and click Next</li><li>Enter the printer's IP address (10.0.0.2)</li><li>What happens?</li></ul>

            <p>I have done exactly what you suggested multiple times. When I say it can't find it, I mean that the found printers screen is empty. If I say check window update, there is no b209a-m that shows up, not even close. If I do as you suggested and add my 10.0.0.2
 IP, it says it can't communicate with that address or the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes, I know the IP by the printer display and I have previously used my mobile to hit that IP, the printer screen appears. I have also done a 10.0.0.1 and found the printer as .2 in the Comcast router.</p>

            Follow Greg's instructions, but if you can't reach the printer with a browser from your computer (forgetting entirely about attempting to install the printer), I suspect that the problem is the BitDefender Endpoint Security firewall.<br />

            I would never use a 3rd party firewall unless you have special needs, since Windows firewall is perfected.&nbsp; Likewise those who practice smart browsing should use built-in Defender antivirus which is perfectly adequate and allows for best performance of
 Windows.&nbsp;

<h3> vladislav trofimov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel sheet as desktop background.</h2>
                    <p>When I'd used WInXP in past, there was a feature called Active Desktop, which allowed me to set up my excel spreadsheet as deskop background. Then... Win10 came out, and I tried it... just to find that Win10 had no active desktop as option.</p>
<p>Is there any way to set up excel spreadsheet as desktop background for Win10?</p>

            It will not be active but you can use the Snipping tool and make a picture of the spread sheet and use the picture as background using Settings, Personalization, Background.&nbsp; Click on picture and then find the capture you made and click on it.<br />

            <p>I'm looking to flush a spreadsheet to the desktops of 6 PC's. I manage the tasklist for 6 people. Progress etc is recorded daily in a spreadsheet that i have auto publishing to a webpage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst the people can click on the link and open the webpage, i'd rather have it embedded on their desktop backgrounds. It wouldn't be interactive - just an image of the overall schedule and tasklist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are all using Windows 7 Professional</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the active desktop feature has been discontinued - but even some sort of script that will automatically update an image file of the spreadsheet when it is saved and update the desktop backgrounds would sort the problem.</p>

<h2>            Shortly after upgrading to Windows 10 files under C&#58;&#47;user&#47;accountname were deleted &#43; Taskbar&#47;Cortana does not work</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p>
<p>Hi, after upgrading to windows 10 from windows 7, I had an issue which I tried solving by resetting to windows 10 again. This solved my previous problem, which consisted of some windows tiles/apps not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shortly after my new reset, I went to download any programs and applications that were deleted. During this process I downloaded 'steam', and realized I downloaded it to the suggested default location which was,&nbsp;C:\Users\username</p>
<p>documents. I went ahead and uninstalled it so I can move it to where I thought it would install in the first place, under program files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During this time period I can an error about not having access to a certain file location suddenly, as it was working before. I figured I would do a system restart, so after restarting my computer I ran into a big issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my files under&nbsp;C:\Users\accountname were deleted/gone. All my desktop folders were gone, my background is set to the default solid colors because the folder is now gone from my documents, and so fourth. I have no idea what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only folders under that location are desktop/documents, and downloads, all which are empty.</p>
<p>I checked my windows.old folder and my user/username area and there were no files there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under my pc where you have shortcuts to desktop,documents,downloads (which lead to nothing) and music,pictures,videos which says something about it being unavailable, which I'm assuming is due to the deletion of my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other drive on my computer seems to be fine except from this exact destination.</p>

            <p>This does not even relate to my problem at all. I only had one user account which was successfully set up over the upgrade. The upgrade was working fine until over a computer restart my desktop files, my document files were deleted under my C drive. My other
 files and directories under other drives were untouched, and I'm assuming this is the cause because the OS was not located on those drives, even though they were currently active. They weren't deleted manually by the user by rather by the system over the restart
 some how. I never prompted anything to do such a thing and it was working fine up to that point. I am not a &nbsp;novice with computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using a system file recovery program, but it couldn't find the files I was looking for. I'm just going to assume this garbage of an OS, that has been causing nothing but problems from the start has deleted my data and the sectors with it, seeing
 I can't recover the files. I just don't understand how there can exist a bug like that in this stage of the release still.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, although I'm not sure why you would need to.&nbsp; They are both the same format, just slightly different file extensions.&nbsp; ".jpg" is the most popular variation.&nbsp; If you really need to change it, do this in File Explorer: Click
<strong>View</strong> (ribbon menu) -&gt; <strong>Options</strong> -&gt; <strong>View</strong> (tab).&nbsp; Untick
<strong>Hide extensions for known file types</strong>, and click [OK].&nbsp; Your picture files should now show the ".jpg" at the end of their names.&nbsp; Simply rename and change it to ".jpeg".&nbsp; If seeing the file extensions on files bothers you, you can go back and
 switch that setting back on anytime.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I doubt you messed anything up, and it is unlikely that you had a lot of files with the ".jpeg" extension as these are rare.&nbsp; Even more unlikely that the file extension got automatically changed on a bunch of files.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the default program for opening photos got changed?&nbsp; Try right-clicking a file that should open in

<h2>            Windows wireless keyboard 6000 v3.0 problem</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
Im having a problem using Microsoft wireless keyboard 600 v3.0 in my windows 7 (32-bit) running computer. I bought today the Microsoft wireless desktop 6000<br />
which contains that keyboard+ mouse. The mouse is working perfectly but i cant get the keyboard working. Keyboard is only responding to its quicklaunch keys and windows 7 flip key. I have tried using usb ports at front side and backside of my computer. And
 i cant seem to find the problem. I would realy appreciate any help. I am using Nordic edition which contain letters: ö,å and ä. As you may have notified English aint my main language (Finnish is)&nbsp; and i have lots of spelling problems so please correct me and
 ask me if i have spelled something so wrong that you cant understand.<br />
<br />
-MrHjelmer<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Got it to work booted computer and changed usb port again (dont no why it didnt work earlier)<br />

<p>I'm still in the same boat. I know a dozen or so of the top 100 players on Overwatch than unjustly were blocked/reported and bow can't play. I have been playing a varoety of games for the past few days, to no avail. I can't even file a case report because
 the Enforcement page still shows me as being a Good Player.</p>
<p>This is very unfortunate, and I am getting to the point of just unplugging the Xbox and playing on PC.</p>

<p>That "copy-paste" reply happens to answer all your "inquires". No one can help you in the forums other than with information regarding this issue since the rep depends on you and how the live community has rated your behavior online.

<p>The enforcement team is unreachable, and most likely nonexistent.</p>
<p>The enforcement page is bugged and says you have good rep when you don't, making it impossible to submit a case review.</p>
<p>The enforcement page offers ways to increase your rep but none of the activities actually have any effect.</p>
<p>People continue to use the rep system to punish people they don't want to play with, regardless of the reason.</p>
<p>Waiting for an official response, all this copy pasta has made me full. Thank you.</p>

<p>I was in the "avoid me" rep but I got out of it doing these things: 1) win or lose don't message or reply back to messages from anyone other than your friends as they can try to report you 2) the games that worked best for me is smite &amp; rainbow six siege
 when needing to play multiplayer to help rebuild your rep. 3) report players who do violate Xbox terms &amp; conditions ie trash talking to you. 4) you don't necessarily need friends to play with to do this, I did this by playing enough games with randoms. 5)
 I didn't use a Mic in multiplayer games just to prevent any chance of someone reporting me for "voice communication" well, I hope this helps anyone trying to get out of "avoid me" rep, it took me a few days to a week but I'm out and back to my favorite games</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete document files&#47;reappear after reboot</h2>
                    XP-SP3 : I think i have 2 separate problems here. The first one is a firefox problem about deleted bookmarks reappearing &amp; each days history disappearing after a reboot. I'm working on that. Don't know if it has anything to do with the 2nd one, maybe.
 I delete programs that i've downloaded in docs &amp; after a reboot, they magically reappear &amp; files i save in docs since this started, disappear. Also, my desktop icons are being switched around after i've put them in order after a reboot. I use firefox 3.6.18
 to download these programs, so it may have something to do with the programs reappearing in docs/downloads after a reboot, who knows. I have alot of security programs on here that are all compatible with each other. This isn't a malware problem either as i
 have run scans &amp; nothing comes up. Malware/trojans try to steal info, not move your icons around &amp; make files reappear. I just added memory 5 days ago from Crucial Memory, although i doubt that has anything to do w

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try saving the downloaded files to a different location apart from the usual one and check if the same issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Another thing you could try is to disable the security software on your computer and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>If the issue is fixed, you may have to contact the program manufacturer to know about the settings that can be changed or if
 there are any other updates for this program.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>
<span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. Running a computer without any security software can cause a potential threat to your computer. Hence, make sure to enable the Security Software
 once you are done with the test.</span></span></p>

            I think the problem stems from a BSOD i got a couple of days ago from trying to reinstall avast anti-virus. It happened many months ago, but somehow i installed it &amp; removed it a couple of weeks ago because i had very little memory, and wanted to free
 up some. I recently installed more memory, and had sys restore turned off, but now its back on, so i can't go back to an earlier time. Every time start the pc, i get an error msg. saying it has recovered from a serious error. I don't know if the bsod is whats
 causing the deleted files to reappear &amp; the icons moved back. I installed a version of adobe reader on here, but after a reboot its gone too. I doubt its causing the firefox problems. I tried to do an online support with dell, but when the agent came on, there
 was no box on the page to type in anything. I'm going to try phone support july 4th or 5th to see if they can help. Thanx for the reply.<br />

<div>As you are receiving an error message at the startup of the computer and also cannot trace the cause of this issue, let's place the computer in clean boot state to do the same.</div>

            Thanx for the reply divya. Its 8:15 eastern time, and i'm going to try your suggestion tomorrow and hopefully i can get this problem resolved.. If i install a new program, after a reboot its gone the same way files i save in docs disappear. Its strange
 how this started at the same time my bookmark problems in firefox started. It makes me wonder if its all from the bsod from reinstalling avast. I have mse antivirus on my win 7x64 laptop and once this gets resolved, i'm gonna install it on this pc instead
 of avast. I haven't made any other changes to the pc and even if i do, it all disappears after a reboot. Even each days history in firefox disappears after a reboot. I can't afford to take it anywhere to have it checked out. I'm worn out the past 2 days dealing
 with this. Thanx again for your help.<br />
        </p>
