<h2>            Fit to page for Word 2010 how do I find it and turn on the option&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;How do I find the old option and turn it on FOREVER!! I figure it out the other day but I was so darn tired that I don't remember the 4 hours of steps I went through when I finally stumbled across it. I tried everyones suggestions from previous persons
 inquiries but could not figure out what the heck anyone was saying. I do not want to hear anything from anyone on how to scale my line spacing or letter sizes. I want to know how to turn on or at least how to get to shrink/fit to one page option. I also need
 it told to me as if a child not as someone who uses it 8 hours a day for their whole life and speaks only tech-ese.&nbsp;

            <p>Please note that Stefan's original reply said: "Add the Shrink One Page command to the Quick Access Toolbar: Right-click the QAT and select Customize Quick Access Toolbar. Look in the 'All Commands' category, select the command and click Add."</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's really and truly all you have to do. When you select <strong>Customize Quick Access Toolbar
</strong>from the dropdown menu, this opens the <strong>Customize the Quick Access Toolbar
</strong>dialog. By default, the selection of commands presented (under "Choose commands from") is "Popular Commands"; instead, you select "All Commands" from the list and scroll down to either
<strong>Shrink One Page </strong>or <strong>Print Preview Edit Mode </strong>(your choice), select it, and click
<strong>Add</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know where you're getting all the other options you are seeing, but I suggest that you ignore all the other tabs available to you on the left of the<strong> Customize the Quick Access Toolbar
</strong>dialog and note that the <strong>Print Preview and Print </strong>command is
<strong>not</strong> the one you want; that's what you get already when you choose
<strong>File | Print </strong>or press <strong>Ctrl+P</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Task &#39;SharePoint&#39; reported error &#40;0x80070005&#41; - SharePoint Contact List Permission issue. Multiple login requests</h2>
                    Dear Community,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have had a look around the net, but I can't seem to find a fix for my problem (although it may have been answered somewhere on this site)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a number of problems, which I believe are interconnected. but let me first give a brief outline of the setup.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have office 365 , all machines have Office 2013 installed (Pro - plus ) . Most of the machines (local machines) are windows 7 , but all the staff also do a lot of work on a remote (central ) server. which is running Windows Server R2 2008 (with office
 2013).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I set out on what I though was a modest project. I set up a sharepoint list with our customer list. This customer list would then sync to outlook and would also have a linked table relationship with an access database that manages our daily orders. (using
 the "open in Access" option from within sharepoint online)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I got as far as putting this all together from my machine and all seemed to work. I split my access database, (as sharepoints list and multi user access seem to be mutually exclusive). with one back end and the front ends distributed to the users.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am now looking to push the system out to the other users and I am having a variety off issues, which I believe hangs on the various users inability or conflict when trying to connect with the sharepoint list.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>From the outlook perspective, I get "Task 'SharePoint' reported error (0x80070005) : 'You do not have permission to view this SharePoint List (). Contact the SharePoint site administrator. HTTP 403.' &nbsp;So that the user is not able to syncronise the contact
 list to their outlook. Another user received a similar warnings advising that they did not have the sufficient permission to access the list. (they were not able to connect to the list at all)</div>
<div>In addition, whenever the user open the access data base that, they can navigate through the tables and forms, but as soon as the come into contact with any object that has a relationship with the sharepoint list (or its linked table) access simply hangs
 and remains unresponsive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Strangely enough, for one of my users, I somehow managed to get the system to work. (both outlook and access) but unfortunately, I don't remember taking any concrete steps or changing any settings that could have created the fix....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All user have access to their email with no issues, and are able to view the sharepoint list via the website&nbsp;(i haven't tested if they can modify yet)&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>there is one other oddity , that is: If I (even as the creator of the list) try and download the list to Excel (to create one of those query files) excel hangs and eventually crashes. If I create the query file on a separate system and then import it to
 the R2 2008 server, the query will not refresh telling me I do not have permission. or " cannot be updated at this time"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As I type, I get the feeling I must be related to the use of 365 across the R2 2008 platform and windows 7 , but at the same time don't understand what would cause the issue. Also, the Server is hosted from the USA (I believe) and the rest of the machines
 are based in Australia. Would this make the 365 security flair up for some reason?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help, very much appreciated!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<div><br />
<div>I have managed to find a fix. I really don't understand why it has worked , but it has.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Following advice from other forums on a similar problem, I entered iExplorer , went to Tools, internet options, security , and clicked on "custom levels of security" scroll to the bottom and tick "automatic logon with current user name and password"&nbsp;</div>
<div>I then added these sites as trusted sites .&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>https://*.sharepoint.com</div>
<div>https://*.microsoftonline.com</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then had the user logon to the sharepoint site on the browser. (iExplorer)</div>
<div>and had them tick the "Keep me logged in" button before signing in.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>from there I deleted the old address book and re-added it to outlook.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It all seemed to work fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Repeating the same steps with iExplorer on the server side, fixed the Access crashes also.&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I go to view an outlook attachment document it opens in the same browser tab as the email meaning I can't have the email and attachment open at the same time. &nbsp;If I want to return to the email, I have to click the back arrow which then closes the
 attachment.</div>

<p>Hi ShereeBajon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not feasible to uninstall Skype for Business&nbsp;individually, if you want to uninstall it, you should uninstall entire Office suite. It's the reason why it takes you to Programs list. If you don't want to use Skype for Business but still want use other
 office applications, you can stop Skype for Business from starting automatically, and exit your account from Skype for Business. Then your Skype for Business is still on your computer but you won't see it. To stop&nbsp;Skype for Business from starting automatically,
 you can refer to following link:</p>

    <title>Turn off Calendar Overlay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephaniewerbe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off Calendar Overlay</h2>
                    <p>I have a user with Office 2016 Pro who is not able to turn off the calendar overlay option. She opens many calendars throughout the day and wants to see them as individual, not overlaid.&nbsp; When she clicks on the arrow to setup the calendars side by side,
 it will stay like that for a little while but then reverts back to being overlaid. This happens off and on all day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see a lot of responses online for keeping Overlay as the default but nothing about turning it off permanently. Any options for that?</p>

            Hello StephanieWerbe, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest following the instructions down below.
<br />
<br />-Open calendar overlays page.
<br />-Click on the calendar link which you want to remove.
<br />-In the bottom of the page, you can see "Delete" button.
<br />-Clicking Delete will remove that calendar from the overlay.
<br />
<br />You can also find more information on the URL down below.
<br />URL: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-multiple-calendars-at-the-same-time-fffa8783-0556-4ea1-ba62-3ed8a95a903c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Thank you and good luck,

<p>Thank you Irisdiel but that really doesn't resolve the issue we have. We need the calendars to
<strong>Stop</strong> overlaying all together. We know how to remove the calendars from the overlay already. My user has to toggle them off the overlay setting throughout the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to make the <strong>Side by Side</strong> option the <strong>default</strong> so that they don't Overlay unless the user wants the calendars to overlay. For some reason her system keeps reverting back to overlaying the calendars even after
 she has set them up as Side by Side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been happening to her for months and I can't seem to find a solution. Most people seem to have the opposite problem so its a bit frustrating for both of us to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions? I would like to avoid and VBA changes but I'm not opposed to a reg hack if that will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Hello, sorry that didn't work!
<br />
<br />How about the following:
<br />-Open the Google Calendar.
<br />-In the top right, click Settings Settings.
<br />-Next to "Events from Gmail," uncheck the box next to "Add automatically."
<br />-At the bottom of the page, click Save.

<br />-Open Outlook.
<br />-Click Calendar in the Navigation pane.
<br />-Check two or more calendars you'd like to see.
<br />-Right-click one of the checked calendars.
<br />-Make sure overlay mode is off.

<p>Hi Irisdiel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked each calendar as you requested and made sure the Overlay was toggled Off. So far it seems to be working for her. We'll monitor it over the next few days to see if it changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Site Navigation goes wrong with Modern Experience</h2>
                    <p>Please fix this issue urgently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have structured Site Navigation: </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eae15333-b5be-4b25-8ffa-21b58bbb2787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eae15333-b5be-4b25-8ffa-21b58bbb2787" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is manually sorted as per below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b500a2b2-7d3c-4564-b2fa-b0018489cd87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b500a2b2-7d3c-4564-b2fa-b0018489cd87" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However,&nbsp;with the Modern Experience&nbsp;even when the navigation Setting is set to "Display the Same Navigation as the Parent Site", it creates a global navigation which shows a range of subsites, which we do not want to view. We want it to work like it should
 (ie the Old Experience)</p>

            Hi Justin,<br />
<br />
Based on the information got from the escalation team, I would like to share a summary here.<br />
<br />
If you need further assistance or have other questions regarding the topic, you can directly reply to our escalation engineer's email.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When in the new experience of SharePoint Online Library, the subsites always show on the top Navigation bar, and cannot be hidden or removed.<br />
<br />
This happens when,<br />
<br />
1. the subsites are created with Display this site on the top link bar of the parent site selected;<br />
<br />
2. SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature is enabled.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Status</span></strong><br />
<br />
We have been aware of this situation, and are planning the fix. The ETA for the deployment is currently not available. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Workaround</span></strong><br />
<br />
We can manually hide or remove the links in the Top Link Bar settings. Use the below URL to access it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;https://<em>&lt;SiteURL&gt;</em>/_layouts/15/topnav.aspx<br />
<br />
Currently, it is also suggested that, if SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature is enabled for the site collection, we use the classic experience for the Library. The admin can set it by going to the Library Settings &gt; under General Settings, Advanced
 settings &gt; at List experience section, select Classic experience &gt; OK.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your working with us.<br />
<br />
Rene

<h3> charlie barnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not all Google calendars are synced in Outlook for Mac and iOS but are all synced across every other app</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue syncing all of my Google calendars in Outlook for Mac (Office 365 subscription via my company).&nbsp; Here's the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When adding my Google account to the Mac and iOS versions of Outlook, I can only see 5 calendars.&nbsp; The same 5 calendars are presented in both the Mac version of Outlook as well as the iOS version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the 5 calendars presented, it shows:</p>
<p>- My primary google calendar</p>
<p>- A calendar owned by my wife and shared with me</p>
<p>- A calenar for my daughter owned by my wife and shared with me</p>
<p>- The Family calendar automatically created by Google that is shared with all family members</p>
<p>- A calendar created by me for which I changed the name, however the old name is shown in Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook does not show two other calendars owned by two other family members and shared with me</p>
<p>Outlook does not show a new calendar that I just created to see if it would show any newly created calendars that are not shared with others</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior is the same across Mac and iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if this is a known issue or even if it might be related to a policy managed by my company.&nbsp; All of other apps to which I've added my Google account, show all calendars.&nbsp; I've also gone to www.google.com/calendar/syncselect and all available
 calendars are selected for sync across devices.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Charlie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, There is currently a 20-calendar limit for calendars shared with you for Gmail account. You can contact Office 365 admins in your organization to see if they have setup some policy to limit it. If they indeed setup
 some policies, we cannot do anything to modify it. Meanwhile, please download <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4483875/outlook-for-mac-support-utilities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Reset Preferences</a> tool and follow the prompts to reset the preferences to see if it helps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please contact <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517">

Other brands like Nokia and Sony Ericsson can do this.<br />

            This is not possible in Windows Mobile.<br />
This is because the operating system is running wich is controlling the alarm. <br />
When the phone is turned off, the operating system is not running.<br />
<br />
The phone can not be automatically powered on triggered by the alarm.<br />

            Suggest:<br />
- restart your phone and check again<br />
- if use headphones, please check your connect or/and unplug n plug back and test again<br />
- can you tell us how loud your volume is? (maximum? or how many bars?)<br />
- I noticed other phone like 6120 generates some noise by running the same program as N73 (mine is n73 not ME), but no noise.<br />
<br />

    <title>Connection problem of Nokia 6151 with Nokia Music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blueray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connection problem of Nokia 6151 with Nokia Music</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Nokia 6151 (RM-200), Firmwareversion 4.1.0 (which is the latest available), and the Nokia Music program (v. 1.3.20722.01). The USB connection cable type for connecting to my PC (Windows XP Home SP 2) is CA-53. In the past, when the music manager
 was integrated into the Nokia PC Suite, I had no problem with connecting the phone to the PC, and copying music to and from the mobile device. But since Nokia Music is a separate program, I am unable to connect the phone to it (note: this only refers to Nokia
 Music; the connection to Nokia PC Suite works fine). Whenever I try to connect, I get the error message that the device is connected in the wrong mode, and that I should select either "<em>Media-Player</em>", or "<em>Printing &amp; Media</em>", or "<em>Media-Data-Transfer</em>"
 mode. But none of these modes is availableon my device. The modes actually available there are rather "<em>Default Mode</em>", "<em>Printing</em>", or "<em>Data Storage</em>".</p>
<p>Just as a further note: I have already un-installed the connectivity cable drivers, and re-installed the latest modules. To no avail. Can anything be done here? Is my device model (6151) at all suitable to be connected to Nokia Music?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I have contacted Nokia support directly, and I have been told than indeed the 6151 does not work with the newest version of Nokia Music. Only thing what helps is to re-install an older version of Nokia PC Suite, where Nokia Music is still integrated.</p>

    <title>Unrecognized Database Format Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unrecognized Database Format Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a very difficult time flushing this error out of our system.&nbsp; Here is the setup:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Running Access 2016 32 bit</p>
<p>- 40 users, usually not more than 15 concurrent</p>
<p>- Split DB, front end is on each users desktop.&nbsp; I have two back ends (A and B) that live on a network server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally it was only the "B" back end database that would lock up/go into the "Unrecognized Database Format" state.&nbsp; But today back end database "A" went into the "Unrecognized Database Format" state.&nbsp; I've been dealing with this for some time, and thought
 that I solved it a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I found a DAO field object that I wasn't closing.&nbsp; I fixed that and it seemed to work fine for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; Then today it's crashed twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone give me some advice on what the problem might be?&nbsp; Is it likely that if I migrate the back end to SQL Server on Azure that this problem will go away?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim</p>

<p>What version and build are you running? Seems to be some issue arising with 1807 build 10325.20082. See this question:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Regarding moving to SQL Azure: While that's certainly a good idea, it's not without challenges, especially if you're a drag-n-drop type of programmer. Azure is a remotely hosted SQL Server database, so if you haven't practice good client-server techniques
 you may find your application to be far less responsive.</p>

            You cannot return to a previous version of firmware but I do believe that you can load a language pack for the phone. Perhaps have a look in the communicators forum and see if there is any help on doing that. If all else fails you can take the phone to
 a Nokia Service Center and ask them to do it for you.<br />

<h2>            missing rtl20,bpl. When i boot i get this mess.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have a (new, 4 weeks ago), Asus Windows 8.1 computer i have been useing. I think i had a bug in it or something because after the Mcaffee subscription told me i had to pay, i uninstalled it. Promptly putting Avg in its place.
</p>
<p>When i ran a scan earlier it found 5 issues that it had taken care of. they were only tracking cookies as far as i could tell, i was not paying attention. (i did not know of the problem atm. :(</p>
<p>i would consider myself to be an above average user, (have always managed to fix any problems that came along with previous versions of windows on both my comp. and others around me., (with a little help from Google and some chat rooms/ FAQ's sometimes...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when i boot this computer it tells me that AsusTray.exe will not (can not) run {because 'rtl120.bpl' is missing} I have also seen this messsage for RealTimProtector.exe and 'ASCTray.exe, (i would assume the last one is for Advanced System Care 7. a cleanup
 program i have since redownloaded (the full version. of which i did not have previously). This program will run now. it is saved in a different place.</p>
<p>I was hoping if i managed to reinstall one&nbsp; of these items it would replace the missing file. no such luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if i go to the start page, most of the apps on the screen are blank and if i click on one it will flash...&nbsp; and end up on the desktop. (for eg : if i want to check mail i would go to start and find the mail (clickable) app and try it. the screen would
 flash and return to desktop. if i try to 'put on right' (or left), the splitscreen, the 'app' will appear (its splashscreen) and then goes to a blank green screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this out when i tried to install the donagle for bluetooth. when i boot, just before the login screen. It tells me that windows has new items for me to install and to find them in the 'PCSettings', of which i cannot open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this a virus, or have i just erased a file by mistake some where along the way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can let me know where to find the run time library files, (rtl120.bpl) to download and place the file myself, with a little direction i can place the file in my system, (provided i get access) myself. if this will do the trick i hope.
</p>
<p>thanks in advance for any help</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<h3> ideas---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia C7 do not turn on. Happened during installation of latest software update via OVI</h2>
                    
<p>C7-00, purchased last month (august 2011).</p>
<p>The phone is attached to my computer via OVI, as a regular practice for a couple of years.<br />
Today I got an alert from OVI to update my mobile software. It started fine but during installation, got turn off, and then never start again. I tried every known method to turn my C7 on (power button, vol+cam+menu+start combination, removal of battery for
 more than a hour, charging it for hours), but no way. The power button gives a vibration but the screen remains blank. Initially the usb port slot gave the blink light, while pressing the power button, but now its also gone out.</p>
<p>Please help me out.﻿</p>

<p>The problem is solved at NOKIA CARE CENTRE. Many thanks NOKIA.</p>
<p>As the NCC told, the problem was due to bad installation of software update through OVI. I connected my phone via USB cable, as asked by OVI, and here´s the culprit I think so. While installing updates my phone got dead. Might be the USB cable is not good
 as it was not original nokia.</p>
<p>I took the phone to NCC, they installed new software and its alive again. Coming back home, I copied my stuff in my mobile, attached to OVI. It alert for some updates. The phone was connected via Bluetooth. While updating the OVI again asked to connect via
 cable, and again I attach it, and again it got dead. I run to the Nokia Care center and they happily copied the startup software again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is SOLVED.</p>

<p>It may need a simple Flashing by Nokia Care and that would not be a problem for them. Surely it will be done out of Warranty..on a Chargeable basis ...</p>

    <title>Excel online data sorting problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanatwildlife  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel online data sorting problem</h2>
                    I attempted to use Excel online at my organization in order to share a spreadsheet with ~ 10 individuals, all of whom needed to contribute data. The shared workbook is stored via our organization sharepoint / onedrive (which I admittedly do not understand
 terribly well, other than it being our access point for cloud storage and collaboration). Things went well until someone "sorted" on one of the fields, as one naturally does to visualize the data in a relevant manner. Unfortunately, only a single column sorted,
 the data was effectively shuffled, and the exercise ended in total failure and a necessary reset. Why did Excel not offer the typical "we see neighboring data, would you like to expand your selection?" prompt?&nbsp; It seems to me this behavior of single column
 sorting should only be allowed after MULTIPLE "Are you SURE you want to do this!?" prompts? (if allowed at all) It seems crazy that this would be default behavior. With the number of sci-aids and interns that are part of

            <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Just to do the final update on this thread from Microsoft.&nbsp; Those devices that were expected to receive the Nokia Black update today should now be able to do so without issue.&nbsp; We were able to resolve the problem that resulted in the error message 80188309.&nbsp;
 I thought it would also be helpful to explain the difference between our two different update types.&nbsp; (Software vs. Firmware/Drive Updates)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Windows Phone has two types of updates.&nbsp; We release software type updates (referred to as Update 3 example, our most recent release) that you can receive through our Developer Preview Program, or directly to your device once
 your specific devices passes certification.&nbsp; There is also the driver/firmware type that are created by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), in this case Nokia, that directly addresses features that are related to the hardware, or include special applications/addons
 that the OEM has built specifically for their device(s).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Some items may be dependent on each other (Ex:&nbsp; FM Radio may work in Update 3, but will require the firmware update to activate it and vice versa), and other features are completely independent.&nbsp; However, the taking of the
 specific updates themselves are not dependent on the other to be installed on the device before that update can be installed.&nbsp; So if you do not have Update 3 on your device, you will be offered the Nokia Black update but not all features will be seen on your
 device until the Update 3 release is available to you.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>If you have Update 3, great!&nbsp; If you have Nokia Black, awesome!&nbsp; The issue we encountered here was more about the correct firmware matching your specific device type.&nbsp; The error calls out that the update you received did not
 match the version of hardware you are holding in your hand so it failed.&nbsp; You guys were great in identifying which hardware types were messed up and we quickly made some changes to resolve the issue.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>I want to thank you all again for jumping into this thread and letting us know&nbsp;the Make/Model, Country and Mobile Operator for your specific device.&nbsp; This information was helpful for us to identify the specific update that
 was providing the wrong details.&nbsp; You should all be up and running now and we hope to not see this again.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Thank you again, and enjoy all that the Nokia Black update has to offer!</font></span></p>
