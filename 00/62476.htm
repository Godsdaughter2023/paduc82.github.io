<h2>            Unable to install Windows 10 cummulative update including KB3210720</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows 10 since it was released and I updated my windows 7 to 10. Therehave been problems previously with updates. Like in December, the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool for Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 - December, l could not be installed
 and windows kept on restarting at 1 to 2 hourly intervals, with later decreased to about once every 24 hours.</p>
<p>Todat the similar problem has started again with cumulative update.</p>
<p>Its trying to install the fllowing updates and failing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 (KB3210720)</p>
<p>Security Update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows 10 (KB3214628)</p>
<p>Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool for Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 - January 2017 (KB890830)</p>
<p>Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) G33/G31 Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.0)</p>
<p>Feature update to Windows 10, version 1607</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anybody else facing this issue as well?</p>
<p>Whats the solution and how to complain to microsoft about it?</p>
<p>I am thinking of going back to windows 7. It was so much better.</p>

            <p>I have not found any solution for this problem yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even live chats with Microsoft technicians has not cured it. I have tried it twice and they took the remote access to pc and tried a lot of things but to no use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: 6th March 2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is still not been resolved and although my computer is not restarting as often as before but still restarts at least once every 24 hours.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand when you use phone to join skype for business meeting, you cannot see the shared document unless you have a Mic plugged in. To narrow down the issue, please provide some information as below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you tried to join the meeting on computer? If not, please try it. (There are two options:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Join-a-Skype-for-Business-meeting-3862be6d-758a-4064-a016-67c0febf3cd5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
join with your credential</a> and <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Join-a-Skype-for-Business-meeting-with-Skype-Meetings-App-Skype-for-Business-Web-App-4828ad18-ed21-422a-a870-94d676d4b72a#Version=Skype-Meetings-App" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
join as a guest</a>).</li><li>If the issue just happened to you or happened to all users in your organization who use phone to join skype for business meeting?</li><li>Except document, is there any other format file you cannot see? Such as picture</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure that the one who adds or shares a file can perform as this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-a-file-to-a-Skype-for-Business-meeting-f74f3958-b447-4905-a98f-de67ff977db0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. You can let the organizer give your permission to download the file, and then check if you can see and download the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, if it just happened to you or few persons, please try to sign in your account on the another phone which can view shared documents. Or re-install the skype for business app on your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;Iry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay We are using a computers we are not using a smart phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem happens to all our computer.&nbsp; If we are invited to a Skype meeting and connect to the meeting (on a Computer) we can't see the shared screen.&nbsp; we get an error "you need to set up an audio device".&nbsp; we are connecting to the audio part of the meeting
 using a telephone (land line) so we can here the presenter but when they try to share their document or screen it never connects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we connect to a Skype meeting (on a Computer)&nbsp;using a headset&nbsp;with &nbsp;microphone the shared screen or document works fine.&nbsp; we have over 100 users it kind of crazy to think that we would need to buy over 100 headsets.&nbsp; Attached is the screen shot of the
 error.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the screenshot you provided and description, it seems that you cannot join the skype meeting without a Headset, cannot see any presentation. You may set the Headset as your Audio device, please check as this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-Audio-Device-options-in-Skype-for-Business-2533d929-9814-4349-8ae4-fca29246e2ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and change to other device and test if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please provide us the skype for business version (Help &gt; About skype for business) and the screenshot of the audio device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try FreeHideFolders which both hides the folder and requires a password for access so 1st someone has<br />
to know it exists and its location and&nbsp;name&nbsp;and then they have to know the password.
<strong>HINT</strong> - write<br />
down the password and keep in several places including at home.<br />
<br />

<br />
Other that will allow you to encrypt files, folders, or entire drives.<br />

                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a weird problem that I have already encountered twice on Windows 10. My Windows Mail App is not allowing me add a new account. I used the Windows Powershell to uninstall and reinstall the app, but still no luck. It just says "Something went wrong."
 Like seriously? Error code is below:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done as instructed, and&nbsp;ran the Windows Store App troubleshooter. It told me to use the Windows 10 trouble shooter, which I did, but no problem was found on that version. A problem was detected on the old version (Service Registration corrupted or
 missing), but it says "not fixed" however. None of the other troubleshooting steps in the other link given matched my error. I tried a few, but still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 10 pro btw.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your steps, but unfortunately nothing worked. However I think I figured out it was an user-based problem. After I created a new User, it seemed to be working fine. It's just really annoying having to wait 4 hours to transfer 800 GB worth of files
 to my new account :(</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It broke AGAIN! The next day I opened up my mail, everything went to ****. It broke again, and it doesn't sync my folders either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code is new, but it's similar to the original one. Microsoft updated the Hotmail/Outlook web mailbox interface today, in my opinion its ****, but do oyou guys think that may be why the sync isn't working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this!?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Every email service doesn't work, including gmail, yahoo, hotmail/outlook. This is ridiculous, I can't do anything, the web version has too many ads to function properly, and the app version is broken :(</p>

            <p>Okayyy, I'm back, guess what, it broke again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does it keep doing this?!!? I didn't touch any system files so I'm confused as to why a perfectly normal machine would corrupt files by itself. After last time, I successfully added my 2 email accounts, and it worked fine until today. It wouldn't sync,
 then I try to edit my account information by going into "manage accounts", it wouldn't open either. It had the exact symptoms as last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft, is there a permanent fix to this?! I really don't want to transfer my files to another user every 2 weeks.</p>
<p>

 matter serious. So if you're ever wondering about your child's account call the Xbox Support Number. Oh lastly tell Microsoft if you call them the account that hacked your son make sure to ask your son what happened and why did it get hacked. We're sorry that
 people ruin your child's gameplay and activities. We hope you'll get the suspect and bring the ban hammer &nbsp;upon them.

<p>@COYO, I think FIFA players and FIFA cash are server side data, meaning that having backups of game save data will not help unfortunately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume the account was not stolen too, only the FIFA players and cash? This could be because of several things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Your son gave them away to another player because the other player told them they could double whatever he have them
</li><li>A trade with cash and players was a scam </li><li>A player has found a glitch to take all the players and money </li></ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your sons account WAS stolen too (If he cannot sign into his Xbox LIVE Profile) then you will need to call support and get them to start a lockdown on the account, so that it cannot be used. Then change the password to the account, and add security
 proofs ASAP.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>IM, as an ambassador you should know not to say things like that. You need to learn to conduct yourself in a much better manner. Medium was not saying anything wrong when he corrected you. He was just letting you know something that you can use in the future.

<p>@COYO, I'm a bit confused, just because I posted a suggestion on a support forum doesn't mean mine is the right answer. Everyone's post is recognised and can be helpful. I don't understand why you're angry at me, it's not like just because I answered the
 post as well you won't get XP from the ambassador programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a problem with me - please let me know using the PM system so we can work something out, there's no need to have a go at me on this support forum for doing something which has somehow upset you perhaps? Was it a post I made on your multiple threads
 you made the other day on how you hate Microsoft, followed by your multiple posts containing abusing words and language?</p>

<p>I've reported this to the moderators. Please also know that Xbox Ambassadors are supposed to be role models, and help others who need it, and shouldn't act like you are now. Ambassadors posts are reviewed, and abusive ambassadors are usually removed from
 the programme. </p>

    <title>Samsung Natural Color Pro app for Syncmaster 204B monitor on WIndows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joyrothman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung Natural Color Pro app for Syncmaster 204B monitor on WIndows 7 64bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have just migrated to a new PC running Windows 7 Pro (64bit) from my old Asus PC, running XP Home 32bit. I do photographic editing and need to regularly re-calibrate the color, contrast and luminance settings of my monitor. The Samsung Syncmaster
 204B is a superb LCD monitor, even if it has quite a few years on the clock. Everything works OK on WIndows 7, but the software that came with the monitor will not install on my 64bit Windows 7 OS since it was designed exclusively for XP 32 bit machines.</p>
<p>I asked Samsung support for help but their download proposal for an updated 64 bit version of Natural Color Pro installs OK but does not run on the new machine. All I get is the opening white screen with the words Samsung Electronics, followed by nothing
 (the application does not open, the screen disappears and it returns me to the Windows 7 desktop).</p>
<p>I'd be most grateful for suggestions from the community</p>
<p>Many thanks !</p>
<p>Joy&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Jayant - many thanks for your kind reply. </p>
<p>I have tried both those solution options you suggest but to no avail.</p>
<p>In fact, I disinstalled the newly downloaded program from the Samsung site and then re-downloaded it again, following exactly your procedure, but it didn't work - same problem as originally.</p>
<p>I think it could be more than a compatibility problem. Perhaps it lies in the fact that Natural Color Pro is designed for 32 bit OS and not 64 bit OS. My old XP (32bit) computer works fine for calibrating the monitor with Natural Color, so I shall just swap
 between my new and old systems in order to re-calibrate the monitor settings as and when necessary. It's a pain and time consuming, but I can't see any other alternative. Samsung support are not very helpful with investigating my problem !
</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<h2>            Games&#47;Apps&#47;Xbox Crash or &#8220;Take too long to start&#8221;</h2>
                    <p><span>I had to send my xbox one x back to Microsoft to be repaired due to no display upon startup. I exhausted every possible troubleshooting option and even took it to the
 local Microsoft Store before doing so. I received my fixed Xbox and had no issues for approx 6 weeks. One night I was playing a game and began to have odd issues. The system overall felt “laggy” from initial startup, controller latency, apps/games not loading
 or crashing but not on a consistent basis. My internet connection is not the issue, as i have a hardwired 1gigabit fiber connection that was checked and rechecked- also no connectivity issues with other devices. My games then began to experience issues. Content
 not loading in correctly, and issues with structures not loading in as well odd texture effects noted. Then, during gameplay my xbox crashed. Multiple error numbers popped up during the next 4 hours while I was unable to use my Xbox(only one that i have a
 picture of on my phone is E105-8007001F) I attempted every known trouble shooting option from a simple restart to an offline factory reset until my xbox finally started working again (after 2nd OFR). I was able to fully load a game but experienced crashes
 every time i loaded into actual game play. The next day, everything randomlly started working normally. Fast forward two weeks, I started having the exact same issues as when this experience started. Im incredibly frustrated, i dont want to send my xbox back
 in for repair and be without it for any time whatsoever. I only subscribe to an ISP, no TV, and the xbox is my only form of multimedia. I have only ever owned an Xbox, here from the very beginning but I am VERY close to buying a PS4 Pro.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Also, something rather odd ive been able to figure out while dealing with this issue for HOURS... If i click on a game to start it up, one that always displays “took
 to long to start” and right after doing so I start to spam open other programs/apps while alternating reopening the game/app that I’m trying to use, eventually it will begin to load.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>As previously mentioned, i have done all troubleshooting. In order to get anything to work (all factory resets would pause around 66%) i had to do 2 OFRs. Now my issue
 is degradation of xbox performance to a point where i cannot load any games or apps and have to do a FFR every 1-2 days in order for anything to work, but i have ceased receiving error codes.&nbsp;</span><span>If
 the answer is to send it back in again it’s really unacceptable that my issues weren’t fixed the first time. I use</span><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span>my Xbox for everything
 and have had to go without it for over two weeks once already. If Microsoft won’t offer to loan me a replacement while fixing this one again I foresee myself selling this x to someone else and moving on to Sony.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>P.S. I have already done all troubleshooting, restarts, soft/hard resets, FFRs (literally dozens) including 3 OFRs.&nbsp;</span></p>

Xbox Support</a> and set it up for a repair.&nbsp; If you have tried everything there is really nothing we can suggest.&nbsp; If you registered your console you should be able to go to devices under your account online and start the repair process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows does not sleep&#47;spin down HDD after a period of inactivity</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>following Problem:</p>
<p>I set the HDDs do spin down after 2 minutes of inactivity in the "balanced" powerplan, but Windows never spins the HDD down, even after a long period of inactivity.</p>
<p>The os is installed on a SSD, the HDD only contains Music and Images, which, in theory, should not be accessed all the time.</p>
<p>I also deactivated the indexing service.</p>
<p>I know, that there are many threads describing the same problem, but i have not found a solution yet.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit

<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip

<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up

                    <div>Original title: Error on the Windows Update website</div>
<div>I have recently reinstalled Windows Millenium Edition and wanted to install all update packages that were released for this OS. However, I cannot do it because when I try to access the Windows Update website, Internet Explorer infinitely loops between
 the pages <a href="http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I do realize that support for Windows Millenium Edition ended long ago, but I believe that users still should be able to download and install existing updates. If Microsoft thinks otherwise, they should at least give users a clear indication of what exactly
 happened (e. g. the website was closed) instead of just trapping the browser in an endless loop.</div>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately Microsft had stopped supporting Windows millenium as mentioned the previous post. However you may try resetting
 Internet Explorer settings and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Exit all programs, including Internet Explorer (if it is running).</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click
<b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Run</b>. Type the following command in the Open box, and then press
<b>ENTER</b>: </span></p>
<p><b><span>inetcpl.cpl</span></b></p>
<p><span>c. Click the
<b>Advanced tab</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Under
<b>Reset Internet Explorer settings</b>, click <b>Reset</b>. Then click Reset again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

If you can't tell me something I don't know already, then don't bother to reply, will you?
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I wrote "I do realize that support for Windows Millenium Edition ended long ago" and yet you are telling me the very same thing as if it were some extaordinary finding of yours :lame:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The link you provided doesn't say anything about Windows Update, and it most certainly
<strong>was</strong> available for a <strong>very</strong> long time after July 11, 2006. In fact judging by
<a href="http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/153149-i-cant-access-windows-update-v4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this thread</a> it only became unavailable in August 2011.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's <em>so</em> ridiculous that you can't even get a competent answer to a question about a
<strong>Microsoft </strong>service at a&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft&nbsp;</strong>website and are better off searching the web.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business broke as hell</h2>
                    
<p>In short, this bug from mid-2015 still exists: 
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/166/t/349443&nbsp; &nbsp; Even though I CONSTANTLY close my chat window, I have messages from any user randomly being lost. We have very few staff testing the Skype for Business at the moment, but I seem to be the only one
 experiencing this. In my Outlook, it actually shows all messages, EVEN THE LOST ONES.</p>

<p>So my Skype for Business is near useless because I have to check my convo history in Outlook at least once per day because of a random lost message.</p>

<p>I'm sad :(</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay but I stopped checking after no reply within 24 hours. I have since resolved this issue by DISABLING ALL SAVING OF CONVERSATIONS! So in Options-&gt;General-&gt;Disabled "Reopen my convos when I sign in" then over to the Personal area and disabled:
 "Save IM conversations in my email...." and "Save call logs in my email..."</p>
<p>Since then I haven't lost a message! As much as I like the conversation saving, we're much more interested in it ACTUALLY WORKING CORRECTLY!
</p>
<p>I've been running with those disabled for almost a month now and so-far-so-good!! (Was losing conversations DAILY prior to this fix)</p>

<h2>            Black Screen during upgrade to WIndows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I started my windows 10 upgrade 3 hours ago after completing the Windows test to ensure that my computer had the right spec. All seemed well until my computer screen has gone black with no mouse icon and it is unresponsive. Would appreciate any help
 as although my university work is backed up I still need a computer to complete it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Fall Creators update kills bootloader on dual boot systems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malibyte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fall Creators update kills bootloader on dual boot systems</h2>
                    <p>OK, Microsoft....you say that you are making peace with and coexisting with Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you still don't play nice with it.&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>For years, we all knew that you had to install Windows first because you didn't play nice with others, then install Linux afterward, with its GRUB bootloader that lets you boot just about any OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I made the mistake of allowing the Windows 10 Fall Creators update to happen on my laptop while I was away on a business trip...without my SystemRescue USB drive or Linux live CD.&nbsp; You guys killed my GRUB bootloader, and I can't fix it until I get
 home.&nbsp; This cost me a day's worth of work fixing a couple of remote co-located servers, since all of the tools I need for this run under Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a look at the EFI partition with bcdedit /enum firmware, and it seems that you apparently overwrote GRUB in my \EFI\ubuntu partition - since I tried using bcdedit set to change between the filenames in the \EFI\ubuntu partition (which is first in
 the boot order) - still goes straight to Windows.&nbsp; Tried doing the same with a third-party utility called EasyUEFI.&nbsp; No joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't you set up the Windows Boot Manager in another directory in the EFI partition and (if you must), just point to it instead??</p>
<p>Or, if you have to modify the bootloader to allow for the several reboots during the upgrade, just store the original setup, then restore it when the upgrade finishes?</p>
<p>Better yet, just let me use GRUB to boot into Windows after each step of the upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For next time, please consider this instead, and learn to play nice with others!&nbsp; We know you can, if you decide that you want to...!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>It appears to me that they changed it in a way that the upgrade doesn't work, at least for my config.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dual boot system setup (Win10 &amp; Arch Linux) using Terabyte BootIt&nbsp; Bare Metal. Win 10 has repeatedly downloaded and applied the update and performs the pre shutdown part successfully, but when it reboots the first time and I select Windows from
 BootIt Bare Metal boot menu during the upgrade, I get a nearly immediate reboot back to BootIt Bare Metal. When I select Windows from the BootIt Bare Metal menu again, it reverses the upgrade and tell me that it failed with an error code that doesn't lead
 to any useful information.</p>

<p>This is really annoying, I have exactly the same problem. It's time to switch to Linux fully and put windows in a VM. At least they won't be able to change YOUR SYSTEM as they want without any warning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is just pretending that they are friendly&nbsp;with Linux&nbsp;users. In the end, they want to sell more windows copies&nbsp;and kill Linux is a way to expand their territory.</p>

<p>Having now updated a number of dual-boot systems, I've found that it only seems to happen on systems that use EFI to boot.&nbsp; Old-school MBR systems don't seem to have this issue.&nbsp; On my EFI machines, I used the Ubuntu live CD to reinstall grub2 on Ubuntu
 machines, but with other distros, their live-install discs should work, or use System Rescue CD.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that it did not reenable fast boot. If it did for the first reboot in the upgrade process then I disabled it again with Terabyte Unlimited's BootIt Bare Metal (BootIt BM). I use BootIt BM as my boot manager and partition manager. BootIt BM's
 menu allows me to choose which OS to boot each boot cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Fall Creators Update, it repeatedly tried and failed to complete the upgrade for a couple of months. Every time it tried to perform the upgrade, it would install the preboot portion of the upgrade without error and during shutdown would run that
 portion of the process without an issue. However, when it rebooted the first time, it would start to put up Please Wait blue screen followed by an immediate additional reboot. During the next Windows boot cycle, it would say that an error occurred during the
 update process and then would back out the completed portion of the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I downloaded the current installation disc ISO and created a bootable USB drive with the ISO on it. After booting that USB Drive the upgrade was able to work, although intervention was still required. The Windows upgrade process doesn't like the
 fact that the Windows bootloader is not on the physical drive's boot sector and creates a new WinPE partition from the end of my system partition for its bootloader. The first time that the upgrade process reboots, I make sure that it boots BootIt BM (sometimes
 requires reboot from USB drive with BootIt BM installation media) and I check that fast boot is still disabled, delete the WinPE partition, resize the system partition to reclaim the drive space, and rewrite a Win7 master boot record onto the Windows system
 partition. For the Fall Creators Update from the ISO, it rebooted properly several times during the upgrade after the intervention on the first reboot.</p>
<p>
After the Fall Creators was complete, I thought that everything was correctly configured. However, when I attempted to reboot Linux (Arch Linux with KDE), it turned out that the Windows upgrade process had written over the GRUB2 configuration in the master
 boot record on my EXT4 Linux root partition, even though my&nbsp; BootIt BM configuration normally hides that partition when booting to Windows (and it hides the Windows system partition when booting to Linux). It apparently did not mess with anything else on the
 Linux root partition, because I did get the GRUB rescue console and was able to boot to Linux after telling Grub where to find the system. I then rebuilt the GRUB config file and everything works properly now.<br />

            My system is a regular BIOS system, it is not UEFI. My current motherboard is UEFI capable, but since the dual boot configuration was originally Windows 7 &amp; Kubuntu, I have kept it a BIOS system. Every single major upgrade has clobbered the dual boot configuration
 in one way or another: Win 7 =&gt; Win 8.0, Win 8.0 =&gt; Win 8.1, Win 8.1 =&gt; Win 10 version 1507, 1507 =&gt; 1511, 1511 =&gt; 1607, 1607 =&gt; 1703, &amp; 1703 =&gt; 1709.<br />

<h2>            Strict NAT. Will not open after trying all options. Losing my mind.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I hardly actually post on forums when needing help, so this alone is a sign that I am at my wits end. If anyone can solve this problem or lead me in the right direction it will be greatly appreciated. So here. we. go.</p>
<p>For starters, I am using a Netgear n600 WNDR340v2 that I bought a few days ago. Before that I was on the cheapest Belkin they sell at Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>I just moved to a new apartment complex a few months ago, and with it came apartment provided internet included in the rent. It is provided through a company called Xcelerate (some small southeastern ISP). It is&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>a set up like they have
 on a college campus or anything where there is just one internet for people to connect to through wireless routers located throughout the complex. From what I have learned after calling my ISP, their internet is provided through fiber connections (do not know
 what that means or if it is relevant). But as a result, I do not have a physical modem in my apartment, nor is there any type of configurations I can do through the gateway.</p>
<p>Back to my router: On both my first router and the Netgear I have now, I forwarded all ports that Microsoft has told us to forward to my XBone's static IP. Nothing. At
<strong>best</strong>, after resetting it a few times it would sometimes go to moderate, but that's it (would always switch back to strict sooner or later). I have tried UPnP, nothing. I have tried setting the Xbox ones static IP outside the routers DMZ. Nothing.
 I have "NAT filtering" set to open with SIP ALG disabled. Nothing. I have tried crying. Nothing.</p>
<p>So after doing more and more research, I came to the conclusion that I must be facing double NAT and would have to contact my ISP to resolve the issue. I told them my situation and asked if they could either 1.) Set the modem to Bridge mode. 2.) Forward
 the proper ports on the modem to my router, so the forwarded ports on my router could make it to my xbox. 3.) set my routers IP outside of the modems DMZ. They told me that they do not use modems, but instead the fiber network I mentioned earlier, so none
 of this was possible. They also said that they dont have any restrictions on their ports anyway.</p>
<p>So right before I got off of the phone with him, I remembered that I read somewhere that if your ISP has provided you with a private IP instead of a public one, it leaves you dead in the water, so I would need to request a public one. He informed me that
 all of their IP addresses are public already.</p>
<p>His conclusion was that my router was converting their public IP to private, and I would need to consult netgear to resolve the issue. Im not going to do that because last time I called they had no idea what I was talking about when I said "I need to open
 my nat".</p>
<p>Again if anyone can lead me in the right direction, I would be very grateful. I cant play xbox with any of my friends, and if I cant do that I might as well not have one.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you in advance,</p>
<p><br />
SAYNT</p>

<p>Please try again to have your One placed in the DMZ of the router and disable all portforwardings. Also please configure all the NAT settings in the router to allow all traffic to pass through. I remember this being a problem if not proper configured.
</p>
<p>The detailed NAT status you've provided talks of a moderate NAT with configured portforwardings.

<p>Thank you for your response! I reset my router to factory defaults and then only had it set out of the dmv with no port forwards and it still says strict.</p>
<p>I'm starting to believe it's an xbox problem. I plugged my xbox straight into the wall port last night, taking the router out of the situation completely. Still says strict. HOWEVER, I plugged up my xbox 360 and put in my roommates COD Black Ops 2 since
 it tells your nat type and it says OPEN. Ran a network test to be sure and received no message saying it was strict or moderate.</p>
<p>Also the 369 and One have never been on at the same time while trying to fix this nat because I know the problems that can arise with two consoles on one router.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback and the additional information.</p>
<p>Are you getting an error like "cannot get Teredo ip" sometimes in the multiplayer test? Would you mind asking your provider if you are on a native IPv6 connection and if they maybe block the teredo tunneling protocol?</p>
<p>Because if you setup the one being in the DMZ and still get a strict NAT it maybe a problem with the teredo protocol.</p>
<p>As the 360 is not using the teredo tunneling protocol you do not experience any problems there and get an open NAT on it. Might be another indicator that this could be the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, so I called my ISP and asked them everything you told me to ask and he said they use an IPv4 connection and do not have any tunneling protocols blocked? He did say he is sending it to an operations center and they are going to look into it on their
 end and see if there is anything they can do. If not they said they would have to send someone out to look at it themselves.</p>
<p>So I guess I am in limbo here until they get it figured out. Any other ideas? Thank you for helping though, you may have just lead me to getting this solved. I will post back when I find anything else out.</p>

<p>No further ideas at the moment. For now you have tried everything possible on your end like DMZ and portforwarding and also bypassing the router. Lets wait for your ISP if they figure something out.</p>
<p>It would be great if you keep me updated on this.</p>

<p>Oh.. one last thing we had not talked about yet: </p>
<p>It may be possible that you share your IPv4 adress with some other users in your building. So if any of them also uses a One they may get in conflict with the ports used by each of them. You may imagine this as all users in your building connected to one
 big router alltogether, all with the same "public" IP. So if someone else already uses the ports needed by your One they are not available for yours, so you may get a strict NAT. So thats what you described as "double" NATted. Keep that in mind for further
 investigations with your ISP.</p>

<p>Okay awesome. Thank you so much for the help. I will certainly keep you updated, I have put way too much time into this to just give up.</p>
<p>Also, if this helps at all, I just tried using my laptop as a bridge as described by the locked forum topic at the top of the forum list just as a shot in the dark. When I did it It switched to moderate. I ran multiplayer test and it said "cone nat", I hit
 A and then it said open.... However I was skeptical and reset my xbox and sure enough it was back to strict and will not return to moderate or open...
</p>
<p>I'm done trying things until my ISP calls me back.</p>

<p>I would like to skeptically proclaim that I now have an open NAT. I tried putting my computer's MAC address into my xbox, and nothing. So I decided to start from square 1 and go back to wireless connected to my router. Moderate nat. Ran test, said "cone
 NAT", hit continue: Nat type: Open. As a test I reset my xbox, because through this process this has happened a couple of times only to revert to Strict after resetting xbox (or just automatically going to strict while I'm playing it).</p>
<p>So at the moment I have an open Nat with my box in the DMZ, no ports forwarded, UPnP disabled. This means one of two things: My ISP fixed the problem, or I am just having that small half hour window or so where my NAT is open and will close again very soon.
 Time will tell.</p>
<p>I will update this you if anything changes. Thank you BobMcFly247 for all of the help so far.</p>

<h2>            Possible Windows Scam</h2>
                    I have windows 10. Had a pop-up regarding a BSOD and I was to call 877 694 1841 to have the Zeus virus removed. The company was called Capslock IT Solutions. unfortunately, I&nbsp; fell the scam. I gave them access to my computer. They told me and showed me
 that my Windows Defender was stopped, also stated that the computer was very slow and needed cleaned. They installed CCleaner software and a Malwarebytes Anti Malware software. I paid by credit card, which was originally decline and I had to call the bank
 to get it authorized. Found out later that it was a Chinese company. Is this a scam ,should I be worried about the programs they installed and I assume I need to change my passwords. Should I get my computer checked out

            <p>Yes you should be worried.</p>
<p>You need to clean install your PC and then change your passwords. You have no idea really what they may have put on your PC. Then programs you mention you could have done yourself as they are free to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep a close eye on your credit card. If you can then cancel the payment made to the "company".</p>

            You were scammed and goodness knows what else they planted on your computer as well. You should NEVER give anybody remote access to your computer !! They probably planted key loggers and who knows what else on your computer. And yes you should be worried
 because now they also have your credit card details. Might be best to contact your bank ASAP and get your credit card cancelled and get them to re-issue you a new one. Also wipe you OS and do a complete fresh install of Windows 10 to remove anything they planted
 on your computer.

            I too have had a call on similar lines after my computer was accessed by a remote user after I had updated a programme. The caller , Rick Anderson, wanted £200 to rectify the problem, but I ended the session, sadly not after I had given him control. I
 will need to monitor my bank and other details carefully. Lesson learnt.

<div><span><span>Yes, it was a scam, and&nbsp; with various names and phone numbers, one that has become very common lately.

<div><span>Besides their getting money from you for doing nothing of any value,&nbsp;</span>
<div><span>if you let them into your computer, who knows what they did there or what confidential information they stole.</span><br />
<br />
<span>So if you did, I highly recommend that you do both of the following immediately:</span></div>
<div><br />
<span>1. Do a clean reinstallation of Windows.</span></div>
<div>
<p><span>2. *After* reinstalling Windows, change all of your passwords, especially any for banks or other&nbsp;</span><span>financial sites.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Since they *might* have installed a key logger, simply changing your passwords without first reinstalling Windows may not be good enough.</div>

<h2>            Reopen an existing support ticket</h2>
                    <p><span>I would like to reopen a support ticket within the promised 90-day evalauation of my service. Part of my original problem still exists. My Windows updates are not installing correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer and review my prior service order from 6/17 is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>Order Number: MS11165160419
<br />
Order Date: 06/17/2012</span></p>
<p><span>- I'd like to re-troubleshoot the original call, as part of my original problems relating to Windows INstaller are still occurring each day now.</span></p>
<p><span>Since shortly after this service, The system is again having trouble properly installing 7 specific Windows Updates. - If I go ahead and install the updates either automatically
 on Shut Down,&nbsp;OR through the Windows Update Icon, the same 7 files appear to update properly. Except for one: It always lists that One Update could not be installed: The Windows Office Suite Servcie Pack 3. - But no other error messages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The next reboot of my PC, the system again calls for the same 7 updates. - Alsways 7 updates. - There are no errors except telling me it can't install Office Suite SP3 if I manually
 update through the windows update icon. - On the next shut down, the same 7 updates try to install.</span></p>
<p><span>It never actually installs them, and calls for the same updates every day no matter how many times I've shut down in the same day. -
</span></p>
<p><span>- I have run the Windows Installer Troubleshooter several times. It detects some problem, then says it has rectified it, but upon next shutdown, the same 7 updates are called
 for every time, and the problem still exists.</span></p>
<p><span>- There are no other performance problems with my system other than this continuing trouble with installing windows updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Please review my previous call actions, and contact me to further rectify this continued problem with Windows Installer/Windows Automatic Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,and thanks,
</span></p>
<p><span>Clinton</span></p>

            <p>We'd really love to help you, but there is no one from Microsoft Support here.&nbsp; This is a peer to peer support forum, where Windows users help other Windows users with Windows XP problems.&nbsp; You need to go back to whatever contact source you first used to open your case to re-open it. </p>

I am curious as to where you called or went.&nbsp; Nowhere does this say it was Microsoft, nor do the numbers gibe.<br />
<br />
Can we get some additional information so we can check?<br />
