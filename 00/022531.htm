            Sounds like your Wi-Fi doesn't like the MS servers.&nbsp; I would recommend unplugging the power from your modem/router, waiting for 5 minutes then plugging them back in.

<p>Choose Tools, Options, Save tab and determine the AutoRecover save location.&nbsp; Although this may do no good, you should check to see if an earlier version of your file is at that location.&nbsp; 2007 works the same way.</p>
<p>Excel 2010 saves versions of your file as you go so its a lot different.</p>

    <title>5 Day Weekly Recurring Task split across resources - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthracyte  say:</h3>
<h2>            5 Day Weekly Recurring Task split across resources</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm quite new to this and may perhaps be doing something wrong but I'm not quite sure how to make it right if so!
<br />
<br />
So there are 3 of us engineers and we all rotate around various projects and support tasks. All 3 of us have one day a week dedicated to personal training, or office administration tasks. The other 4 days of our week are dedicated to project or support work
 for our clients. Each of our days of the week are different, for instance, mine is a Thursday, whilst another of us have Monday and the other Friday.<br />
<br />
So I've created Weekly recurring tasks for each engineer i.e Engineer 1 - Weekly Recurring task - Fixed Duration - 1 day - for the next two years for instance. The same for the other two engineers.
<br />
<br />
Then we have a regular task for a client which means that at least one of us must be onsite at their premises every working day. So for this I created a weekly recurring 5 day task - starts on Mondays ends on Fridays, fixed duration. From here I want to assign
 all 3 of us to the particular task for the week and I'd like Project to be able to schedule or split this task between us, but the task itself cannot move or be delayed. So if Engineer 1 is unavailable then Engineer 2 or 3 should go to site.
<br />
<br />
Of course unfortunately no amount of levelling or auto scheduling is making this work and all Engineers are assigned the full 5 days and are then over allocated. I have been able to manually level this by giving someone 3 days worth of work, and the other two
 one each, and manually moving them in the team planner, but this is very time consuming and not how it should be I'm sure!<br />
<br />
I'd be very grateful for any help you can provide me here!<br />
<br />
Thanks
                </div>

            Anthracyte,
<div>Well first of all there isn't a quick and simple way to do what you want.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The first part (training, admin tasks) is easy to implement. The second (on-site at client's facility) requires a little more effort and it depends on how you want to track stuff.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would not use recurring tasks, at least not to control when each resource works on which task. &nbsp;Instead control engineering effort via resource calendars. Here's a starting point.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Create three resources called "Joe in-house", "Bob in-house" and "Tim in-house". Create resource calendars for each based on the day of the week they will be doing the training, admin, etc. in-house tasks. For example, assume you are Joe and create
 your calendar as having only one working day per week - Thursday. You do this by selecting the Resource on the Resource Sheet and then going to Project/Change Working Time. On the Change Working Time window "Joe in-house" will appear in the For Calendar selection
 box at the top of the window. Click on the Work Weeks tab in the lower half of the window, then click Details. Select each weekday and set it as non-working time except for Thursday. Then hit OK. You will see the "Joe in-house" calendar shows Thursday as the
 only working day for all months and years. Do the same thing for each of the other two engineers based on their in-house work day.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Create a task that is fixed duration and lasts two years. You could, at this point create a recurring monthly task lasting two years. This task is the in-house training, admin, etc. effort.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3 Assign each of the three engineers ("Joe in-house", "Bob in-house", and "Tim in-house") at 100% to the task in step two. If you then look at the Resource Usage view you will see each engineer only working on in-house task on their specific day of the
 week throughout the task's duration</div>
<div><br />
<div>That was the first easy part. The second part, on-site at the client's facility, can be done a couple of ways, (maybe more), and the best way depends on how you want to track effort. I'll outline a couple of approaches.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. First create three more resource calendars called "Joe at client", "Bob at client", and "Tim at client". Set Joe's calendars such that the working days are Mon, Tue, Wed, and Friday with Thurs being a non-working day. Do a similar thing for each of
 the other two resources.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Create another task that is fixed duration and lasts two years. Again make it recurring if you want to break down effort into more manageable time spans (e.g. monthly). This task is the on-site client effort</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. Assign all three "at client" resource to the task in step 5 at 33%. On the Resource Usage view you will see all three engineers supporting the client on-site effort at 2.63h per day with no work on their in-house effort day.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you don't want the three engineer's effort equally spread each day, the only option is to manually contour each resource's "at client" effort day by day or week by week. The latter would be a little quicker but nonetheless an arduous effort if the task
 span is long. There is no automated way to get Project to do it for you - sorry.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, another approach to the client effort would be to create a resource called "3 engineers". Set the Max unit level to 300%. That effectively creates a 3 man engineering team. Now, instead of assigning all three "at client" resource to the client
 on-site task, assign the single "3 engineers" resource to the task. The advantage of this approach is it gives 8 hours of effort at the client's site and it can be any one of the 3 engineers, because they are a non-individualized team. The disadvantage of
 this approach is that you will not be able to see which particular engineer is on-site at the client, but then maybe you don't need that level of detail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There you have it, simple as pie.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Oh yeah, Merry Christmas</div>
<div><br />
<div>John</div>

<h2>            OneDrive for business not opening</h2>
                    
<p>I have a user on Windows 10, Office 2016, and Office 365.&nbsp; Her new PC had OneDrive working great both locally and syncing to her OneDrive in her Office 365 account.&nbsp; Syncing still works, but if you click on the OneDrive for Business icon, nothing happens.&nbsp;
 OneDrive will not open.&nbsp; Anyone else seeing this issue?&nbsp; If so, how was it resolved?</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>Firstly, could you try <a href="https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Online Repair</a> and check the result?</p>
<p>If the issue persists, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. To rule out the possibility of the error being caused by the device, does the issue occur to other devices?</p>
<p>2. If you put a file in the local synced folder, can it be synced to the OneDrive for Business web page? This can help us check if the client works fine.</p>
<p>3. A screenshot about “nothing happens”.</p>
<p>4. A screenshot about the version of OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>You can check it via <b>Task Manager</b> &gt; right click <b>Microsoft OneDrive for Business</b>&gt;
<b>Properties</b>&gt; <b>Details</b>.</p>
<p>Note: To upload screenshots, please click <strong>Use rich Formatting</strong> in this thread and select the
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.</p>
<p>Please post back if you have any updates.</p>

    <title>Finding Office on HP Envy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janetgrunder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Finding Office on HP Envy</h2>
                    <p>I have a two month old HP Envy Touchsmart 15 laptop on which we are running Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I say "we" because my husband installed the software and is listed as administrator even though I am the primary user of this machine. He installed Office Home and
 Student and unfortunately, I can't get access to it.&nbsp; It doesn't show on my start screen.&nbsp; There is no charm for it under my screen name and it doesn't show up in the file folders when I am signed in.&nbsp; My husband has no problem accessing it from his screen.
 We tried to reinstall and the computer told us it already exists on the computer. We cannot figure out how to make it accessible for me.&nbsp; Since we have a desktop, I have been using that for word processing, but it is highly frustrating&nbsp; not to have it on this
 laptop.&nbsp; Obviously, neither of us is particularly computer smart, though, we've never had problems installing Word with the other computers we've owned.&nbsp; We are not sure if this is an Envy problem or an Office problem. Any one else faced this?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

            Does it only show when you print? That means you have field codes enabled but you should see them in the messages before printing too.
<br />
<br /> Click Alt+F9 will toggle field codes off and on - use that and see if it fixes the problem.

</p><p>I'm a big shortcut key guy and I used to use &lt;command&gt; + &lt;E&gt; to attach a file.&nbsp; That still works.&nbsp; But if I needed to navigate to a subfolder to select a file, I simply used &lt;command&gt; + &lt;down arrow&gt; -or- &lt;command&gt; + &lt;up arrow&gt; to navigate through subfolders
 or parent folders.&nbsp; That feature went away so I now need to open all subfolders to drill down to a file, then attach the file, then go back and close all the open folders.&nbsp; Otherwise Outlook will just attach the entire folder.</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply cause I was out of office. For this issue, please make sure if you have selected the subfolder first, that is, highlight the subfolder as the picture above. After that, if you're still unable to open it, you can try to assign a custom
 shortcut for your Outlook. For your reference, you can take a look at the following link.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-custom-keyboard-shortcut-for-office-for-mac-6bbeb90e-96d9-4e03-b199-fc026ebdc321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-custom-keyboard-shortcut-for-office-for-mac-6bbeb90e-96d9-4e03-b199-fc026ebdc321</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can try to download and run the <a href="https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/12/OutlookResetPreferences.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reset preference tool</a> to check if it helps. As a side note, this tool will reset your customization of Outlook, such as window size and position settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if the issue still exists, to better help you, please contact Outlook for Mac in-app support channel via
<strong>Help </strong>&gt; <strong>Contact Support</strong>. The dedicated engineers will share further suggestions with you. It's highly appreciated for your understanding.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi teknishn,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows XP does not include the necessary cryptographic providers for 256-bit cipher strength. Windows Vista and Windows 7 do support 256 bit Cipher
 strength. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your information, Internet Explorer 7 itself has 256 bit Cipher strength in Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What does Internet Explorer protected mode do?</span></strong></p>

    <title>Microsoft Word 2013 and Onedrive for Business, Read-Only Mode issue. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Word 2013 and Onedrive for Business, Read-Only Mode issue.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Microsoft Surface Pro 3, Windows 8.1, and I have the Onedrive for Business 2013 desktop folder installed on my desktop. Any Word file opened from the Onedrive for Business folder opens as a "Read-Only" file, including ones I created on this
 computer, which means that I cannot save my files under the same name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into the Onedrive for Business folder and checked the files properties, the read-only box is not checked for any of the files. I just want to be able to save my documents without having to save as something different. What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Preview changed view on me after an update</h2>
                    I am using Outlook 2013 Preview, and after an update, my mail view has been completely changed. Each mail used to have the sender on one line, the subject on the second, and received time/date. Then the mail in the preview box. Now it is in an old style
 excel like format with the from/subj/received date all on a single line. ANy thoughts on why this changed, and more important, how do I get it back?

How are you trying to get to it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're&nbsp;trying to use a backdoor, try starting from the root</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weightwatchers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.weightwatchers.com/</a></p>
<p>and navigating as if you had never been there before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, clear the TIF in case a route you choose is corrupted by obsolete versions of its files (or at least press Ctrl-F5 at each step.)</p>
<p>FWIW after&nbsp;inspecting the dnscache (e.g. with ipconfig&nbsp; /displaydns), it looks as if the host names involved are deep aliases with very low Time To Live.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not surprised you might have problems with them.&nbsp; If the problem is due to DNS, finding a workaround
 could be tricky.</p>
<p>If you use IE9 you could at least take advantage of its Developer Tools, Network Capture to try to understand what is, or is not, happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

            <p>Many thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I have navigated to the page several ways - it needs to be ww.co.uk and dot com is the US version.&nbsp; Have also cleared TIF.&nbsp; I've tried all suggestions and have been back on to my technical help guys at KnowHow who are able to
 help with remote access as I didn't understand what you meant about host names with deep aliases and very low time to live!&nbsp; Nothing seems to work and I've tried safe mode, even got WW to try my account for themselves and they say it works for them - so it's
 obviously something on my machine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've come to the end of the line I think.&nbsp; Much appreciate your help but I am coming to the conclusion that I have to accept I can't use this site on my laptop!</p>
<p>I'm loathe to go back to IE9 having just uninstalled it because of other issues, not connected with this website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again thanks for your interest and help.</p>

 suggested.&nbsp; The problem is still there in safe mode and we have done what we can with the web browser.&nbsp; We've even reverted to an older version of flash player - one that was around when last I successfully used the site - all to no avail!!</p>

<p><br />
How about going back to IE9 so you can try getting some clues from the IE9 Developer Tools?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm willing to help you understand the DNS side of your symptoms but only if it is not going to be a Red Herring.</p>
<p>You seem to be implying that&nbsp;your remote help see the same symptoms that you are complaining about.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you ask them to state the problem, as they see it from your symptoms, more clearly?&nbsp; Presumably they could use your IE9 Developer Tools for you too?</p>
<p>FWIW the host name that you implied you are using redirected me to</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weightwatchers.co.uk/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.weightwatchers.co.uk/index.aspx</a></p>
<p>and once there I saw the same kind of aliases and Time To Live values (e.g. in a cmd window), so many that you would probably have to capture the output of the display command into a separate file.</p>
<p>To see this the procedure would be </p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter in a cmd window:&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /flushdns<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter in an IE Address bar:&nbsp;&nbsp; your host name<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter in a cmd window:&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /displaydns&nbsp; |&nbsp; clip&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; notepad<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Untitled -&nbsp;Notepad window:&nbsp;&nbsp; press Ctrl-v</p>
<p><br />
If you really can't go back to IE9 there are alternative traces you could do but&nbsp;the simplest one, using Fiddler2,&nbsp;could change your symptom, especially if the problem is occurring in a secure transmission (e.g. in an HTTPS exchange.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

            Thank you again, Robert, this is really helpful.&nbsp; Give me time to get back to the Knowhow team and I'll see what happens.&nbsp; I actually uninstalled IE9 a week or so ago as I found browsing with it was frustrating.&nbsp; I thought at first it might have been my
 mouse that was faulty because I often needed to click twice on links and then occasionally would just get a blank page.&nbsp; Anyway, again thanks for your interest and I'll come back to you.

<br />In Outlook, you have the flexibility to make Outlook work online or offline with your email server.
<br />
<br />Go to: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/switch-from-working-offline-to-online-2460e4a8-16c7-47fc-b204-b1549275aac9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/switch...</a>

            Hi Rochelle,
<br />When you click send and receive in outlook do you get an error message? 
<br />Look on the very bottom. Please see screenshot. It is said a picture is worth 1000 words. 
<br />If working offline see if you can reconnect. Make sure that your internet is working by opening a web browser and click on the link <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/</a>
<br />If it is showing Connected to: and you are not receiving emails then we need to troubleshoot further. Please Click on Send and Receive and copy the error that shows if you need further help.
<br />Let me know the outcome and if I can help you further. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eca18e57-803a-4f8e-b77c-70efe2f8d73d?upload=true" />

<h2>            Is it just me or does the Windows 10 Mobile Alarms APP need fixing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The problem is that if you have some Alarms that are turned ON and some OFF, if you go to edit one and save it, when it returns you to the list of Alarms, some that had been ON (red) are now OFF.</p>
<p>This has been going on ever since my new Nokia Lumia 950 phone had build 1511 on it and the newest build 1703, which just installed yesterday, hasn't fixed it.</p>

<p>Hello Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That is strange. Let's work on this concern by providing us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the OS build currently installed on your Lumia 950? To check this, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>
More</strong> <strong>info</strong>.</li><li>Does re-adding the alarm time make a difference?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can also restart your phone or perform a soft reset to refresh your device. To do a soft reset, press and hold
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>Down+Power</strong> button for about 10-15 seconds until your phone vibrates and restarts. This process is completely safe to perform to any problem situation and will not delete any personal data stored on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi. Thanks. My phone just got some big update a few days ago to Version 1703.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It only does this every now &amp; then and even though it has done it a few random times since then, it hasn't done it at all today and I've edited a few alarms, combinations of either or both the text and the times. My son says he thinks I'm accidentally doing
 it myself by being careless but I know that can't be it. It has to have something to do with how slow it reacts to taps and since the 2 Alarms that are always supposed to be OFF but get mysteriously turned ON are always the 2nd &amp; 3rd Alarms in the list, it
 would make sense to me that it would is somehow reacting to touching made just before I save it after editing any Alarm. As you know, you need to tap a blank black space in the Alarm in order to get the keyboard to go away to expose the Save icon.</p>
<p>And if I think about it, where I usually tap it to do that is about where the ON/OFF slider switch is underneath it or when the screen image refreshes.</p>
<p>I hate to sound stubborn but I'm not sure what doing a Soft Reset might accomplish since it has kept doing this after that big update a few days ago that forced a Restart. Surely that accomplished even more than a&nbsp;Soft Reset would?</p>
<p>This is what I have now:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/524a6541-6a64-4755-b247-ac5b1137eda3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/524a6541-6a64-4755-b247-ac5b1137eda3" /></a></p>
<p>ADDED WITH AN EDIT: I just did a Soft Reset. They're too simple not to do to try something to fix it.</p>

<p>I'm really not sure what made me say that my phone reacts slow sometimes in my Reply on Sept 4. It really doesn't &amp; hasn't.</p>
<p>That's an issue that I've been fighting on my home computer and my brain must have mixed them up when I was Replying.</p>
<p>So are you really telling me that nobody has ever reported this having happened where a couple Alarms near the top of the list in the 2nd &amp; 3rd position will mysteriously switch themselves ON when another Alarm is being Edited &amp; Saved?</p>

<p>Currently, we haven't received any feedback about alarms turning on automatically. We've tried to replicate your query and have not experienced this on our Lumia devices. You can try using the
<strong>Back</strong> button, instead of tapping on a blank space in order for the keyboard to go away when editing an alarm and see if it makes any difference/improvements.</p>

<p>Thank you, MODERATOR, for removing my MAC Address from that image I'd added into my Question. It's weird but it had later actually occurred to me that a&nbsp;MAC Address might be dangerous personal info, similar to a Social Security # or credit card # and I'd
 asked my son who works at a Sprint cellular store with if it is something I wouldn't want people to know.</p>
<p>He said it is a bit of a security risk but that he can go on any You Tube video and find the&nbsp;MAC Address of whoever uploaded it, so I felt it must not be too risky to have here in this environment that is much safer than out in You Tube land.</p>
<p>*************** ADDED WITH AN EDIT *********</p>
<p>I just realized that I'd asked my son about an IP Address and not a&nbsp;MAC Address. My bad.</p>
<p>When I'd asked him, my mind had confused what I'd remembered on that image that I posted here on this Question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion of tapping the &lt;- icon instead of just tapping an unused space above the keyboard.</p>
<p>I'll try that from now on but it will be a while before I'm convinced that it resolved it for me. That's because it only has been turning Alarms at the top right of the list from OFF to ON pretty randomly and for quite a while, even before last week's 1703
 update.</p>
<p>What also tells me that this is some weird program glitch that might have something to do with how Windows 10 Mobile handles the timing of finger taps &amp; screen changes is the fact that the only 2 alarms of mine are the ones that have their ON/OFF slider
 switches about directly underneath the spot that I've always been tapping to get back to the screen that has the SAVE icon on it.</p>
<p>No other Alarm of mine has ever magically turned itself ON.</p>

<p>Did I ask this in Microsoft Answers or at the Feedback Hub? I hope it's in the Feedback Hub so that others who might have experienced this issue with Alarms might stumble upon it and Upvote it.</p>
<p>I know the&nbsp;Feedback Hub has been down a few days and is supposed to be up and working tomorrow.</p>
<p>I've got a few things I've been wanting to discuss over there. :-)</p>

<p>Thank you for the response. That would be a good idea to report this on our Windows Feedback Hub app so that our dedicated team will have a visibility of the issue you're experiencing and also advise you to keep checking if the alarm still behaves oddly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the issue recurs.</p>

<p>Thanks. I'll do that tomorrow when they get the Feedback Hub up &amp; running again. It's been down for a few days.</p>
<p>I'll mess with editing Alarms to see if I can pick up on some pattern.</p>
<p>Luckily it has only ever slid the switch from OFF to ON on the 2nd &amp; 3rd Alarms which are easy to see without needing to slide down and look.</p>
<p>That fact is also why I'm convinced that it is a software &amp; hardware interaction issue that can be resolved by some IT people.</p>

            <p><span>PowerPoint 2007</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is a simple example.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is only one way to do it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>1.</span></strong><span> Start PowerPoint.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It should start with one slide in it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>2.</span></strong><span> Home / Slides group / click on the arrow to the right of New Slide / click in Title and Content.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A second slide should now be added.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>3.</span></strong><span> Click on the icon Insert Chart / Insert Chart should launch / click on OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>4.</span></strong><span> An EXCEL Workbook should now launch and it will have some trial data in it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can change this if you want to but let’s leave it unchanged.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>5.</span></strong><span> You should see a chart for that data in slide 2.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>6.</span></strong><span> Now let’s save the PowerPoint presentation:-</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Office Button (top left hand corner) / Save As (on left hand side) / Save As window should launch / in the File name field: type in the file name, for example:-</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>C:\presentations\embedded_file_testing</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(You need to change the above to your own choice).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>7.</span></strong><span> Click on Save (lower right hand corner).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>8.</span></strong><span> Close the file and then reopen it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should now have your embedded EXCEL file on the Presentation in front of you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>TRAINING</span></strong></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>There are 5 items on the above page.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For EXCEL you want item 2 and for PowerPoint you want items 4 and 5.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is also plenty of information in Microsoft’s own online help facilities.</span></p>

<h2>            What the heck, WHERE&#39;S THE DRAG N DROP on OneDrive&#63;&#63;&#63; It&#39;s NOT easy to use.</h2>
                    
<p>The OneDrive interface is SO OLD-fashioned. Where's the DRAG &amp; DROP???? Why can't it be modern??? easy to use? No offense, but, for as important as OneDrive is to Microsoft, it would'nt show by looking at the total lack of user-friendliness. Always old-fashioned
 style. Make it EASY to use, not just for programmers, but design for ease of use for the average person!&nbsp; Start with obvious stuff like adding drag and drop, not "UPLOAD", lol!!! Who has the time or skill or desire to locate the ACTUAL PATHS of the source
 files every time???? It's annoying. Make it friendly to use, and that'll help Microsoft. Apple does this with every product they make. It's designed with the user in mind, not the programmer in mind. Maybe get some focus groups. OneDrive is a good idea, but
 every company has something like this. Make it FRIENDLY to use. Add drag and drop. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi MrE5151,</p>
<p>Firstly, I would explain that Drag &amp; Drop is supported in OneDrive for Business, you can refer to

this article</a> for more information.</p>
<p>If you encounter an issue when you are using Drag &amp; Drop in OneDrive for Business, could you confirm the following?</p>
<p>1. Does this occur when you dragging file from cloud to local or from local to cloud?</p>
<p>2. May I know which browser you are using? Can you change different browsers to see if there is any improvement?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are using Edge, please note that it isn’t yet supported currently. The Edge team is working to add this functionality in a future release. You can monitor
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3083635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article</a> as more information becomes available (for updates).</p>
<p>3. Could you try <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">resetting Internet Explorer settings</a> to see if there is any improvement?</p>
<p>4. Have you tried <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-Copy-or-move-library-files-by-using-Open-with-Explorer-c27bc6f3-7b38-4c29-b947-5d00c7153384?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Shazam App Failure</h2>
                    I bought a Microsoft Lumia 950, July&nbsp;2016 (after a 3 month old 650 just stopped charging) it was pre-loaded with the Shazam music recognition app, since recent Windows updates it has stopped working and just says 'sorry we didn't quite catch that' altho
 I'm holding it next to a good dab radio (Pure Evoke) at a loud volume, and i purposely set the station to one playing well known songs. Then Microsoft&nbsp;gave me a Shazam site to link to, which showed as not recommended to visit, like it was dodgy &amp; unlicenced.
 Have had&nbsp;many issues since recent updates,&nbsp;phone shutting down when you expand a photo, crazy jumbled&nbsp;type on twitter and massive type on wikipedia. And Streetwise availability on Maps is very limited.&nbsp;Windows 10 just isn't doing it and nor is Windows phones,
 where the&nbsp;battery life is shocking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Office 2013 will not open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> servetekolar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 will not open</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been having difficulty accessing my Microsoft office application for the last two days. I click on an office icon&nbsp;&nbsp;(word, power point, excel) in the start menu of windows 8 the loading circle appear then disappears and nothing opens. I received an email
 that my 365 subscription was ending on September 20th, but as far as I remember I purchased Office 2013 when my laptop initial office version expired. Trouble is I don't remember my product key&nbsp;( so I haven't tried to reinstall to see if there was an issue
 with the file). I&nbsp;have also gone into program files on the desktop to see if I could open it another way. When I go into office, I search word but don't see the application (the folder is also named office 2015). I see parts of the application ("word.cnv.dll,
 Wordicon, etc . . .) but not the&nbsp;app. When I &nbsp;press on the shortcut for word it tells me windows is searching for winword.exe, and then asks to fix the shortcut. I press yes. When I press it again it goes through the same procedure. I am now completely lost
 on what the hex is going on with my pc?</p>
<p>Update: I see the file in office 15&gt;root&gt;office 15 I click it and nothing</p>

<h2>            watching purchased videos offline - blocked &#39;cannot verify usage rights&#39;</h2>
                    I have purchased videos from the Microsoft store to watch on my tablet on flights but it wont play them in flight mode as it cannot verify usage rights... this is why I bough the tablet (Nokia 2520 and the TV shows). Does anyone know how I can watch them&nbsp;offline?

            <p>Hi cdeastwood,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you buy a Movie you have a download limit. If you try downloading again on another device it will not give you the rights to download it again. Rental videos can be viewed only on the rental device and cannot be transferred to other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using the app below to play your videos?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/pt-br/store/app/vídeo/6affe59e-0467-4701-851f-7ac026e21665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/pt-br/store/app/vídeo/6affe59e-0467-4701-851f-7ac026e21665</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloading a video is a good option if you have a slower Internet connection, if you want to make sure you get the best possible video quality, or if you'll be offline when you watch the video. Although a broadband Internet connection (cable, DSL, or LAN)
 is recommended for Xbox Video, especially if you want to stream videos, most Internet connections support downloading a video.</p>
<p>After you confirm payment, the download will start immediately. When a certain percentage of the video has been downloaded, the Play button will appear, and you can then starting watching the video. Or you can complete the download and go to your Video Collection
 to play the video later.</p>
