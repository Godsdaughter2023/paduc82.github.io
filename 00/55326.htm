<h2>            nvidia graphics driver could not find compatible graphics hardware -Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10 about a month ago. After a few problems I had most things updated and fixed. I just got my Evga 980 SC and installed it. I am upgrading from a 680. When I plugged in my DP My screen stayed black. With an HDMI my Desktop pops up but
 only when connected to the Motherboard. I tried to install the Nvidia Drivers and it told me that it could not find any Compatible hardware. Thinking that i needed to do a fresh install I uninstalled the Drivers and then tried to reinstall. No luck. Still
 cannot detect any Available hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now i've checked the device manager. The only Display adapter is my Intel HD 4000. If anyone knows how to fix this I would really appreciate it. I'm about to just reinstall windows 7 and wait a few months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Chris<br />

            <p><em>"I'm about to just reinstall windows 7 and wait a few months. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is it won't be 'free' any more. I'm close to the end of my one month 'trial' as well, and keep having</p>
<p>problems here and there. Not really wanting to risk loosing Win7 for a glitchy Win10 atm, but don't want</p>
<p>to miss the 'free' OS either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If the drivers don't detect your 980, and it is fully seated in the PCIe slot, and the power cables are
</p>
<p>fully seated, the card may be DOA.</p>
<p>If you have a cloned copy of Win7 it would be easy enough to use that to verify if the card is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"With an HDMI my Desktop pops up but only when connected to the Motherboard."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meaning your Intel HD graphics, yes ?</p>

            <p>Well a few things,</p>
<p>First, &nbsp;Thank you for the quick answer, I really appreciate it. Second,Windows 10 will be a free upgrade until July 29th 2016. it is a free upgrade for a year. I would simply upgrade next march when more drivers will be out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, My card was seated properly in the PCIe slot, power cables are fully seated. I forgot to mention that I tried my 680 out again and it had the same problem. I thought maybe I had broken my PCIe slot somehow. Looking at the other people who have this
 problem though I was more keen on the idea that Windows 10 just had a bug. After leaving it sit for two hours and restarting about 6 times the card was finally recognized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have absolutely no idea how my card is working but if anyone who is having this problem finds out why exactly windows 10 seems to be doing this, please let Microsoft know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Chris</p>

            <p><em>"After leaving it sit for two hours and restarting about 6 times the card was finally recognized. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go figure, eh!&nbsp; Persistence pays. Good to hear the 980 is recognised, at last.</p>
<p>The only other suggestion I have thought&nbsp;of meanwhile is a BIOS update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Windows 10 will be a free upgrade until July 29th 2016."</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;I may have misinterpreted the part about having only one month to revert to Win7 meaning that once
</p>
<p>that has been done you cannot go back to Win10 on the free ticket again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"...you will have one month after upgrading to revert back to the previous version of Windows on your device. "</em></p>
<p><em>"...Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need a product key for re-activations on the same hardware."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So if once you have upgraded to Win10, and as you can do a clean install at any time, then it does look like you</p>
<p>can go back to Win7 up to the end of the one year 'free' period and revert to Win10 again.
</p>
<p>Maybe even bounce back and forth between the two, as I have been doing over the past few weeks ?</p>
<p>

            Catalyst control center is a program designed by AMD to make the graphics settings easier to find.It also helps in shortcuts for display and many other things.

<p>Go to dashboard, Find the system tab, go to Memory, highlight your hard drive or internal memory and press Y clear the cache and try again.</p>
<p>If you have an internal hard drive then try copying the game over to the hard drive as well.</p>

<p>Its a known problem with the physics of the game or something like that, not the xbox. I personally have been unlucky with the damn thing. Its crashed upwards of 10 times in a row. I managed to get past the crash once then rolled of the damn gondola. I'm
 waiting for a patch cos this constant crashing is pissing me off. I'm playing Halo Reach to pass the time...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Was the <em>Bluetooth</em> working before you upgraded to <strong>Windows 8.1</strong>? Make sure your
<em>Bluetooth</em> drivers are latest and updated. You can check this in <em>Device Manager</em> using
<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> command. Also checkout this article and see if that helps:</p>

<h2>            SkyPE - Who are these &#34;Suggested Contacts&#34; &#38; how to get rid of them &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried SkyPE on my iOS device for the first time in a couple of years, and suddenly found myself presented with a list of names I'd never been in contact with before, nor recognised in any eMail communications. My first thought was that I'd been hacked,
 yet, this was the very same email account that I'd been using daily till date... so what's happened ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that these are "Suggested Contacts", yet as I don't know them, and have never contacted them.... perhaps they were SPAMers to my mail account ??? (I dont know), I really do not wish them to appear in front of those few whom I did contact over
 SkyPe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I cant seem to get rid of them, so I'm faced with two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; How can I get rid of these suggested contacts ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Has Microsoft put my own contact id in front of another person as a suggested contact - and is this is, as I suspect, a breach of Privacy Laws in numerous countries ? (UK, Europe, Asia, US).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions - other than deleting the App, which won't fix #2....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a feature of the new Skype, to easily find friends of friends. This is not a security breach in your account. If you don't want your account to appear on the suggested Contacts, you can disable your discoverability on the account page.

<p>

<p>
</p><p>There's no option to disable the suggested Contacts feature. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions.</p>

<p>It looked like a security breach! The first thing I saw was a list of contacts that had never been in my contacts list!</p>
<p>Furthermore this isn't facebook or some other Social Media system - so why would you want to suggest people for me to talk to 1 on 1&nbsp; who I never knew...&nbsp; who are they ? The names shown in the list I saw were rather peculiar, to say the least....</p>
<p>
</p><p>* what does this do for a Kids account ?&nbsp; Introduce Paedo's to kids or vice versa ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, this feature is wrong, totally wrong.</p>

<p>I understand your point, however take note that Microsoft does not allow users who are below 13 years old to use Skype. Microsoft is strict when it comes to child security.</p>

<p>Sergei,&nbsp; I have to say to you, Politely... that I differ here upon your view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SkyPE change is totally wrong. I can not understand the logic behind driving it. Can you perhaps explain why it is acceptable for strangers contacts to be shown to me, ahead and instead of my own contacts within this applications ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use multiple Social media applications, and none do this, indeed this is why I first, at thought I had been hacked... honestly whoever came up with this idea seriously needs to explain their reasoning...&nbsp; it's not just a Paedo matter, but extends across
 all others current topical issues - such as #metoo.... why should I have a daughter subjected to association with a male she does not know ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>This feature has been used by other social media wherein suggested contacts are also available. Thus, this doesn't breach any privacy as we are just suggesting based on the contacts who has a Skype and their phone numbers are connected. Still a good point
 and we will let our developers know about this. </p>

<p>On the contrary. The Suggested contacts "Replaced" my limited number of contacts (unlike other Social Media applications that I use), and led to me initially believing that someone had hacked my account and used it to be in contact with those "Strangers".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, by default, sharing my own contact details across the SkyPE network as a "Suggested Friend" ... I wonder how that can not be in breach of Privacy laws ? (Here in Japan, I know for sure, that the sharing of an email address is indeed in breech of
 PIPA, suggest you get your Legal Dept. to check it out if you're not sure)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now deleted the App. So for me, this is no longer an issue.&nbsp; But it's sort of sad to see something that was good being ruined in such a way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't blame the developers per se,&nbsp; but the new Designers (post Microsoft takeover), who would appear to be, in this case, a bit out of touch with common sense.</p>

<p>With iOS 11.2.6 et Skype version 817.0.4 / 2018.09.01.9 I can aver, the “amies en commun” (AKA Suggested Contacts) is gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is excellent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is good for privacy, sadly I feel the damage has already been done; it was a massive breach of the users’ trust especially where Skype was employed to assist with sensitive topics - sales leads, intimate paramedical support, were two I was aware of
 the immediate impact upon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some distance to go yet, but acknowledgement is due for this step.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Using uninstalled fonts in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krys1202  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using uninstalled fonts in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I use a graphics program, Paint Shop Pro, to create a many types of graphics.&nbsp; I have collected a large number of fonts (close to 50,000)&nbsp;over the years which I use in creating the graphics.&nbsp; I do not install these fonts, I simply save them in a folder and
 then retrieve them as needed.</p>
<p>In all prior Windows Operating Systems, I was able to open an uninstalled font, minimize it to the Taskbar, and&nbsp;the font&nbsp;would show up in the list of fonts available&nbsp;in my graphics program, then when done with the font, I closed it.&nbsp; Other programs also
 worked on this premise in using uninstalled fonts.</p>
<p>This allowed me to have extreme flexibility in selecting and using fonts from my collection without the necessity of installing extra fonts into the System.</p>
<p>This option&nbsp;seems not&nbsp;to be&nbsp;available in Windows7,&nbsp; I open a font I want to use, minimize it to the Taskbar, but it does not show up in the list of available fonts in my graphics program.</p>
<p>Is there a way around this without having to install and use a font management program?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>krys1202</p>

<p><span>Hi krys1202,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows 7 you may copy and paste the font you want to use in the fonts folder of Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>To save space on your computer, you can allow fonts to be installed using a shortcut instead of installing a copy of the font file each time.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>For installation of fonts follow the link given below.</span></span></p>

<p>Then you have a good reason, but aside from that I can't see the point. On the surface, it seems like a good idea. You can look up walkthroughs if you're stuck on a game, but you would have to exit the game, watch the vid, and then start the game again.&nbsp;
 Easier to use your computer. </p>

<h2>            Stubbs the Zombie not working...</h2>
                    
<p>After following the instructions and re-downloading the game more times than I can remember it still wont load...&nbsp; The game tries to start but the screen goes blank and the sound stops &amp; starts.&nbsp; I have turned to the forum in case I am missing some thing,&nbsp;I
 see others have the same problem.&nbsp; I have downloaded this game on two different (original) HDD's with the results staying the same....&nbsp; I really want to play this game, but I don't want to have to mess about to get some thing to work when I have bought it
 and it should just work.&nbsp; How do I get my Microsoft points back?, can I get them back?.&nbsp; It seems there is a known problem with this download and asking people to re-download again and again is not much help.&nbsp; My system is up to date and has no problem running
 any other title..</p>

<p>Hey there Unincredible! So just to confirm, you have downloaded this game before on the same console, but a different HDD, correct? Since having this issue, have you tried using a different storage device? Also, please ensure you have a legitimate first-party
 hard drive as required by Xbox Original Games (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/8/t/25.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../25.aspx</a>). Let me know, thanks!

<p>I have two original XBOX 360 hard drives, newest being a 120gb. &nbsp;I have tried to download the game on both and still get the same result, screen goes black after seeing the original XBOX logo and then the opening music cuts in and out. &nbsp;I did leave it doing
 this for about 20 minutes to see if would clear. &nbsp;I have followed the advice posted on the other forum theads aswell as an email reply from XBOX support (also asking for my points back which I wont get) and this has not changed the outcome. &nbsp;My XBOX is upto
 date with all the updates, it is an original generation XBOX with no HDMI but I cant see that making a difference. &nbsp;I owned this game before I had my 360 and loved it though I am unhappy that the download wont work. &nbsp;If you have any idea's im happy to try
 them..</p>

<p>This is what I usually try when I'm having any sort of download issue:</p>
<p>Delete the content from storage device, go to system items in memory and delete the rights database and marketplace system data (you may not have one or both of these).
</p>
<p>Clear system cache and try downloading again. </p>

<p>Ok, so I have tried again. &nbsp;Again no go. &nbsp;I deleted the game from my HDD and went to the system folder and deleted the "Rights database" as I was suggested to do, set Stubbs to download again. &nbsp;Once finished I selected to play the game and ........wait for
 it............black screen, music cuts in and out. &nbsp;I know the policy is not to give people there points back and I want the game to work but at what point do we just accept that it is not going to work???.....

<p>that really sucks, the actual disk plays just fine on the 360. Since you already paid for it and own a license I think you should have the right to download it and play on a modded xbox1 without any issues. DLC always seems to have issues and likes to corrupt
 saves. Some things will not even work without being connected to xboxlive. It's really too bad 360 has so many issues, hopefully they will not have the same problems with the 720. They really should put this game back on the market. It is so much better than
 halo which it was based on. I wish they would make another stubbs the zombie. Rebel without a pulse is awesome!!!</p>

<h2>            Intellipoint USB mouse propereties not showing in Control Panel.</h2>
                    I have an Intellipoint USB, PS2 compatible mouse on a Win 7 Pro 64 bit system. When I use the recommended driver, IPx64 8.0 or 8.20 drivers the mouse is recognised in the C Panel 'devices' but not in the C Panel 'mouse properties'.&nbsp; I am using the IPx64
 7.1 driver currently where the mouse is recognised in both 'devices' and 'mouse properties'. How do I get the mouse properties to be recognised when using&nbsp; the latest recommended driver, IPx64 8.20?.<br />

            <p>Not knowing exactly which mouse you have, I picked the IntelliMouse like I used to have (USB and PS/2). According to the Readme under Win7 64-bit IntelliPoint 8.2 for USB, it states that if you are using&nbsp; the PS/2 connection, then you must use IntelliPoint 7.1, so that may be the reason it doesn't show up in Control Panel.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>

<h2>            Craft one type of each bomb effect - Glitch and Fix - Bomb Challenges</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all, Ok so up until recently I was pulling my hair out trying to complete the Bomb challenges for AC:R.</p>
<p>The one I was stuck on was craft one type of bomb with each effect type, no matter what I made or how many I made this challenge was not unlocking, until the other day.</p>
<p>To get round this problem/glitch you need to quit out to the xbox settings, access the memory device that stores your AC:R save files and delete the update to the game (do not worry you will be prompted to redownload later).</p>
<p>Load the game again, but decline the update. Load your single player game save and check if the challenge has unlocked, if it hasn't spend some time crafting a bomb which effect type (effect types are things like Caltrop, Datura, Coal Dust, basically the
 very last choice when crafting bombs).</p>
<p>Once its unlocked, save your progress and reload the game and download the update again.</p>
<p>This worked a treat for me and let me finish the bomb challenges.</p>

<p>This does work, but not for the newer download for it, because it seems the title update is included in the download, because such a file does not exist on my hard drive. Is there a way to still get around this glitch, even with the newer download?</p>

If the installation CD is OEM, contact the OEM's tech support (Dell, HP, etc.). It is usually not necessary to enter a Product Key when reinstalling with branded OEM media.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Indexing stalled - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Indexing stalled</h2>
                    <p>I've scoured the internet and found others have the same problem, but no solution has been stated which works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WIndows Indexing gets stuck. it will index a number of files, then stall. a restart of the pc lets it edge forward a few records sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done multiple rebuilds, thinned the folders, and the file types to the minimum. tried removing outlook, removing other folders I really need, I've restarted the service, and a number of other angles .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i just the pc on overnight all last night and it was stuck at 52129 files indexed all night. now it's at 52153 after a pc restrart, stuck again</p>
<p>
</p><p>In event viewer I always get event 10023 on the gather, approximately every 8 minutes. This has to be a major clue. This I am assuming is related but there;'s not way I can find to work out what's causing the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>please instead of provided the usual rebuild, resrart, thin the scope advice, give me something useful. Please dont point me to another conversation as I am sure I have scoured them all. I am sure there are many others out there hoping for something in this
 space</p>

            Hi Hazza.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How would anyone know everything you've tried, so asking us not to suggest anything already suggested is useless?  You have access to some of the top experts in the world giving our time here so the better they are, the more comprehensive they will be.  If you've already tried something what's smartest is to try it again because there may be a sequence it need to be performed in, or it may work a second or third time.  What's important is that you try everything.  
<br />
<br />Run the Search &amp; Indexing troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Modify the Index so it only includes what you want and nothing else, then Rebuild the Index after doing that following this tutorial:
<br /><a href="https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/how-to-solve-windows-search-issues-index-rebuild/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/how-to-solve-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />If these still do not work and the Search Service remains set to Automatic, then you likely have deeper System problems.  Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi   HazzaBoll
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />See if these steps help:
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br /> 1. Open Control Panel.
<br /> 2. Select Troubleshooting.
<br /> 3. Click on Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.
<br /> 4. Run the Troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool. If the issue persists, I would have run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.  
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: CMD
<br />Hold down the shift key then click OK
<br />
<br /> 4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt Window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, 
<br />and then press Enter.
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it. 
<br />
<br />Also review the following:

<p>Thanks Greg . That's a very comprehensive set of steps you have sent. I've pursued all of them that I can . I can't try things like system restore or bios updates as the computer is managed by a corporate policy. I would be concerned about breaking something
 critical to the corporate such as Bitlocker or Endpoint security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite doing things like stopping every service which is not MS (and is not protected e.g Symantec), I still see the Event 10023 every 8 minutes&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly a reboot seems to result in a spurt of indexing of a few more files, then it stalls again or runs very slowly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a way to diagnose the root cause of the Event 10023, rather than just try to clean up the system which seems more of a sledge hammer approach. Surely some log or other deeper error recording can point to at least what file the gatherer was trying
 to index when the 10023 was issued, or / and a lower level program or service error</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the 10023 root cause can be established and corrected, then I except to either see windows search indexing operate at a proper speed, or I will at least know that Event 10023 is not the reason for the slow indexing</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks Andrew</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubelshooter does not provide any solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to DISM, windows updates run ok so I expect windows is healthy. I ran&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
 and no issues were found</span></p>
<p>I don't want to run the
 actual cleanup unless it's going to help and have no adverse consequences?</p>
<p>
</p><p>as per my email to Greg I would like a way to find the root cause of the Event 10023 which I get on the gatherer every 8 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

            Everything in WIndows 10 depends on the quality of the install.  So "cleaning up" is always required as is having the best possible install in the first place.  
<br />
<br />But since your install is managed by an IT department then you should have them fix this because it is likely tangled with their set restrictions.  Company PC's fall under IT Pro jurisdiction and are not well served by a consumer forums which is for end users only.  
<br />
<br />I'll be glad to continue advising you but I would ask my IT desk first.

<p>Thanks Greg. The information you provided is very helpful and I'll use this as/if I pursue further with the IT Support people. Given using IT Support would take a large period of my life away I may either just live with it or fiddle around some more when
 and outlook using web client also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then perhaps a more recent version of Windows 10 (I understand there is a new one in the pipeline which fiddles with Windows search) will magically fix it</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate the support your have provided</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile if anyone reading this stumbles upon a root cause for Windows Search gatherer spitting out Event 10023 every eight minutes (a very precise symptom methinks) , please advise or create another conversation with Error 10023 in the title for me to
 find at a later date</p>

            I don't see where the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter has been run.   If not I'd try that  troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.

            The web results for that error are sparse and mostly go to your thread, because I don't have the full error text.  The way I research these errors is copy and paste the full text and number into Google to see how others have dealt with them.  Normally Warnings are trivial, but I agree that with so little else to go on and everything else you've tried, I would dig deeper into the error by making sure it's properly fully searched.

<p>Try using "*Copy" in the search box of the folder you are working on. Select the files in the search results and delete.</p>
<p>Also try *[*] in the search box, sometimes the file names are appended with a number in brackets.

<p>Steve, I used CloneSpy and it provided me a list of all the duplicates and I was able to delete the ones that I wanted without loss of any of my files that I wanted to keep.&nbsp; I personally checked the location of the files before deleting to ensure that I
 deleted the ones that I wanted to delete.&nbsp; Since this was a free program you have nothing to lose by installing and see what it provides it does have several methods to delete the files which I found to be a big plus.&nbsp; I hope that this gives you the peace
 of mind that it will do as you want and not destroy your files, at least it did for me and I suggest the more diligent you are in deleting the happier you'll be.&nbsp; I got rid of 25GB of duplicates and all is running as normal.&nbsp; Note I am a retired IT executive
 with my entire career in management so if I could feel safe I believe you should also in downloading and checking out this program.</p>

<h2>            Bring back the pre-1.10 textures for Minecraft&#58; Bedrock Edition.</h2>
                    <p>I have been playing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for six years and the recent update for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition changed the default textures. Me and a lot of Minecraft players hate the new textures. Please bring back the textures from the 1.9 update for
 Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If you can't, then can you make a texture pack with the old default textures like you did with Minecraft: Java Edition? The old default textures is what made Minecraft, Minecraft. The new default textures makes Minecraft not feel
 like Minecraft. Minecraft is my favorite game and the new default textures make me want to stop playing Minecraft forever, and I don't want that to happen. Please change back the default textures to the pre-1.10 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            You haven't told us how long your actual movie might be?&nbsp; Also, have you first tried saving your movie to your PC (not to DVD) to see if it will save that way?&nbsp; I'm not talking about the project file (which I assume you've already saved). This is the option
 to save a movie, with a destination of your PC.

                    Hello,<br />
I would like to use Windows Live Mail, but I have a concern about using clear text authentication. Does this mean that someone could possibly get my log on details over the web?<br />
<br />
My outgoing SMTP and incoming POP3 server ports have SSL connections. Will this help hide my log on details at log on?<br />

Thanks for your help.<br />

            Hi Aqudatul, I don't speak Malay, but I believe those are the Windows Accessories and Advanced Tools. 
<br />
<br />This is just a bug and should be fix itself the next time a major update for Windows 10 is released. 
<br />
<br />Until then there is not much you can do, I am sorry!
