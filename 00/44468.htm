<p>Fala Lukao11 blza? Cara, na verdade eu uso o 3d apenas para filmes, quando jogo, desabilito todos os filtros possíveis e impossíveis isto para não ter problemas com lentidão (input lag) mais mesmo assim ela fica muito lenta.... Obrigado por sua indicação,
 to pensando em antes de comprar levar o game da loga e dar uma jogada hehehe.. vlww</p>

<p>Mano, compra uma Sony de Led, seja pra jogar ou para filmes, o tamanho depende da distancia que você senta em frente a TV, se senta perto, uma de 32 ta de bom tamanho, se senta longe de 40 a 47 esta bom, mais que isso só se você tiver uma sala bem grande
 pois assistir TV ou Jogar por varias horas cansa a vista e ao longo prazo prejudica a visão , mas não vai adiantar você levar o Game na Loja pra testar porque na loja eles tem um aparelho que melhora a imagem das TVs, pode perceber toda loja de TV tem um aparelho
 que parece um DVD mas é pra melhorar a imagem e a luz e o espaço na loja tambem são diferentes da sua casa, o melhor é pesquizar a configuração da TV antes de comprar.</p>

<p>Cara eu tenho uma de 32'' desse mesmo modelo. Eu tb sofro um pouco com o inputlag. Mas aprendi a conviver. O melhor que eu consegui deixar foi com 70ms de atraso. Vejo em forúm algumas artimanhas que o povo "diz" ter deixado com 30ms. Não sei se é verdade.
 Mas isso já não me atrapalha tanto.</p>

<p>Vlww pessoal, agradeço muito a todos. O espaço físico que tenho é muito bom e nesse caso o tamanho na TV não é o problema. Quando falo em levar na loja é justamente sentir o input lag, que nesse caso é o grande vilão. jomairodd, já fiz de tudo cara, mais
 eu tinha uma sony muito boa antes e acho que é por isso que sinto tanto o input lag, antes dessa LG eu nem sabia o que era isso. Como eu só jogo Battlefiel, Sniper, Call of Duty e jogos do Gênero, sinto muito esse problema, outros amigos que já jogaram na
 minha tv dizem não perceber nada. Na segunda a noite, peguei minha sony que hoje está em nossa sala e pensei, vo da uma jogadinha pra ver, e cara, sem comparação... Meu score no Battlefield tava em 40x10 (matadas e morridas hehehe) enquanto na lg fica elas
 por elas.... vlww pessoal</p>

<p>There's no way to get a listing of corrupt files on a memory stick - you just need to check each file to see if it works or gives you problems or an error message about being corrupt.</p>
<p>To check for corrupt files on your system, proceed as follows:</p>
<p><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>As far as saving files to memory sticks go, try reformatting the memory sticks and see if that resolves the problem (save the contents to your hard drive first
 so they can be recovered).&nbsp; Of course, if this doesn't resolve the problem your memory sticks will have nothing on&nbsp;them and you won't be able to add antything so do this at your own risk.&nbsp; I'd test it with only one stick before trying the others - preferably
 the one least used or with the least&nbsp; amount of data on it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade
 using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 That will restore ALL system files (unlike SFC which only addresses some and sometimes is unable to repair the corruption) and should restore your ability to save to memory sticks.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Please post back in any case and let us
 know what happened (and if it didn't work, what the results of the scans were and if you actually tried the system repair/upgrade process).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<h2>            Raise your voice.</h2>
                    
<p>We need to all show Microsoft how much we, the gaming community, are upset by the choices they have made that have been poor towards games and gamers for the next-gen console, XBox ONE. &nbsp;These decisions are so poor that they have made my friends and I reserved
 PS4's and making them our primary console while the ONE will be picked up when Halo 5 comes out and will be a console for exclusives only.</p>
<p>Speak up if you are doing the switch or going to primary PC because of this for any of the failed reasons that have plagued a system before it even releases.</p>

<p>----If you will switch your primary platform, reply with yes. &nbsp;If not, then no. &nbsp;After that flame and troll this board all you want.----</p>



<p>And we thought the RRoD was bad.</p>

<p>It is not going to be free in a few months for PSN. &nbsp;They are adapting an Xbox Live business model and will be charging $50 per year if you want to play online. &nbsp;If you think they are not going to do that to PS3 users and just PS4 users then you are in for
 a rude awakening.</p>

<h2>            How To Create Different Mailing Labels on one page in Word 2010 without mail merge</h2>
                    I do not want to use mail merge. I just want to type each address onto a mailing label and have different labels on one page. I do not want the same address on each label on the entire page. How do I type a different address into each label on the page
 without using any mail merge?

            <p>Hi Anita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow us to ask a few more details, so we can properly isolate the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this your first attempt to download these games?</li><li>Prior to this download issue, have you done any updates on your computer?</li><li>Is the issue happening only to these particular games?</li></ul>
<p>If you have recently done an update on your computer, we suggest running the Windows Update Troubleshooter for initial troubleshooting. You can get it from this link:

<p>
</p><p><span>It is not my first attempt in downloading the game.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The game was downloaded in August and worked fine since then until about a week ago.</span></p>
<p><span>Updates on the puzzle prior to this problem:<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don't think so. </span></p>
<p><span><span>The problem is only for this puzzle game.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi Jaxon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be also caused by a damaged hard disk. When a file resides on a damaged area of the hard disk, Windows cannot access the file. When this occurs, the program crashes. For us to better assist you, we'd like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue begin? Have you made any relevant changes on your device prior to the issue?</li><li>Is the issue confined to a specific file type or to all? What type of files are you having issues with?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we'd recommend that you run the Chkdsk.exe program to try to recover files from any damaged areas of the disk.

            Hi unhappyGwen 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Wordpad which is free also creates RTF file. It may not offer very rich formatting options like Word but for day to day uses, Wordpad will be sufficient for RTF needs. No need to buy Word just for RTF sake unless you have other reasons.
<br />
<br />Type wordpad in cortana search and this will pop up.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Gwen
<br />
<br />Windows 10 contains a free word processor called Wordpad
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type wordpad
<br />
<br />In the resulting list, right click Wordpad and choose 'Pin to Start'
<br />
<br />That will put a Tile on your Start Menu for easy access to Wordpad
<br />
<br />Using that, you can create rtf files, Word documents (docx) . . .etc.

            Thanks (to all of you) for your help.&nbsp; Worked fine - I saved to the Desktop and the icon was the WORD icon.&nbsp; When I clicked on it, it went to the WORD "purchase" screen.&nbsp; I finally figured out that I have to go to WordPad and then use the FILE upper left

<p>No, you don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows comes with WordPad; it's a glorified text editor rather than a real word processor, but it can create rtf files. If your word processing needs are modest, it will probably work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your word processing needs are greater, almost every word processor can create rtf files, including the two very popular free programs Open Office and Libre Office (largely compatible with Word), and my personal favorite (not free) WordPerfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend starting with WordPad and seeing if it meets your needs before considering any alternatives</p>

<p>I find this very annoying and want this removed from my computer now. If Microsoft does not remove it there will be a lawsuit for invading my privacy for an unwanted and unsolicited program. I don't care who Microsoft is and how much money they have. I will
 be looking into the laws and finding out what I can do about this ad. They better come up with a way to uninstall what they have placed on my computer.

            u can not use those driver for the 64 bit version of windows. I tried in all ways but it is not working. the manufacturer has no website or support service, so it is difficult find the correct version of the drivers.
<div><br />
<div>you don't need to uninstall the drivers. it won't affect the system in anyways. although if you want to uninstall it , just use the installer file u previously used to install the drivers. in that you have removal option ( in some other language &nbsp;may be
 chinese ) this will uninstall that.....</div>
<div><br />
<div>mean time if you find any drivers for 64 bit windows plz share here</div>

            Upgrading from Windows XP?<br />
<br />
Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.<br />
<br />
Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).<br />
<br />
More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.<br />
<br />
3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.<br />
<br />
If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>actually it depends on your budget. You have all ratings and reviews about antivirus on this site about the top 10 antivirus found on the market</p>
<p><a href="http://anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com/v2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com/v2/</a></p>
<p>and here is the list of top ten anti malware actually available on the market</p>
<p><a href="http://anti-malware-software-review.toptenreviews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://anti-malware-software-review.toptenreviews.com/</a></p>
<p>Be sure to check for hardware minimum requirements before doing any purchases. For example bitdefender is actually on of the best antivirus available on the market but it is rather heavy particularly during startup times. I personally use Norton Internet
 Security 2010 and is very light and good at tracking viruses, tracking cookies and others. I'm not trying to influence your choice, just talking about my personal experience about this antivirus.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

<div>&gt; Which Anti-Virus software is the best for Windows 7?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It's a matter of opinion and you'll get different opinions from</div>
<div>different people, just as you would if you asked which was better, a</div>
<div>Ford or a Chevrolet. Here's *my* opinion:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For an anti-virus program, I recommend eSet NOD32, if you are willing</div>
<div>to pay for it. If you want a free anti-virus, I recommend one (do not</div>
<div>run more than one) of the following three:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Avira AntiVir</div>
<div>Avast</div>
<div>Microsoft Security Essentials</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt; What Anti-malware software is best also for windows 7? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Despite what many people think, "malware" doesn't mean spyware in</div>
<div>particular. The word "malware" is short for "malicious software." It</div>
<div>refers to all types of malicious software, including viruses, worms,</div>
<div>trojan horses, rootkits, spyware, adware, etc. So anti-virus software</div>
<div>is one type of anti-malware software.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But if you are asking about anti-spyware software, you'll find fewer</div>
<div>opinions there than you will with anti-virus software. The best, in</div>
<div>the view of most of us, is MalwareBytes AntiMalware.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And all the recommendations above do not pertain just to Windows 7,</div>
<div>but to all relatively-recent versions of Windows.</div>

<p>Hi davidsclulow,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, the firmware is not anti-virus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Firmware is a kind of software that is made specifically for specific hardware for providing a low-level of hardware control. Sometimes it can be a complete operating system for a small stand-alone device. However, if the hardware is a part of other connected
 hardware, the firmware likely to provide a controlling interface to the main operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it will help.</p>

                    My flash drive has been working fine. All of a sudden it wouldn't let me save my document that I was working on. Then it switched the device to some type of storage SM32 something device. The computer automatically did an update and started to install
 my flash drive as some type of driver. Then I went in to follow the help prompts to got thorough the device manager and I have seen nothing to change. Can my documents be recovered ?&nbsp;

            <p>Issue hasn't been resolved.</p>
<p>Method 1 couldn't find any issue with my usb. </p>
<p>Method 2 wouldn't let me install the driver. Something about the link is old..I need to find a new link.</p>
<p>Method 3 only installed the usb as what the installation update change the drive to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really need the documents off my PNY usb flash drive device. I hope that this issue can be resolved.&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for trying to resolve this issue. I have read other post that have not gotten solutions yet. I hope that I am able to. Yes the day that the flash drive stopped opening was the day I put in this request. I was actually in the middle of updating
 a resume for a position that I was applying to. All of a sudden the usb started to act like it was inserted correctly. continuing to ask the type of device. I usually just click the red x and close it out and open and save document as needed. But Then it started
 to install as something else. I have tried to stop it but there was no option. I then tried to complete the solutions that were given to other users with the same issues. none of the solutions made a difference. So then I received the email with Microsoft's
 solutions to do the given update for the usb and it says that it's out of date I need to finds another update.. Can I plz have some remote help. I have been working on a book and a business plan on this flash drive. This is the second

</p><p>Yes you may try to format the USB drive once you&nbsp;have taken the backup&nbsp;of the files in it&nbsp;and see if that helps because, sometimes these issues could be due to virus as well. You may run Anti-Virus scan and see if that fixes the issue.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your support. I went in and tried the solutions that you provided. I wasn't able to complete the Microsoft Security Scanner and when trying to change the drive letter at first I couldn't see the usb in the computer tab. So I re-entered it while
 the task box was open during the letter change and the usb is reading 0MB. Which looks as if I have lost all of the files on the flash. It looks as if I will be starting from the drawing board until I find a place to send my device.&nbsp;</p>

 my book) of constant troubleshooting, recovery tools, testing (all this even on a Mac), etc. I FINALLY found a solution.</p>

<p>This is the second PNY USB device I've had trouble with, fortunately I was able to MOVE my files from the USB before it became completely unuseable/unfixable/reformatable towards accepting new data. Best solution is: &nbsp;not to buy the brand again, as I've
 not had problems with another more expensive brand. &nbsp;To be fair, I intend to check back here to see if perhaps it's a Windows 10 'bugaboo'. &nbsp;Sigh . &nbsp;</p>

<p>The APPID {316CDED5-E4AE-4B15-9113-7055D84DCC97}&nbsp;is for a COM application called "Immersive Shell". I cannot use the Component Services administrative tool to edit the security permissions because every setting is "grayed-out".

<p>I tried running in Safe Mode and was still unable to modify any of the Immersive Shell settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PC has no software installed except for the latest Intel drivers. I performed a clean installation of Windows 8, installed chipset, VGA, Intel Rapid Storage Tech, LAN, and Intel Management Engine drivers. Then I updated to 8.1 through the Store app.
 The errors began immediately after that update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PC has an ASUS Z87 motherboard, 16 Gb of DDR3-1866 ram, Intel i7-4770k cpu. It is not overclocked but memory is in XMP mode at frequency 1866. The system drive is an SSD.</p>

            When going onto account.microsoft.com you would sign into your account and across the top there is a menu choice for payment and billing you would go there and click on address book and would then want to change the address under billing info.

<p>Hello Aesthention,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with your payment option. Have you tried removing the credit/debit card then adding it back on? If you are trying to buy original Xbox game or a backward compatible game you can also try it on the website. Remember the only time you can
 use currency for these games is on the Xbox 360. There have been service alerts as of late also, that may have been affecting this. Currently there is a service alert for social and gaming for party chat. Yesterday was one for purchase and content usage. You
 can view it at&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            Using the latest versions of the Skype client, I have come across no issues preventing the sending or execution of a visit to your website. I Make sure no network/firewall/antivirus software is installed that is blocking access to the website or preventing
 Skype from functioning properly on your computer. If you have any crashes logged that may pinpoint any remaining cause.

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Let's start from the beginning. When did this issue first arise?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are able to, try running a system restore back to a date when the drive was working fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore</a>
<div><br />
<div>If that's not possible or does not work, then you'll want to make sure you have the correct drivers installed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Visit the Dell Support site linked below and click Drivers and Downloads</div>
<div>Search for you specific make and model of PC and update your chipset drivers as well as any drivers that might be available for the drive itself.&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://support.dell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/</a> </div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps!&nbsp;</div>

1. It means instead of logging into a regular user&nbsp;account, something occurs during user&nbsp;account login and Windows assigns a temporary user account. It affects all user accounts on the computer.&nbsp;You can not do anything with files/programs that requires saving
 information. Windows warns you that since it a temporary user account, nothing you do will be saved.</p>
<p>2. You get a task bar pop-up notifying you once you enter the desktop.</p>
<p>3. With limitations. Most often you get warning that you are on a temporary user account and changes will not be saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my specific case I have tried Restore, Refresh, and re-installation. They all fail. Windows installation pops up a notice that it failed. Restore/Refresh pop up a notice that no changes have been made.</p>
<p>I have booted from the install disk and selective start up. Nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since others are having same/similar issues, it must be a Windows programming glitch that Windows itself can't fix or even give you a proper error code/reason for error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You now have all the information that a PC user can provide you. And&nbsp;no, a screen shot is not working (at least not in my case).</p>
<p>I know that this is the Community Forum, but if there is a way to send this to MS Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;Programmers, then please do.</p>

That did not work for me.</p>
<p>I had to create a new account. I had to go through Live SignIn (or whatever it is called) and remove the old account from there before I could use the same email address. I forget what I actually did, but it was not a straight forward thing. It took some
 work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, everything I could find about this issue did not work. Whatever the glitch is, MS apparently could not fix it.</p>
<p>All the data for my old&nbsp;account was on my laptop, but for whatever reason, when logging on, Windows would not access the data and login normally. It probably some security setting that MS has hidden away to prevent someone from hacking your account that
 becomes corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS needs to dump the tablet touch screen format for the PC until the majority of PCs have touch screen monitors as a standard. I can build an entire PC for half the cost of a touch screen monitor. Plus I did not see any that supported 3D. Bring back the
 Start Button as the main way to access programs with the new start screen as an optional feature.

<p><br />
Not that I have found.</p>
<p>I finally had to create a new user, go into Microsoft Live Sign In, change the user there, then add the new user and delete the old user.</p>
<p>I was not able to save anything from the old user.</p>
<p>Apparently, once again MS has implemented something that they don't know why it breaks and can't fix it.</p>
<p>People on the part of MS ask for&nbsp;a lot of information, put can't seem to understand all the available information has been provided.</p>
<p>The entire problem, and who, what, where of it is that without any warning, or explanation, one day you log into Windows 8 and it tells you there was a problem and you are being logged into a temporary account. It is a FEATURE of W8&nbsp;with no information available
 on why it could happen and what to do if it happens. As it is a FEATURE of W8, I don't understand why we are being asked for screen shots. or what we are seeing: it is&nbsp;programmed into&nbsp;W8 and they should already know what we are seeing. MS should know more
 about it then we do.&nbsp;The only link provided takes you to a web page that is completely unrelated to the problem (and I have use the user input box on that page to let whoever is supposed to monitor it know it was utterly useless information for the problem
 W8 sent you there to fix).</p>
<p>MS has been doing better generally with the Windows platform IMO, but it is issues like this that brings MS back down.</p>
<p>Maybe MS would benefit from opening regional (within 50 miles)&nbsp;MS tech support shops where users can bring in their Computers when a problem like his occurs so MS can figure out what is going on and fix it the first time. Going back and forth and a forum,
 being asked questions we can not possible answer, just makes users more frustrated. The shop will need an actual MS programmer available and not just a regular tech support person who has no clue what to do about the problem and must send it out to someone
 else.</p>

I have the same issue.  When Window 8 has installed updates, everything I have saved has been deleted.  I get that same pop up box.  Temporary Account sign in.  Log out and sign in as another user or all of your files will be deleted.  What the ****?   So, to keep this from happening, I need to NEVER allow Windows to update, or I will lose everything I have saved.  This is garbag. I bought my lap top 4 months ago, and would pay money to have it turned into a Windows 7 OS.   I actually tried to order MS Office when my trial subscription ran out.   I entered my credit card number and everything, and MS would not let me register it.  What a messed up OS.   I wish I would have purchased an Apple.    Does MS even know that this problem exists?  What is the fix?

            <p>Use a system restore point, your account will start working, takes less than 5 minutes (most of the time) and then you can attempt the update again, hopefully without issue.</p>

            <p>This does not&nbsp;fix the problem. Even after using Restore, Windows 8&nbsp;still puts&nbsp;you into a temporary account. For users, it is not a problem we can recover from.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;seems to occur after a certain type of update, and is related to Microsoft&nbsp;Live Sign In.</p>
<p>Still no word from MS what the problem is, or if it has been corrected.</p>

<p>For the correct way, you should have contacted WebRoot and waited to be doubly sure.&nbsp;</p>

With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry

<h2>            signed with my MS account , went back to my previous account and some apps got corrupted</h2>
                    <p>I accepted windows 10 suggestion to login with my Microsoft account, then I could not access my user personal files, cold not save, or modify them, so I decided to go back to my previoud account to login &nbsp;then I realized, some Windows 10 core apps were corrupted,
 and could not be opened, the apps were the Mail a&amp; Calendar, Photos, One Note, Zune video, Zune music.</p>
<p>I tried to uninstall them to reinstall after that, but they did not uninstall I searched the net for solutions and found some commands to be used in Windows PowerShell. I tried to uninstall the them but it failed. tried to registered but it did nor work
 either, then I found that I need to change the ownership of my user files folder in order to gain access to them but I need to fix the core apps not working , if there is a solution please let me know if not please ask the coders for windows 10 to find one.</p>
