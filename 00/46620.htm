<h2>            Computer frequently crashing&#47;BSOD when playing FFXIV</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been having some problems playing FFXIV with my computer. After playing for 10-15 minutes, the computer will crash with a BSOD, and each time it has listed different errors, although frequently the cause has been listed as either ntoskrnl.exe or
 ntkrnlmp.exe. The methods that I have tried are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Updated Windows and all drivers. Game still crashed after updates.</p>
<p>-Memtest86+. No corrupt memory indicated.</p>
<p>-sfc /scannow in Command Prompt. No problems there.</p>
<p>-chkdsk /r C: in Command Prompt. No problems there.</p>
<p>-Checked hardware temperatures. Temperatures nominal.</p>
<p>-Tried driver verifier. I found one program (ScpVBus.exe) that was listed as causing some of the crashes. I removed that but still receive crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post links to the mini dumps and my system configuration below. Thanks in advance for any posts or advice given.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Knowing there were no issues when you ran the tests and the computer seems to be functioning normally, have you checked if the your computer meets the requirements to play the game?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be the reason why it crashes, despite finding no issues. Additionally, please follow the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> to see if we can repair it by troubleshooting the software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you update your BIOS too, as you're using one that's more than 3 years old. You should be able to find the latest version from your manufacturer's website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need more help. </p>

<p>Use AHCI, load the SATA drivers and then then try to make the partition. If the error continues, see here:</p>

            <p>So I am in the process of cleaning the hard drive, and followed all the steps, its been 30-40 minutes and is still not displaying the confirmation "disk cleaned". &nbsp;please keep in mind this hard drive is factory new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>concerning the sata drivers, i don´t see a single driver listed on the toshiba website for serial ata drivers or sata drivers no this product model. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a brand new hard drive and an unworking computer and I don´t know where to go from here. &nbsp;I can´t take it to a tech because the price to repair (hourly in spain is outrageous!) would exceed the cost of buying a this crappy laptop to begin with...</p>
<p>
</p><p>any more advice to offer? &nbsp;where are these sata drivers?</p>

<p>Does the hard drive show without loading SATA drivers? Have you tried the installation without them (now the drive is clean)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like the way Toshiba is packaging them. Try getting the latest from Intel:</p>

</p>
<p>

            The hard drive has always apeared/been recognized in the install menu, when attempting to install windows, the problem occurs when I select the drive and hit install windows, it gives me the error message, "

            Are you using a USB 3.0 flash drive? There's a bug with the Windows 7 installer trigger by USB 3.0 flash drives on modern systems. Try using a USB 2.0 flash drive or installing from the original DVD media on an optical drive.

<h2>            KB951847 fails to install - Error Code&#58; 0x80070643</h2>
                    <p>I haven't seen any really helpful threads on this problem.. or they're too old, or they don't apply to the O/S I am using..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This patch Tuesday for some reason Microsoft Update says I need to install KB951847 ... again..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Windows Server 2003 STD, SP2.&nbsp; This is not R2. </p>
<p>Error code: 0x80070643 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried the manual installation and 1st got an error that VS_Setup.msi could not be opened..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I ran the MATSKBRun.exe from the Fixit Center (that I can't seem to find again) and it fixed that problem.</p>
<p>Now I run the manual installation again, choosing "repair" and it fails - an error occured during setup.. There is an error log but clicking on the link to open it does nothing.
</p>
<p>I'm afraid to choose the uninstall DotNet35 option because I fear it won't reinstall and we need it for a network application.
</p>
<p>I'm tempted to just mark the latest DotNet security updates as hidden and forget about it, and any future DotNet security updates for that matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should be able to bill Microsoft for my time dealing with this garbage code called DotNet.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only support appears to be this community yet the server operating systems aren't in the drop-down box to choose from for "Windows Version".
</p>
<p>I've seen several step-by-step processes to address this problem but they're either for a client platform or require removing DotNet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DotNet has consumed more of my time troubleshooting installation problems than any software on the planet.. 10x more .
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any REAL support for Windows Update or a reliable way to get this problem fixed?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was glad to see the menu system a bit in one of the videos though, it looks cool, although it kinda looks like it might get annoying when you're trying to do something quickly (I know, hotkeys.... I never use them).</p>

<h2>            How To Replace Corrupt Standard VGA Adaptor</h2>
                    I have asked this question before but issue hasn't been resolved as yet.<br />
I have tried Update in Control Panel but is says up to date device already installed. So, is it possible to delete this from registry? I have tried and even with administrative rights,<br />
you people at Microsoft won't allow me to do it. <br />

            I have downloaded a Standard VGA Adaptor which I want to install in place of the faulty one on my system, but so far have had luck in being able to install it.<br />
<br />
1. I have tried updating it in Device Manager, but it tells me tye driver is up to date.<br />
2. I have gone into Windows-Sys32-Drivers-vga.sys and tried deleting them so I can replace with the new ones. It won't allow me to do this and won't let me to change<br />
permissions.<br />
<br />
What is wrong with Microsoft and why are they stopping me -the owner of the PC and OS do what I like?:?<br />
Is the only way to solve this problem is to obtain a Vista replacement disc?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You have to install drivers that are written for your devices - try this :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site and get their latest.<br />
Good time to update others while there - you can download - SAVE all you need and then install one<br />
at a time rebooting after each install.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
After installing a driver and rebooting double check in Device Manager that the new driver is installed as<br />
some (especially sound) need to be run more than once as they rollback a time or so and then install the<br />
new driver.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers -&nbsp;check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            1. The corrupt driver is the original Vista driver.<br />
2. The replacement driver is same type email to me by the Vista64 forum.<br />
<br />
I have tried all methods suggested by you and the other forum but nothing works. Also, did the sfc scan and found no problems with the integrity. However, Vista64 forums<br />
suggested the installation disc would be corrupt seeing as the problem occurs even after a clean install of Vista.<br />

<p><span><span><span>Thank you for posting your question on Windows Vista Forums.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I require additional information in order to assist you better.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>How long have you been facing this issue?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Why are you trying to replace the display adapter?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Who is the manufacturer of the display adapter and what is the model number?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Windows Vista contains its own driver store which generally contains all the standard drivers for most of the common
 hardware devices. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I will recommend you to delete the driver from the device manager and then install the correct driver you have downloaded
 from the manufacturer website.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can run the installer downloaded from the manufacturer website and it should install the latest driver for the
 installed display adapter on the machine.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the installer is not available, you can follow the given steps:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click on
<strong>Start</strong> and then click on <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click on
<strong>System and Maintenance</strong> and then click on <strong>
System</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Under
<strong>Tasks</strong>, click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><span> Provide administrative credentials
 when prompted.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Expand the
<strong>Display Adapter</strong> category on the right hand side.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Right click on the selected device and click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click on the
<strong>Driver tab </strong>and then click on <strong>Update Driver</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click on “<strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong>”.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>8.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click on
<strong>Browse </strong>and locate the required driver.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>9.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click on
<strong>Next</strong> and follow the subsequent instructions given by the installer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            The manufacturer is Microsoft of course, who else? All I want to do is to replace the current corrupt adaptor with one which isn't corrupt. Vista 64 Forum sent me a copy of an undamaged driver but the system won't recognise it and if I uninstall the corrupt
 one, the system want to install it again. There is no provision to delete the old software.<br />
I have gone through all the steps shown above without success.<br />
I am geeing very frustrated with your company!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
MS did not make your computer. Please tell us complete make and model info and also version of Vista<br />
and is it 64 bit? Then we can point you to the correct driver.<br />
<br />
Is your video adapter on board or do you have a separate card? (If you know, if not the above info<br />
will help us determine that).<br />
<br />
When you look in Device Manager - Display Adapter what do you see? Make - Model - double click<br />
Driver's Tab - version and date.<br />
<br />
Please let us know.<br />

            Hi There,<br />
<br />
Driver version: 6.0.6001.18000 21/6/06&nbsp; (VGA Standard Adaptor)<br />
Vista Home Premium 32 Bit.<br />
Graphics card: Radeon 3650 (Driver not installed)<br />
CPU: Athlon 64 3200+<br />
<br />
The driver has an exclamation mark against it. (Code 10 PCI Bus 1, Device 0, Function 0.)<br />
When I install the Radeon driver, everything works for a short time then freezes, so I presume it is due to the VGA problem?<br />
I do not have this problem with Windows 7.<br />
The computer is custom built.<br />
<br />
Please explain why Microsoft will not allow me to delete the VGA driver in the registry even though I have admin rights. It's my computer and my OS and if I wish to crash the<br />
system, that is my problem.<br />
        </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry I am a volunteer and can hardly explain myself.<br />
<br />
Did you run SFC and CheckDisk as above? If not please do that 1st.<br />
<br />
Make a Restore Point - <br />
<br />
How to Create a System Restore Point in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76332-system-restore-point-create.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76332-system-restore-point-create.html</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE the file and put it where you can find it.<br />
<br />
You want the top with Catalyst Control included.<br />
<a href="http://game.amd.com/us-en/drivers_catalyst.aspx?p=vista32/common-vista32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://game.amd.com/us-en/drivers_catalyst.aspx?p=vista32/common-vista32</a><br />
<br />
Then Device Manager - Dispay Adapter - Right Click on it - UNINSTALL - check the box to REMOVE DRIVER<br />
<br />
REBOOT - <br />
<br />
Go to where you put the driver - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

            I have done all that already, but I do not want to install the Catalyst driver until I have replaced the damaged Windows driver with an undamaged one otherwise I will still keep having
<br />
problems when I install the Catalyst driver.<br />

            That site also has the regular driver however&nbsp;you really need to install both to fix the issue.<br />
Please do so per my last message, its your best shot I think.<br />

<h3> imacofdeath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing data for Fallout Shelter</h2>
                    <p>So I'm sitting at a little over an hour of that "Syncing data..." screen for Fallout Shelter.</p><p><br /></p><p>Game ran fine the first couple of days I had it, loading right up with little wait time. It's been pretty fun so far, but the fact my save data is up in the air now is really killing my positive outlook on this port.</p><p><br /></p><p>I can easily get a refund on in-game purchases made on a broken game, if that's what it comes to, but the progress and time I put into the game is not something I can get back. So, what's the deal?</p><p><br /></p><p>Is anyone else having this problem? Because I've searched around and I've seen no one making a fuss about Fallout Shelter not working, well, besides those that said they could never get it to work in the first place.<br /></p>

That being:</p><p><br /></p><p>Disconnect from internet, restart console, sign out of profile, launch game, sign in.</p><p><br /></p><p>The largest problem being this game needs the internet to operate for some strange reason, even though I don't have any cloud storage activated.<br /></p>

            <p>So I got it to work finally, here’s what I had to do:
</p><p>1. Download Fallout Shelter onto my Windows Laptop<br />2. Start the game and save over the downloaded sync file<br />3. Shut down my laptop<br />4. Turn on my Xbox One<br />5. Delete my local save file for Fallout Shelter on my Xbox One<br />6. Restart my Xbox One<br />7. Launch Fallout Shelter on my Xbox One<br />8. After being prompted, select “Sync my latest data.” <br />9. Game works.</p>

    <title>Hard Drive space keeps changing without downloading or deleting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samopepsi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard Drive space keeps changing without downloading or deleting anything.</h2>
                    <p>My C: Drive (only one in my PC) keeps changing randomly without me deleting or downloading anything. It goes from 1.66 TB free, to 1.65 TB free, small changes like that. Is this a concern? Or this normal? An example just recently I had used 161 GB of space
 in the Hard Drive, then later that day without downloading a single thing, I had used 164 GB of space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it something to worry about or is there some explanation for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Sam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If any more information is needed to get to the bottom of this, please ask and I will provide it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of things to note:<br />
</p>
<p>-I am running Windows 8.1.<br />
</p>
<p>-I have AVG Free Anti-Virus 2014 and MalwareBytes installed on my PC.</p>

            <p>Consider this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every web page you open, the entire contents of it are not just shown to you on your screen.&nbsp; The entire website contents are downloaded and saved to your hard drive.&nbsp; All those pictures, videos, files, clips, text.&nbsp; everything.&nbsp; These are saved so that
 if you ever go back to the same site, the pictures and content will load up again from the cache (temporary files) immediately instead of having to be re-sent down the wire from the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just one example.&nbsp; Caching also occurs when you open a folder and the icons have thumbnails, or you open your media library and the album art graphics show.&nbsp; Or hundreds upon hundreds of other cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows cleans up these files periodically on set schedules, or when the cache reaches a certain age (expires) or the server it came from invalidates the data and chooses to send new data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes it's very normal, and in most cases you can just ignore it and use your PC normally.</p>

    <title>Video Thumbnails wont update in preview pane - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakobkraft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Thumbnails wont update in preview pane</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">My video thumbnails in the explorer preview pane wont update. It shows me the preview of the first video thumbnail but when i select another, the preview remains the same in the preview pane.<br />
I was using windows 8.1 -- which didn't have this problem -- when I upgraded to Windows 10. I like everything about Windows 10 so far EXCEPT this.<br />
<br />
See a video here showing the issue: <a href="https://vimeo.com/138204107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://vimeo.com/138204107</span></a></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Someone in another forum recommended installing VLC media player and associating all video files with it. This worked for some users who were experiencing this issue, but it didn't work for me unfortunately. And rebuilding the thumbnail
 cache didn't help either.<br />
<br />
I went into a Best Buy and downloaded a few sample mpgs on a brand new Surface 3 running Windows 10 and the same issue -- preview pane video thumbnails do not update from video to video. I'm really surprised there hasn't been more said about this, and the only
 fix--for some people at least--has been to install vlc and set it as the default video player, which is a pretty shoddy workaround, imo.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing this, and if so, any suggestions? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://vimeo.com/138204107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p><span>Finally, I have found the solution to this problem!
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the love of the universe, I have spent HOURS (days!) trying to correct this preview thumbnail issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s happened to me before (when I was using Windows 8) and I found the solution with a registry tweak that took just a few minutes to resolve. I am now using Windows 10 and this previous solution does not work properly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For me, this problem came up once I upgraded to Windows 10. Yes, I kept Windows Media Player as my default media player (instead of Microsoft’s new ‘Movies &amp; TV’ application) and somewhere, somehow,
 this new app is the root of the problem – or some of it (who knows). I’ve deduced, from the previous registry fix that solved this instantly, that the “somehow, somewhere” must relate directly to the registry: perceived types, MIME formats, image handlers,
 persistent handlers, ShellEx settings, etc. I am familiar with working with the registry and perhaps spent way too long trying to devise a solution. I had to think of something else. Icaros, a third-party program to “easily” establish video thumbnails, couldn’t
 correct this properly. Neither could K-Lite’s Codec tweak tool.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Well the solution TODAY is to NOT worry about – not even TOUCH – anything to do with the registry. Not even folder view options – anything! The solution RIGHT HERE, TODAY involves installing a new
 media player directly. And it works – it solves this problem successfully!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the choice program? The trusted, open-sourced, used-by-thousands (millions?) VLC Media Player. A simple download and installation (and not bloated with any garbage or trickery), installing VLC
 has solved the problem of video thumbnail preview images in the preview pane. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You've stated you tried VLC - I'm curious to know what didn't work. Please let me know and I will help you troubleshoot.&nbsp;</span><span>If you're using Windows 8, perhaps the
 registry fix that helped me before may work for you, too.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I don’t know your current default media player but I’m guessing it’s Windows Media Player. Whatever it is, what I’m saying IN MY CASE I have no problem going with another video player.
 I still use WMP for MP3 files, for what it’s worth. I don’t need to “preview” an MP3 file in the preview pane.
</span><span><span>J</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once installed, you then need to choose VLC as the default player (via right-clicking the video file, clicking on ‘Properties’, then viewing the option “Opens with…” then clicking on ‘Change’). When
 clicking on ‘Change…”, you may need to scroll down…maybe scroll down some more…and then navigating to the VLC program in the Programs (x86)/VideoLan/VLC folder to select the program (simply listed as ‘vlc’).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, finally, when you open your folder(s) with video files, you will gladly see the preview images all work!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please note: VLC will indeed change the respective video file ICONS to the VLC icon (the orange and white cone). But don’t be alarmed: there are programs available to change the icons back to your
 respective video file formats (if this matters to you). VLC offers their own icons, too, if needed. I have created and long-used my own (that’s just me) and I was happy I could add them back with no problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do post back here if I have missed anything or you have any questions. Believe me, in all my “try this, try that”, I have finally found a working solution to get the video thumbnail preview images
 back in order. I hope my solution is satisfactory and moving to VLC works for you, too!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One last note: I tried downloaded and installed ‘Media Player Classic – HC’ (which solved the preview image problem) but I struggled to replace my icons properly! Craziness! So…next choice was VLC
 and it’s a spot-on, A-OK solution!</span></p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew it was something very simple, now if the player controls would show at the bottom of the preview all would be perfect. (like in win 8.1)</p>

</p><p>As I said, installing VLC did NOT fix this problem. I know how to assign video files to a program and effectively did so, but the preview thumbnail in the preview pane still does not update. I also tried installing Media Player Classic and setting that as
 the default video player but that also did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the registry fix that worked for you in Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also what build of Windows 10 are you using? Another user for whom the vlc fix worked was using an Insider preview edition of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>I went again to Best Buy&nbsp;yesterday and did some tests and ALL the machines there experience the same bug -- ALL of them -- &nbsp;and they are all running Windows 10 Home Edition build 10240.</p>

</p><p>As I said below, consider that new machines being sold at Best Buy ALL have this issue, account corruption can NOT be the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else is causing this--as DavidCostanza pointed out, it's very likely having to do with Microsoft’s new ‘Movies &amp; TV’ application -- another poorly thought-out app causing more trouble than it's worth.

            <p><span>Jakob, I completely understand your frustration with this thumbnail issue. But I have good news: you are very close to having this solved – and it should only take no more than thirty minutes to fix – perhaps less. Follow my instructions closely (and
 trust me, too) to solve this at last. Ready?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First of all, you are correct in saying ‘VLC did not fix this problem’. But I must add VLC
 proper rendering. While I don’t know WHICH codecs are (and are NOT) installed in Windows 10, I can deduce that they are too standard and too generic.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I recommend you stick with the VLC player AND THEN download and install new, updated codecs that will bring you success. My apology for not mentioning the action of updating these codecs in my previous post. That said, you will download and install
 what’s called “K-Lite Codec Pack”, which will solve the thumbnail rendering for good. Once installed, the final check is
</span>the oh-so-important “Codec Tweak Tool”.</p>
<p>More&nbsp;on this at the bottom of my post.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are two highlights from K-Lite’s website that, among other things, will solve this problem:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>•The pack provides extended <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">video thumbnail generation</span> functionality for Windows Explorer. All popular video file formats are supported.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>•The pack automatically configures Windows Media Player and Media Center to recognize all common audio and video file formats, so that such files show up in your media library.
<em>Normally this would require all kinds of manual registry tweaks.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>These highlights are shown on the following URL (and please forgive their choice of masthead font):</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>http://www.codecguide.com/about_kl.htm</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The K-Lite Codec Pack is configured for both 32- and 64-bit platforms (my Windows 10 is 64-bit, build 10240), so don’t worry about choosing the incorrect download. K-Lite has made it easy because there is only&nbsp;one codec pack (current version 11.4.3).
 I recommend choosing the basic variant which will suffice outright (it’s the variant I chose and has brought me success). You can choose their other variant options (standard, full, mega) if you so desire. Standard, for example, also installs Media Player
 Classic.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All K-Lite versions will also install the&nbsp;“Codec Tweak Tool”. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is the download URL (showing the K-Lite variants respectively):</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Basic version is just over 12Mb.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click on ‘Download Basic’ and choose Mirror 1 (which should point to downloads.ddigest.com). Don’t worry – it’s safe!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5c086a4-3913-4cb9-8178-1dc5c28d1770" height="303" width="485" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once K-Lite Codec Pack is installed, there’s nothing freaky that will happen (and you do not need to reboot either). K-Lite will align your registry tweaks SAFELY and CORRECTLY – and get you closer to proper thumbnail rendering.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, the Codec Tweak Tool. So, so important! The tool can tweak additional codec settings but the one you want is located near the lower-left corner (under Miscellaneous): the THUMBNAILS option. Once opened, and by default, ALL boxes should have checkmarks
 already in them for all the various video formats. Leave them ALL checked. NOTE: you may need to checkmark the two Flash Video options. If you do, don’t forget to click ‘APPLY &amp; CLOSE’.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Finally, ONE MORE CHECK: viewing the video option window showing all the video formats with checked boxes, click the OPTIONS button in the lower right. Personal preferences, yes – but I have only the FIRST TWO checked (‘Hide video reel overlay’ and
 ‘Hide filetype icon overlay’). Do NOT check any other boxes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/632fddf6-10ad-4116-8f3a-e953f881f35f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>‘APPLY &amp; CLOSE’ and EXIT out. Be sure VLC is your default media player! Now, go check your Explorer video thumbnails. You should see success! The updating of all the respective video codecs (and audio, too) via K-Lite is the transformative solution.
 I am indeed hoping that success is seen and all is A-OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As always, do post back for whatever reason. And, of course, let me know if you indeed find success!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>PS – You asked about the registry tweaks I mentioned before. While these tweaks, when applied, corrected this issue outright, the tweaks were for Windows 7/8 and are NOT compatible with Windows 10 (which is why I haven’t included or discussed them
 here). If you’re interested in checking them out FOR INFORMATION ONLY and to see what the tweaks were, here is the URL:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FIXMissingThumbnailsForVideosWMVAVIMPGInWindowsExplorer.aspx</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>PSS - The Basic K-Lite download version is 11.4.0. An update to K-Lite, which you can perform after installing, will then move your codec pack update to version 11.4.3. It's a small update. And there will be more down the road.&nbsp;K-Lite is right in step
 with the ever-evolving video format/file-type changes and applicable codecs. It's all good.</span></p>

<p>I have always been aware of the codec limitations of Windows -- and did use K-Lite for earlier versions of Windows, including Windows&nbsp;8 but have found that Shark's codecs have been superior for Windows 10, mainly because they allow you to disable Win 10
 MKV support, which is very poor and causes stutter playback with many of my mkv files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See attached screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/741b9ac0-9a86-4596-8fc4-84fc24436304" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing when speaking about video thumbnails. I have no problem getting video thumbnails -- I'm talking about video screenshot in the PREVIEW PANE. My video thumbnails in explorer are just fine -- it's the PREVIEW
 PANE that does not update when switching from one video to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See attached screenshot here to see what I'm talking about:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d1794d7-3f18-46d0-8b69-23a19dda4498" /></p>
<p>I also have a video showing this issue here: </p>
<span>
<p>https://vimeo.com/138204107</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If this is indeed what you're talking about, then I might be willing to give the whole vlc thing a try, but again, installing an additional player (one I've never been very fond of no less, it's subtitle support is dreadful and well behind other players
 like MPC for example) shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thank you for taking the time to reply and providing all that detail.</p>

            <p>Jakob, thanks for quickly replying to my post. I know you want to arrive at a solution ASAP.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, yes, indeed, I am referring to the thumbnails in the PREVIEW PANE. Please know I am&nbsp;sorry for creating a misunderstanding on my part regarding video thumbnails (Explorer View vs. Preview Pane).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give my suggestion (i.e. instructions) a try for 1) defaulting to&nbsp;VLC&nbsp;and 2) utilizing the K-Lite codecs in tandem. I have spent hours and hours trying to find the correct solution to get the
<p>
</p><p>This preview pane&nbsp;issue was the very problem from your initial thread...and was exactly my&nbsp;problem, too. Meaning, if you didn't start this thread I would have instead. So very frustrating (!) this issue, but finally arriving at the VLC/K-Lite combo has worked
 for me PRECISELY and I am confident it will work for you, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, about the VLC player and subtitles specifically: I viewed an MKV-formatted&nbsp;movie file the other night and, as just a quick check,&nbsp;the subtitles were available and&nbsp;rendered perfectly. The VLC player was spot-on (no hiccups, etcetera). And yes, there
 are VLC skins to make the player a bit more sleek (aka WMP in Windows 10) but I'm not ready to change things around just yet. Right now, I'm just happy the preview pane issue is solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes for your success, too. If you move forward with VLC/K-Lite (and the Codec Tweak Tool), let me know how it goes!</p>

            <p>Jakob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same problem with video thumbnails - I posted it on the 21st August under</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/windows-10-file-explorer-video-thumbnail-display/55b59918-b7be-4910-b1da-5d7724aca776</p>
<p>
</p><p>so we have some duplication here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to your findings, if you switch to a different folder containing other videos and select one you will see that the original thumbnail (from the previous folder you were looking at) is still displayed. Although the incorrect thumbnail is displayed
 in the preview pane, the correct (selected) video will play if you click play in the preview pane !</p>
<p>
</p><p>For completeness (and since I previously had the K codec pack on Windows 7 before I upgraded) I installed the latest K codec pack on Windows 10. Not surprisingly, it didn't touch this problem and we can now forget about that as a 'solution'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an ex computer bloke this issue just smacks of a database pointer not getting updated correctly and as such is a clear bug which can only be fixed by Microsoft. Fortunately, it is an annoyance rather than a reason to go back to Windows 7. Any idea how
 one formally reports a bug to MS ? Or is this post sufficient ?</p>
<p>

            <p>I've since chosen to use a different preview handler for video files.&nbsp; Instead of the wrong thumbnail in the preview pane, it just shows a black screen which is definitely preferable.
</p>
<p>
I do hope someone reports this bug to MS.&nbsp; As I said before,&nbsp; there are a bunch of computers in stores being sold that have this bug outright&nbsp; with nothing extra on them,&nbsp;apart from the usual bloatware.

<h2>            My Laptop is not working. LITERALLY nothing works.</h2>
                    This happened few days ago. I turned on my laptop and suddenly nothing was working. Windows key doesn't work, and the windows button in the taskbar is frozen, it says "this folder is empty" in "This PC", audio system doesn't work, network system doesn't
 work, task manager won't open. I can eve shut down my laptop in a normal way. I don't know what to do. I searched online for the solutions but all of the solutions has to do something with Command Prompt and the thing is i can't open command prompt. The only
 thing I have access to is word files and not even .pdf file works. I don't know how this happened but this really sucks.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please suggest me some solutions because I really need my laptop to work properly.

            Hi JohnKW1 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />It is difficult to say without receiving the mail and studying the sender and its path from sending server to receiving server. Also look into JimWynne's response in below thread.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/is-this-a-genuine-ms-email-address-email-at/a7dd00f5-7656-4b12-bcb4-400c3564ac71">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />I don't know what is the content of the mail. For all practical purpose, you should consider it is fake. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Creating a child&#39;s account &#40;with email&#41; with Family Safety</h2>
                    I've recently purchased two Windows 8 laptops for my twin daughters.&nbsp; I've updated to 8.1&nbsp; I'm configuring the computers in advance of Christmas.&nbsp; They are 12 years old.&nbsp; When I try to create a child's account with email, I go through the entire process
 (while logged in as administrator) and the request gets rejected on the final screen stating that a parent needs to do this and to check the web for details.&nbsp; The web tells me to do what I'm doing.&nbsp; &nbsp; I am the parent.&nbsp; I'm following the proper steps.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
 appears to be a bug.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only success I've had is in creating an account without email, but I want my kid's able to access their email accounts.&nbsp; Do I need to lie about their age?

            <p>can you let us know what the exact error message is ?&nbsp; you might want to check the parents Microsoft Account age and other details are appropriate to be treated as parent by going to profile.live.com with the parent account and see if things are ok with
 that account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can also create your childs e-mail account&nbsp; by going to signup.live.com and specify the appropriate page - this should take you through the parent consent flow and associate your child account with the parent account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>once you have the childs Microsoft account, you can add this account in the Windows 8 laptop and mark that it is a child account and you will have activity reporting enabled and sent to parent account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the error message?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Does the error occur when doing a certain activity only?

<p>Thank you for your time and attention Dennis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not made any changes to my computer that seemed to trigger this. &nbsp;A couple months ago I downloaded Quickbooks Pro 2017 but I didn't see any increase in these events until a couple weeks ago. &nbsp;My Mozilla Firefox crashed and burned last week, I couldn't
 even un-install it. &nbsp;I had to go searching for every file with Mozilla or Firefox in the name or path and delete them and then re-installed Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I can do a PrtSc (<em>print screen</em>) of the BSOD... I'll try it next time. &nbsp;The only part I remember on the page is the "Attempted switch from (<em>or is it 'to'</em>) dpc". &nbsp;That's the same thing I've been seeing all these months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent in my 3 reports, et al, a few months ago and someone began helping but then he had me download more software and generate more reports and then he disappeared and I've just been struggling along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very random, sometimes I can go days without an incident and then, like the last few days, it seems to happen a couple times or so a day.</p>

<p>Weeeelllll, that was a complete disaster.&nbsp; The article you linked was for Win 7 or 8 so I used the titled to search for those instructions for Win 10 (wish I'd never heard of Windows 10, all the troubles I've ever had with this computer began with my install
 of Win 10 'free upgrade').&nbsp; I followed the instructions (such as they are) and now my computer will not boot up at all.</p>
<p>I'm stuck in an eternal blue-screen loop of restart.&nbsp; The stop code error I have now is: Driver Verifier iomanager violation. "What failed: iorate.sys".&nbsp; A couple of times around I got this instead: Driver Verifier Detected Violation.</p>
<p>I have searched the internet and cannot find instructions that work to boot my Lenovo G570 in safe mode so I can turn off the Driver Verifier.&nbsp; I've tried F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 and F12 so far...&nbsp; Nothing is working and I can't afford a new good computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My entire business is computer based and without a computer I'm dead in the water - cannot serve my clients, cannot open any of their files (thank the computer gods that I had enough sense to keep their data out on Dropbox).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My husband's Mac is what I'm borrowing to stay in this thread but I can't run any of my PC based Quickbooks software on it.&nbsp; I'm so stuck I could just scream if I wasn't crying so hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Thank you very much Dennis. &nbsp;I had to go buy a new (<em>refurbished</em>) computer but I do want to try and fix the other one so I will work on this when I have a few days to devote and get back to the thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, maybe you can direct me to whom I should report this, I tried to reply but (<em>for the first time</em>) this forum made me go through a sign in screen - even though my account was already showing in the upper right corner of my screen. &nbsp;It
 made me go through a profile set up and wouldn't let me use my name, saying it was already taken even though I've already got activity beyond this thread under my name. &nbsp;:-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

    <title>Issues with XB1 controller disconnecting&#63; Thats not a flaw, thats - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with XB1 controller disconnecting&#63; Thats not a flaw, thats a feature&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So... Like a lot of people i've read about on here I have been having issues with my controllers randomly disconnecting... at least i thought it was randomly. &nbsp;Turns out, its designed for this really.</p>
<p>The controllers connect via infrared... This is, as they say in latin, "dumb".</p>
<p>So the way i prefer to play, i sit on a couch and i will at times cross my legs by putting my ankle on top of my knee, and my controller sits in my lap. &nbsp;I finally noticed that this would cause the controller to immediately disconnect. &nbsp;This means that the
 controller REQUIRES line of sight on the console in order to function, it also explains why microwaves would interfere, and some 2.4GHz equipment might cause issues (although this shouldn't really be the case normally, but it is possible). &nbsp;Your TV remote
 control uses infra red, put your hand in front of it and see how many buttons work... although yes, i know something like a video game controller should probably be able to blast signal through a lead wall considering that if your controller can't connect
 you're essentially watching the worlds most boring movie.</p>
<p>Speaking with a couple support people, eventually i get the answer that there can be nothing in between the console and the controller for it to function properly. &nbsp;It also means its max range is about 20 feet. &nbsp;Even a glass cabinet case can potentially
 scatter the infra red signals from the controller. &nbsp;Using a usb connection obviously bypasses all this wireless nonsense all these youngsters seem to think is so "hip".</p>
<p>So remember, when you have to sit a couple feet away from your console and keep your controller pointed at your Xbox One, thats not an issue... thats a feature!</p>
<p>Obviously this isn't a blanket statement to resolve everyone's issue, but hopefully this info helps at least some of you get some closure.</p>

<p>The controller uses Wifi direct for information transfer(button presses, audio), the infrared is used to talk to the kinect to determine who has the controller and if its being used.

<p>Think there's something wrong with yours man. I have noticed that the red lights on the front of it flash if I'm not pointing it at the TV/Kinect, but I can leave the room with mine and it still works. (Ignoring the defective LB button, that is).</p>

<p>I think you might have been given incorrect information. The LEDs exist so that Kinect can tell who is holding a controller and where they are sitting. So if you're signed in and you put the controller down and leave the room, then I pick it up and start
 playing, it knows that it's now me that's gaming and not you. Also, if we are playing split-screen and we switch seats, it would know that we've switched and it can swap the sides of the TV screen automatically too (no currently released games do this, but
 that's one of the supported functions). The LEDs can also be used for rudimentary motion controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The controller will disconnect if it's been unused for 5 minutes in order to save power. It may also disconnect if the batteries are almost dead. Because the controller connects via Wi-Fi Direct, there may be other things in the room that are interfering
 with the Wi-Fi signal which causes it to drop.</p>

<p>Why are you bringing up kinect? &nbsp;The issue occurs whether kinect is on or off. &nbsp;Which i specifically asked a support rep about. &nbsp;The exact words were that the controller uses infrared to connect to the console. &nbsp;If there is anything in between them, the
 controller will disconnect. &nbsp;The rep even confirmed it with other support reps... If there is incorrect information it is systemic in microsoft's entire support department.</p>
<p>And there is nothing in the room that is interfering. &nbsp;Its in my basement. &nbsp;If there is interferance, the xbox one is the only devices effected by it, and i think its a bit unreasonable to be expected to shut down my entire wireless network so the xbox one
 controllers can work properly.</p>

<p>The reason I brought up Kinect is so that I could explain why the controller has infra-red functionality. I'm only trying to help - I'm not here to call you a liar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually misspoke when I posted above (I'm tired, so please forgive me :D). The controller does not connect via Wi-Fi Direct. The console does support that, but it is used for things like SmartGlass. The controller connects to the console via a proprietary
 wireless technology that is optimised for gameplay and communications. It is quite possible for the Xbox One controller to suffer from interference issues even if no other devices in your basement do. To troubleshoot this, I would start by turning everything
 off other than the Xbox One and the TV. Make sure that there are no electronic devices in there that could be causing it. If it's still happening, then there are other potential causes of interference, such as metal doors on a TV cabinet, or even metal shelves.</p>

<p>There is no metal in my basement other than some screws and furniture springs. &nbsp;As I said, I don't really think its reasonable to shut down my entire wireless network to get a couple of wireless controllers working. &nbsp;I accept there may be some kind of interference
 going on, but there really needs to be some other work around then just not having any other wireless signals in the house. &nbsp;At the risk of sounding like a jerk, (I assure you i'm doing my best not to :P) my issue isn't that I need to find a way to resolve
 it, but that the issue even exists. &nbsp;Shutting down my entire wireless network is not a solution. If that did actually end up making it work then i would really be in the same position. &nbsp;I can't just leave it off.
</p>
<p>I will try to play around with my wireless channel bandwidth and my control channels, if it doesn't work then I will just need to look at sending it all back, which is a shame cause I was really getting into Ryse. :P</p>

<p>Shutting everything else off would just be a temporary move to test if that is indeed the cause of &nbsp;your problems. You might shut everything off and find that the issue still persists, but at least then you know that it's not any of your other electronics
 that are causing the problem. If you shut everything else off and your Xbox One problems disappear, you can turn things back on one at a time and track down which device is responsible. EDIT - I don't know why this post has "suggested answer" on it. I didn't
 do that, lol.</p>
