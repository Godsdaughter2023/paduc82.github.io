<h2>            How to Change Zoom Increments using shortcut Word Mac</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>Hi. I searched the forums but could not find an answer to this question.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm wondering if there is a way to change the zoom increments using the zoom in+out shortcut in Word for Mac.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I zoom using the standard Command and "+" or "-" shortcut, to zoom in and out,</div>
<div>word zooms in by a huge increment, for example ; when I use the zoom shortcut starting at 200%, the zoom jumps straight to 500% , which seems to me to be a huge increment / leap.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>[Actually, it seems to zoom by 50% increment from 150% to 200%, but as I said, it goes from 200% straight to 500%.&nbsp;</div>
<div>... 200% is too small on my screen, and 500% is much too large].</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to make it zoom in and out by just 50% increments using the shortcut?</div>
<div>Or smaller or larger increments?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for help.</div>
                </div>

            If you want it to just fill the screen left and right:<br />
Open the zoom box on standard toolbar and choose:<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool &#40;KB890830&#41; x64</h2>
                    <p>My computer was delivered after the latest removal tool was updated. Therefore I downloaded the 64 bit version of the tool and ran a full system scan. No infections were found. Why isn't the removal tool shown in my programs, windows updates, or hidden updates?&nbsp;I
 tried rebooting to see if it would show, but it didn't.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate, 64 bit. There was some confusing wording on the Microsoft download site as to whether or not the program would work with my system, even though it listed Windows 7 in the Overview. After the Overview paragraph it stated,
 "Note that x64 version of this tool will only run on Vista x64, Windows XP x64 and Windows 2003 x64 computers.".</p>
<p>(I just realized that my system is&nbsp;running Windows Defender. Should I even need the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool, or will I get it on the next Windows update?)</p>

<p>Hi Chas,</p>
<p><span>Do you actually have a full antivirus product installed?&nbsp; The Malicious Software Removal Tool and Windows Defender do not count as full-time
 virus scanners.&nbsp;I believe the Malicious SW Removal Tool is simply an executable you can search for on your hard drive. Please check though your programs list for a virus scanner.&nbsp; Some of the more popular ones available are McAfee, Symantec, Norton, and Trend
 Micro (there are many more).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If you don't have a full virus scanner installed, you might want to check out Microsoft Security Essentials or avast!&nbsp; Both products are
 free full-time scanners and do a good job at keeping viruses away.&nbsp; (It's a very bad idea to have two full-time virus scanners running, so make sure one isn't installed before you install another).</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>avast!</span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing one of these programs, it would be a good idea for you to run a full scan.&nbsp;</p>

            Go to safe mode, uninstall the Intel graphic driver, then the blacking will disappear, then install the update in WU.

<h2>            ActiveSync 4.5&#47;Outlook 2007&#47;AT&#38;T Tilt&#47;Win XP SP3 - Some appointments do not sync</h2>
                    
<p>ActiveSync synchronizes successfully, but ignores some of the calendar appointments I've made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I create a calendar appointment and do not assign a category or invite an attendee, the appointment synchronizes without issue between Outlook and the Phone.&nbsp; If I assign a category, it will not sync.&nbsp; And if I invite an attendee, it will
 not sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Regular/Simple Appointment - Synchronizes fine</p>
<p>Appointment with a Category - Does not Synchronize</p>
<p>Appointment with an Attendee -&nbsp;Does not Synchronize</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done a lot of looking on the web for solutions, but none have worked thus far.&nbsp; Here is what I've tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Delete partnership on Phone and PC</p>
<p>- Rename C:\windows\system32.mapi.dll and then run fixmapi.exe</p>
<p>- Uninstall and reinstall ActiveSync 4.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All with no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got the full logs from WCESLog.log and WCESMgr.log, and I'll paste a small excerpt here from WCESLog.log with the error message in bold.&nbsp; It is my belief that there is something in Outlook 2007 with these appointments that cannot be handled
 now by the "DataHandler.cpp"&nbsp; Again, I've tried reinstalling the MAPI32.dll file, but that has not resolved the issue at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; Any MS people here with any ideas?&nbsp; I've found one helpful article, which I tried, but no success - click

<p>I do not have any filters set.&nbsp; Besides, the appointments with invitees wouldn't be filtered because some of them have no category assigned to filter against anyway.&nbsp; Good thought, though!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure it's an Active Sync issue in how it processes the items from Outlook ... something in the appointments is causing an error when they are getting processed to transfer to the Phone/PDA.</p>

<p>I have attempted to disable the splash screen for each office application using RegEdit</p>
<p>
</p><p>The splash screen still appears no matter what</p>
<p>I have checked the Registry edit - Set Correctly</p>
<p>I have checked the Group Policy - Set Correctly and reporting as applying with no failures</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why won't this screen disappear? My client is finding this increasingly aggravating and it makes no sense for it to continue to appear&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So you upgraded Win 7 Home to Win 7 Pro. That should upgrade to Win 10 Pro, when Win 10 is activated it will be registered against your hardware as Win 10 Pro. If you need to reinstall the once online your Win 10 Pro will activate. I don't believe you need

            Hello, unfortunately, the fix for this is to just remember as much account as possible, and try logging in one by one and see which account includes the Skype credits. To ask Skype directly for more information, you can contact them here:

<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions! :-)

            RED(2A Fuse) +12V<br />
Permanent 12V supply Connect to battery positive (12V).<br />
<br />
BLACK GND Negative Ground<br />
Connect to a good negative ground.<br />
<br />
BLUE(1A Fuse) IGNS Ignition Sense<br />
Connect to positive voltage from ignition. If not available, connect to RED. If connected to ignition phone will automatically power up when key is turned on and will be automatically powered down (if no key is pressed) when the key is turned off.<br />
<br />
YELLOW XCRM Car Radio Mute<br />
Connects to mute wire on car radio (if available). This wire goes to 0v when in a call and if the car radio supports it, will mute it. Max. current 200mA can be used to drive a relay (or several) to shutdown the car radio or car speakers.<br />
<br />
GREEN(1A Fuse) AMC Antenna Motor Control<br />
Connects to auto-antenna motor (if available). Do not connect this wire to the normal antenna. This wire outputs +12V when the phone is on to make the motor control raise the antenna and to 0V when phone is not connected or powered down. Max. current output
 200mA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Read instruction carefully, otherwise u'll brake the product :)

            Great to see the correct wiring breakdown on the nokia hfu-5, my radio cd player did not have the cellphone mute, so I was lost to make it work with out connecting the yellow to negative, with out this I couldn't get the system to operate, with both positive
 wires I used 2 amp fuses.It would be good if diagrams and instuctions were available from nokia on pdf format,im glad to see this detailed subject matter.

            You can easily make your radio muted via relay.<br />
look at <a href="http://www.gwynfryn.co.uk/downloads/cark91.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gwynfryn.co.uk/downloads/cark91.pdf</a><br />
It's a Cark-91 installation guide, shame but i couldn't find any 128/134 kits manuals on the net.<br />
Anyway it's clearly shown how to use the relay to turn off the radio while using a phone.<br />
But please read carefully!<br />
<br />
Good luck

            People, you do not connect the yellow wire (car radio mute) from any of the Nokia HFU's to negative/ground. This is a logic output wire, not input and has no bearing on the functionality of your car kit. If you do not have a car stereo with a telephone
 mute wire or do not want to wire up a relay with its normally closed contacts actuating the accessories +12V connection to your car stereo, you do not connect the yellow wire at all! I haven't taken any HFU's apart to see if there's a protection diode in place
 but it's safer to assume there isn't and therefore, you don't risk shorting TTL +5V to ground thereby damaging your car kit.

<h2>            Cannot Receive non-supported-by-nokia files types via bluetooth.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia 5800 XM. I am not able to receive any file via bluetooth if that file is not openable by Nokia. ie., if I receive a jpg or mp3 file, it receives fine, and when I open it from Messages, it tries to open it, and then I save it from the Message
 to the Gallery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when I try to receive some other type of files which is not supported by the mobile, it receives the message, but it fails to open the bluetooth message and as a result, I am not able to save it to the Mass Memory. It says Un supported files.</p>
<p>Say for instance, I am trying to receive a docx (Microsoft Word) file, then I face this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to save the file directly to any folder in memory without trying to open the received message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had it been some protected files like .SIS or .SISX then I would agree, but It's bad if I am not able to receive general files.</p>

                    Whenever I have an attachment on an emial it sits in my outbox for long periods of time before getting sent. Sometimes they don't go through and I shut down at the end of the day without them being sent. This has never happened before....very frustrating

<h2>            ...not a valid value for this field</h2>
                    <p>Well it's a new day, and therefore a new SPO issue. Surprise!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put a library into quick edit mode, grab the little handle to copy the field value to all list items below and you get that '..is not a valid value for this field'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got news for you: actually IT IS A VALID VALUE!!! Given that the choice is right there in the lookup and some items already have it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, it's now 2019, are we still having these amateurish issues with simply trying to copy information for pete's sake????????????????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to recreate: </p>
<ol>
<li>Ummmm, select a valid value in the drop down. Ya, check.</li><li>Attempt on other browsers. Check.</li><li>Walk away before putting fist through screen. Check.</li><li>Return. Check, same thing.</li><li>Attempt to make something up. Check, no it doesn't like that either. It doesn't even like the valid values. (?????????????)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't get all these issues with SPO. Can I not just sit down and do something for 5 frick'n minutes without something failing, not working, not able to do that because it's not a Tuesday with a full moon type of gotcha. Insert cartoon sound when
 someone shakes their head very quickly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>At the end of the day:</p>

<li>I was trying to update a bulk of items.</li><li>It's taken an hour to try and update 20 files' metadata field because of this issue.</li><li>Then, I have to keep going to my site column choice field to update/add new choice item since the choice field doesn't have an "Add new" feature (why would it?).</li><li>Oh yes we can use managed metadata since that has the capability and that's what was advised by a brilliant Microsoft engineer, but that person didn't think it through.</li><li>Why? Well, that's a whole other story.</li><li>You have to create the term set but research how to create one based on the existing choice field items. Done. That was done years ago, but now that we would have that created, it's time for another Microsoft gotcha.</li><li>You can't simply add the new managed metadata field into the list, go into quick edit and copy the items from the old choice field to the new managed metadata field. No of course not, that would be wayyyyyyy to simple.</li><li>Nope, now you have to do another 
 framework can't do simple little things like this then it's obviously not worth the effort. And yes, I have a good 15 years experience with this 'Framework' from SP 2003, MOSS and up. So I know what I'm talking about.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I muse over the possibility of Microsoft bringing me in as a consultant to bring these misdeeds to the table and help create a platform people will want to use and not be constantly frustrated. That won't happen though. People don't need to know the truth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just me or does this sound extraordinarily and unnecessarily complex and ill-thought out?????&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Carl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are sorry for that. But we tested on our side according to your repro steps, it worked fine. Here are our steps: add a new choice column&gt;set its choices and other settings&gt;Save&gt;Quick Edit&gt;choose
 a choice in the drop down list&gt;grab the little handle to copy the values. Therefore, to better address this behavior, we would like to have your assistance to confirm the following information.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Could you please confirm whether it occurs with other
 columns or a new Choice column? If the latter, please share your detailed steps to create that column.</span></li><li><span>Please confirm whether it occurs with specific library or site.</span></li><li><span>Please confirm whether it persists with other users who can access this library as well.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to further investigate it, we would like to collect your tenant info. Could you please contact your IT department and shared it via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate your understanding.</p>

<p>Ohhhh wow, can't believe it.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>The item had a space after it. </strong>You mean after all the secret gizmo crap SharePoint does behind the scenes that nobody appreciates &lt;Removed Inappropriate Content&gt;, it doesn't even trim such stupid user inputs???? That's at least one GOOD
 idea that SharePoint could do behind the scenes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the engineers there have never heard of this issue either? Rather do https protocol this, fiddler that, double pirouette here and there, two hours later maybe solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, it was my fault for putting the space in, but spaces are always trimmed off the ends of most input boxes I've ever seen. That should've been the first thing you guys suggested, just like IT used to do for users complaining something isn't working:
 "is your PC plugged in?".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I hadn't remembered doing that by accident, God knows if this would've even been solved and that would've likely been the straw that broke the camel's back because I'm looking for an alternative to this..........buggy Framework. No disrespect but................................</p>

<p>Hello Zixuan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no more info you need. As stated, I had a space after the item in the field. After removing it the grab, copy function worked. My point is is that although SPO does a lot of other behind the scenes modifications, one would think a simple trim would
 be one of them. Some consistency in behaviour would be nice I guess is the bottom line.</p>

<p>Dear Carl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your explanation and apologize for my understanding. I'm glad that you have figured it out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But regarding the reason "a space in the item in the field", I tested in my end but still can't repro. Here are my steps to type the space: choose that column&gt;Column Settings&gt;Edit, 1) navigate to a choice item,press the space bar. 2)type some texts in a
 cell in a workbook, press space bar to add a space in the cell, copy it and paste as a Choice item. (I recorded a video for my steps and shared it with you in&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a>.&nbsp;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your steps are different, please share it and we will test again to check whether it is a limitation. If not, since we can't repro, we will treat it as a issue. If you are willing, we will continue to investigate it.</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Why not release a Windows 10 Developer edition&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mortsdn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why not release a Windows 10 Developer edition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We have seen numerous editions over the last few years:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starter</li><li>Home</li><li>Home Basic</li><li>Home Premium</li><li>Media Center Edition</li><li>Business</li><li>Enterprise</li><li>Professional</li><li>Ultimate<br />
</li></ol>


<p>The majority of people have no idea what edition they have nor would they notice any difference. What really would make a difference to the people who actually cares about their edition would be a Developer Edition of Windows, shipped with an SQL Server
 Instance containing the AdventureWorks DB, Azure Toolkit and other useful Powershell plugins, and of course Visual Studio Express, easily upgraded requiring only a licence key or a valid MSDN credential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Combine this with a long wanted "Install all Windows Updates" button that actually installs (and restarts) and installs and restart Windows until it us fully updated. Then we (the developers) would save hours just staring at the screen waiting to click the
 reboot button x times before continuing on installing the same tools over and over again :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a nice Easter.</p>

<p>that's important.&nbsp; Henry Ford originally&nbsp;had "one color" for that reason, it kept costs down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more flavors you have (SKUs) the more expensive inventory control and market forecast errors can become.&nbsp; There's also extra $ involved in creating and maintaining each flavor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it were ME I'd make "one flavor only" and be done with it.&nbsp; Give everyone uber-super-ultimate.&nbsp; Having one SKU makes it cheaper in the long run, actually.&nbsp; Just pick which features you want during the install, that's all.&nbsp; Put everything on the DVD, but
 only install what the user actually NEEDS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>much simpler, I say.</p>

<p>These are the features that define Pro:</p>
<p>- Remote Desktop</p>
<p>- Group Policy Editor</p>
<p>- File/Folder Encryption</p>
<p>- Network Backup</p>
<p>- Support for 512 GBs of RAM</p>
<p>- Hyper-V</p>
<p>- Domain Join</p>
<p>
</p><p>The premium business SKU Enterprise adds the following:</p>
<p>- App Locker</p>
<p>- Branch Cache</p>
<p>- Federated Search</p>
<p>
</p><p>SKUs:</p>
<p>Windows Core - Home/single users</p>
<p>Windows Pro - IT, Mobile users, Small/Mid-size Businesses, Engineers</p>
<p>Windows Enterprise - same target as Pro, but also large Enterprise, multi-national environments, global entities such as Governments, Universities.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see a grandmother needing what Pro and Enterprise offers. That would be&nbsp;feature kill for that demographic. What is a little girl with $200 HP budget laptop doing with an SKU for branch office or Domain Join.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SKUs are designed for user needs and specific environments and also cost. The OP is requesting an application stack bundled with Windows. The functionality I mentioned that makes each SKU unique is an operating system functionality, business functionality,

            im a home user and i use remote desktop and network backups on my network all the time as it makes it easier&nbsp; to keep up my network. im disabled and cant just jump up and run from one node to the next all the time to keep them up and im not as good as
 some of the script kiddies out here to make it automated. i like to control these features from wherever in the home im able to at the current time. no not all home users would be using these features but what is it going to hurt to leave some basic control
 and backup features like these in? it sure did not hurt a competitor who shall not be named but their logo does resemble a fruit.....<br />

            <p>Yeah, but the general population doesn't need these features, Remote Desktop would suggest you have multiple PCs you need to remotely access, which means you are a power user. For a niche case of yours, investing in Pro for the benefits it offers shouldn't
 be considered costly.&nbsp;Besides, you could use a third party solution such as VNC. In fact, there are third party solutions to everything I mentioned in those SKUs. You could as easily create a peer to peer network between your machines and create a network
 share and backup all your files to one particular machine. So its relative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, OS X is tied to the hardware, the price of entry is the hardware. Considering that you are beholden to Apples upgrade cycle which obsolete a release with a new version, its not considered a practical choice or it would own this market. Lets not forget
 the applications which would have buy OS X versions for. We love to play, the Linux/OS X game, but we never look at the hidden cost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take into account the features I mentioned were introduced with Windows Vista, but lets use&nbsp; Windows 7 as an example.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 was released in 2009</p>
<p>OS X Snow Leopard was released in 2009</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 is still supported until 2020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple stopped supporting Snow Leopard since 10.8.</p>

            as i stated i am disabled i.e. not a great source of fundage available here to enable multiple licensing for several copies of VNC or other software to keep backups done. i'm not beholden to the other company as there is no way i could afford their pricing
 structure i was just pointing out that on their OS there was no qualms about including these features a long time ago and not on "home" or "just for pro users" i do agree file encryption and some other features are something i dont need and maybe bobs suggestion
 was right, put it all on the dvd and let the end user select what they need or select what they need upon download just my nibbles worth.... old timers will get the nibble reference...

    <title>Remove Facebook contacts in Outlook 2010 and Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike2112  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove Facebook contacts in Outlook 2010 and Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I have an Outlook.com account (a legacy Hotmail account).&nbsp; I almost exclusively access it using Outlook 2010 - previously using Hotmail Connector, which I was forced to upgrade to MS Exchange about a week ago (as of 16 October 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently noticed that Outlook 2010 has a number of extra Contacts lists (see list below).&nbsp; The only one I care about is the contacts in Outlook 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to delete the Skype, Facebook, and LinkedIn contacts, but they keep re-establishing themselves.&nbsp;
 (I'm willing to ignore the Windows Live and Hotmail lists, but would like the "Suggested Contacts" to go as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set out below the list of Contacts that appear, as well as the five or so failed attempts to remove the extra accounts.&nbsp; Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things I have done with no success:</strong></p>
<p><em>Disconnected the Outlook Social Connector add-in as described here: http://www.groovypost.com/howto/howto/outlook-2010-disable-people-pane-social-connector/</em></p>
<p>I then closed and re-opened Outlook 2010.&nbsp; I then deleted the FB Contacts folder.&nbsp; When I closed and re-opened Outlook, the FB contacts were magically reinstated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Tried to remove Outlook Social Connector as described here: http://www.groovypost.com/howto/howto/outlook-2010-disable-people-pane-social-connector/</em></p>
<p>Received an error message: "This Add-in is installed for all users on this computer and can only be connected or disconnected by an administrator".&nbsp; I successfully removed it by running as administrator as described here: http://www.slipstick.com/problems/add-in-can-only-be-disabled-by-an-administrator/.&nbsp;
 I then deleted the FB Contacts folder.&nbsp; When I closed and re-opened Outlook, the FB contacts were magically reinstated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Tried to disconnect my social networks from my Outlook.com profile as described here:&nbsp; http</em><em>://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/opeople-ocontacts/how-can-i-remove-all-facebook-contacts-from-my/75e149a7-7669-46a8-9f53-78abdb132c4a
 and here: https://www.poremsky.com/windows/edit-or-remove-social-networks-from-hotmailoutlook-com-accounts/</em></p>
<p>It only showed me as connected to Skype and Messenger, not Facebook.&nbsp; When I clicked on "Add Accounts", Facebook wasn't even an option.</p>
<p>
<em>Tried to 'Remove connection completely' from my profile using the following instructions:</em>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>"1. Sign in with your Microsoft account at</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(155, 79, 150, 1)">http://profile.live.com</span><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>2. Click “Manage” on the left part of your profile page.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>3. Click “Edit” under the Facebook icon.<br />
4. Click “Remove this connection completely” at the bottom part of the page.<br />
5. Click “Remove” on the dialog box that will appear."</span></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it only showed me as connected to Skype and Messenger, not Facebook.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Tried to remove the settings in Outlook Mail Options (Options, People, Connect to Social Networks)</em></p>
<p>Using Firefox, I received an error message:&nbsp; "There was a problem loading your options.&nbsp; Please try again".&nbsp; I got the same result when I logged in using Edge, i.e. this appears to be browser-independent.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Downloaded and ran MFCMAPI tool as described here: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10/error-message-when-trying-to-access-email/e3fb1b13-7f55-4204-91ea-de9249313432</em></p>
<p>That link was for the 32-bit version.&nbsp; After a reply on another forum, I was able to download the 64-bit version from http://mfcmapi.codeplex.com/downloads/get/1614203.&nbsp; I was also able to complete all the MFCMAPI post.&nbsp;
</p>
However, it does not appear to have accomplished anything.&nbsp; On Outlook.com, there are no Facebook icons to be seen, the "connect to social networks" menu under Options &gt; People still returns "There was a problem loading your options.&nbsp; Please try again.", and
 when I delete the Facebook Contacts in Outlook 2010, they are immediately reinstated.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Outlook 2010's list of Contacts</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><em>Would like to remove</em></p>
<p>Suggested Contacts</p>
<p>Skype Contacts - currently empty, probably because my SKype account doesn't use Hotmail as a UID.

<p>LinkedIn Contacts - also empty</p>
<p>Facebook contacts (4,507 entries)- Despite the name, it is not my FB contacts list, but instead appears to be a copy of my Outlook 2010 contacts, except that it somehow contains another 156 entries).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to how to remove the accounts gratefully received.</p>

<h2>            illegal access to my Skype chats</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Kostya. I have been experiencing the following issues - my posts in some of my Skype chats with some of my connections are being deleted by someone else. My messages simply disappear from the chats after sometime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently, someone has been illegally accessing my Skype account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me to resolve this issue or let me know how could I contact the Skype support team, since they don't have contact emails or phones nor even online help chats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Holidays !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kostya.</p>
