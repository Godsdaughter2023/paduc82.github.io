<p>Hi Kristine,</p>
<p>I have that latest windows as Im on a monthly update plan.</p>
<p>No changes to PC but Samsung S8 is my new phone and its first time Ive tried top download the photos from new phone.</p>
<p>Error box on screen reads ' error message 0x80030001' and suggests I can got to help to confirm reason for 0x80030001 error...However, Ive tried that and no help....&nbsp;
</p>
<p>tried downloading sync - transfer&nbsp;type software from internet and no success there either..</p>
<p>I had no issues with my previous Sony Xperia..Might be something Samsung need to rectify, but not sure..</p>
<p>

<h2>            USB Adapter not being detected. Is it 7&#39;s fault&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, here's what I'm having a problem with...</p>
<p>I purchased a MayFlash N64 Duel Port Adapter, which is SUPPOSED to be "Plug and Play". It says compatible with Windows 98, ME, XP, and Vista... But my PC isn't even acknowledging that I've plugged something in! Is there something I'm missing here, or am
 I just out of luck because I bought into Windows 7??</p>
<p>(I've never had trouble using older programs/devices before... And I was really excited about using the N64 controller with the N64 games...)</p>
<p>I searched for drivers, but since it's "plug and play" I couldn't find any.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yeah it sounds like the maker has a quality control problem. Call or email them if possible and<br />
maybe they have a solution or possibly they will offer a factory tested and proven model ((I<br />
would ask for one).</p>

<h2>            SATA Drivers Missing for ULi SATA&#47;RAID Controller &#40;1573&#41; - Cannot install on partition 0</h2>
                    I just spent about two hours trying to get Win7 to install on an older computer due to lack of workable Sata drivers.&nbsp; Windows Vista didn't have any problems with the drivers but Win7 must have blacklisted them because they may be too old.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Search String: <br />
ULi SATA/RAID Controller (1573)&nbsp; Version 6.3.0.2<br />
<br />
I found the drivers on ZDNet under:<br />
ULi SATA/RAID Controller (M1575/1697) 1.0.5.9 (Windows) then it took me to: <br />
www.radarsync.com/downloaditem.aspx?Locid=136807<br />
I downloaded Floppy-AA1697.zip (Vista x64) but comes with both 32 bit and 64 bit drivers.
<br />
<br />
Vista uses the same 6.3.0.2 version but the date on the file is 4/28/2007<br />
<br />
I hope that this helps someone save hours of time. <br />

<p><span>Hi danjo70,</span></p>
<p><span>•</span><span>Did you make any changes
 to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> You may<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>navigate to the following locations to check
 for Accessories</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you can access these then they should appear on the Start Menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If they are missing you could copy new folders and shortcuts in to the appropriate location.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You can also try to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>restore the Start menu to its
 original, default settings.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Open Taskbar and Start Menu Properties by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, and then
 clicking Taskbar and Start Menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click the Start Menu tab, and then click Customize.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. In the Customize Start Menu dialog box, click Use Default Settings, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If it is a recent issue, you may also<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>try a System restore to a restore point before this issue&nbsp;</strong>and
 check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3:<span>&nbsp;</span>Try System Restore</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> When you perform System Restore to restore the computer
 to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform System restore, you may refer the following link:</span></span></p>

    <title>Lets talk strategy for BFBC2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmacstudios  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lets talk strategy for BFBC2</h2>
                    
<p>Ok I do not see much on here about actual strategy with this game. So I will start the ball.
</p>

<p>1. When you see an allied parked, occupied tank in the middle of the battlefield check before you hop in and start madly driving towards the enemy. One of the best uses of the tanks is to give cover fire on a traffic corridor. If a tank is in a corridor
 with a dude in the machine gun it is probably because they are mowing down enemies giving your team a great change to advance and cap the flag! This *** me off something fierce when my tank gets wheeling when I had a bead on a series of enemies and someone
 moves me just as I am about to massacre the group. Before you act like a hero and waste the tank in a stupid suicide run,check the situation! Not hard to read!</p>

<p>2. In case you did not know, the UAV only can use it's secondary machine gun fire if you have VALT mod active on your toon. I didn't know that till recently.
</p>

<p>3. Tired of committing suicide after jumping off a building when you get shot? Did you know if you double tap the jump button you auto deploy your chute? No magic. Just the controls.
</p>

<p>4. Engineers can use their fix tool to take apart the enemy tanks as well! Use it! And did you notice the Kill Tool achievement? Yup. You can drill someone in the head just like the medic can actually shock someone to death! TASTY!</p>

<p>5. Are you playing for fun or to win the round? I understand sometimes you want to just snipe in the shadows. You want to be the soldier covered in the most guts. The highest point rank. We all have been there. But if you want to win, work with your team.
 Support them as you move up the map. Team up when attacking. When you have 5k points and the team still loses this should be saying something to you! Yup your a star. But not a team player.</p>

<p>6.The team with the most snipers usually loses. Snipe, scout, cap! Sprinkle Mortar for flavor.&nbsp; Don't just sit on the hill and snipe. You kill one target great. Two even better. But for certain someone is b-lining to snipe you back since we all get to see
 your ingenious hiding spot when we die. Tunnel vision is the fastest way to get a knife lodged in your noggin. C4 is great but you can't push the button on the trigger if someone already rolled over you.
</p>

<p>7. Holy helicopters. Yup, I hate them because they are the weakest part of my game. I need to learn them because the team that has the best helicopter support will win hands down every time (unless that pilot doesn't follow point 5). I find the controls
 for this machine difficult and unruly. But I have seen surgeons in the air and I swear one day I will figure this out!</p>

<p>8. RPG vs mines. Ok mines are great. I love them because so many people just miss the audio cue they are in their path and then BOOM, double or triple kill. Of course when I am playing against experienced players that know team work I make diddle with mines.
 RPG's are the best tool to take out tanks and sometimes even other units and buildings. Only recently have I been practicing with them and I can see their value. The best part is you are mobile with a RPG and don't have to wait for someone to jack in the box
 your devious plan. One side note, two mines behind a tank and a grenade works awfully well.</p>

<p>9. Medics are amazing when you get good with them. And boy can you rack up points fast if you have a team that works as a team! Drop the heals&nbsp; and res your mates. Try not to die and check the area. There is probably a reason three of your team just keeled
 over. Might want to deal with that before you rush out with the blood packs! </p>

<p>10. Saving Ryans privates with grenade spam. If you are a **** class drop a resupply kit behind cover and then start hucking grenades all over the attack zone. The nice thing about team damage off is you don't have to worry about killing your own. But
 boy does it sow great chaos in the enemies plans. Note: you should behave like a scout class in this case and keep moving each time you kill someone. Bet your donuts someone is coming to knife you when they die this way!</p>
<p>This is just a start to what I have found over the course of my play. Now I want to hear your tips to newbs and experienced alike. Just because you think it is common sense does not mean others think the same way! Show us your brilliance!&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Enjoy! </p>

<p>been playing this game since it came out and still play it now...mainly conquest tho but since everyone wants to play Atacama desert all the time, thats what i tend to play the most....one thing about this map is that most chopper pilots would rather lose
 the game and never get out of the chopper than to actually do some ground work and take flags...remember, if you have all the flags and the other team has both choppers, dont put yourself in harms way, just chill somewhere why they try to find people to kill
 and their tickets will just bleed away....with that said, if you can base r4pe them, do so as much as possible....because ive learned that if they get a chance they will do the same thing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My main vehicle of choice is the tank, im close to 45k kills with the tank now, one tip with the tank is to be able to hit people on the move without stopping, also, practice using your tank in the zoomed out camera mode, that way, you have better visibility.
 I kill several choppers a game with the tank, the best way to tell if they are noob pilots or not is by watching how they fly....if they are flying high, you prolly are not gonna kill them much, but if they fly slow and low you have a really good chance of
 blasting them out of the sky.....if they are really good pilots youll die almost everytime, so when that happens to me, i just start doing everything on foot,....practice hitting choppers with tracer darts, they come in handy....ive gotten good enough now
 that i can no scope choppers with a RPG without them being tagged, most people use the AT Rocket....</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;heres a trick.....if you are in a tank and a UAV keeps hitting you and killing you and you cant make it to the ship to kill him.....if you are at the US base, take the tank to the front of the base where the tow gun in but stay on the road. aim your
 turret up about 2 inches on your screen toward the UAV area, if you find the sweet spot, you can kill the UAV pilot without even leaving the base... In a tank if you are heading to A, always take the road less traveled, meaning, dont go down the main road
 to Alpha, take the side road on the desert side....too much C4 and mines going on the main road....The best way to take Bravo in a tank is to not use the tank, either go on foot or dont mess with it at all....when you use the tank to take Bravo there is just
 too much that can happen unless you know, no one is there then its ok, but watchout for the mines in the water, they are hard to see.....taking Charlie is pretty easy, but again, dont go down the main road, come up on the desert side road and stay near the
 first set of crates that way if you get into a battle, you can back out into the desert and use some of the hills for a little cover, and if the players are showing all kinds of noobery, they might just follow you on foot and you can blast them with the big
 gun ot the 50 cal.....if you are riding solo in the tank, always make sure that your 50can gun is aligned with your big gun, that way if you quick switch seats, youll still be on target for the most part....my clan mates know that i use the tank the most and
 if they are in with me they always know to put the 50cal gun alignment back before they hop out....its not a command but it helps me be more effecient in backing them up and increases our chances of staying alive longer....remember that it is a team game........enjoy....</p>

<h2>            Problem while installing software for Vodafone 3G USB Stick</h2>
                    I have a laptop and a desktop. I tried to install the software in both of them.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There was no problem with laptop. The installation completed successfully and the USB is working fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But in the desktop, the installation progress goes about 99% and it shows a message "starting services" and then the whole installation rolls back. Even I find during the installation that the desktop icons for the dialer etc. are created but once the
 roll back starts, the icons are also removed automatically.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both my laptop and desktop have Windows XP SP3.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please advise what can be a possible solution.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks</div>

            My user account already has administrator privileges. So that should not be a problem. However, I tried it but did not work.

    <title>Capturing Game Clips to External Drive Requires NTFS Format Question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xbsjason  say:</h3>
<h2>            Capturing Game Clips to External Drive Requires NTFS Format Question</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to capture extended game clips to an external hard drive. When I connect it and change the save location in settings it gives me the option of Internal or EFI. I'm assuming EFI is the connected hard drive (it is usb 3.0).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it says I need to format it NTFS on a PC. I've done so, but reconnecting gives me the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hey XBSJason</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to post this on the Xbox Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to using an external hard drive [EHDD], I would recommend that you try to format it once more to FAT32 and then try to format it back to NTFS. When you format it, I would implore you to make sure that you uncheck the box that says "Quick Format"
 just as a precaution, and then try to plug it in into your console</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can try to format it to FAT32, and then plug it into your console and you will receive a message that states in you must format it in order to use it on your console.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Storage formatted for Xbox games won't work for captures. If you have games installed on the same device, do one of the following:&nbsp;
</p>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Plug an external storage device (USB 3.0, NTFS-formatted) into your Xbox. </li><li>Note that storage formatted for Xbox games won't work for captures. If you have games installed on the same device, do one of the following:
</li><li><strong>Plug a second storage device into your Xbox</strong>. Use this for your captures so you can keep using the other one for games and apps.
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repurpose your storage device for captures, but move your stuff first</strong>. While the device is connected—but before you format it for captures—go to your games and apps and move your games from external to internal storage. Next, unplug the
 storage from your Xbox, plug it into a PC, reformat to NTFS, safely remove it from your PC, then reconnect it to your Xbox.
</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox </strong>button <span>
</span>&nbsp;to open the guide, then select <strong>System</strong> &gt;<strong> Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Broadcast &amp; capture</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Capture location</strong>, then choose a destination for your game clips and screenshots.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update on November 9th keeps spinning</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to bed last night to what appeared to be a Windows update with just a black screen and spinning wheel. &nbsp;See image below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It has now been about 6 hours and it is still spinning. I had this problem before a week ago with another update where I had to hard boot my system, go into safe mode, log in and then reboot the system in normal mode just so I could log back in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had issues with the last two updates and if so what did you do to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi IanXY,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question <span>in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information, <span>when you open photo viewer some thumbnails have a green tick in the corner and others have a blue chevron sign.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>These entries were added by Norton 360. Norton 360 v2 adds a feature called "Backup Status Indicators" which clearly identifies which files have been backed up, which files are pending backup and which are excluded from backup. This feature is responsible
 for the Tick mark (green box) and double arrow (blue box) overlay icons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A check in a green box means the file’s backup is current, while a chevron (») character in a blue box indicates a file that’s been changed since its last backup. Files excluded from the backup set display a slash in a gray box.</p>
<p>If you don’t need the backup indicators feature you can turn it off by clicking
<strong><span>Settings</span></strong> in the Norton 360 main window, disabling the
<strong><span>Backup Status Indicators</span></strong> check box and click <strong>
<span>close</span></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may also happen if you have MozyHome Backup installed on your computer, then you need to disable icon overlays in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>MozyHome Backup program adds a green checkmark overlay icon for files which are included in your backup list. To disable the overlay, select the following checkbox in Mozy Options:</p>
<p>Disable icon overlays in Windows Explorer</p>
<p>Enabling this option hides the icons that displays next to files and folders in Windows Explorer when a file is included in your backup list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you need further assistance, please reply and we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            Sorry, there is no built in facility in Windows to edit PDFs. You would have to download a free PDF editor from the Internet to achieve that. It is possible, though.

<h2>            Issue with changing the 24 hour to 12 hour format</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 10 Time Issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded Windows 10 a couple of days ago and so far it has been great. The only thing I can't seen to work out is the time settings. See Windows 10 brings the 24 hr time format and I've been wanting to change it to the 12 hr one. I already know that
 I have to go to the Short Time and Long Time settings to be able to change it in both the lock screen and the desktop, but the bar doesn't show any other options different from the 24 hr default one. I'm in time zone Atlantic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your help!</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I had some problems with my internet. It became slower and sometimes it totally doesn't work, replying the message : "can't connect to proxy server". I tried on few browsers (IE, Mozilla, Chrome), and the same message appears all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm actually using internet at home, so I don't need any proxy server ; that's why I want to deactivate it. But here's the real problem. When I uncheck "Use proxy server for your local network", I press ok, and when I go back to these settings it didn't
 change anything. I can't delete the proxy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read lot of topics of people having the same problem, but I didn't find any answer. Can anyone help me ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation
 of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing

<h2>            Proxy settings for Skype not working</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype 12.18 installed on windows 10 and have connection issues where I am unable to send messages, receive messages or calls or do anything at all with application. We use proxy script in company and skype has picked the same up from internet explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to enable "Automatically detect settings" but that does not help either and this setting gets changed automatically in some time.</p>

Can I connect to Skype through a proxy server?</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you connect to the internet through a proxy server, Skype automatically detects your proxy settings.<br />
If for some reason Skype cannot connect to your proxy server, you can try to manually configure Skype to connect to it — but
<strong>we don't support manually configuring your proxy settings and cannot guarantee the steps below will work for you.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For this case, you can install the classic Skype, we've already restored it. To install the classic Skype:</p>

    <title>Xbox One not detected on my home network when attempting to connect - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One not detected on my home network when attempting to connect via the Xbox app in Windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>I'm attempting to use the Windows 10 Xbox app to stream games to my computer. I have a Comcast provided modem with four ethernet ports. One port is connected to my router, which my PC is connected to via ethernet cable. Another port is directly connected
 to my Xbox One.</p>
<p>When I click 'connect' in the Xbox app, it does not detect the console. However, when the console was connected to the
<em>router</em>, via wireless signal, it could detect the console. Anyone have a clue why this is, and how to fix the issue?</p>

<p>You may want to check the settings on your router for and DMZ settings that may be causing a conflict, I know a lot of provided routers and modems will block talking back and forth between devices. You may have to call your cable company to help with this
 issue and to get access to the router settings.</p>

<p>Another possible solution is to manually enter your Xbox's IP address into the windows 10 app.</p>
<p>To do this go to:</p>
<p>Xbox App -&gt; Connect -&gt; Add a Device (In the top right corner) -&gt; Then type in the IP address</p>
<p>To get your Xbox's IP on your Xbox go to:</p>
<p>Settings &nbsp;-&gt; Network -&gt; Network Settings -&gt; Advanced settings </p>

<p>sorry you are posting in the wrong section only those in the suspension forums can help you. &nbsp;but since you were perm banned for solicitation even as a joke does not matter asking people for points or $$$ is against the rules and is grounds for an immediate
 ban of LIVE. &nbsp;and when you are banned there is NO appeal your ONLY option is to create a new account and move on and this time DON'T solicit points or money from people.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer is Gateway NV57H05h Laptop Core i3-2310M</p>
<p>Running Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>All updates reported as successfully installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had been reapplying the updates individually and it appeared that the Siverlight update caused the problem, but removing it didn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rolled back, reapplied the updates plus a couple subsequent ones and ran through your Methods 1-3 with no errors, outdated drivers, or viruses&nbsp;detected.&nbsp; I ran CCleaner against the registry and cleaned up a bunch of Silverlight installer reference issues.&nbsp;
 The problem is not fully resolved but it is far less frequent (occurring once every&nbsp;few hours versus once every 5 minutes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect Silverlight is the culprit but can't be sure.&nbsp; Also, my hardware configuration has not liked the last couple of updates.&nbsp; I have an external monitor connected via a wireless dock.&nbsp; The February updates caused severe mouse-stutter on the external
 monitor which was finally resolved with a reinstall of DisplayLink.&nbsp; I'm experiencing some minor mouse stutter after the March updates but haven't yet reinstalled DisplayLink, which I hope I don't have to do every time updates are released.&nbsp; I only mention
 this as the current problem seems video related.</p>

            <p>For whatever it's worth to others that may encounter a similar problem, I've pretty much ruled out any connection to Silverlight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm still not sure what the root problem is, but it seems to occur following the monthly Microsoft update releases to varying degrees and usually self-resolves.&nbsp; However, following the September patches the problem was again severe - screen flicker occurring
 every 5 minutes or so with event id 9020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating the DisplayLink software almost fully resolves the problem so it may be that my wireless dock is getting messed up by the updates - I am using a Toshiba wireless Dynadock to connect an external monitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long story short if you have a similar problem ... don't fuss around with Silverlight, but if you're using DisplayLink software try updating your drivers.</p>

            Hi Amar,
<br />
<br />Right click a stp file and choose 'Open With' - Choose Another App
<br />
<br />Important - Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open stp . . .'
<br />
<br />If SolidWorks is not in the list, scroll to the bottom and click 'More Apps'
<br />
<br />Again if SolidWorks is not in the list, at the bottom, click 'Look for another app on this PC', then navigate to find the SolidWorks executable and choose that . ..

<p>
</p><p>I think the problem might be, that Solidworks was not downloaded from the Microsoft Store, and you CAN make this work, but by default Windows 10 seems to be set up to only use apps from the Microsoft Store (for security reasons).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start Menu, then Settings, then Apps, then on the lefthand side click on Apps &amp; Settings. You can also Cortana Search for Apps &amp; Settings as a shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are at Apps &amp; Settings, on the righthand side at the very top you will see a section called "Installing Apps" and just below that heading I hope you will see what I see, which is: "Choose where you can get apps from. Installing only apps from the
 Store helps protect your PC and keep it running smoothly." Just below that is a little dropdown box that will say: "Allow apps from the Store only."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on "Allow apps from the Store only" and choose a different option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try again to associate the .stp file extension with Solidworks. I am not certain this will help but I sure hope it does.</p>

<h3> get muted nerd  say:</h3>
<h2>            No way for me to contact enforcement team&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp; I was previously banned from communication on April 9 to April 16 on April 16 I played Xbox for about two hours about one hour and a half into playing I tried to send a message to someone and it said something like that based on my previous actions I wasn't
 allowed to do that. So I checked the enforcement page and it said I was banned again from the 16th till the 30th. That doesn't make any sense because I couldn't talk at all for an entire week. How can I get banned in a span of 2 hours when I wasn't even playing
 a game that has a multiplayer feature in it. I tried to submit a case review and while it was checking my eligibility it said I "didn't have an active enforcement action" I tried to post on the other forum specifically for getting banned and it told me to
 submit a case review. I need some way to contact you. It doesn't make sense how I was reported for innaprotiate communication during the time I was already banned from talking. How can I even talk to someone for people to even report me when I couldn't talk
 at all. Please consider taking time to review this and understand where I'm coming from. Thank you</p>

<p>Submitting a case review is the only way to contact the enforcement team. </p>
<p>Investigations take some time to happen, so most likely you were originally suspended for one enfraction and then suspended again for another one. Both enfractions could have happened months/weeks ago.</p>

            <p>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS, THE ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT IS OBVIOUSLY RUN BY COMPUTERS. THEY DO NOT TELL YOU WHY YOU ARE BANNED, WILL NOT TELL YOU WHY YOU ARE BANNED. ANYONE CAN CLICK "REPORT PLAYER" AND SAY WHAT THEY WANT. YOU ALL AT XBOX HAVE BLOCKED OFF THSI DEPARTMENT COMPLETELY. IT'S LIKE, DMV PULLING MY DRIVING LICENSE AND NOT TELLING ME WHY, NOR ALLOWING ME IN THE DOOR. I JUST CAUGHT A BAN IN THE MIDDLE OF A CURRENT BAN AS WELL. THIS IS RIDICULOUS THAT YOU ALL DO NOT EXPLAIN THE INFRACTION THAT WE "SUPPOSEVELY DID". I HAVE HAD PPL TRY TO GET ME BANNED FROM ELDER SCROLLS AND THEY OBVIOUSLY FOUND A WAY TO HURT MY ACCOUNT BY GOING TO XBOX LIVE. I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO FILE A SMALL CLAIMS AGAINST XBOX IN THIS REGARD, BC THE MORE OF THESE FALSE BANS I CATCH, PUTS MY ACCOUNT IN JEOPARDY, AND I HAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ATTACHED TO MY GAMER TAG.

            <p>this is why all real gamers go to pc and ps4. F*** Xbox live and their B'S. I can get overwatch on pc and don't even have to pay for a membership. I've had one act banned because of salty kids on Destiny... and now I have my 5th enforcement action and all I can tell is I sent a player a non abusive message about competitive play asking him to change characters. I love how saying scrub is considering harassment and abusive. I'm leaving Xbox for good. Go poke&nbsp;yourselves xbox. Completely stealing from dedicated players just to make that money. They have no problem banning an acct and then letting you make a new one as long as you pay for that membership again and rebuy all your digital games. Years ago it was nearly impossible to get banned for communication unless you had a mass report. Now anyone can report you for anything and they automatically give a mark. Thanks for screwing my run to diamond. World's run by a bunch of pu$$ys now I guess. It's that everyone gets a medal mentality that's

<h2>            XBox fair play team not enforcing.</h2>
                    
<p>I’ve been banned from commmunications for 7 days, I admit I was wrong, but the guy I slapped with words, should also be banned. The enforcement team does&nbsp;nothing to people who use mics, I reported a guy for unsportsmanlike conduct, and voice, I get banned
 he doesn’t even get a review. I’m already pissed at Xbox, but this, this just made me want to throw away my Xbox and buy a ps4, I’d get better support from them. I want my account ban reduced or some confirmation he’s getting a consequence for the **** he’s
 done.</p>
<p>For those wondering, &nbsp;it’s worl of tanks, I’m arty he’s a TVP, I missed &nbsp;cross map shot on hilly terrain and he runs all the way back to me, enemies in&nbsp;tow, rams me, gets me spotted and killed, all the while he’s running away yelling at me saying next time
 don’t miss ****. Now someone tell me&nbsp;they wouldn’t retaliate, especially on the first match of the day with a x3 Xp boost, and a 5x crew boost as well. I’m mad I &nbsp;wasted those and mad he killed me over something so stupid.</p>

            <p>As long as you filed a complaint on him, the enforcement team will investigate him. Suspensions are not always immediate so even if he hasn't been given a suspension yet, it doesn't mean he won't. It's also not possible for you to know 100% whether or not he has been given some sort of suspension.</p>
