<p>I had the same problem. Here's what you do. </p>
<p>1. Go to my games and apps.</p>
<p>2. Go to the game and hit menu.</p>
<p>3. show all add-ons.</p>
<p>4. Season pass is installed but you have to go to each of the other DLCs and install them individually.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Heya Maxben22.</p>
<p>This thread is over two years old, be sure not to bump older threads. So that we can best help you out please create a new thread. If you had another account on your Xbox One, be sure to make sure that the season pass wasn't purchased on that.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Keyboard with Fingerprint ID and Surface precision Mouse constantly drop off WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm having constant issues with both Microsoft products: Keyboard with Fingerprint ID and Surface precision mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse is constantly going into a stuttery lag and I have to turn it off and on or replug it into the usb cord. I've searched for help dozens of times, which always amounts to "change driver to ***, turn off "put to sleep" in power managment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My latest iteration was to changed the bluetooth adapter to the generic bluetooth adapter. No change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm completely confused on why windows 10 and microsoft hardware are so buggy together. As I look around the net, and this site, this seems to be a consistant problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can do before I return these hardware products?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello thickbeard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A software conflict is a possible cause of the performance issue of your Microsoft peripheral devices. To isolate which program is possibly causing the device to malfunction, I suggest performing a clean boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by
 using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you use your Windows 10 device. For the step on how to perform a clean boot, please refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">support article</a></strong>. You can also watch our

<h2>            Windows 8.1 System Image Backup Compression Seem To Good To Be True...</h2>
                    <p>Hi all I have done system image backups in win 8.1 using the powershell, the thing that concerns me is that my c: drive is 750GB and I've used 670GB, however, the VHDX file in the backup location is only about 200GB, is the compression that good??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the following powershell command: wbAdmin start backup -backupTarget:D: -include:C: -allCritical -quiet</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx Chris</p>

            <p>In my experience, the compression of a backup image is around 55% of the original used space.&nbsp; This may depend on the type of files being compressed, and if you have files that compressed more than normal, it might look the way it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The -allCritical switch normally includes all partitions necessary to restore you basic system, which are a Recovery, EFI System and OS partitions.&nbsp; On Legacy installs it would be the System Reserved, OS, and possibly Recovery if you had an extra one of
 those. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if using -include:C: and -allCritical would make any difference.&nbsp; The utility will list which partitions are being backed up, so you can check.&nbsp; I use WBadmin when I want to include my Large Recovery Image partition in the backup.</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
</span><span>The VHDX format also provides protection against file corruption related to power failures by continuously keeping track of updates in the metadata, a feature not available with the VHD
 format. Larger block sizes for dynamic and differencing disks, as well as the ability to store custom metadata, also give the new format the edge in the VHD vs. VHDX comparison.<br />
<br />
- Try to attach the VHDX using the Disk Management window and let us know if it works.<br />
- Use the search charms to open Disk Management and then click on Action and select Attach VHD.<br />
I would suggest you to manually restore the image files (in .vhdx format) using Disk Management and check if the disk size remains same it resolves the issue. Follow the steps provided below to do so:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Connect the hard drive that has the image file backed up.
</span></li><li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows+X
</span></strong>keys and select <strong><span>Disk Management.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>In <strong><span>Disk Management</span></strong>, click/tap on
<strong><span>Action </span></strong>(menu bar) and
<strong><span>Attach VHD</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click/tap on the <strong>
<span>Browse </span></strong>button.</span></li><li><span>Navigate to the drive or partition that has the system image's “<strong><span>WindowsImageBackup</span></strong>” folder, select the .vhdx file listed on
 the hard drive and click/tap on <strong><span>Open</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>You will now notice that the .vhdx file has been attached (mounted) as a separate virtual disk with it's own drive letter. If the attached .vhdx file isn’t automatically assigned a drive letter, you
 would need to assign one to it. Refer to this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/change-add-remove-drive-letter#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to do so. </span></li><li><span>You will now open the attached .vhdx file in File Explorer. You can copy and paste whatever files and folders you want back.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>In this way, you can also transfer the file to a different location as well.</span></p>
<p><span>For further reference, you can refer to these links and check if the suggestions help you to transfer the image files:</span></p>

<h3> ehgoodrich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Bing Maps metro app only printing 1st page of directions</h2>
                    <p>Subject line pretty much says it all: I have a client who wants to use the Bing Maps metro app to print maps with directions.&nbsp; His first attempt looked pretty good until we noticed that the directions (which needed 2 pages) only printed the first page (the
 2nd page were the maps).&nbsp; Also, the problem is NOT with a particular printer since the print preview screen that comes up when you select ANY printer only shows the 1st page of directions.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello EH Goodrich,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. What is the make and model of the printer and the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
2. Have you check the printer preferences to print all pages?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Place the computer on the clean boot and check if the print preview gives 2 pages.<br />

<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>To reset the computer to normal mode after troubleshooting, please refer “How to reset the computer to start as usual” from the above article.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue is not resolved in clean boot, I would suggest you to run the windows built in printer troubleshooter:<br />
<br />
1. Press “Windows + X” key on the keyboard.<br />
2. Click on "Control panel"<br />
3. In the Control Panel Window upper right corner Search box type Troubleshooting.<br />
4. Click on "Troubleshooting" in the search result.<br />
5. Click on "View All" in the left hand pane.<br />
6. Click on "Printer".<br />
7. Click on next in the Printer Troubleshooting window.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong>If the issue still persists follow the links below:<br />

            <p>Thanx for your reply;&nbsp;perhaps you missed the last sentence in my 1st paragraph where I mentioned that the problem is NOT printer specific: it happens with any printer (including the built-in&nbsp;"Microsoft XPS Document Writer") and appears on the "preview" window
 that shows up as soon as you select a printer.&nbsp; It looks like it prints as many step in the directions as will fit on 1 page (typically around 13) and then&nbsp;drops the rest of the directions and prints the maps on page 2.&nbsp; I've tested with a couple of routes,&nbsp;one
 with 25 steps and another cross-country with 48 steps (which should take about 4 pages to print) and I only got one page of directions on the preview AND printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try your suggestion of a clean boot, but it didn't make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Try using the Desktop version instead?&nbsp; What file format do you get in each case?&nbsp; Can you print the Desktop result?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh.&nbsp; Now I have tried the MUF Maps app.&nbsp; The problem is that it isn't giving you the Range setting in its print dialog and apparently its default is to print one page at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember now seeing someone else complaining about a similar problem in
 another MUF app.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case, there was no Desktop version for use as an alternative but&nbsp;IIRC I did find a workaround for them...&nbsp; I don't remember exactly but this will work:&nbsp; Share&nbsp; instead of&nbsp; Print.&nbsp; Then Print.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. I just shared to OneNote and could
 Print from there if I wanted to.&nbsp; Or not.&nbsp; No range given there either?&nbsp; I'm sure I have done it some way and now have multiple copies of the file, so am sure that I could find a workaround to actually print the whole thing (or contiguous parts) if I had to.</p>

<p>At the bottom in the middle or at the top on the right?&nbsp; The latter is what I call the Range:&nbsp; setting.&nbsp; I think it is even explicitly labeled that but you might only get it by using the More... settings option.&nbsp;&nbsp; In it you can make a list of pages and specify
 contiguous ranges, e.g. for your example:&nbsp; enter <strong>1-2</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try using one of the other methods of saving your directions and try finding a workaround to print from them?&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise I'm sure you will have to print each page separately.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; Now it looks as if when I request page 2 to be printed that both
 page 1 and page 2 are printed?&nbsp;&nbsp; Quirks abound.&nbsp; YMMV.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I guess I'm still not being clear about the behavior: after entering From &amp; To and selecting the Route, there are 3 icons displayed below the selected route: Print, Share &amp; Favorite.&nbsp; When I select Print, I get a list of printers to choose from.&nbsp;
 At this point, it doesn't matter which printer I select (including the MS XPS Writer) AND I don't actually have to print: the problem&nbsp;exists at the preview stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1st page of the directions is displayed in a "preview pane" and below that in the middle&nbsp;I
 see: "1 of 2".&nbsp; If I change that to "2 of 2" or if I click the right arrow symbol that appears on the preview, I DON'T see the 2nd page of directions; instead I get the page which has the map(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, it appears the app is never generating more than 1 page of directions even though they are there.&nbsp; I can demonstrate this by double clicking the route I want which displays a scrollable region with ALL the steps in the directions.&nbsp; If the
 number of steps is more than 12 or 13,&nbsp;multiple pages will be required to print the directions.&nbsp; There appears to be no way to force it to print the 2nd (&amp; others if needed) page(s) of directions because it thinks all the directions will fit on one page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried Share to see what that does since the user does NOT have (and doesn't want) a Microsoft account.&nbsp; Is there a way to use Share that doesn't involve putting it in the cloud?&nbsp; (Maybe Share locally??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned when you requested page 2 to be printed you got BOTH page 1 &amp; 2.&nbsp; Were these 2 pages of directions or 1 page of directions and 1 page of maps?&nbsp; If so, can you try to generate a longer route (one that will require more than 1 page of directions)
 and let me know your results?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanx for working on this&nbsp;with me.</p>

<p>How can you be using Maps if you don't have a Microsoft account?&nbsp; In any case, I can share to OneNote and see the whole thing, both directions and maps.&nbsp; They are still presented in only two pieces but at least the size of the pieces aren't constrained by
 the size of a piece of paper.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

            <p>Thank you for confirming I'm not crazy and don't have a problem NO ONE else has seen.&nbsp; I have had this problem posted here for over 2 weeks and this is the 1st time anyone has duplicated my issue.&nbsp; I'm gonna go out on&nbsp;a limb here and say this is a problem
 with ALL installations of the&nbsp;Bing Maps app under Win8.1.&nbsp; I haven't gone back and tested it on a Win8.0 machine but maybe it's been there all along.&nbsp; So what STUNS me is that A) I couldn't find a post regarding this problem after a good hour of googling,
 and B) that you are the first (and so far only) person to say "Yep, looks like a bug"!&nbsp; My client is trying to move into the Win8.1 Metro App world and the first one he tries to use won't let him do something as basic as printing out a set of directions to
 give to his drivers (a trucking company) so they hopefully can find where they're going.&nbsp; Right now, he is using desktop IE to go to Google Maps and printing just fine from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what I've seen, I guess no one is using the Bing Maps Metro app and printing directions from it.&nbsp; I realize that the modern way to do what he wants is to Share it so his drivers could pull it up on their tablets or iPhones or whatever, but I just
 can't believe there's not some old-school folks still out there looking at paper?&nbsp; Or maybe those guys are ignoring the Metro stuff and sticking with Desktop versions?&nbsp; (I will freely admit I haven't found a Metro app that can compete with it's desktop counterpart
 on a non-touch device).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, since I appear to have discovered a somehow unknown bug at this late date, do you know how I would go about reporting it to MS so they can hopefully fix it in the next SP or via some update??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanx again and sorry for the diatribe...</p>

    <title>How to change the punctuatuation format with Chinese Simplified - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanyoung999  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change the punctuatuation format with Chinese Simplified Quanpin version 6 in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I am able to add the Chinese Simplified Quanpin version 6 on the new Win 7 PC I bought. The language&nbsp;function works fine except when I have to change the punctuation format. By default, the system displays the punctuation sign such as a ". (period)" in
 half the space. I want to be able to change the format so the sytem would display the ". (period)" as a full space sign (i.e. to display the sign as a standard space of a&nbsp;Chinese character). This function&nbsp;is available in Windows XP with (there is an icon you
 can click on) but apparently not in Win 7. Can anyone help? Thanks!

You try following this below steps to Input Chinese Punctuation Mark.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Follow these below steps.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Use the mouse<br />
2.Click the left button of the mouse on the above icon to shift between Chinese and English punctuation marks.
<br />
3.use the keyboard<br />
Use Ctrl + [.] (period mark) on the keyboard. <br />
4.Table of keys for Chinese punctuation <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a.Under the state of English punctuation, all marks shall correspond to keys on the keyboard.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b.Under the Chinese state, all Chinese marks shall be correspond to keys as shown on the table below:

<br />
<strong>Tips</strong> <br />
&nbsp;1. The shift button of Quanjiao/Banjiao will not be explained as it will be mentioned in the introduction on Microsoft Pinyin input method
<br />
&nbsp;2. For the first time the input method is activated, it is under the state of inputting Chinese punctuation marks.

Thanks for the info. But for whatever reason, there is simply no icon that I can click on to&nbsp;shift between Chinese and English punctuation marks&nbsp;with the Chinese Simplified Quanpin in Win 7.</p>
<p>Can you tell me how to make that icon appear?</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is a TOTAL DISASTER !!!!</p>
<p>Microsoft, give the user back its control.</p>
<p>Let us decide in a normal manner what ring-tone I can hear when someone is calling me on skype.</p>

<p>With all due respect, that is a politician's response.</p>
<p>I, like other users want to be able to customise the ringtone.</p>
<p>A ringtone that can't be heard in your pocket with some background noise is useless.</p>

    <title>&#34;You don&#39;t have permission to shutdown and restart this - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cookymonzta  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;You don&#39;t have permission to shutdown and restart this computer&#34;</h2>
                    Just recently I reinstalled Windows 7 on my machine, and <i>before</i> I activated my DSL modem, I installed Kaspersky Internet Security 2012, and it determined that one item that was installed in my machine (either from the Windows 7 DVD or my ASRock
 motherboard DVD, or from the DVD supplied by my video card) was dangerous; namely, Intel ME FW Service (intelmefwservice.exe).&nbsp; So, I put a restriction on its operation in Kaspersky.<br />
<br />
As I was downloading Windows Updates, things seemed to have been going well, until one restart was slow.&nbsp; My clock gadget took 2 minutes to appear on my screen, and my Kaspersky gadget below it did not appear at all.&nbsp; When I tried to restart my machine after
 gathering more updates, I was blocked by this message:&nbsp; "You don't have permission to shut down and restart this computer".&nbsp; I can't even perform a hard shutdown.&nbsp; This message started popping up whenever I tried to shut down my machine, forcing me to hit
 the reset button to go into Safe Mode to figure out the problem, even though I have absolutely no idea what I'm looking for, except perhaps to perform a System Restore.<br />
<br />
If it ain't one thing, it's another.&nbsp; What just happened to my Windows setup <i>this</i> time that is keeping me from shutting down my machine?&nbsp; Or did I pick up a bug that Kaspersky failed to catch, even though I had the program running before I activated
 my DSL my <i>latest</i> attempt to get this OS running smoothly?<br />

I think it's more likely the other way around. Kaspersky is flagging legitimate software as<br />
malicious.&nbsp; Kaspersky is notorious for this, and system slowdowns, but all AV's do make false positives.<br />
The first indication of this is -<br />
<br />
Of course they aren't dangerous, but software can be coded in such a way as to make an over<br />
vigilant (or because of too high security settings) AV"s paranoid.<br />
Try disabling Kaspersky before shutting down, or just uninstall it (or reduce the security level).<br />
<br />
If you are not logged on as Administrator when setting Windows up, do so.<br />
<br />
btw - The software on the disk that comes with motherboards, graphics cards; pretty much all<br />
hardware, is always out of date. It's best to download more recent drivers from the mfg's web site.<br />
You may want to disable Kaspersky&nbsp; while installing.&nbsp; ;)<br />
<br />
- With Windows updates you should also avoid installing some of the 'Optional' updates particularly<br />
the&nbsp; graphics drivers.&nbsp; Graphics card drivers are best uninstalled manually via Programs and Features and the new drivers installed after restarting the machine.<br />
- It is also safer in regard to possibility of corruption to install the updates in small batches.<br />
To do this set up Windows Updates to only inform you what updates are available and install them<br />
in your own time, and when the machine is not busy doing other tasks.<br />
<br />
Always install the motherboard and graphics driver software before anything else, particularly things
<br />
like gadgets. Save all that sort of thing until after you have fully setup Windows.<br />
<br />

Somehow, I suspected that would be the case.&nbsp; I performed a System Restore to take me back to a point before I was blocked from shutting down or restarting my machine, and tried to reinstall all the updates that were wiped out by the System Restore, and it
 turned into a mess.&nbsp; Windows failed to configure as many as 2 or 3 dozen of the 138 updates, and I decided I'd be better off wiping the hard drive clean and starting all over again,
<i>as usual.</i>&nbsp; If I had allowed the program to run unobstructed (I chose "Restrict"), most likely I wouldn't have had this problem.<br />

If you have not already reformatted and reinstalled this would probably save time in the long run.
<br />
You don't really have anything to loose on a new install gone wrong, but leave Kaspersky out of it,
<br />
at least until after you install the drivers and Windows 'Important' updates. <br />

I've already wiped my disk for another clean reinstallation, after my latest attempt to install all of the important updates failed.&nbsp; This one, following my installation of Kaspersky
<i>before</i> connecting to the Web, yielded 56 items which failed and another 84 which was displayed as "not needed".<br />
<br />
PA Bear (one of the moderators here) says that antivirus software should be up and running
<i>before</i> you expose a clean Windows installation to the Web, to prevent <i>any</i> chance of any bug sneaking in and corrupting the machine.&nbsp; But is a firewall sufficient?<br />
<br />
I ask this, because I almost always closely followed the procedure laid out by <i>
Computer Shopper</i> (as per article, 'Weekend Project:&nbsp; Protect your New Computer", by Matthew Murray), before PA Bear's advice gave me second thoughts.<br />
<br />
That article laid out the following steps:<br />
1.&nbsp; Install all available Windows updates (make sure firewall is on before connecting to the Web).<br />
2.&nbsp; Ghost your machine.<br />
3.&nbsp; Set up backup.<br />
4.&nbsp; Install security software (here is where Kaspersky would come in, if I were to return to this procedure)<br />
5.&nbsp; Install everything else.<br />
<br />
Now I have second thoughts again, after my latest setup failed.<br />
<br />
Would I be better off going back to the <i>Computer Shopper</i> routine?&nbsp; It seems that the installation of any antivirus software other than Microsoft Security Essentials leaves open the potential for the AV to corrupt one or more files during the initial
 mass update process.&nbsp; I imagine I would be better off letting Microsoft Security Essentials install with the other updates, and replace it with Kaspersky
<i>after</i> Windows is done retrieving and installing all of the important updates.<br />

            It's hard to imagine that even notorious Kaspersky is stuffing up the updates to that extent,
<br />
but the only way to verify is to at least disable it before starting&nbsp; a download of say a dozen updates.<br />
If the install does not complete then you need to look elsewhere for your update problems.<br />
<br />
If you must install an AV straight away at least use something else. Try MS Security Essentials.<br />
If Kaspersky is in fact what is stuffing up your updates, and not a bad internet connection, then<br />
it is acting as badly as malware anyway.<br />
<br />
I've been using Avast since I started on PC. It's not perfect either, but at least it has not borked<br />
my updates or driver installs, and while some people recommend disabling any AV before installing software in general, I usually forget.<br />
Avast did think my DELL monitor drivers were suspicious about four years ago, and I had to send a message to a gaming web site I use frequently because it started flagging the site as dangerous and<br />
blocked it. Sending reports to Avast fell on def ears. It stopped flagging the site after<br />
I wrote to the site itself though. I think Avast didn't listen to me because I use the free version.<br />
<br />
Lately Avast has been slowing Windows Explorer when I open folders the first time after booting<br />
into Windows. I've been having to disable it temporarily while I open some folders just to prep them.<br />
I'm hanging out a while longer and if it does not improve I'll be moving on to another AV as well,<br />
and it won't be Kaspersky, McAfee or Norton. Problem with MSE is it does not score as high as Avast<br />
in a recent detection test.<br />
<br />
I've never had a malware myself, but I don't use torrent sites or do social networking outside forums
<br />
like these, so I'm not downloading things that have been around the block several times.<br />
Started using PC's in '02. Not as long as many, I know, but I really don't think something, or
<br />
someone, is going to hop into my Windows while doing&nbsp; updates and driver downloads.
<br />
Not impossible, but not likely. <br />
Most malware&nbsp; is user installed via downloads from torrent and other suspect sites, or opening email attachments&nbsp; that have been&nbsp; infected as they get passed from person to person / PC to PC.<br />
The same is true of office PC's on a large network. Junk in junk out and many connections leaves them<br />
far more open to attack than a single home PC. That's why Windows Pro and Ultimate have enhanced<br />
security features.<br />
<br />
After installing Windows I prefer installing all drivers first thing. Then I finish setting up Windows<br />
before doing Windows updates. If using a standard HDD I defrag after installing Windows and again<br />
after all drivers are installed, and so on until Windows updates are all in. Defrag goes a lot quicker if<br />
you do it sooner than later.<br />
I do as much as possible while off line, and when Windows is sorted out and I'm not doing something
<br />
on line I always disconnect the internet from a shortcut on the desktop.. Best firewall you can have - lol .<br />
<br />
That's just my take on it, but there is not much in computing that doesn't seem to be debatable.<br />
<br />

            I installed MSE to my desktop machine (via SD card from a download to my laptop) before activating the Web, and this time, I had little trouble downloading and installing all the necessary updates and options.&nbsp; Only when I'm through getting all that I
 want (barring another mishap that disturbs the functionality of my Win7 setup) will I replace MSE with Kaspersky.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to another question:&nbsp; Could it be possible that a disturbance in my DSL transmission (rather than my early activation of Kaspersky Internet Security) completely corrupted my previous download of nearly 140 Windows updates?&nbsp; Of all the mishaps
 I have encountered, never had I encountered one in which a full download sequence was either complete or in progress, only to watch all the files downloaded basically blocked or kicked out of the system and registered as failures.<br />

Without experimenting it's hard to say if Kaspersky is to blame or your connection is, but if<br />
you used the same method to do the updates each time and had good results with MSE then<br />
it's a pretty safe bet Kaspersky is the culprit ( along with Kaspersky's&nbsp; general infamy).<br />
- If the downloads completed, as you seem to indicate, and the failure came with the install then
<br />
Kaspersky is the more likely candidate.<br />
- If your connection is very slow or has any tendency to drop out then the connection is more likely to blame. Dodgy modems can also cause corruption.<br />
<br />
But as I said earlier, keep the updates in small lots, and don't be doing other tasks when downloading
<br />
and installing, except maybe a little bit of browsing,&nbsp; and you have less chance of corruption, and<br />
if you do get a corrupt update you have better chance at rolling the update back.<br />
Which brings us to the best practice of creating a restore point before the update. Your system should<br />
do one automatically, but if you do one manually there is no guess work.<br />

It may very well have been my connection.&nbsp; My DSL speed is 1Mbps, and my transmission (via Verizon DSL) has had a history of glitches that cause it to drop out, even for a split-second, when I&nbsp; least expect it, and I've been giving consideration to upping the
 speed.<br />

I have two problems that are slowing down my computer.<br />
<br />
1) Start-up time:<br />
After my computer starts, it loads quickly to the log-in section. However, after I provide my log-in information<br />
the HP computer's&nbsp; HP monitor goes totally black for about two minutes, then the desktop appears.
<br />

2) Display Tune(R): After the desktop appears, I get an error box saying that "Display Tune(R) failed to load."<br />
<br />
I have removed Display Tune(r) from the program list using uninmstall tool in Control Panel.<br />
I even deleted some extra Display Tuner(r) files I found when doing a search. <br />
<br />
Still, the Display Tune(r) error pops up after every start.&nbsp; Have even tried reloading the program, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Any&nbsp; help would be gratefully appreciated.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks in advance.<br />

 Now, when they try to log in to the computer using that account it says "you must be online the first time to complete your account setup."</p>

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, you can try following one of the methods described below:
<br />
<br />1) <a href="https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrad...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Alternatively, you can try the below:
<br />
<br />a)  Start –&gt; All Programs –&gt; Accessories –&gt; right click on Command Prompt -&gt; select "Run as Administrator". Type net stop wuauserv to stop Windows Update Service. 
<br />
<br />Wait till you get : The windows update service was stopped successfully. " (DO NOT CLOSE COMMAND PROMPT).
<br />
<br />b)  - Go to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution 
<br />- Delete all files in "DataStore" folder
<br />- Delete all files in "Download" folder. 
<br />
<br />c) In the Command prompt window, type net start wuauserv to start Windows Update service. 
<br />
<br />Restart your computer and try to get update again (this should fix the issue permanently).
<br />
<br />3) Reset Windows Update with a script
<br /><a href="https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/window...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Other 5 additional tips can be found here:

<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped somehow. 
<br />

            The error code means update files are missing.
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

    <title>Movie Maker video quality is significantly less than the original MOV. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Movie Maker video quality is significantly less than the original MOV.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Donald. I shot some videos with&nbsp;a DSLR at 1920x 1080 50i (PAL mode)&nbsp;with a hand-held camera stabilizer. I copied orginal video clips which are in MOV mode to my desktop. I then use Windows media player to play a video and&nbsp;the image is&nbsp;is hypnotically
 smooth, and&nbsp;overall quality is incredible. However, I imported the video clips to Window movie maker and then save it either with the option"For Highest Definition Display" or "Window 8 (1080P)", the output videos became a lit bit Shaky and it is obvious to
 see. It's not for a particular out video, actually all output&nbsp;video have such issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your info, I am runing Windows 7 ultimate and Windows movie maker 2012(the latest one for windows 7). My desktop computer is purchased three years ago&nbsp;running i3 processor and&nbsp;graphic card&nbsp;which is fully capable of&nbsp;playing Full HD videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried to troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Follow the link beloe to check Codecs and update video driver, and doesn't help</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-av/movie-maker-video-quality-is-significantly-less/f068bffc-b6c7-4813-9e78-61dfd74f276b">Movie Maker video quality is significantly less than the HD original clips.
</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Convert orginal MOV files to other format such as AVI or MP4 with&nbsp;mainstream format converters, found that the output videos quality is similarly downgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Repeat above steps on another latest computer hardware, and problem persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is an example of my&nbsp;original video clip info for&nbsp;your reference, and hope you can solve the issue. Thanks!!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. I understand that you're having issues on the converted files on your Movie Maker as it degrades the quality. We would like to investigate this issue further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, when you convert your file, there shouldn't be a significant change on the quality of the video. But, since you've mentioned that the video is getting shaky after converting the file, please provide us a sample of the original video and the converted
 one using Movie Maker. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have provided a private message where you can securely upload the video clips. After uploading, please reply back to this public thread for us to be notified.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We'll wait for your response.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for posting. I understand that you are having issues with the attachments in your Mail. To further isolate the issue, I would like to ask some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the file types being opened?</li><li>Does it happen to all of the attachments?</li><li>Can you open those when accessing through web?</li><li>Does the sender your contact?</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
