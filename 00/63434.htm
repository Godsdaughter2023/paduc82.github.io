<h2>            Change desktop background etc.in Win 10 Visitor A&#47;C</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have finally managed to set up a "Visitor" user A/C on a Win 10 PC but can't change the desktop background etc..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right clicking on the desktop brings up both Display Settings and Personalize but no options.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead it brings up a rectangular box with a white X in a red circle which says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel. . . . . &nbsp;. . I have absolutely no idea what they are talking
 about????<br />
</p>
<p>Can someone pls help, for which many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As requested, this is the screen print of what I had previously described. It comes up if I right click the desktop and choose either Display settings or Personalize (but only for the visitor account . . . in all other accounts they work fine):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00b28590-b300-4610-abe8-8dd468d54380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00b28590-b300-4610-abe8-8dd468d54380" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer to have the desktop background as a simple solid color, but the only 2 options available are flowers or space scenes, which, whilst beautiful photos, make the screen too fussy . . . this is the simplest but it changes constantly.</p>
<p />

            <p>Can't now try the Start Menu etc. as about an hour ago I got fed up and deleted the Visitor A/C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my original post I said,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;"finally managed to set up a Visitor A/C" because, as I couldn't see where to turn on "Guest A/C" in Win 10, I googled it and used this rather complicated
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">link&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(for me that is) to set up a "Visitor A/C":</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.howtogeek.com/280527/how-to-create-a-guest-account-in-windows-10/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Anyway, as I was fed up trying to make the changes to "Personalize" etc., &nbsp;I deleted the A/C and, instead, set up an additional user A/C through "User Groups" and simply named it "Visitor" &nbsp;. . . . and,
 so far at least, everything seems to be working perfectly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The howtogeek.com link says,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><strong>By default, new users are placed in the users g</strong></span><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">roup so they
 have the permissions for standard users. However, we want the account to more limited than that. So, we’re going to put the Visitor user in the guests
</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">group.</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, they don't elaborate and say which &nbsp;permissions/specific actions are not possible. Although, of course, I found one myself in that I couldn't Personalize the Desktop background.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless anyone can give me a non obvious and/or unacceptable vulnerability, I'll now leave well enough alone.</p>

<h2>            How to copy &#47; clone parental controls to another account</h2>
                    Is there a way to copy or clone parental controls settings from an existing restricted account to a new account?<br />
I am setting up individual accounts for my children, and find it very inconvenient to do the list of allowed programs multiple times. It would also be handy to have the settings synchronised if settings from one account (when settings have been changed) could
 be copied to another account.<br />
Any hints or pointers will be greatly appreciated!

<p><span><span>Thank you for replying. You can copy a user profile, however, you would have to enable the parental control settings again. Unfortunately there is not a way to clone.

            Hi muskokacam 
<br />
<br />Honestly the truth - none of those utilities are of any use to you with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />A lot of those are wrapped in malware and the rest are simply not supported
<br />
<br />Window 10 updates very regularly, those software companies have difficulty keeping up with the changes that are made to Windows 10 and especially to the Windows Registry. 
<br />
<br />Every day on Community there are users that have installed those applications and are unable to get into their PC . . .
<br />
<br />Honestly, keep your PC up to date and those updates will clear out your registry and keep your PC running as well as any of those utilities . . .

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I like to keep my SSD clean and free of clutter so I use this built in utility every couple of weeks or so. You can also set it so it will do the job automatically. Also Run&nbsp; "Defragment and Optimize" drive. If you have a SSD drive it will simply "Trim"

    <title>Windows 7 Backup and restore managing space - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Backup and restore managing space</h2>
                    <p>I set up Windows 7 backup and restore one year ago and thought it was working just fine.&nbsp; I went to try to restore a file and discovered that my last completed backup was in August.&nbsp; My drive was full.</p>
<p>Windows 7 Backup and Restore allows you to manage the space system images take up on a backup drive.&nbsp; You can either keep only the most recent or have it start overwriting old system image files when system images have taken up 30% of the backup drive.&nbsp;Does
 this tool have a similar overwrite feature for the actual backup files?&nbsp; I've read many topics regarding space management using the Windows 7 backup and restore feature.&nbsp; It looks like for the actual backup files, you have to manually go in and delete older
 backups to free up space.&nbsp; Is there anyway to automate this process to keep the disk from filling up?</p>

<p>Hi SupineFlunky838,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ability to automatically delete older backups to free some space for the new backups is not possible as backups are created depending on the available disk space. However, you can also change how Windows retains older system image. Instead of
<em>letting Windows manage the space used for backup history</em>, you can choose
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Keep only the latest system image and minimize space used by backup</span></em>. Doing so will delete your earlier system images and keep only the latest System Image.</p>
<p>

                    When I connect my cell phone to my computer it shows in the "my computer" as a CD drive rather than as a storage device, therefore I can not access the sd memory - it will ask to insert a cd.<br />

<h2>            How can I save my updates before change my Windows 7 Home Premium&#63;</h2>
                    My windows is up to date and everything is latest version (Microsoft Applications Such as Windows service pack, IE, Security and etc). I have to restore my laptop to factory settings but after that I don't want to wait again for downloading all of updates.
 Is there any way to save my updates and after changing my windows I install them manually very fast?

<h3> jg44077  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controllers become unresponsive</h2>
                    New problem! My controllers become unresponsive. After a hard reset they work again then will go unresponsive again a few minutes later. Problem started in the beginning of may. Batteries are good. Controlers firmware is up to date. Same problem with both
 controllers. Tried using while plugged into usb also. Same result. When they become unresponsive they are still connected. Druing that time if you try and hit the sync button in the xbox the light on the xbox will not blink. After a hard reset the controllers
 work and you can resync. It doesnt lastlong though 15-20 minutes and back again. I see a few people posted they have the same exact problem.&nbsp;

<h2>            Afters upgrading to Windows 10, I have constant stutters, freezes, and hiccups in audio and graphics</h2>
                    <p>Ever since my upgrade two days ago, I've been experiencing issues with my audio and on-screen graphics that occur randomly and during any kind of activity, be it gaming, watching videos, or even just browsing the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer will suddenly freeze for a quarter of a second, my audio will loop repeatedly making a buzzing sound, and then the computer will return to function normally right afterwards. I have no way to replicate this glitch, but it occurs at both inopportune
 times that makes gaming an incredible hassle, and it also distracts me when I'm watching videos or even listening to music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not seem like a huge issue as the rest of my upgrade appears relatively stable, but this is a huge inconvenience that I did not foresee when upgrading, and I'm actually reconsidering downgrading back to Win 7 as a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My graphics drivers for my GTX 760 are up to date, and so are my audio drivers. This error has only just begun because of my installation of Windows 10. I have defragmented my PC's C drive with around 7-8 passes throughout.</p>

            <p>I have tried everything suggested above and still I get a random buzzing sound in the middle of a game which also locks on my screen until the buzzing stops.</p>
<p>Would it be advisable to go back to windows 7 or is there some thing that can be done to resolve my challenge. What information must I send for you to analyse and find a solution to my problem.</p>

            <p>After following all of the instructions above - I have found an improvement. So far anyway, the hangs are less frequent and the duration is shorter. I also downloaded a tool called latencymon from resplendence software. Running this suggests that my network
 card drivers are the cause of much of my latency - and directx for the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drivers for my card are up to date, as is the directx - so not sure where to go from here.</p>

 in the bios and installed 2 individual Sound Blaster cards. So this is not an Audio issue at least on mine. I have done a complete reinstall of Windows 10 to attempt to resolve this issue and it persists. I formatted my HDD and even attempted a different one
 with no change. Please advise where to go from here. I am on a desktop with 6gig mem, a 250gig hdd primary and a backup that is 1t. ATI graphics card (I had an NVidea originally but it caused issues with a game that I play.) It had the same problem as well.
 I have run a continual Memtest86 burn in for 24+ hours so the mem is good. I used a burn in tool on the PCU and GPU no errors after 8 hours. Just to verify RAM I tried 2 gigs same issue then the 4 gigs (Matched sets 2x1 and 2x2) same issue. I do not overclock
 my equipment so it is not a clocking issue. Running a dual core 3ghtz proc I tried a 2.4ghtz proc same issue. Per my monitoring software the proc stays well within the "Safe" zone heat-wise. the only thing that I can attribute this to is Windows 10. I will
 try the suggestions that are listed and hope for the best, unfortunately I am not very hopeful. The suggestions should be a mute point after a clean install.<br />

            Ηi,i had the same problem in both my desktop and my laptop for months and i couldnt find what was causing it.Finally i found that uninstalling realtek audio drivers and installing the generic audio drivers of the windows solved my problem completely in
 both my desktop and laptop.Let me know if this solved your problem :-)

            <p>In the device manager,in the sound video and game controllers section you will find your realtek high definition audio then double click,and in the driver tab you will choose uninstall and you will tick the delete driver after windows will reinstall the
 generic drivers by its own maybe it will need refresh or restart.Also for this specific problem i found out that disabling the windows fast start up and keeping the realtek drivers does the trick i dont know why, maybe with it activated it doesnt shut down
 some drivers properly,the thing is that it works for me.</p>

            Thanks for the info. After playing around for about 10 hours straight with all kinds of stuff to no avail, I ended up getting a new Wi-Fi card and that seems to have fixed the problem. Stupid machines.

<h2>            Windows 10 install fail 80070003 on ASPIRE e1-510</h2>
                    <p>After wading through 100's of "fixes" it seems the root problem is that the product key is blocked. i have experienced a variety of error messages and spent endless hours with the trouble shooter and reinstalling windows 10 at least 25 times since it's release.
 on my desktop it installed and is running flawlessly right from the first. the main difference is i built my desktop and don't have a OEM license on it as i do on the Acer E1-510 Laptop. Sitting on the phone for hours only to be disconnected is very upsetting.
 What do i have to do to get help?</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p>Here is the answer to this mess, the partitions on the disk don't match what windows 10 expects. therefor it looks at a partition expecting one thing and if no match fails the installation.</p>
<p>FIX:</p>
<p>reinstall windows 8.1 keeping all your data and programs. (use the mediacreationtool for 8.1 or use your install disk, mine didn't come with one so i used the tool, it may be a better choice as it will have all the updates on it)</p>
<p>run it, and then check for updates, install windows 10 from the update, keeping all your data and software.</p>
<p>Yes it all takes a long time, almost all day.</p>
<p>final result: i have an authorized Windows 10 Home computer.</p>
<p>Good Luck to All</p>

                    <p>I have a new Surface Pro 3 with Win 8.1 and a 128 GB SSD - love it.&nbsp; But it's all C:\, and I really want to partition it as C, D, E and F drives. However, Paragon's Partition Manager 14, which installed without difficulty, won't let that happen. No matter
 how I try it will not reduce the size of C:\ to make room for the three other partitions.</p>

</p><p>Is this a Win 8.1 restriction, or a specific Surface Pro 3 limitation? Or is it inherently not possible to partition an SSD (which I find hard to believe)?&nbsp; Can someone identify a way to do the partitioning I desire without obliterating the Win 8.1 installation
 that came on the machine?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rabnud,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disk Management is a built-in tool in Windows which enables the users to view and manage the installed drive in their computer and the partitions related with those drives. With the help
 of Disk Management, you can create partition, format partition, extend partition, shrink partition, delete partition, change drive letter. It nearly satisfies all the demands of the users and is convenient for the users, so it is widely used by the users.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to Partition a hard drive with Windows 8/8.1 Disk Management tool:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Windows 8 or 8.1 Disk Management by pressing "Windows + R" and typing "diskmgmt.msc". In the pop-up window, right click on C drive and select "Shrink Volume".
</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the pop-up window, enter the amount of space to shrink.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click "Shrink" and we can preview an unallocated space behind C drive. Then, right click on it and select "New Simple Volume". Follow the on screen directions to complete the process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

<h2>            Xbox One will not format external hard drive</h2>
                    
<p>After reading all of the forums about similar problems it seems that there is something wrong with my xbox. &nbsp;My xbox one will recognize that an external hard drive is connected however it only gives me the option to view contents. &nbsp;I have tried "full reboots",
 all three usb ports, making sure the setting to keep hard drives on is checked, you name it i've done it. &nbsp;I've formatted the drive on a pc and made sure it had a partition. &nbsp;I've tried both of my external hard drives, one is a 1 tb HGST Touro as well as my
 WD 2tb my book. &nbsp;Both drives are usb 3.0. &nbsp;I have tried both drives on my friends xbox and they show up, can be formatted and can move to and from the drives. Both have the newest april update. &nbsp;I purchased my xbox one a month after they were released and
 they purchased theirs a month or so ago. &nbsp;The only thing that installed was the media player app when i connected my external drive. &nbsp;It seems as if there is something missing such as an app that reads the external drive. This is so frustrating, thought this
 was supposed to be plug and play, but i cant download any new games being that my hard drive is full. my xbox 360 got the red rings and now the one is doing things like this! &nbsp;Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! &nbsp;I guess this is the price you pay for
 being an early adopter.</p>

<p>Hey guys, same problem here :/ Playing games from our Western Digital 1TB - purchased new and fresh-used on the XBO in June 2014 - fine yesterday, then today: nothing.
</p>
<p>Tried all the troubleshoots but no joy; attempted re-formatting on Win8.1 laptop but can't see a way to Format - however Properties/Troubleshoot say it's working fine/no issues detected; plugged it in to the Mac Mini [I know, long shot!] but OS X reports
 it unreadable and needs initialising, opens Disk Utility, which then highlights the drive in danger-red, disables all edit options, shows S.M.A.R.T. as failing and advises backup and contacting Apple for assistance..!
</p>
<p>Anarkia: I've not tried another USB drive but I've connected the poorly WD1TB to all three XBO USB ports and each time the drive activity light blinks on connection for a few second before turning steady - I'm fairly certain it used to blink irregularly
 [currently it remains on constantly until powering the XBO off, when it returns to blinking]... Is this proving the ports are sound or would I be better off rooting through man-junk-drawers for a thumbdrive just to be positive..?</p>
<p>Should also add that we've had a couple of flaky moments in the past, where the drive's been missing and had to be disconnected and reconnected to regain availability. However this seems something different as previously it's rectified itself fairly swiftly,
 plus I feel it's odd that we're all coming to the Support forum with the same issues - anyone had any luck reviving their drive yet or any Support folks have any suggestions..?
</p>
<p>Managed to find the receipt, so I'm tempted to go and see if I can get a new replacement to plug in and see if the Box will format a factory-fresh drive - if I do, I'll report back here with my findings!</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. I go to Settings/System/Storage and it recognizes that my hard drive is plugged in, but will only allow it to be used for media storage, and when I select it it doesn't even offer the option to be formatted for memory. It had
 worked earlier but now for some reason it won't allow me to. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Installed on hard drive instead of SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew mazar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Installed on hard drive instead of SSD</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my laptop to Windows 10. It has a hard drive (~ 1 TB) and an SSD (~ 25 GB). Previously, Windows 8 was installed on the SSD. When I upgraded, I did not see an option to choose which drive to install Windows to. It did it on the hard drive.
 Obviously I want it on the SSD. Any idea how to move it over OR reinstall with the option to choose which drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Option 1: You can download Windows 10 and put it on a USB or DVD and try to install it from there.&nbsp; That should give you the option of which drive to use when installing it / upgrading.&nbsp; You may want to disable or temporarily disconnect your HDD if you don't
 get the choice.&nbsp; from what I understand Win8 is on the SSD so if you download and try to install it on the SSD it should upgrade it and all your personal files will be there.&nbsp; Because you already installed it once I don't know if there is an activation conflict.&nbsp;
 Visit this link below in Internet Explorer&nbsp;and at the bottom of the page locate the download links for the Media Creation tool. Pick the 32 or 64 bit version based on what your copy of Win8 is. Download and run the tool and pick the option to download the
 image to install using DVD or USB. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Option 2:</p>
<p>You can try to clone your Windows partition using&nbsp; a partition manager.&nbsp; I personally have EaseUS partition master which is free.&nbsp; There are a lot of Commands that can be entered into the Command prompt but I prefer to use a program like I mentioned to be
 sure I can see what I am doing.&nbsp; I can't even remember all the commands right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never tried to clone a partition from a HDD to a SSD but it should work the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have or acquire a partition manager program. Try cloning your windows partition to the SSD. Making an exact copy. The new partition needs to be marked as Primary and Active.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to update the MBR Master boot record or go in to your BIOS and set the SSD before your HDD in the boot order.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a partition manager in it but it is extremely &nbsp;basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 3:</p>
<p>Or you could make a backup of your system (create a system image) using the Windows Backup feature or another backup program.&nbsp; The backup image would need to be on an external hard drive or a USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you could reboot your computer into recovery mode by holding Shift and&nbsp;clicking restart from the start menu at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then restore from the backup to the SSD.&nbsp; Which would essentially copy Windows to the SSD.&nbsp; That would take some time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t navigate menu due to menu glitch</h2>
                    <p>This started yesterday. This issue happens no matter what controller I use (and I did a hard reset before I tried each one).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>When I turn my Xbox one on once I attempt to navigate anywhere on the home menu the Xbox will automatically launch the "manage game and apps menu" and take me to that screen. If I input anything else from the controller it kicks me back to home screen like I hit the home button, with the "manage games or apps" menu minimized. If I push any button, it relaunches the "manage games and apps" menu, and just repeats thus no matter how many times I do a hard reset, no matter what controller I use. All I am trying to do is sign into my profile.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Any ideas? I searched this forum, reddit, google, and haven't come across a fix yet.</p>

When I try to navigate the home screen menus it will tab left once to the menu on the left that allows you to choose a profile to sign in, check messages, ect.

                    The volume icon is missing from my notifications bar even after I chose to show notifications and icon on the customize link. If I click on "turn icons on or Off" the sound icon is greyed out.

    <title>After a windows update Microsoft doesn&#39;t recognize validation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lbharmon  say:</h3>
<h2>            After a windows update Microsoft doesn&#39;t recognize validation</h2>
                    After one update that was about 3 weeks ago after the restart and welcome window the screen goes to Windows doesn't recognize validation to validate click here. The last time this happened I had to do a factory recovery and set it for before the update,
 due to the fact that I cannot get to the start screen to do what it says to run to correct the problem. Now, I just did "a critical update" and the same thing happened again. Can I validate without having to recover my pc again? I have a compaq presaris and
 I am running Windows Vista Basic.

            Hi alfredogf
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. To troubleshoot - Can you login to Web Skype (only Chrome browsers) and let me know whether you are able to use Skype?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />This would help me to isolate whether Skype client is the reason or is there a problem with Skype services or some other reason.
<br />
<br />2. Please confirm if you have caller ID setup
<br />
<br />What is caller identification and how do I set it up? - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is...</a>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting the <strong>error for invalid phone number</strong>, the only way to know is to

<p>
</p><p>It is possible that&nbsp;two numbers have been saved under the same contact and it is automatically dialing the incorrect one.

<h2>            &#34;The endpoint mapper database entry could not be created&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>lately I've been having this problem with my PC, an error keeps popping up. The error message always reads: "The endpoint mapper database entry could not be created" and is usually accompanied by an address leading to the system32 file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error usually occurs at a certain set of events:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I try to download something;<br />
Every time I try to download something (lately the problem occurred with Teamspeak, Tunngle and Adobe Flash) it always stops before I can run the installation and it gives me the exact same error as above. No help to guide me, no suggestions, just the error
 and the exit button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I try to access anything having to do with the Windows System;</p>
<p>Of course I've tried to look this problem up on the internet and try to solve it myself. Usually the suggestions are something along the lines of: Do something in msconfig or view what happens in the event logger. Now the problem with this is, is that I
 can't start either of these. It just gives me the same error. Which leads me too believe it has something to do with the Windows system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I need to mention a couple of things. First of all, I'm using Windows 7, if that wasn't clear already. Also, the problem does not seem to occur when I boot my computer into Safe Mode. I can install anything, start any program, and also start msconfig.
 However, if I recall, correctly, it does occur when I perform a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any idea how to solve this problem, or any further questions that might lead you to find a solution. Please feel free to ask.</p>
<p>I'm really looking for a solution for this problem, since it inhibits a lot of things I like to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Yellowdevil</p>

<h2>            System Restore Failed&#58; Error 0x1F and System Files Integrity Check and Repair Failed&#58; Error 0x490</h2>
                    <p>Recently my Desktop failed to start Windows 7 with the errors listed above in the title. I recently saw the post pertaining to the same errors but since my computer will not start Windows and I was not supplied with a Windows disc with my PC, I cannot try
 any of the potential solutions given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, before finding the other posts with the same errors and trying these solutions, my PC would start Windows after failing to restore or repair a few times.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found no viruses, malware, no errors on disk, etc., etc. Coincidentally, Windows did automatically restore to a previous Restore Point at one point after about an hour after using my computer, but has since failed to properly load Windows 7 again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since you have mentioned that the computer started working after sometime, I would recommend you to perform the steps mentioned below in order to get the issue resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could be resolved by performing clean boot. </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>Sorry if I wasn't clear in my original post but my computer no longer starts Windows at all so I cannot try the solutions you provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my first post I also didn't receive a DVD or CD of Windows when I purchased my computer so I can't boot from a disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the BIOS when booting up and the Boot Priority had set the 1st priority to the CD Rom Drive for some reason. I changed the Boot Priority for my HD first but still receiving same errors above when Windows fails to start, along with the System Restore
 and Restore Point failing as well.</p>

            <p>Jessen,<br />
Booting up in Safe Mode does not work either. All I get is a Boot Priority prompt that gives me the choice of my HD, Floppy Drive, or CD/DVD drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When selecting my HD, the computer automatically restarts again saying that Windows failed to load and gives me the option of trying the Startup Recovery (which has repeatedly failed several dozen times by now) or start Windows Normally, which of course
 fails and automatically restarts my computer and places me back where I started again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I can't even boot up in Safe Mode and am stuck to where I was before. At this point my computer will only let me Start Windows Normally (and fail), Startup Recovery (fail), or view/change the BIOS.</p>
