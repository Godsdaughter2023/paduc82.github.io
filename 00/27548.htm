            Chances are, you might have switched your Hotmail.com account to Outlook.com<br />
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If you need to print an email using outlook.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. After you click the email that you wanted to print.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the upper middle part where can see the three dots(right after categories)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. There will be a drop down,to where you can see, Print on the very bottom</p>
<br />
If you like to switch back to your old Hotmail account to do the printing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Click on the Gear icon &amp; switch back to Hotmail.com<br />
<br />

            I'm glad I found this discussion because I had the same problem trying to find the print button in the new hotmail. &nbsp;I don't get why such a common feature such as Printing is hidden as three dots??
<div><br />
<div>Anyways, I'm trying to figure out how you customize what e-mails within a list of e-mails that you can decide to print out instead of printing out the entire discussion as the print button would normally do.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there a way to custom select or choose which e-mails you want printed or which ones you don't?</div>

            Thanks for your reply, It is very helpful. The logfiles indicate a Policy change just before the DB is crashing. The is Error Description is in Dutch but is just Disk or Network error. Close the Database and open it again if you wil continu. Eror 503043

            Hi fedbil100 
<br />
<br />What you say is true - who believes a complete stranger phoning you saying they are from Microsoft and asking for Bank Card details
<br />
<br />The best and first line of defense is the user themselves and some common sense, though the problem with common sense, is it is not very common!
<br />
<br />Windows Defender has, over the last few years become a fully featured Security solution 
<br />
<br />Windows Security Center is on a par with paid for Anti-virus software, the virus definitions are updated regularly, it will not slow our PC down, works well with Edge and it is Free 
<br />
<br />Honestly, you do not need more protection than Defender can supply . ..
<br />
<br />For most users that come here on Community, usually with a ransomware attack, the fault lies with the user, their system is not up to date, sometimes up to 2 years out of date, others have turned off Controlled Folder Access, or removed 3rd party Anti-virus suites and Defender was never turned back on . . .  I don't think I have seen a thread on Community, where the user's system was up to date, with all security options turned on and the user then got infected . . .

            Dave thanks for your reply you sum it up greatly . Windows has become a powerful Security System. However the users of the OS need education . Do you think Windows 10 will become on a Par with Apples System . People will probably still crave the Bells
 &amp; Whistles of the Top names in the Security Industry. However I believe they tend to cause bloat if you have your own Guard dog its not going to be happy with a third party one when update feeds are needed if you see my analogy &nbsp;Thanks once again Dave best
 wishes. Billy

<p>Though you realize the problem is education Billy, you've missed the point that this can never truly happen, since not only don't most people have the basic understanding to learn all of the technical details, almost none have the desire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as you've inferred, the "walled garden" approach, or really creating a version of the "Windows operating system for dummies" is what's truly required, with all of the updating, security and limitations on how and where applications can be gotten from
 and installed built-in from the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though Windows 10 was part of the path on the way to this more secure future, it was only a half-step, since the Windows operating system was originally a large, overgrown and historically very open system designed for software developers, not consumers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on the way to improving Windows 10, Microsoft created several concepts such as Windows Core OS, which though as the following article states, isn't easy to define, was useful for Microsoft to create various other legacy free versions of Windows
 that operate on smaller, less powerful hardware platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-core-os" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Core OS The Complete Guide&nbsp;| Windows Central</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another major step on the way to the Core OS was something called "Windows 10 S", which though it still contains a few legacy components, removed many of the least secure and most attacked, resulting in a version that's not only more secure, but also much
 leaner and faster, making it ideal for less powerful hardware like tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/s-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Introducing Windows 10 in S mode – Performance that lasts</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/305363/WHAT-IS-WINDOWS-S-AND-HOW-IS-IT-DIFFERENT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What Is Windows 10 S, and How Is It Different | How-To Geek</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Though as the first Microsoft link above describes this as intended for Students, they also mention that it's useful for anyone wanting better security and performance for the long-haul, especially for those consumer users who really don't understand the
 technical issues or how to properly protect the more complex older Windows based PCs that contain all of the vulnerabilities of that legacy OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, Microsoft already makes the "walled garden" OS you've suggested, it's just that as usual, few other than a handful of the more technically knowledgeable truly understand what it's for and even that it exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I just finally bought a Microsoft Surface Go -&nbsp;10" tablet this Memorial Day that comes with Windows 10 S installed, with the option to "upgrade" the operating system to the "Pro" version of Windows at additional cost&nbsp;if desired.&nbsp; The big box
 store salesman even tried to tell me why I might need to install Pro, until I told him how wrong he was and explained why this smaller, leaner version of Windows exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't figured this out yet, someone like me thinks that anyone doing this upgrade is a fool, since from the above you should understand that this means a reduction in both security and potentially performance.&nbsp; However, many of the self-appointed
 "geeks" or "experts" is various forums love to tell people that Windows 10 S "isn't really Windows" and is somehow inferior, when in reality the truth&nbsp;is exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, Windows 10 S only allows installing apps from the Windows 10 store, which along with being a more secure place to get them as these are tested by Microsoft, also means they operate without most of the less secure legacy components that were
 most easily attacked by malware.&nbsp; In fact, most of the popup and other malicious advertisements that display messages to call Microsoft won't even work on Windows 10 S, along with most of the malware that depended on those same old portions of legacy Windows
 to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as is often the case, Microsoft itself is far ahead of the computing public, but few are even aware, so they keep buying the big old PCs and laptops and/or "upgrading" their new PC or tablet to an inferior version of Windows 10 Pro, that though a few
 business users have some old applications that will only work with this outdated version, most consumers have no need to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my own case, this new Surface Go tablet is fast, simple and will run any of the Office, or other basic apps I need including the built-in Outlook email/calendar, MSN weather, as well as popular apps like Microsoft News (e.g. MSN News, Money, etc.), Netflix
 and other major names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still setting the new tablet up, but I can see no reason that the typical consumer would need anything more than this, other than possibly wanting a larger 12.3"&nbsp;screen as offered by the Surface Pro 6 or an even larger screen with the Surface Laptop
 that, you guessed it, still ships with Windows 10 S initially installed.&nbsp; Just don't be stupid and install the Windows 10 Pro upgrade unless you absolutely can't run a critical app without it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, if it's only one app that requires running Pro, take a serious look at why you're installing it and whether it's truly needed.&nbsp; For example, none of the major&nbsp;3rd-party security apps will run on Windows 10 S, but then you don't need them, since
 it of course comes with Windows Defender built-in and there are none of the Win32 or other legacy components of Windows included that most often allowed malware to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think about it.&nbsp; If the malware can't run, then why do you need the additional software to protect from it, so the problem's already solved.&nbsp; Most of the extra software the geeks and experts installed on Windows were to protect, maintain or monitor portions
 of the legacy operating system that with Windows 10 S, simply no longer exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one of the commonly misunderstood parts of where Microsoft is heading with Windows 10, to a leaner, more secure and faster version that doesn't have most of the old problems, while it still runs nearly all of the major software that has bothered
 to keep up with these changes.&nbsp; So if you have a favorite software that doesn't, either tell them to get it up to current standards or simply move on to something that does, voting with your money and your feet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt; EDIT &gt;&nbsp; Just took a glance back at Dave's answer above and that reminded me of some other points.&nbsp; For example, CFA doesn't exist on Windows 10 S because it doesn't need to, since the folders it protects can't be written to by any apps the way they could
 with legacy Windows, so there's no need to protect them.&nbsp; If it isn't obvious, that also means that most ransomware simply won't work on Windows 10 S, so problem solved and no extra protection needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that everything else Dave mentioned that stupid users do are something that Windows 10 S either does automatically, without any user intervention or control or again simply doesn't exist.&nbsp; For example, you can't have problems removing major 3rd-party
 security apps, because they can't be installed in the first place and as I already mentioned above, there's no need to anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The unfortunate truth is that the typical consumer does need better protection than Windows Defender alone on legacy Windows can provide.&nbsp; They actually need a computer nanny that stands over their shoulder and tells them not to be stupid, including doing
 stupid things like letting someone they don't know remote control their PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since Windows 10 S limits what the computer user can do, let alone other software, most of what even the callers do doesn't work any more and the most they'd be able to do is change your password or something else that cripples your access to use
 the device.&nbsp; But for most even this could be fixed, since most set up a Windows 10 S device with both&nbsp;a Microsoft Account and the free OneDrive cloud storage, their data is safe in the cloud and they can simply reset their tablet, laptop or similar device,
 reset their account password using a number of Microsoft provided methods and re-download their backed up favorites, files and&nbsp;other settings from the OneDrive cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only if the user let the scammer on their system long enough to manually delete all of their data first would a ransom be possible and unless the scammer&nbsp;backed it up offline first, they've have nothing to sell you anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So fools can still be tricked, but it's more difficult and not nearly as likely, since eventually most consumers will realize that all such calls are fake and their Windows 10 S&nbsp;system can't have malware.&nbsp; Those that don't deserve what they get, since there's
 always been a fool born every minute and nothing will stop that no matter what any computing company does.</p>

            Rob Thanks once again for a totally excellent fully comprehensive explanation. All your Colleagues do a great job but nobody goes into every nook and cranny like you. That is the education I talk about people only have to ask and its free. &nbsp;I was impressed
 when it was mentioned that the US Military have or are taking Windows 10 obviously there will be extra layers involved but its a complement to Microsoft. &nbsp;I much appreciate your reply Rob keep up the good work mate. &nbsp;Best Regards &nbsp;Billy&nbsp;

<p>Education is fundamental for all users, like when you buy a car, you don't just drive it.</p>
<p>You will need to learn driving and get driving license.</p>
<p>Most people just buy a PC and internet connection and start using it, even though there are many security features build into Windows which protects you against cybercriminals but they are areas where are beyond control of operating system.</p>
<p>That is why forum like this one exist, so we could help users with their issues.</p>

<p>Again, nice theory Cyber, but it just doesn't happen for most&nbsp;and never will, at least not for those older people not currently in school or planning to return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's simple human nature, since though you believe that people become "educated" in order to drive a car, that's really not true either and is becoming less so as time goes on and assistive technology takes up the slack for human limitations and failures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I say all of this because I worked in the education field during my technical career, including administration of computers for universities and all levels of primary and secondary education in US Midwest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I learned during this portion of my career is that those students in primary and secondary schools were being provided with increasing levels of access and training, since the computer was being seen as something they'd all need to deal with in their
 future, whether they used them directly for work or simply as consumers in order to do daily tasks such as banking or online purchases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The use of computers in college and university environment typically occurred even earlier, but working in an engineering school revealed some interesting effects, since over time the true "computer literacy" of most students actually declined, in part due
 to their complexity.&nbsp; For example, though those students specifically training for careers in the computer field often learned a broad range of new technology, those in other engineering&nbsp;fields like architecture or&nbsp;mechanical began to learn less, as well as
 take less interest beyond the specific programs they needed to learn for their chosen track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tendency to ignore technology that isn't important to a person's field or work is normal and simply a reaction to the massive amounts of information that exists in the world.&nbsp; In consumer terms, this means that most device users won't learn anything
 beyond what they must in order to get a task done and maintaining a computer isn't of interest to most, so it simply won't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The basic truth here is that the PC is actually a general purpose computer, which though what most of us have grown up with since the early 80's, was never the proper tool for the general consumer population.&nbsp; Instead, what was supposed to happen was that
 these PC devices would be used and&nbsp;reworked by engineers and technicians into simpler, more limited computing tools that employees or consumers would use to perform daily tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the fact that the PC was so capable and available, especially as early competition brought their cost down to reasonable levels, meant that most software developed quickly to use the PC itself as the platform for many applications, often simply
 hiding it in cupboards or back rooms where only technicians or knowledgeable employees required access.&nbsp; Over time though, the PC became more common in visible locations, as well as in the homes of those needing to perform certain management or other tasks
 from there as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's changed in the last dozen years or so is that people like Steve Jobs finally began to create tools like the first smartphone and others that were more suited not only for consumers, but anyone needing the ability to be more mobile to perform certain
 limited computing tasks in multiple locations at effective cost.&nbsp; So what the mobility trend finally did was to begin the conversion of the computer itself into more of a dedicated purpose tool that though more limited, was typically both easier to use and
 mobile as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The remaining set of general purpose tasks including banking, online shopping and general browsing or reading have often stayed with the PC, but even those are often more effectively done on other devices that are either more mobile like tablets or even
 less so like TVs with Internet capabilities.&nbsp; SO as people learn these options are available, the trend away from the PC is only increasing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why Microsoft along with others is concentrating their efforts in these areas, especially where consumers are concerned, since that's where they know they'll need to resolve the issues of security and education we're discussing here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's also why Microsoft is creating these lean versions based on Windows Core, starting with the Windows 10 S Mode and parallel products for business like Windows IoT, since these applications require smaller, simpler to use interfaces and devices that
 can either be very mobile or included as part of some other larger device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its here that Microsoft is working to simplify and harden the operating system, since along with&nbsp;often inherently simpler tasks, the consumer or lightly trained employees will often be involved with using them.&nbsp; So designing out not only the obvious risks
 of technological complexity and vulnerability inherent to the outdated legacy Windows general purpose computer design, but also the overhead this creates is obviously the best way to resolve most of these problems in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the education of the user, just like the early discussions of "computer literacy" are all really just concessions to the status quo of the time and as time and technology progresses, they're being designed out of future version of the products that people
 will be using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this means is that knowledge of Windows Defender, antivirus and&nbsp;antimalware applications and even these forums themselves are an endangered and short-lived set of tools, while the original Windows 10 that's been relatively quickly evolved into the Core
 and related products soon to be all that's available to most users on any new device.&nbsp; Thus eventually, the need for security tools not inherently included in the devices and again the forums here to support them will cease to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation is really already present and it's only the legacy devices that people are already using that require this outdated support at all.&nbsp; Until most of those end support over the next few years there'll continue to be some need, though as the decline
 in use of these forums has already shown that's declining fast as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So back to my original premise that the education of consumers on a wide scale will never happen, it's because it won't need to, since the archaic legacy Windows operating system, some of the devices it operated on and all of the vulnerabilities, security
 risks and related support required to deal with them will simply disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone still buying a PC today, or especially performing the "upgrade" to Windows 10 Pro is usually a fool, since virtually no one truly needs these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They simply haven't taken the proper time and effort in order to find the appropriate modern tool that replaces these, as I have been over the last few years investigating the best tablet device to replace my most used laptop device.&nbsp; In may case, the requirements
 are similar, but with plans to travel I wanted a device that was even smaller, lighter and more quickly able to be taken out or out away, so a tablet was obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes, there's still education to be done, but it has nothing to do with security applications, or complex technology, it's simply helping anyone make better choices of what device they choose next, Microsoft provided tool or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue of educating people about con artists, today called scammers, has really nothing to do with these forums.&nbsp; This just ends up here because the scammers are misusing Microsoft's and other technical industry names in their cons, so we've learned to
 accept that and answer the questions for people without either a good education, common sense or who simply have a feeble mind due to age or some other reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this was ever truly Microsoft's responsibility, but as a side effect of providing their products, they've had to deal with it, since unlike with a car, there's never been a standard usage&nbsp;test required by a certifying agency, regardless of how simplistic
 and easy even&nbsp;a driving test might be to pass.&nbsp; That's why it will never be resolved and also why Microsoft needs to make their future products simpler, more closed systems, since just like a car key, most users should never have a need to know anything more
 than how to turn on a device and punch the few buttons required to get what they want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scammers and fools will still exist and that problem will never end, it will eventually just become more obvious that it's the fool with the problem and not the technology.</p>

<p>True, in case of security assessments I always create learning agenda and for example asking people to report suspicious activities to helpdesk. It is not always happens in reality but we keep finding the blocking cause and improving process.</p>
<p>Windows also getting smarter and this is ongoing loop in helping people and fighting cybercriminals.</p>

<p>The advantage in a business situation&nbsp;is&nbsp;you've got a trapped audience and often the funding to perform real&nbsp;training, while with consumers it's only as requested (e.g.&nbsp;a forum&nbsp;post)&nbsp;and your window for holding their attention is very short, typically until
 the immediate issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So with the general consumer audience, the only true solution is to simplify and harden the device itself, which Windows 10 and it's offspring such as Windows Core and S are now doing&nbsp;relatively quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The delay for implementation though will be the next purchase cycle for each user or device, so the most important item of training to retain a customer for Microsoft is to help them understand why they should retain the Windows 10&nbsp;S that many, if not all&nbsp;devices
 now initially ship with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I realized when talking to that big box store salesman, though was that from their standpoint, it's better for them to convince the consumer to upgrade.&nbsp; Not necessarily because they'll make money off the upgrade itself, since they may not, but for
 all of the other trash like added AV, antimalware or other useless 3rd-party software they can sell them once they do upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only better for the consumer himself if they don't upgrade from 10 S, so the industry trend is that many still do, for whatever reason and for most it's an utterly foolish decision.&nbsp; Even for most small businesses it's unlikely they'd truly need the
 Pro version, unless they have some relatively obscure piece of software that won't work without it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A consumer using legacy Windows, whether 10 or not, is fundamentally only safe if they do absolutely everything right.&nbsp; The problem that technical people don't see is that's nearly impossible, since it takes years of experience and some technical acumen
 that most consumers simply don't have.&nbsp; The handful who actually make it here are really the rare&nbsp;exceptions, which is why training itself can never work.&nbsp; It's not necessarily that they can't be trained, it's that they simply won't be for whatever reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most simply give up and at best buy a new PC, which since they're likely to make the same mistakes as before, doesn't really solve a thing unless they happen to get Windows 10 S and somehow manage to avoid the upgrade.</p>

Suzanne's answer is better. <br />
<br />
Pre Office 97 formats as far back as WinWord 2 are supported but blocked by default in the Options, Trust Center.<br />
&lt;/edit&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, Office apps support files created in older versions. Currently you can open files that are created in Office 97-2003 formats. It sounds like your files may be older than that. Office apps no longer natively support files that old.<br />
<br />
IF that is the case, you will have to use an extra tool or addin to be able to read them. You will have to open them and then save them to newer file formats that current programs can handle. Here are links to addins and tools that may provide the access you
 need:<br />

    <title>Office365 on Windows 10 pro installing additional language packs takes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dschaareman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office365 on Windows 10 pro installing additional language packs takes too long</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Windows 10 pro and use MS Office 365/ 2016. I want to install additional language packs as I use multiple languages (English, Dutch, German and Indonesian). So I downloaded language packs for Dutch, German and Indonesian (64bit). I started with installing
 one language pack at a time, pops up the medium-sized orange-red box with the text "we're getting things ready". That box stays there on end. I started in the early evening, left the PC running over night and in the morning nothing had changed, still sitting
 on the screen. How come? My internet connection (LAN) is ok, speed-test indicated 100mbs for downloading and 25 for uploading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>Danker</p>

            Hi, dschaareman
<br />
<br />You're right, it should not take so long, try to repair the Office. Check this link, I hope you can solve the problem.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reluctant to run the repair option. I have done that in the past a couple of times, and, likewise, it didn't stop, it never succeeded. Worst of all, I had to end the process which caused Office not to run anymore, and I had to fully reinstall it.</p>

<h2>            Resetting hotmail password on Lumia 930</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Lumia 930 and have a Hotmail account set up on it. I changed the password on the account, but there is no way to change the hotmail password on the phone for the account. And I can't uninstall the account either. How can I change the password on
 the phone so that it goes back to working? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Go to Settings&gt;email + accounts. if the account says "Not up-to-date", tapping on it will prompt you to fix this problem, which in this case is changing the password.

            It is not giving me that prompt box to change the email password. My 920 would give me a prompt box, but the 930 doesn't. I can't uninstall it to reset the password that way, and when I try to sync it, it comes up with the Error Code 85002012. All I want
 to do is change the password on the hotmail account. Thanks

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Insider build &#40;10240&#41; won&#39;t activate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexanderalen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Insider build &#40;10240&#41; won&#39;t activate</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if somebody could help me with my problem. I am an Windows Insider from the beginning of the program, when the first build of Windows 10 was released I did a clean install of it, without upgrading from previous OS or anything like that, and since
 then I was receiving builds normally without any errors/issues or troubles, when I finally got the final build Windows 10 Pro (build 10240) everything</p>
<p>was fine then after July 29, somewhere in the first days of August I decided to do a clean install of the final Windows 10 Pro build (I have the ISO of Windows 10 build 10240 released for the insiders before July 29 and I have the Final ISO which I created
 using Media Creation Tool provided by Microsoft from July 29), so as I was saying, first I used the ISO which I created using Media Tool, I did a clean install, skipped the key entry and used my Insider account, after the installation was completed I noticed
 that my windows was not activated, so did a clean install using the ISO that was released to the Insiders before July 29, again skipped the key entry and used my Insider account and I still can't activate my Windows. I saw that the key that was pre-installed
 was ending with this: *****-3V66T and the error was saying that this key has been blocked by the server then I found another key, this one: W269N-WFGWX-YVC9B-4J6C9-T83GX that its suppose to be an Insider key or something, and with this key its says that DNS
 name does not exist and I'm getting an Error code: 0x8007232B. Can anyone tell me what can I do?
</p>
<p>Please note that I contacted support three times, the first time the Support Expert explained to me that due to many Windows 10 upgrades worldwide servers are overloaded etc etc and that they are looking into the issue as the number one priority, the others
 were just throwing me like a tennis ball from one support page to the other and that's why I'm here, because the last Support expert told me to post my issue here.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated, sorry for the long post and Thanks in advance.</p>

            MS says you must upgrade first that sets your account permanent then you can do a clean install. you may want to try and update from where &nbsp;you are now not a clean install-- maybe that might help-- you might want to go to settings --my account and some
 where in their they ask you to re-identify your identity for your MS account i have done this more than once during the program after TP clean installs.

            <p>Thanks for the reply Mik62, as I mentioned above I did upgrade and had the final build for some time after it was released and after the official worldwide&nbsp;release of Windows 10 I did a clean install. As for the re-identification, I cant seem to find where
 it is :/</p>

            Your key that ended in 3V66T is the generic key for Win 10 build 10240. So I would think that is the one you should have. You may just have to wait and see if it activates.

            Still no one? :/ well i guess internet ran out of ideas :p whatever happened and i can't activate my windows 10 copy seems to be little unfair, because Microsoft said that insiders will get a free copy of Windows 10, seems like no one is keeping their
 promises in this world, anyway. Might just buy Windows 10 from a retailer and be done with it. Thanks everyone. And THANKS for nothing Microsoft...

            <p>There are no keys that work for windows insiders other than the generic install key that you mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no free window 10&nbsp;gifted to&nbsp;insiders &amp; never will be.&nbsp; They will probably have a free key to next builds beyond the 10240.&nbsp;&nbsp; But right now
 there isn't even a insider key for 10525.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to have the real&nbsp;deal for a&nbsp;free win10 lifetime&nbsp;licensed machine is to install it as an upgrade to a qualified licensed/activated win7,&nbsp;8,&nbsp;8.1 version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am currently running Vista Ultimate 32-bit and Mobile Device Center 6.1. I recently had to reinstall Windows due to some Windows Explorer errors that I couldn't resolve. Before that I had no problems synching my Dell Axim X51v at home and work. Since reinstalling
 I get this error: <em>Synchronization cannot be started because you are not able to log on to the network and access information.Restart your desktop computer and synchronize again. If the problem persists, contact your network administrator.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done a lot of searches and can't find an effective answer. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the mobile software several times with the same results. If anyone has had similar problems with better results I'd appreciate hearing from you.</p>

<p>Please, specify the version of Outlook you're running?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, here's what you can do to fix your issue:</p>
<p>The culprit might be a file called Mapi32.dll. this file tells Outlook where to finds the files it needs during synchronization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try running Detect/repair under the help menu in Outlook. Make sure your device is disconnected and restart your pc after Detect/Repair is completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not work, search for the file Mapi32.dll. If you find one or several, rename it them to mapi32.old. Start Outlook and it will tell you that files are missing and if you want to replace them. Click Yes and let Windows Installer do the rest. Connect
 your device to sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps.</p>

<p><span>Hi Marta,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Thank you for raising this issue up to our concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there is no option to add additional GIF on the yammer network.<br />
</p>
<p>However you can search as many as GIF on Tenor, when you select the GIF in yammer you<br />
will get the search option on top "<span style="font-weight: bold"> Search for a GIF on Teno</span>r ".<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If you find my reply useful, I would appreciate if you can click it as helpful.<br />

    <title>Evaluation Build 10074 issues to Full Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothycosentino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Evaluation Build 10074 issues to Full Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping someone here can help me as I am at my wits end with this custom PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backstory- I Built my first PC in March and was given a copy of windows 7 from my father in law. I did not know at the time that it was a trial version of windows 7 enterprise. After the 30 days or so, the Operating System prompted me that my OS was not
 valid and that I needed to upgrade. I was directed by several people to join the insider program for a free copy of windows 10. I did just that, and everything went smoothly until last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I had an error pop up on my PC stating that the Operating System was not valid and that eventually my PC would not start anymore. I was quite busy at work this week, so I never had a chance to sit down and take a look at what the issue was. I finally
 contacted Tech Support because when I did try to upgrade to my free version of windows 10, I would get constant errors. After some time with tech support, we discovered that windows 7 enterprise is not eligible for the free windows 10 upgrade. I was told I
 would have to buy the full retail version of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yesterday I went out and purchased a copy of windows 10 Home. When I got home, my PC would not boot up, and would give me an error stating&nbsp;</p>
<p>RECOVERY</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PC/Device needs to be repaired</p>
<p>
</p><p>A component of your operating system has expired</p>
<p>
</p><p>File :\windows\system32\winload.ese&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>error code 0xc0000605</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I figured I would change my boot priority to boot the OS from the new flash drive I just purchased. After some prompts and entering the CD Key, I have an error pop up to the effect that windows is on the PC, and to upgrade from my desk top under settings.
 The problem is, I cannot get past the inital error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have any options here? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Just Updated to windows 10 to get an error message</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to windows 10 and now I've encountered a problem with the message I've attatched</p>
I'm not too good with tech and sometimes the screen stays black. I'm using a Toshiba Satellite C850-1KN which I know is more than capable of running windows 10. I'm more into hardware than software so if you can explain it as simply as possible please let me
 know. It's sad as I have waited all night just for windows 10 and now I can't use it.<br />

            <p><span>No. Windows&nbsp;8 comes with Windows Defender, which has been improved in Windows&nbsp;8 to provide the same level of malware protection as Microsoft Security
 Essentials.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You do not need to install Microsoft Security Essentials and it will not work with Windows 8. Microsoft will continue to provide and improve Microsoft Security Essentials for Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. If you are upgrading&nbsp;to
 Windows 8, you should uninstall Microsoft Security Essentials first. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For information on uninstalling Microsoft Security Essentials, see the following Knowledge Base article:

<h3> lavinashaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add email address to existing email account</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to add another email address to my account so that I essentially have 2 x inboxes and can read and respond to emails from either address whilst logged in. I already have an Outlook email account, and the new address which has already been created
 is not an Outlook or Hotmail account. It's a "dot.org" type address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions I was given originally told me to go to "Sync email" and then "connected accounts" and "other email accounts" which I did. I completed all the server information and once I clicked OK/Submit, it just went back to to the "sync email" settings
 screen. It did not indicate if I was successful or unsuccessful in adding the second email address. It does not display an email address under "manage your connected accounts" either. I attempted this a few times, even logging out and back in and nothing has
 worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I go about adding this email? I seem to be getting a road block each way I turn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Ron, I haven't personally, no. Because it was set up for me by a charity group and I'm just a volunteer so they sent me the email address, password, and server info. The other volunteers were able to set theirs up according to the steps in my post.
 I do currently have 2 emails attached to the account (my old email and new) and I remeber setting that up fine. Is there a limit to how many emails I can have attached to an account?&nbsp;

            Unfortunately, there is no upgrade available for your device an there are two reasons for that.<br />
<br />
1. Dell has stopped manufacturing the Axim pocket PC.<br />
<br />
2. Your device does not meet the minimum hardware requirements to support Windows Mobile 6.

<h2>            Log choices made from a drop down box &#40;Word or Excel&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help making my weekly planning document more intuitive....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table in Word and in the boxes I have used the developer tab to create drop down menus - I need to find a way to 'log' the choices selected.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f0bf815-7708-43bb-8b90-13928779f007?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f0bf815-7708-43bb-8b90-13928779f007?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Context: I'm a teacher in my literacy lessons I need to cover certain standards (these are what is in the drop down menu) now to take it to the next level I want to have somewhere (could be in word or excel) that logs of all the standards I selected with
 the date selected them on. The idea being that at the end of the year when I need to justify that pupil A has achieved standard "R.Oracy.5" I can go to the log and filter/search for&nbsp; "R.Oracy.5"&nbsp;and see a list of dates when we covered that standard and I can
 look in their books and easily find the evidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            <p>I found the solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem and I was freaking out because apparently nobody had the solution.</p>
<p>I wasn't able to open any apps (Office, Skype, etc.). The error message said "AppVlsvSubsystems32.dll is missing from your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to re-install Skype and it worked, so I thought to uninstall Office and all the programs that did not work. Than, I re-started the computer and I re-installed Office and the other programs. AND IT WORKED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it seems something too easy to be real but I was very worried when it happened to me and I wanted to share my experience in order to help other people in my same situation.</p>
<p>I hope it will work for you as well!</p>
