            Look at the link for burning CDs in Windows 8.&nbsp; The procedure is the same in Windows 10.<br />

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker&#59; the mysterious disappearing act&#33;</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings, All!&nbsp; Please bear with me, as this is my first attempt to post; not to even mention the brain damage&nbsp;trying to learn computers have caused!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an HP Vista Home Premium desktop that I have been trying to collect some utube clips together and make an entertaing video to share on standalone DVD player.&nbsp; I downloaded the .flv files to desktop, used FF Download Helper to convert them to .wmv,
 then imported to WinMovMkr.&nbsp; After constant hangs, glitches, and going through the motions of 6 failed burns, I saved the project and&nbsp; hunted for more info, what I was doing wrong.&nbsp; My next attempt, found that the files were missing, and running a search,
 found that Nero Scout had stolen them, and MM could not recognize nor import. &nbsp; Long story short, I uninstalled Nero.&nbsp;To my dismay,&nbsp;it took all the original 33 clips&nbsp;with it!&nbsp; Search revealed no video&nbsp;anywhere on HD.&nbsp;&nbsp; Totally stressed; shut down &amp; went to
 bed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This A.M.on startup, the folder of clips was sitting on desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AAAGHHHH!!!)&nbsp;&nbsp; I opened Muvee and Roxio, but was too frustrated to try to learn another (partly there trial) program.&nbsp;Seeings how the original files were back and the Scout index was gone,
 I thought to give WMM another shot.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unspecified Error! Program wouldn't open.&nbsp; Back online to hunt for answers; till I thought , maybe uninstall-reinstall MM.&nbsp; HA.&nbsp; Nowhere to be found!&nbsp; Then tried right clicking startup shortcut&nbsp;to reveal file location; one time was located in an ehome
 folder, the next time in program files.&nbsp; (repeatedly there, not there)&nbsp; Typing the exe file in run, only gives unspecified error.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I manually check updates and run scans daily&nbsp; (always say ok).&nbsp; Was going to download program from MS, but don't know which one, how, or if already have it hiding and shouldn't.&nbsp; Actually, I spent the majority of last year on my Gateway-Vista laptop trying
 to make movies with new Sony camcorder.&nbsp; Basically, same non productive results from studying WAY too technical stuff.&nbsp; I shut down both computers all winter, trying to get myself real again.&nbsp; Now having flashbacks.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realize you experienced users need&nbsp; more detail of computer specs, and will try to find and submit;&nbsp;but I am not experienced.&nbsp; Do you know what confused means?&nbsp; Since trying to learn on fouled up XP, it was replaced to Vista.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (I worked with the Sony
 software 6 mo. before finding that only part of the program was installed, and was incompatible with Vista!)&nbsp; This type illogical behavior totally confounds me, I learn nothing.&nbsp; So here's my question:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just&nbsp;HOW can you tell&nbsp;if problems come from stupid user errors, Vista incompatibilities, hidden settings, viruses trojans worms &nbsp;spies or hijacking, a bad update, etc., etc.?&nbsp; If one did not grow up with computers, and is not familiar with what's supposed
 to be there or not there; how would&nbsp;one know?&nbsp; Since my study, my screen never looks like the books, help files, or online discussions describe.&nbsp; Promises of what this very expensive equipment could do, has proved to be nothing but lies.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Easy?"&nbsp; "User Friendly?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;Nothing is consistant...WHY???<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone should take interest, I would like to sincerely express my gratitude in advance.&nbsp; I never used to think I was dumb, but now, all I want is some sort of logic to this delimma so I can get my life back?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank You All!<br />

            Thank you for your prompt reply and suggestion.&nbsp; I am sorry for my delay in response, but I have been very upset and busy over this matter.&nbsp; Movie Maker was not the only thing that has disappeared.&nbsp; ALL my personal files are GONE!!!<br />
<br />
I had called HP tech support with my delimma, who did a remote check of my system.&nbsp; They said I will have to reformat, and asked me what files I needed to backup.&nbsp; When I plugged in my external HD, it was empty; and the personal files were no where to be found
 on the system.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Needless to say; panic and dismay.&nbsp; I mistakenly believed those files on the usb HD were safe.<br />
I canceled HP tech service, and cried emergency to my guru friend, who is currently trying to recover them.<br />
I am trying to recover from the nightmare.<br />
<br />
For any possible hints for other users desperately chasing down elusive problems;&nbsp; it may be that Movie Maker in and of itself is not the problem, especially on Vista. &nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
First, (IF I recover!) I will be uninstalling all trial software.&nbsp; <br />
Next, I am hunting down and hounding Nero about installing Scout without option, stealing my Movie Maker files, and corrupting the MM program.<br />
Then SanDisk will wish they never forced their U3 software on my computer, that fouled up every usb port.<br />
<br />
Both Scout and U3 are indexing programs, taking over ALL media files, and can't be gotten rid of.&nbsp; Then Windows has it's index?&nbsp; I'm just a beginner, but this sounds illogical.&nbsp; No wonder the computer doesn't know what to do.<br />
<br />
This must have something to do with this insane problem, as finding out where to look for errors (I am never notified) in the event viewer, there are plus 22,000 errors, all are indexing.&nbsp; Also, that service pack 1, and 6 other updates was installed by Microsoft,
 that were not applicable to this system.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Woe is me!<br />
I never had a chance!<br />
<br />
Thank to all for the interest, and hope this may clue in someone more knowledgeable.&nbsp; I'll be taking a break from ever being able to make a movie; but will watch the forums to learn more.&nbsp; It does reassure me, that I'm not the only one and it ain't necessarily
 all my dumb fault!<br />
<br />
Thanks again, and good luck to everyone that just wants to make a home movie!<br />

<br />
I am sorry about all that you have been through. Hopefully your friend can get your computer back on track again. Just a word of caution, going forward be careful third party software out there. This is not a condemnation on any software.</span></p>
<p><span>Once
<span>&nbsp;</span>your PC is back, if you are still interested in making your movie, please come back to this forum and let us know how we can be of help to you on your project.</span></p>

            Thank you, David and Joseph!<br />
<br />
The third party software mentioned;<br />
<br />
Some were trial programs, preinstalled from manufacturer, such as Roxio and Muvee.<br />
Another, such as the Nero and Scout, was an OEM for a CD Burner I purchased.<br />
Also, the security U3 program on the USB SanDisk Flash drives.<br />
<br />
I thought others should be aware of these so-called legitimate programs (that one wouldn't guess to be a problem)<br />
as possibly the culprit running silently in the background and undermining the whole operating system, while you spend your life chasing wild geese over this problem and that!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Although I am far from being a techie, I can suggest others should regularly check the event viewer and (in Vista) the reliability monitor.&nbsp; Zero in on the repeated errors there first; it will save lots of time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I had seen the indexing errors caused by U3 and Scout, but was unable to fix.&nbsp; Now is too late for me, but sincerely hope this info may help someone else avoi such a disaster!<br />
<br />
OH! And by the way; DON'T DO AS I DID!&nbsp; You shouldn't rely on one backup!&nbsp; It wouldn't hurt you to make TWO!!!<br />

<h2>            Does &#34; Sysmain &#34;  Really improve performance &#63;</h2>
                    When I open my task manager I see some of the operations going on the top of the list&nbsp; like Antimalware service executable and some other services running in that I found some thing called " Sysmain" this service runs round the clock when I use my laptop
 so regarding this I searched on the web and I came to know that it runs in background and improves the system performance . And it always eat around 60 to 80 Mb of ram. I have a laptop with 4 GB of ram and I get abot 1.8 Gb free nd sometimes 2Gb is it okay
 for the system to have this much free ram&nbsp;

            Hi Legend
<br />
<br />The old Superfetch process was renamed to Sysmain a while back
<br />
<br />You can turn off that process if you wish, that will not affect the good running or performance of your PC
<br />
<br />Superfetch is part of the Indexing service for searching your hard drive fore files and was known in the past to use a lot of hard drive activity. 
<br />
<br />Honestly if it is only using 40MB - 60MB of RAM that is not really affecting your system performance, if it was using a huge percentage of Disk, the it would be worth disabling . . .

                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>I have a USB flash drive which I want to use DeviceIOControl API to send SCSI command 0x2A (write 10) to write 512 bytes (1 block) to the flash's block 0. But the function fails with error code 5 (access denied). The device's handle is opened using CreateFile
 function with Generic_Read &nbsp;and Generic_Write permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens only if the flash memory is formatted (FAT system file). If it doesn't have valid system file,&nbsp;DeviceIOControl executes sucessfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the problem and what should I do?</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>First I would suggest you to run the troubleshooter and check if this helps.<br />
For more information visit the following link:</div>

<div><strong>Method 2:</strong>To select a default printer<br />
<br />
a. Open <strong>Devices and Printers </strong>by clicking the<strong> Start </strong>
button.<br />
b. Right-click the <strong>printer</strong> you want to use, and then click <strong>
Set as default printer</strong>. (You'll see a check mark on the printer's icon signifying that it's now<br />
your default printer.)<br />

a. Open the <strong>Start </strong>menu and click on “<strong>Devices and Printers</strong>”. This will open a window with a list of the printers currently set up on your computer.<br />
Now click on the printer that you have under the "<strong>Printers and Faxes</strong>" icon.<br />
b. <strong>Double-click </strong>on the icon of the printer you want to change to online. A pop-up window detailing all current print jobs will open.<br />
c. Go to <strong>"Printer"</strong> in the menu bar of the pop-up window and uncheck "<strong>Use Printer Offline</strong>". This action will change the printer from offline to online.<br />

<h2>            Text missing from Windows 10 &#40;SOLVED&#41;</h2>
                    <p>OK, So there's a strange issue with text missing from explorer and system text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't get a screen shot, but, if you have seen this you know exactly what I am talking about.</p>
<p>It's hard to navigate or run scans since you can't see a damn thing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, after digging online and NOT finding a solution, this did the trick:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Window Key</p>
<p>type:&nbsp;Adjust ClearType text (or clear type)</p>
<p>uncheck the box!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn it back on if you like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else finds a solution, please add to the post!</p>

<h2>            How do I put my Xbox One in Standby Mode</h2>
                    
<p>I love my X-1! Everything works perfectly, and I am loving the voice commands. Unfortunately I don't see an option to put it in "sleep" or "standby" mode. It only gives me the option to turn it off completely, and unfortunately when I do that...saying "xbox
 on" doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<h3> hswatson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidentally Deleted Linked Windows 10 Device</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to install Windows 10 on a new laptop. My Windows 10 licence is linked to my Microsoft account and I thought I&nbsp;needed to remove the device in order to use the licence on a new device. As a result, I removed the old device both from my Microsoft
 account and my Microsoft Store account. Now when I attempted to activate Windows 10 on the new device, it told me no licence was linked to my Microsoft account. I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 and was therefore not provided with a product key. I
 wonder whether there is any way to recover my Windows 10 licence?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1, there was no license because it was activated though the chip in your old device. In order to activate your new PC, you can use the product key of your Window 8.1 if it came with one. If not, and it was preinstalled
 in your old device, this means that the Windows 10 license can only be used with that device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back should you need further help.</p>

<p>It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.<br />
<br />
If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />
<br />
If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />
<br />
If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />

                    <p>Windows 10 Update tries to download an ALREADY INSTALLED update (KB3081448). The result is that when trying to download KB3081448 it stays forever at 0%. I am stuck. I installed KB3081448 last August 28 and had a hard time with it. I had to search for answers
 and found one that worked. But maybe it broke some invariant that Windows Update relies on and thus causes my current issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ran dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth and it reported no issues with my image. But maybe the image number is what is wrong considering that KB3081448 is already installed.</p>

            <p>I am somewhat farther ahead but I am still having issues and I cannot decide if things are correct:</p>
<ol>
<li>Method 1 above seems specific to Windows 7 and 8, not to Windows 10 so I did not complete the procedure.</li><li>Method 2 is always failing me as I am unable to download the file... the download is always interrupted leaving a file fragment. In case I 'Resume' the download I get a page fault in an non-paged area with a nice blue screen and a subsequent reboot.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>On the other hand I just started Windows Update again and it no longer tries to download KB3081448; it seems to be trying to download KB3011455 (cumulative update for win 10) and KB 890830 (MSRT for Sept 2015), which looks right based on what my other computer
 got yesterday. However the download progress is stuck at 14% and the Details page shows that Windows Update is 'Waiting for download' on each update.</p>

            <p>The good news is I managed to get my device updated properly:-) More good news is that I was also able to download msert.exe and run it (no infections found; perhaps the download difficulty was due to an under-powered machine serving that file). Bad news,
 if one can say that, is that I didn't use method 1 to fix things. Instead i did this:</p>

    <title>Category Bug on Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrspattinson18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Category Bug on Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <div>Whereas in Outlook for example, we create GROUPs which is basically a list of addresses, so that we can just specify a group name in an outgoing mail and Outlook will expand it into a list of receiving email addresses.&nbsp; In Windows Live Mail, the feature
 disappeared, replaced by a thing called “Category” which is similar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is a bug with Category feature in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; Frequently Windows Live Mail fails to expand a category properly, resulting in a number of situations ranging from empty list - no email addresses – one or some of the address on the list.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
 errors are spotted, I would exit and then turn on Windows Live Mail again.&nbsp; Eventually it will work properly, but even then, it – category expansion - may work perfectly only for most but not all categories.</div>
                </div>

<div>There is a bug with Category feature in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span>There is a tried and tested procedure that avoids the fault with a few extra keystrokes:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>In the message compose window, click the <em>To... </em>button. A dialogue headed
<em>Send an Email </em>opens. </li><li>Select a category and then one of the <em>To</em>-&gt;, <em>Cc</em>-&gt; or <em>Bcc</em>-&gt; buttons; the category name will be displayed in the corresponding field.</li><li>Click on the "+" beside the category name.&nbsp; All the names in the category&nbsp;should be displayed in the entry field.</li><li>Click OK. The dialogue will close, returning focus to the message compose window with a fully-populated address list in the appropriate field.</li></ol>
<p>NB: the&nbsp;vital part of this process is the trip through the <em>Send an Email</em> dialogue.
</p>
<p>

            Hello TedWilson,
<br />
<br />My name is Brad and I am an Independent Advisor and I will do my best to assist you with the trouble you are having.
<br />
<br />You can resolve this a couple of ways, the best solution would be to download a free malware/adware scanner such as Malwarebytes and use it to run a scan of the system. After removing the problem software you can safely remove Malwarebytes and reboot your computer. The issue should be gone after that.
<br />A guided solution for this particular software infection was posted previously on the Forums and I think it will also be of help to you if you need something to follow along.
<br />Link to guide: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/all/how-can-i-safely-remove-searchmywaycom-from-my/f6b6c8c4-c9bf-43c2-ad5b-7200a091ea46">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Both answers listed are good ways of removing the infection that has taken over Chrome on your computer.
<br />
<br />Please let us know if you have any further questions or issues!
<br />
<br />Brad

<p><span>You will be able to revert back to the previous operating system only if you have
<strong>windows.old</strong> folder in <strong>C:</strong> drive and within 30 days of upgrading to Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you upgrade to Windows 10, the previous Windows files and folders are automatically stored in
<strong>C:\Windows.old</strong> folder. This folder is kept by Windows only for one month. After one month Windows 10 will automatically delete the folder. So you can restore previous Windows version only within one month after Windows 10 upgrade. Also if you
 run <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> in <strong>Windows 10</strong>, make sure to uncheck "<strong>Previous Windows installation(s)</strong>" option. If you don't uncheck it, Windows will delete all files and folders present in
<strong>C:\Windows.old</strong> folder and you'll be unable to rollback to previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Sony DR-BT50 Bluetooth Headphones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allenshortnacy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sony DR-BT50 Bluetooth Headphones</h2>
                    Not sure what's wrong as these headphones were still paired after my Vista upgrade. Handsfree seems to connect and all services are checked but nothing shows up in playback devices. When I try to connect under audio tab of bluetooth it tries for a second
 and bombs. I've tried to delete and re-install the device...all drivers load fine. I have a HP laptop with Broadcom and even tried getting their bluetooth update for Windows 7 but it fails on 'validate bluetooth device'. All other audio and bluetooth connections
 like mouse and Windows Mobile 6.5 phone are working fine since upgrade.

            Hi AllenShortnacy,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
"I have a HP laptop with Broadcom and even tried getting their bluetooth update for Windows 7 but it fails on 'validate bluetooth device'."<br />
You may have to download and install the updated driver from the manufacturers website to get the full functionality from the device.<br />
<br />
Are you using a dongle for the Bluetooth or are you using the built-in device for your laptop to connect to the headphones.<br />
If your using a dongle, you may have to disable the on-board Bluetooth in the BIOS.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">LXGYT, you made a small mistake with the Video and it kinda falls under false pretense. Dedicated Servers do not "get rid of" or eliminate Latency or what's referred to as "lag". It will reduce it but nothing will improve a Connection
 with another Player on the other side of the world.<br />
<br />
Short story,you still get Players that "lag" even on a Dedicated Server.</span></p>

<p>FYI these servers will not be used for multiplayer gaming. Developer servers are used for the multiplayer gaming side of things. There is one thing that everyone on here needs to be excited about. The first thing I thought of with 300,000 servers was cloud
 processing and it turns out my theory is correct. MS is using this huge network for cloud processing. They will be sending the Xbox One's background apps to be processed in the cloud. This would free up at least 95% in box resources to be used for the game.
 Even the PS4 won't be able to do that because all processing has to be in box. As the technology advances we will be seeing cloud graphics processing like a virtual machine does. This is huge for gaming because when that happens it will be like running two
 video game systems to support one game, which in turn will give us huge expansive games with amazing graphics. This is also the reason why MS was pushing no disc drives and always online. So the older the platform gets the more powerful it will become as more
 servers are added! X box One is going to be awesome! Here is a quote that proves everything I just said:</p>
<p>"As a developer I can start doing things like shifting latency insensitive things to the cloud. You may have a limited number of transistors in your house, but you have an unlimited number of transistors in the cloud As bandwidth improves, there is potential
 for actual game computations to be off-loaded to servers in the cloud, essentially allowing the Xbox One to become more powerful over time as more and more transistors are connected to Microsoft's cloud infrastructure." -Boyd Multerer</p>

<p>Yes i have realised that sorry, it does dramatically reduce lag though and is a much more fair online gaming environment, if you guys read the "Wired" exclusive X1 article, you will see that they do mention dedicated servers, more players online, bigger
 worlds, and more, enjoy</p>

<p>[/quote]<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Yes, yes they will. It's already been stated Dedicated Servers from or either both but not less than minimum from Microsoft will be used for every Xbox One Game. I'm not doing your homework for you.<br />
<br />
There will not be any Host/ Client Games via Xbox One. There will be at least minimum MS Servers for each and every Game.<br />

                    I'm trying to install Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 on&nbsp;a replacement HDD in a Samsung Q1 Tablet using the supplied Samsung Recovery Media disc. The usb keyboard works OK at BIOS and USB Legacy Support is enabled in BIOS; however the keyboard stops
 functioning at the Windows Setup stage when being prompted to install windows or create/delete partition, and I am unable to proceed further as there is no touchscreen option. Does anyone know how to correct this?

            <p>I am pleased to report that I was able to sort out the problem by trial an error; and the answer for anyone else encountering the same problem with a Samsung Q1 tablet is as follows:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>DON'T USE THE DEDICATED SAMSUNG KEYBOARD AA-SK0TKBD/UK WHEN TRYING TO RESTORE THE O/S ON A SAMSUNG Q1 NP-Q1-V000/SUK, AS IT IS SEEN AS A 'HUMAN INTERFACE DEVICE' AND THE USB KEYBOARD DRIVER DOESN'T RECOGNISE IT. INSTEAD YOU SHOULD USE A STANDARD USB KEYBOARD
 ALTERNATING IT WITH A STANDARD USB MOUSE VIA THE RIGHT HAND USB PORT WHEN REQUIRED TO DO SO. AFTER THE INSTALLATION OF THE O/S THE SAMSUNG KEYBOARD WITH ITS' INTEGRAL JOYSTICK MOUSE IS THEN RECOGNISED.</p>

<p>Which version were you using? Are your project files in .mswmm format? If so, reload
<a href="https://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they were in .wlmp format, reload Movie Maker 2012. Look in these forums for other posts that give a link to that version.</p>

<h2>            Xbox App capture feature doesn&#39;t work properly for Fortnite.</h2>
                    <p>For the past month or 2 I've been getting better at Fortnite on PC and have been using Xbox capture to save my clips but when I go to view them all it shows is the thumbnail and plays the audio but there's no video. I also play Forza Horizon 3 and Black Squad and I've used Xbox capture on those games and it works perfectly fine, it's just Fortnite (not surprising) would really appreciate if you could take a look at what's happening as some of my Fortnite clips are so good that I'll never hit those shots ever again..</p>
