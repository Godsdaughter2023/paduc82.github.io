    <title>Cannot change skype status on ipad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fraukeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot change skype status on ipad</h2>
                    <p>I cannot set my Skype profile to active on my ipad. Normally, I would see my own profile picture on top of the "chats" tab. When I clicked on it, I could change my status. However, for some reason I cannot see that icon with my profile picture on any of
 the tabs anymore. On my chats tab I also see only one of my contacts. I checked for an update for the app, but there was no new one. Would you know what's wrong? Thanks in advance!</p>

            a. Uninstall the Skype app by pressing and holding the Skype app icon. Tap the 'X' in the corner and then accept the confirmation message to delete it.
<br />
<br />b. Perform a “soft reset” by pressing and holding both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously for at least 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo. You can let go of both buttons after the Apple logo appears.
<br />
<br />c. Reinstall the iPad app from the App Store.

    <title>Send and receive in Outlook 2007 is very slow and freezes other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deb568  say:</h3>
<h2>            Send and receive in Outlook 2007 is very slow and freezes other programs on my computer. How do I fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was previously using Outlook express, and when the send/receive function ran (from blueyonder, pop3) it was always very quick and didn't interfere with any other program running on the computer.</p>
<p>Recently I upgraded some parts on the computer (operating system is XP), so decided to run Microsoft Outlook 2007 instead of express, mainly because of the archiving function.</p>
<p>Now though, the send and receive function is incredibly slow - 37 minutes for 63 items coming into the inbox - and worse still, it causes all the other programs open at the same time, including internet browsers, to freeze/work only intermittently.</p>
<p>I have turned off the addins, including the search indexer but this action has had no impact on the speed of the receive function.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how I can fix this? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the detailed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted install file is a possible cause of the issue. We suggest launching Excel in Safe Mode to isolate the issue. This procedure will start Office apps with the add-ins and extensions disabled. To run
<strong>Excel</strong> in Safe Mode, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close <strong>Excel</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> to launch
<strong>Run</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Run</strong> window, type <strong>excel /safe</strong>, and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue continues, we advise repairing Office 2016. Kindly refer to the steps outlined in this

<h2>            Do you use slack or lag... or maybe both in your projects&#63;</h2>
                    Hi folks,
<div>I've (often enough) made the mistake of scheduling task successor tasks right on the tail end of their predecessor tasks, and I'm trying to decide whether I should add lag between the tasks, or if I should rather work with slack. With which technique have
 you had the best results?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm considering adding lag as a percentage (+20%) of the predecessor. This however has a disadvantage: the slack is by definition 0.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not really sure how to work with slack, and I'd appreciate any assistance on understanding how to use slack, and what the advantages/disadvantages of each method are.</div>

            <p>Slack is calculated only. You can change lag, but not slack.</p>
<p>You only need to add lag if a resource can't start the next task immediately. Where a resource is working only 50% on your project, set the units to 50% and then no need for lag. However order equipment does have a lag before receive equipment happens.</p>

            Hi Rod,
<div><br />
<div>thanks for the response. I do understand that slack is not directly added to a project, and is actually a result of how various tasks are scheduled.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&gt; set the units to 50% and then no need for lag...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't see any correlation between the percent allocation and the need for lag. If a resource can only work 4 hours a day on a task and the task requires 24 hours of work, then setting the percent allocation will simply cause the planned duration to be
 6 working days rather than 3 working days. That doesn't actually add any "buffer" between that task and its successor.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you schedule tasks so that a certain amount of slack is "created", or do you add lag in order to have more buffer?</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Pug,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm curious as to why you think that&nbsp; "scheduling task successor tasks right on the tail end of their predecessor tasks" is a mistake. The implication is that your task durations have been too optimistic. If your average error is 20%, why don't you schedule
 your tasks to take longer with lower effort per day - e.g. follow Rod's advice on changing resource usage?&nbsp; If you do that, you can use slack to decide which tasks are likely to cause you to be even later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have often seen is that people working on the project look at the Gantt chart and assume that they don't have to finish until that date. What you might want to do is to revert to the "old" PERT method where you create three schedules based on optimistic,
 pessimistic and likely durations. Publish the likely one to your staff,&nbsp;try to get your staff to deliver on the optimistic one, &nbsp;and publish the pessimistic one to your client. Glen Searle of PCubed made available the macro code for creating PERT plans. Sorry
 I don't have the link immediately available.</p>

            Norm,
<div>You're right when you point out that my scheduled task durations have been too optimistic. Part of the problem has been due to simply assuming that if an engineer says that he needs 8 hours to complete a task, then I should just schedule a full day. I
 didn't take into account that almost nobody can or will be 100% productive all day long. I've since reduced resource's effective time to 70-80%.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At the moment, I'm looking at different ways to either add buffer time, or to schedule in a way so that I have more slack to work with. Ideally I would be able to schedule tasks so that the risk of unavoidable delays and late task completions torpedoing
 the entire project schedule is minimized. How do you deal with it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I understand your suggestion regarding 3 different schedules, but the thought of having to maintain them makes my skin crawl.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've been cracking my head on Monte Carlo simulations for the last couple of days, and feel like I'm on to something very good and powerful. By entering a pessimistic, a realistic, and an optimistic duration value for each task, and then chasing the data
 through the simulator a couple of thousand times, I was able to determine that there was only a 30% probability of actually finishing the project on the date shown in MS Project. IF you're interested, Jack Dahlgren has some great information and macro code
 available (<a href="http://masamiki.com/project/blackjack.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://masamiki.com/project/blackjack.htm</a>).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do have to admit that I had to bone up on the care and feeding of Excel histograms, frequency tables and array functions first before I was able to do anything with the data provided by the Monte Carlo simulation.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even as I wrote you, my QC lead asked about running MC simulations on existing projects - so I had just&nbsp;downloaded Dahlgren's code. Thanks for the advice about the Excel studies - I'll get started there first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With PERT it's really not maintenance of the three separate projects - all of the versions are simply kept in different fields, i.e. Duration1, Duration2, etc. The actual values are the same for all sets of assumptions. The Searle code allows you to pick
 which tasks are included in the PERT set and the output tables compute probability and standard deviations. But, with three times the amount of information, it is certainly more work. You can view Searle's presentation, which was very well done, at this location:</p>

<div>If you're interested, I've already set up a .bas file with Dahlgren's code, formatted to make it bit easier to read. there's also an Excel template that will generate the histogram and the frequency distribution curve. Be glad to provide them to you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm still debating on how to deal with the information provided by the Monte Carlo simulation - our management has not been receptive to techniques such as simulations or even Earned Value Management; too abstract. And explaining to them that even though
 the Project Schedule shows a completion date, there may be only a 30% probability that that target date can be reached.</div>

<p>Hi Charlotte,</p>
<p>I have done some tests in both the Word 2016 for windows and Word 2016 for mac.<br />
In the Word 2016 for windows client, we can add the icon into the quick access bar. But in the latest version of Word for mac, it seems that there is no option to add this icon.<br />
So I’d like to confirm the version of Word for mac you are using. If the version is the latest, I suggest you submit feedback via the smile face at the upper right corner of the Word interface.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

Didn't think Outlook 2007 did that with IMAP? (2010 does AFAIK...)<br />

            IMAP accounts don't have a "Deleted Items" folder for Outlook 2007 and earlier.&nbsp; The IMAP protocol simply doesn't allow it.&nbsp; Even in Outlook 2010, the Deletd Items folder is simulated.&nbsp; The default folder view is "Hide Messages Marked for Deletion" so
 you don't see the messages with lines through them as you would if you were using tghe IMAP Messages view.

<p>Why? All that the delete command does is to MARK the email for deletion. It doesn't actually DELETE the email until you do a purge of the folder. Why do you need to put deleted emails into a deleted items folder?</p>
<p>You don't store emails in the deleted items folder. Do you??</p>

<h2>            Only one line in Calendar app Windows 10 Mobile on Lumia 950 in Week View</h2>
                    <p>Since the last update of the app there is only one line of appointments in every single day visible in the Calendar app from Windows 10 Mobile on Lumia 950 in week view. Very annoying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i swipe from the bottom up on the screen so the virtual buttons disappear, then because it creates space for the app the second and third line appear. Strange behavior!</p>

            I tried the clearing of Browser's Cache. didn't work. It worked for a while without clearing. Then problem started again. tried to clear it. didn't work.
<br />
<br />
I found out it has to deal with the Messenger. Whenever the messenger pop-up pop-ups with a person named Stephanie who I don't even know or in NOT even in my contact list- the some functions of Hotmail doesn't work. I tried to disable the messenger pop-up.
 I can't seem to find a way.<br />
<br />
I never even used MSN messenger before. And now this Stephanie wants to chat with me and messing up my Hotmail.&nbsp; The email they are using is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />
<br />
Please get her out of my life.<br />

    <title>Problem with MouseDown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> feelow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with MouseDown</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a column of text boxes on a form that are organized to pass the focus to another one in the same row as them when clicked on (no matter how strange that seems, even to me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub ctrlTX_MouseDown(ByVal Button As Integer, ByVal Shift As Integer, ByVal X As Single, ByVal Y As Single)</p>
<p>&nbsp; ' Code that sets the focus to another text box and make its name the current ActiveTx</p>
<p>&nbsp; Target.Controls(CallGet(ActiveTx_Stub) &amp; nmSufx).SetFocus<br />
&nbsp; Call CallLet(ActiveTx, CallGet(ActiveTx_Stub) &amp; nmSufx)<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>Note: "Target" is the frame containing the textboxes, "ActiveTx_Stub" represents the current active column on the form, "nmSufx" represents the row of the text box being clicked on and "CallLet" is a function within the class module that uses CallByName.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, everything seems to be functionning well (the other text box receives the focus and change its color appropriately), except one little detail: the textbox that was clicked on seems to keep scanning for mouse events, and no matter where I put my
 next click, it sets focus back on the original textbox that was clicked on the first time. Then things resume the way they should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So getting back to the original state seems to be a 2-click affair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody has any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everybody,</p>
<p>Feelow</p>

            <p>Okay, I tried to simplify my problem a bit and found something that people could build very quickly to figure out my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Userform, containing</p>
<p>3 TextBox objects named respectively "TextBox1", "TextBox2" &amp; "TextBox3"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following code in it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>' Code begins here</p>
<p>Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()</p>
<p>&nbsp; Dim i As Integer</p>
<p>&nbsp; For i = 1 To 3: Me.Controls("TextBox" &amp; i).Text = i: Next i</p>
<p>&nbsp; Me.TextBox3.SetFocus</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>Private Sub TextBox1_MouseDown(ByVal Button As Integer, ByVal Shift As Integer, ByVal X As Single, ByVal Y As Single)</p>
<p>&nbsp; TextBox2.SetFocus</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
' Code ends here</p>
<p>
</p><p>Showing the userform, it fills the text boxes with their numbers (so we know which one is which), then sets the focus on TextBox3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on TextBox1 should give focus to TextBox2. Go ahead and do it. Works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT then, the next click, on any of the three boxes, or on the form, or even anywhere on the screen, even if not on the Excel application window, will send the focus back to TextBox1...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I'm lost at trying to go around this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everybody,</p>
<p>Feelow</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the slightest idea about what is causing that but you can cure it by using MouseUp instead of MouseDown</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your input Mike. MouseUp is indeed a workaround, but I don't like it as much as MouseDown, since it's not as instantaneous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could be a temporary solution for sure, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, I suspect the problem could occur when the mouse button(s) is/are being released, but I couldn't think of any mean to test the validity of the hypothesis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, good to have feedback from a trustworthy source like you. Thanks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can come up with a code in MouseDown that would solve the problem, I'm still a taker.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm of the opinion that this is a bug. If we use mousedown and put a STOP command in the code we can establish that the code isn't called by any subsequent clicks so it seems that it's the execution of the code one-time that causes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intrigued by this I too did some Googling and can find many references that allude to this but none that actually state it's a bug of any kind. Oddly if you put the STOP command in the code and click in textbox 1 then the code executes, textbox2 gets the
 focus&nbsp;and the code&nbsp;halts at the stop. If you then tap F5 in VB editor to continue then clicking anywhere on the userform does not make it select textbox1 again and it behaves as you would expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Private Sub TextBox1_MouseDown(ByVal Button As Integer, ByVal Shift As Integer, ByVal X As Single, ByVal Y As Single)</p>
<p>&nbsp; TextBox2.SetFocus</p>
<p>stop</p>
<p>End Sub</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying with a break point in the MouseDown and could not recreate the strange behaviour I was observing, and it only added to my initial confusion. I eventually stopped thinking about it, but with your comment, it came back to me and you did shed some
 light on what was then happening. The breakpoint was probably resetting something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just while I was typing, it sort of came back to me that there is a command called Wait, which could be useful. I am not overly familiar with it, but I think I'll go check it out, see if it could bring up a solution. (——&gt; EDIT: Not working. &lt;——)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your interest and your useful inputs!</p>

<p>I already tried with&nbsp;WAIT and with a very small for x=1 to 2 :next loop and they didn't work for me either.</p>

            <p>No AfterUpdate in class modules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I guess I'm getting used to MouseUp, even though I didn't intend it in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made various ClassModules implementing an interface for dealing with grids of text boxes, and I am just too lazy to change one of my columns to labels, for which I don't have any interface built yet, and was hoping not to have to do it. So I just made
 that information column as unselectable text boxes, the unselectability being delt with through MouseDown events (MouseUp for now...).</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Synching emails non-stop from Gmail account</h2>
                    How do I stop my Outlook 2016 from trying to upload 84,530 old emails from my gmail account? &nbsp;I go to the Sync Status in Outlook and it won't let me stop the uploads. &nbsp;I have deleted these emails from my Gmail account so not sure where these files are
 now coming from but the status shows my gmail account "Trash" folder, which I have emptied completely. &nbsp;This process is draining my computer and memory and I can't stop it unless I remove Outlook or don't use outlook. &nbsp;Any new updates or solutions out there?
 &nbsp;Very frustrating.&nbsp;

            Hello my name is Yohandi
<br />
<br />It is a pleasure to have your participation in the Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />This usually happens when the user's mailbox contains a lot of information and Outlook tries to synchronize all the information, but this as you say takes a long time depending on the number of elements to be synchronized.
<br />Here I recommend you to change the time from cache to outlook to a shorter time, that is if it is for all the time because you set it for 6 months, but if you are a person who receives many mail it would be convenient to put it to 3 months.
<br />
<br />How to change the Outlook cache time:
<br />1- Start Outlook&gt; go to File
<br />2- Info&gt; Account Setting&gt; Account Setting
<br />3- In the new window select the account&gt; Change
<br />4- Set the desired time by moving the bar&gt; Next
<br />5- Close the Outlook application and restart it.
<br />
<br />Another solution would be as you comment delete the oldest emails from Gmail or those that do not need.
<br />
<br />I wish you an excellent day! ;)
<br />
<br />I hope it works for you<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7129dfa1-9d71-4d72-bd07-853f6b8d1f42?upload=true" />

            If the messages were deleted, i would rename the gmail data file (its at %localappdata%\microsoft\outlook) and let outlook resync it. 
<br />
<br />If you have calendar and contacts in folders labeled 'this computer only' you'll need to export them to a pst before renaming the ost.

<p>It seems you are using a different version of Outlook. &nbsp;2016 when you go to file it doesn't have info &gt; account setting under that category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to suggest this in the Cache, I will locate this and adjust accordingly to see if this works.</p>

            Hi Brian
<br />
<br />You can try another way to set the cache in Outlook.
<br />
<br />1- Control Panel
<br />2- Mail (Microsoft Outlook 2016)
<br />3- Show Profile&gt; Select account.
<br />4- Properties&gt; Email Accounts anthen&gt; Change
<br />5- Set the desired time by moving the bar&gt; Next
<br />6- Close the Outlook application and restart it.
<br />
<br />I wish you an excellent day! ;) 
<br />
<br />I hope it works for you

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure this answers the original question as the problem didn't appear to be the amount of data being synced but rather that the synced seemed to never stop.</p>
<p>In any case, you really don't need to close the profile and start a new one. That's a real pain that forces you to read all accounts in the new profile, recreate all rules, export local data from the old profiles and reimport it all in the new one… A massive
 headache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All you'd have to do would be to delete the Gmail account from the current profile and re-add it with the new settings.</p>
<p>In this case, I'd be tempted to use that approach too (after making sure Outlook is perfectly up to date in at least version 16.13.1). There might be something wrong with the configuration of the account.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 on &#40;and off&#41; the Lumia 1020 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eepotter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 on &#40;and off&#41; the Lumia 1020</h2>
                    <p>I have to give up on Windows 10 for my Lumia 1020 for now; I'm currently downgrading it back to Windows 8. I installed it a week or so after I did the upgrade on my laptop;&nbsp;the Tech Preview&nbsp;has&nbsp;been nearly&nbsp;flawless there so I felt pretty safe upgrading the
 phone.&nbsp; I've submitted a lot of feedback using the Insider tool, but of course there's never any indication of what happens to that feedback.&nbsp; I don't know if my experience was soured by&nbsp;something I was doing wrong; clearly other people are having better experiences.&nbsp;
 For the record:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The interface was smooth and responsive. The transparent Start screen was neat, though I'm not sure that I like it better than the 8.1 screen.</p>
<p>- The action center is awesome! Replying to texts up there is an amazing&nbsp;feature.</p>
<p>- The new Settings layout is way nicer, though I wasn't always sure how things were categorized.&nbsp; I ended up searching a lot.</p>
<p>- I loved the new keyboard, huge improvement over 8.1.&nbsp; The little nub is a great feature.</p>
<p>- I wished the OS made better use of swipe gestures.&nbsp; There were little beginnings of&nbsp;swipeiness (?)&nbsp;in Outlook.</p>
<p>- The messaging app worked really well for me, very smooth and reliable.</p>
<p>- Battery life was great, unless the Start menu bug killed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looked&nbsp;great and I really wanted it to work, but.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Several of the apps I used on a daily basis wouldn't run or ran poorly. Some got updated.&nbsp;Most haven't yet.</p>
<p>- Configuration options disappeared for several important things, like the Glance screen.&nbsp; I missed Glance screen configuration the most; I keep the phone next to the bed at night and had to start flipping it upside down because the clock was lighting up
 the room. Other configuration utilities would start but then instantly crash; others had weird color glitches (e.g. lock screen configuration) where the text and background would suddenly become almost identical shades of grey, making configuration really
 difficult.</p>
<p>- The new Outlook apps had critical bugs (e.g. I can't add any IMAP accounts) and, in my opinion, were steps down from the wonderfully useful and solid Mail and Calendar apps of 8.1.&nbsp; Start tiles were not transparent, and the excellent status from the 8.1
 tiles was gone.&nbsp; I could never get the calendar to show me anything other than a scrolling list of upcoming events. I feel like there was almost definitely a way to show a week view like the 8.1 app, but I never found it.</p>
<p>- Lots of random crashes and reboots.&nbsp; Lots.</p>
<p>- Most critically: every couple of days, the Start screen would decide to stop working, rendering the phone almost completely useless.&nbsp; Can answer phone calls but can't make any.&nbsp; Can't start apps.&nbsp; Can respond to text messages that come in by using the
 notification bar (awesome feature btw) but couldn't launch the app to send new ones.&nbsp; Instead I just get "Loading ..." as the phone converted chemical energy from the battery to heat.&nbsp; Nothing short of a factory reset ever fixed this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I would have put&nbsp;up with all of that; it is a tech preview after all.&nbsp; But with it I expected a constant dribble of updates, fixes, patches,&nbsp;workarounds,&nbsp;and feedback from the insider tool&nbsp;- and got none.&nbsp; The Insider tool showed me that many other
 people had the problems I did, but it never indicated progress - it was a one-way forum for people to complain, like graffiti on a large brick wall.&nbsp; The tool was unintuitive enough that many people clearly submitted posts without understanding that the one-line
 box they started typing in, which (to me, at first) seemed like a title bar, was actually their post.&nbsp; Every once in a while an app would get updated, but I never saw any actual changes in behavior.&nbsp; Several times I got a notification that the phone would
 reboot at 3am to apply updates, but never saw any evidence that the phone actually rebooted, or updated anything.&nbsp; If there were signs of progress, I would slog through this.&nbsp; I was genuinely excited to install the tech preview on my phone, and confident after
 my experience on my laptop.&nbsp;But I can't wait a month for the next preview build in the hopes that it fixes some of the critical bugs.&nbsp; I need to see progress.&nbsp; Right now, all I see is that the Windows 10 team has a lot of work to do on the phone side before
 July 29th.&nbsp; I'd love to help out by trying the product and providing feedback, but need to feel that progress is happening. Maybe when the next build comes out.&nbsp;I'll be watching this space.</p>

            <p>Just to add my 2 cents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 1020 too (AT&amp;T).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its slow and buggy.&nbsp; Everything is slow; it appears that everything needs to perform some sort of network connection before executing what it is supposed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone locks up at least daily.&nbsp; Requiring the soft reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My battery drain is ridiculously bad.&nbsp; It appears to be some sort of bug related to something the phone apps (Camera, Search, Messaging, or Phone).&nbsp; I routinely close the apps I open now to&nbsp;reduce the battery drain rate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search / Cortana isn't fully integrated into the phone functions yet.&nbsp; For example if I tell Cortana to call the Library in my town, it can find the library and when I press call, it launches the phone app, but doesn't call.&nbsp; Its like the phone app wants
 to add it to a contact and then I have to press call again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot revert back to 8.1 as my phone isn't recognized by either of my computers using the latest version of the recovery tool, so I appear to be stuck on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully it improves, but it seems like there is much work to do before it is ready for a real production launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scott.</p>

            <p>Hi Scott, has&nbsp;anything improved for you in the last couple of weeks?&nbsp; I'm semi-excited about the release of build 10130 for Phone, but the list of fixed issues that I've seen is pretty short, and makes no mention of anything mentioned here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a more complete list of what's been fixed here?&nbsp; I'd jump right on this upgrade if I knew it wasn't going to make my phone unreliable for a week until I downgrade again.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Well I got all excited about the new build and did the upgrade (10.0.10136.0).&nbsp; It looks pretty, as before.&nbsp; Things I've noticed so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The upgrade took a LONG time.&nbsp; ~2 hours, maybe more.&nbsp; I didn't notice the 15 minute blank screen that I was warned about, but I wasn't necessarily watching the whole time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I was already running 8.1, after&nbsp;my poor experience&nbsp;with the previous build, so it was completely set up with apps, accounts, logins, etc.&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised how much of that carried over.&nbsp; Most, if not all, of my pinned start menu items stayed
 in place. My background image was replaced with some stock image, but that was easily fixed. It didn't automatically connect to my Wi-Fi network at home, but it remembered the login information so I was able to connect no problem.&nbsp; (aside: I don't really like
 the new Wi-Fi toggle in the pull-down menu - which was apparently widely requested - so ... eh.&nbsp; I preferred getting to the screen where I can see what networks there are.&nbsp; Ah well.&nbsp;&nbsp;It all seems to be working, at least.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I resisted doing a factory reset before/after the upgrade partly because I'm lazy and don't want to, and partly because of all the noise made about improving the upgrade process.&nbsp; Since presumably most users aren't going to be expected to do a factory reset
 of their phone, I want to see how this goes.&nbsp; It's OK, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. A few 3rd party apps that weren't working on the last build are working now (Buckstar, yay!).&nbsp; A few that I recall working before are now broken (no TaskCrunch or Aeries, boo!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The feedback app still sucks.&nbsp; It's really, really, really slow at searching as you type and there's not a clean way of hiding the keyboard.&nbsp; I would leave a lot more feedback if the tool was easier to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose not having a clean way of hiding the keyboard is a global thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Holy **** everything is slow.&nbsp; Based on past experience, a hard reset may help this, but maybe only temporarily.&nbsp; If lots of things are open the phone is unusably slow.&nbsp; If everything has been forced to quit, the phone is merely annoyingly slow.&nbsp; Every
 tap leads to a 1-2 second wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I ignored a phone call earlier today and the missed phone call reminder on the glance screen is still there.&nbsp; I can't figure out how to get rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Speaking of the phone, there are now two phone icons.&nbsp; I think it's a known issue that sometimes there can be two icons but what's annoying is that they're identical, but only one of them works.&nbsp; One is pinned to the start screen but it's the wrong one.&nbsp;
 I haven't bothered to change it because it's such a slow ordeal.&nbsp; The one that's pinned says "Phone off" which I suppose may be technically true if you consider "off" to mean "not currently making a phone call" but when I see it I make a quick glance to the
 corner to make sure I'm not in Airplane mode or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Speaking of the corner of the screen, the little mouse cursor that sometimes appeared is gone.&nbsp; While that's definitely a noticeable bit of progress, I feel like it was generally harmless and maybe people could have focused on some of the other problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. I'm kind of freaking out about the Start screen lag.&nbsp; In the last build,&nbsp;as time&nbsp;went by over a couple of days when the Start screen was supposed to&nbsp;be displayed, I would see a "Loading..." screen for increasing amounts of time until it just stayed there
 indefinitely and I did a factory reset.&nbsp; Now, as far as I can tell, the wait appears to have plateaued at 1-2 seconds, sometimes 3-4 (depending on what's opened) but I've pretty much decided that there is only one&nbsp;hard reset&nbsp;before I revert back to 8.1.&nbsp; This
 is my primary phone and I'm willing to put up with some things, but I've also got an actual job and can't spend a few hours a day resetting the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. Outlook Mail and Outlook Calendar have improved a bit but are still not as nice as the Mail and Calendar apps they replaced.&nbsp; I can now have IMAP accounts (I was going to say "I can now add IMAP accounts" but I didn't add anything, that info was carried
 over during the upgrade) but if I start the mail app and then switch to one of my IMAP accounts, I can no longer view any other account until I force quit the app and start it again.&nbsp; If I rotate the screen to landscape, I can't rotate it back to portrait
 without forcing the app to quit.&nbsp; I can't see mail status on the glance screen.&nbsp; It doesn't show up on the list of options for quick or detailed status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calendar still doesn't show me the nice week view that the old Calendar app did.&nbsp; It's also a white theme, which is jarring and annoying.&nbsp; I have an OLED screen and generally prefer dark themes anyway, so the couple of things that are bright white are both
 blinding and detrimental to battery life.&nbsp; I used to have Calendar be my detailed status on the glance screen, but now it doesn't show up on that list.&nbsp; It does show up in the quick status list.&nbsp; Periodically the phone's status bar (with cell connectivity,
 clock, etc) stomps on the top of the Calendar UI and hides things like the top of the hamburger menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11. Speaking of OLED,&nbsp;one of the neat things about&nbsp;the glance screen is that it's not a battery killer because you're only powering the pixels that are required, and the rest of the screen is completely black.&nbsp; This was one of the really exceptional things
 that came out of Nokia, but on this phone it's always been a bit weird because the rest of the screen doesn't shut off completely; the dark pixels are at some very low brightness instead of being off completely which makes it look more like a 5-year-old LCD
 when the room is dark.&nbsp; I don't know if this is a Nokia thing or a Windows Phone thing but it's definitely weird so I'm just going to bring it up now.&nbsp; It was like this under 8.1 also, so #11 here is probably a waste of bandwidth overall.&nbsp; Sorry :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. The "change lens" option on the camera app isn't there anymore.&nbsp; I miss that, it was handy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>13. There's a tiny horse next to the clock on my lock screen.&nbsp; Not the glance screen, just the lock screen.&nbsp; Don't know why.&nbsp; It creeps me out a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>14. As far as I can tell, all of the Settings selections work!&nbsp; This is a huge improvement over the last build, where only about half of them did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>15. I can change the phone ring tone, but not the message tone.&nbsp; I miss this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>16. Third party apps that show status on the glance screen don't seem to work reliably.&nbsp; I have one that shows battery level (a flashlight app) and the battery level icon is there on the glance screen, but it only updates if I actually run the app.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>17. Outlook Mail won't show status on the glance screen.&nbsp; Outlook Calendar claims it will show quick status, but not detailed status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>18. Battery life is not quite as good as it was with 8.1.&nbsp; It still lasts the day, but just barely.&nbsp; I could get nearly 2 days on a charge with 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>19. I don't feel like I'm always getting audio notifications for text messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>20. Speaking of text messages, I had a wide tile for Messages so I could see previews when I unlock the phone.&nbsp; At some point in the day, the wide tile moved to the bottom of the screen and became a half-wide tile.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; Other tiles seem to be staying
 put.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like there's probably more, but I guess this is a start.&nbsp; I've got the preview on my laptop and my phone, and I definitely feel better about the laptop.&nbsp; I would have put more of this as feedback in the phone's feedback tool, but I hate&nbsp;the phone's
 feedback tool&nbsp;so I've done this instead.&nbsp; Phone crew has done some excellent work but y'all still need to step up&nbsp;your game, yo.</p>

            <p>I'm stuck on 10080 as I can't get my phone to communicate with my PC's, so the WPRT will not function to revert back to 8.1 to either stay there or upgrade back to 10136.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I am stuck.&nbsp; I chatted with Microsoft Mobile tech support the other day with the hope that they may have some enlightenment, but as I suspected, they were pretty clueless - I am sure they have people that know things, but not the people I was interacting
 with.&nbsp; They suggested I send my phone back for repair, but I asked how I define the problem to the repair team as I am running a non-production release OS on it and they didn't give me much help after that.</p>

            <p>I'm currently running build 10149 on my 1020, which (as far as I can tell) is the latest build released on the fast ring (it was released June 25th, and pushed out to the slow ring today).&nbsp; Since 10149 was released on the fast ring, there have been three
 builds released on the PC fast ring.&nbsp; I say this only as a point of reference because fixes to problems on phones, even for apps,&nbsp;come painfully slowly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my experience with this build, on my Lumia 1020:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;Several apps that worked well on Windows 8.1 are broken in this build of Windows 10.&nbsp; Most notably for me, WinKee (the only KeePass client I found for Windows 8.x that supports password+keyfile access) won't give up my passwords, and Aeries (a really
 nice Twitter client) doesn't launch.&nbsp; A few other apps&nbsp;that I use broke and were fixed by their authors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;The phone is more sluggish running Windows 10 than it was running Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp;Battery life is shorter with Windows 10 compared with 8.&nbsp; It seems that the base power consumption has gone up, but also periodically something will run away and the phone will suddenly become uncomfortably hot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Related to #3, the phone seems more inclined to go off and do things without my asking. A feature was added to Cortana that allows it to be launched even while the phone is locked; this can be disabled but it was enabled by default, which led to a lot
 of pocket dialing, launching of bunches of apps, and so on.&nbsp; Certain types of messages also seem to wake the phone up while it's in my pocket.&nbsp; Once the phone is awake, it does all sorts of things.&nbsp; Sometimes while I'm talking on the phone, background apps
 will switch to the foreground and start doing things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) You'll want to track down Lumia Camera to get better access to the 1020's camera features.&nbsp; They're making it hard; it doesn't show up in searches with the new store, and functionality in the old store is slowly breaking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) The new store is broken in important ways.&nbsp; This wasn't important up through the last build because the old store is also installed.&nbsp; However in this latest build, the old store is starting to break so you're forced to use the new one, which isn't quite
 ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) The mail/calendar apps have been replaced with Outlook-branded ones that are very immature and not nearly as reliable.&nbsp; I have a lot of trouble sending mail, and if you have multiple mailboxes the combined inbox is gone, and so are the individual account
 live tiles, so switching between accounts is cumbersome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are my biggest gripes.&nbsp; I'd say that this is the first Tech Preview build that's reasonably useful on the 1020, but it still has a long way to go before it's as good as Windows 8.1 was.&nbsp; One other note: you'll have to do a factory reset of your phone.&nbsp;
 The upgrade will appear to work fine from your running system, but it will be unusably unreliable until you wipe everything and install from scratch (don't even use your backed up settings).&nbsp; Presumably this will get fixed at some point, but it's not yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're patient and forgiving, I'd say give it a go.&nbsp;If you're easily aggravated, or if you&nbsp;really need your phone to just work all the time, I'd say wait.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 is still a better OS on the Lumia 1020.</p>

    <title>Fail when setting up new account using external email address&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> win10nuc2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fail when setting up new account using external email address&#58; must use an &#64;outlook.com address</h2>
                    <p>I've started this as a separate thread to highlight the&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an account is set up using an external email address (i.e. not @outlook.com) then the Outlook.com Mail setup fails when it tries to set the region and timezone. It is then necessary to create an @outlook.com alias, make that the primary, logoff, logon
 to the alias in an InPrivate session, and then the region/timezone can be set. The original address can then be reset as primary.&nbsp;This was explained by
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e5bf4e02-0259-4bae-b8da-f78921f3f85c" title="John_E_M">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">John_E_M</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(of MSFT) as the workaround in </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oaddacc/unable-to-set-time-zone-on-new-outlook-account/e2ab758f-a847-423d-9d8b-c6c690446986">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oaddacc/unable-to-set-time-zone-on-new-outlook-account</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been other suggestions about using clearing browser caches, using a different browser, but they do not work (for me), only the use of @outlook.com / InPrivate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;is an issue with the new web version of Outlook.com, it did not arise previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It needs to be fixed by Microsoft, as changing the primary will affect logins/display names on linked devices/phones, and may cause accounts to be reset (that used to be an issue but may have been fixed in latest Win10). Until then, there should be a warning
 to use an @outlook.com account at first when new accounts are being set up, and only when this has been successfully&nbsp;completed and the web Mail&nbsp;initialised can you create an alias for the external address and set that to primary.

            You are optimistic.&nbsp;This is an issue that has been introduced by their new version of Outlook.com. Their support people generally do not acknowledge that it is their problem - blaming browsers as usual - and there is no sign that they have communicated
 with the developers to get it fixed.

            <p>I agree this is a very serious problem, I can not syncronize my onedrive and therefore not use my phone or tablet when I login with my none outlook email as primary even though this is my Microsoft login account, where I have office 365 added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to make the change in the link you added but here one bug is that I think you need to have the twofactor ID setup, this I didnt so my login with the new primary doesnt work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I setup twofactor ID and now it says wait one week before you can change your primary email (Bu'******..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have then thought I could make a work around by adding my existing email to an outlook I created, but I get the message this email is already in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am very stuck and if not resolved I have to move over to google or other :((((( but cant wait weeks with no backup and no use of my services just because I dont have an @outlook email.</p>

            <p>Hi Mogojohn :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to followup with you directly, actually, there is a way to do this in your build - simply tap or click the area above your live tile&nbsp;group in the start menu&nbsp;(where the group name is, or would be if you had one). When you do that, an ellipsis (...) should
 appear to the right of the group name, which you can then use to drag the group around and drop it where you please
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The team is still iterating on the design, but hopefully this should unblock you for now. Lemmie know if you have any questions and thanks for flighting windows - keep the feedback&nbsp;coming&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>J</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 HTML images stripped from POP to POP, but RTF works - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 HTML images stripped from POP to POP, but RTF works</h2>
                    <p>In Outlook 2016 I have 2 email accounts, a Local Provider POP account and Hotmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I insert pictures in the Hotmail account using HTML email, it arrives fine everywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I embed pictures in the Local Provider POP account using HTML (normal or /safe mode):</p>
<ol>
<li>Arrives at other POP email accounts with "The linked image cannot be displayed. The file may have been moved, renamed, or deleted. Verify that the link points to the correct file and location."</li><li>Embedded pictures arrive at Exchange and IMAP accounts correctly</li><li>Embedded pictures sent via the POP account using RTF work fine</li><li>Embedded pictures received from those same POP accounts work fine</li></ol>
<p>The issue is sending via the POP account using HTML</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Some of the steps taken:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When I set up the same POP account on another O365 Win 10 PC it works normally.</li><li>I deleted the email profile and set up one from scratch, and that didn't work.</li><li>Online repair for Office 365 didn't work.</li><li>Turned off AVG in case it was something to do with email filtering</li><li>Pulled out most of my hair, to no effect.</li></ul>

<p>That repair tool didn't work. It found a few minor things that when addressed didn't solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new desktop user profile and migrated the typical user folders over there. The problem instantaneously went away. Something in the user profile was corrupted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's so much garbage in the AppData folder and the hidden NT files. Wish it were easier to fix corrupted user profiles or to move files and programs to a new one while avoiding the possible causes of the corruption.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Word print &#34;Send to OneNote&#34; O365 - not working.</h2>
                    <p>Today I went to demonstrate to colleagues to print from Word and send the document to a page in OneNote, as they wanted to use this as an assignment. However, the dialogue box to select a page to print to did not appear. I also tried doing this from a pdf
 and it did not work.&nbsp; I saw other options such as remove the printer, so I did and now I still can't get the printer to work.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Denise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you can send files to OneNote form Word and PDF file, that means this issue may be related to OneNote. To troubleshoot this issue, please share with me more info as below:</p>
<p>1. Which kind of OneNote you are using? OneNote for Windows 10 or OneNote 2016?</p>
<p>2. The version number of OneNote(File&gt;Account&gt;Product Info/Three points menu&gt;About).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, I also suggest you try to Send to OneNote to print your documents into OneNote. You can find that app in the Microsoft App Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

<p>1. OneNote for Windows 10</p>
<p>2. Version number: 16001.11029.20060.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried to download the app.&nbsp; I received the following error:</p>

</p><p>Sorry for the&nbsp;inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot this issue, I'd like to suggest you uninstall OneNote for Windows and install it again from Microsoft store to see the outcome. If you still can't print your file into OneNote normally, please share with me ULS&nbsp;log of OneNote via Private
 Message to let me help you. You can download and install related app <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></span> to get that log. I will share with you the steps to get ULS log in PM.</p>

</p><p>Do you mean that you can't find OneNote for Windows in&nbsp;Programs and Features page? If so, I'd like to suggest you right-click the icon of OneNote for Windows then click Uninstall. Please have a try and share with me your result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Denise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked my suggestion above? Can you print your file into OneNote now? Do you still need any help? It would be great if you can let me know your recent progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            NO! Nothing works.&nbsp; I'm frustrated that it takes a full day for you to respond. I was on chat today for 2-3 hours and they couldn't help either.&nbsp; Microsoft needs better support.&nbsp; I don't have all this time to waste. This problem has been going on for over
 a week now and NO ONE can help! This is disappointing.

<div>Hi Denise,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>
<p>To troubleshoot this issue, I'd like to suggest you uninstall Send to OneNote and OneNote for Windows then install them from Microsoft store. You can search them in Windows search bar and right-click to uninstall&nbsp;them:&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook pin - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook pin</h2>
                    I just moved and changed by email and later I changed my phone number.&nbsp; I can no longer get my emails after May 25th on my computer.&nbsp; It is asking for my password on the new email account.&nbsp; It does not accept the password and is asking for a pin which
 I don't have. Since the phone number on my old account is no longer in use, I can't sue the "Hello" feature. I have been waiting for a letter from Microsoft to validate the account.&nbsp; Still don't have it.&nbsp; What do I do now?

            Hi
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />May I ask if you tried filling in Microsoft's account recovery formulaire?
<br />- <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17875/...</a>
<br />
<br />Responding correctly to the questions allows Microsoft to confirm a given user is the right owner of an account and, subsequently, grants him access. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)! 
<br />Maggie

            Hi Patricia,
<br />When you log onto your computer do you use a pin. Try that one to see if it is what it wants. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam
