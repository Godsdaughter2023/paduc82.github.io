<h2>            Playtech program issue</h2>
                    HI to all<br />
<br />
O.k I've tried almost everything before this so I'll try explain as best I can in steps.<br />
<br />
I want to play poker on line with sites that use Playtech software. In example Poker770, Paddy poker, My betfair, Ibet&nbsp; etc.<br />
Problem is when I download the program and it opens it kinda freezes and my mouse cursor just flickers with the arrow and busy/loading circle.<br />
I cant do anything, type in any letters or even close the program I have to do it with task manager. Nothing really responds, just the window opens and the log in screen the tables don't load, but the advertising and everything else does.<br />
<br />
I have asked all the sites for help and done everything they instructed,but to no prevail. I have searched google and tried everything.<br />
<br />
I have done the following to try and find the problem:<br />
<br />
Trace check<br />
Ping check<br />
Compatibility checks<br />
Switch off antivirus and firewall&nbsp; (Symantec)<br />
Registry clean and fix<br />
Defrag<br />
Virus scan<br />
Safe mode check<br />
Clean boot check<br />
Monitor refresh check<br />
<br />
None of this has worked. I only have this problem with the Playtech software sites as I run other poker sites perfectly.<br />
I have contacted Playtech support, but they as useless as a one legged man in a butt kicking competion.<br />
<br />
Please can anybody help me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>What is the exact error code or error message?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
Adjust graphics hardware acceleration:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To adjust graphics hardware acceleration, follow these steps: <br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click Start type personalization in the Start Search box, and then click Personalization in the Programs list.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click Advanced Settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click the Troubleshoot tab, and then click Change settings.Collapse this image Expand this image<br />
Note: If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Move the Hardware Acceleration slider two notches to the left of Full (the Disable cursor and bitmap accelerations setting).</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click OK, and then click Restart Now.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>After the computer has restarted, test the game.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Since almost all troubleshooting steps have been performed, may be this game will not work with Windows 7, Hence
</span><span>I would suggest you to try contacting Playtech support, since you have the problem only with Playtech software and check if it helps.</span><span><br />
<br />

            Hi Vijin<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for the reply I really appreciate you spending some time on it.<br />
<br />
Regarding your questions and solutions.<br />
<br />
1- I have not made any changes to my pc as this is the first time I&nbsp; want to run the program.<br />
<br />
2- There are no error messages<br />
<br />
3- I don't have a graphics card so I can not execute the hardware acceleration steps.<br />
<br />
The software that you download is very basic and the site support (Poker770) said that I do not need a graphics card. I only have my G31\33 chipset on my MSI motherboard that I use.<br />
<br />
Also I can play there flash version of the program on there site perfectly fine. Thing is I am just full of nonsense and would like to resolve the issue and use the downloaded version.<br />
<br />
I will contact Playtech now again and see if they reply or if I find anything useful on the site.<br />
<br />
Again thank you very much for taking the time to help me sort out my issue<br />
<br />
Kind regrards<br />

            <p>For IE9, the workaround is to turn off hardware acceleration in IE's Internet Option page.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab and check the first option: Accelerated graphics, Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check if Symantec is the problem (it often is) you have to do more than just disable it, you really do have to uninstall it completely and then check the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these hints if you uninstall or install programs, including any Playtech software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried right-clicking on the shortcut to the program, or the .exe, and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>
<p>Try right-clicking on the actual Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried cleaning out your Temp folder, you can do it by typing %temp% in the Start Menu RUN box.&nbsp; This will open your Temp folder, there you can delete everything that Windows will allow you to do so.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to show Both Hidden and System Files, and also to uncheck "Hide known file types" in Control Panel/ Folder Options/ View, to navigate to the mentioned Temp location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried testing with a different Windows user?</p>

</p><p>I have 3 other old accounts with my real full name and people cannot find which one I am. I need them to be able to search my display name and not real name.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It would be better to provide the skype ID of&nbsp;your account rather than&nbsp;the display name you have provided.</p>
<p>Skype ID is&nbsp;the unique ID of your account which lets other users to search you&nbsp;easily.</p>
<p>If you have signed up for an account&nbsp;with skype name, then you just provide that skype name you created.</p>
<p>But if you use&nbsp;an email or phone number, you will need to look for it.</p>
<p>Here's the step for you to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">Skype Page</span></a></li><li>go to the purchase history of the account.</li><li>The name that you see beside the sign out is the skype ID of your account.</li></ul>

    <title>Swipe feature on touchpad randomly cuts out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattzx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Swipe feature on touchpad randomly cuts out</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8.1 and the two-finger scroll function on the touchpad keeps randomly cutting out. Now it appears to be completely gone; I haven't been able to scroll through a website with the touchpad for a couple weeks now. It is not an issue with
 the settings because that feature is turned on in the settings window. Also, the one-finger setting where it drag and drops or highlights after one tap of the pad is going crazy and I keep moving tabs around accidentally because of it and I just want it to
 be turned off. Both gestures are set to work the way I want them to, yet both gestures are working in the exact opposite manner from how they are set. Oh yeah, and the swipe one was working fine, and in the middle of scrolling through a page, it just stopped
 cold turkey. Help?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I was unable to change the files and folders to access them with my Microsoft account also with a new local account that I created with admin rights.&nbsp; I am certain its a parent/child permissions issue however I wanted to start
 again with a clean slate so I reverted back to windows 8.1, then reverted back to Windows 10.&nbsp; So far I am not having the permissions issue that I had previously.&nbsp; I ran a the powershell command and that is when the troubles began previously.&nbsp; I am not going
 to run that command this time lol....I got an email as well from Microsoft support about the issue and I have informed them of what went on as well.&nbsp; As I stated, this is not just one application that won't open, its a matter of permissions on all applications
 as they "belong" to another user when added in the upgrade, you cannot call the programs to open under your user ID as you don't have permission to access them.&nbsp; This is why this issue is only symptomatic of a permissions issue, not an issue with the program
 itself which is why I investigated it as a permissions issue instead of just one program.&nbsp; I'm sure you understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep investigating as this is a new operating system to me and I am certain after changing my files and folders to "all users" after going back to windows 10 it should resolve the issue, and this is something that I think if people have not been in
 IT before, they would have an issue with understanding the underlying issue of what is truly going on.&nbsp; That is understandable.&nbsp; I have been doing this for almost 30 years now so am familiar with some troubleshooting methods.&nbsp; I should hope that there will
 be a fix for this issue for people not familiar with IT and only wanting their operating system to perform as expected, ease of use is very important.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response again.</p>

            <p>This script command is what broke the apps in the first place, when I tried to fix the start menu after that last major Windows update. &nbsp;The merge failures corrupted the stuff in the AppRepository, and fails to replace them on Add-AppxPackage. &nbsp;I am still
 analyzing a procmon dump on the Appx Distro service. &nbsp; On another computer, I copied the Store files, which seem newer than mine and tried to install it, and still get merge fail. &nbsp;There are some repo databases ending with srd, but no idea how to parse those
 files into some known DB tool. &nbsp;Obviously, it's a special database that stores info about the repository to find out which apps are installed. &nbsp;Fails to remove the app store, because of failing to find the manifest.</p>

            Managed to install one Store package from WindowsApps, the merge fails because in fact the whole folder wasn't present. &nbsp;I renamed a similar directory to the version it was looking for, and it installed without errors. &nbsp;Now the store is shaded out in gray
 and has a exclamation point in the corner of the icon. &nbsp;wsreset crashes now.

            <p>Tried the exact thing between my desktop and my laptop and got the fail as well.
<span>Summary Record <em>Database</em> (<em>SRD</em>), it might be pulling from some pre existing package, as I noticed in my newest reinstall, that the apps were keeping some kind of summary record database that was created during the upgrade,
 however, the Power shell command given would not have the same data base to pull from SRD, or previously created records, so it would not be looking for the same manifest that was actually created in the upgrade. Most likely, for that reason, there is no success
 on copying files as by the very nature of SRD, both devices will inherently contain differences which would make it unable to find the manifest.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have several procmon dumps that I am looking at to see why that is going on.&nbsp; I can tell though, its only a matter of time before it starts to do it again unless root cause is found.&nbsp; I know the reinstall would do it for now, but I think
 its going to reoccur, especially with this Powershell script command being used so heavily to attempt to fix this issue.&nbsp; And, at some point, the SRD will get updated, will it remove old manifest data or will it continue to try to find the old and fail then?
 If you have a fresh install, not an upgrade, there doesn't appear to be a .old file where repositories were retained, so I'm not sure if it will pull from those or not at a later time with an upgrade.&nbsp; I would sure like to identify it to not replicate it at
 a later time and fail.&nbsp; :)</span><br />

            <p>Wondering something....your user ID that you are logged in as, does it have access to Microsoft.WindowsStore_2015.21.25.0_neutral_split.scale-100_8wekyb3d8bbwe folder? And, I wonder at what time does it consider the registry key marked for deletion and why?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its very, shall we say, uncustomizable in what is available to re-download on a specific basis, instead it seems all or nothing.&nbsp; I can't find a way to isolate the store resource files, even when examining the .old files on the upgrade.&nbsp; Not sure if it is
 because they don't want everyone to have access to custom download the files or if its because of the way its compiled?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the same errors for mine, unlike yours, it was there but flashed when trying to open it, indicative of a permissions issue that must be inherited permissions issue.&nbsp; I can't find where the permissions issue is getting its inheritance from yet though.</p>

            I had changed the owner of WindowsApps and its children to Admin group. &nbsp;No apps have been affected by this, except the ones with missing resource files. &nbsp;I have a few apps with no logo, which means the powershell script broke those by messing up their
 resource files and then failing. &nbsp;I don't know what exactly the command does, maybe it removes / replaces data about the appx package and then fails when it cannot find resources for the apps. &nbsp;Perhaps some resources are missing that are required by the installer.
 &nbsp;Now why would wsreset delete that folder for the Store?

<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:

 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>Hi kah524,</p>
<p>Also, please go to the laptop manufacturer's website to update the latest Vista drivers.&nbsp; Also please see the following steps (thanks to Mir A. Microsoft Support) to change your touchpad's sensitivity:</p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps below to reduce the touchpad sensitivity on the computer:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on the computer and log into Windows as normal. Open the "Start" menu and click on the option labeled "Control Panel."</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click on the icon labeled "Mouse.". The "Mouse Properties" window will open. Navigate to the tab labeled "Device Settings." Click
 on the button labeled "Settings." A window labeled "Properties" will appear.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examine the left panel of the "Properties" window and expand the option labeled "Sensitivity." Click on the option labeled "Touch Sensitivity."</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce the touch sensitivity setting by moving the slider to the right, towards the "Heavy Touch" label. Experiment with different levels
 of sensitivity until you find one suited to your needs.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the button labeled "OK" to close the "Properties" window; repeat with the "Mouse" control panel. Your new touchpad sensitivity
 settings are now saved.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

            Debra,
<div><br />
<div>When I open Mouse Properties there is no tab labeled Device Settings. The tabs are Buttons, Pointers, Pointer Options, Hardware, and Set Point Settings. When I select Set Point Settings, it takes me to the LogicTech web site for my LogicTech wireless mouse.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The issue I have is that the touchpad is so sensitive it randomly moves the cursor to other locations while I'm typing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft should have a very easy and straight forward way to adjust the touchpad. If it is under the Mouse Properties, please provide the information.</div>

            Hi Zimame,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
On a notebook/laptop it so happens that when our wrist accidently grazes the touchpad, the cursor starts tossing all over the screen.<br />
<br />
To make sure that this isn’t the root cause to this behavior; I’d suggest disable your touchpad while typing. Test on Word or any other application where you were initially facing this issue.<br />
<br />
See if this changes anything and check if that fixes the issue.<br />
<br />
Another thing I’d suggest is to get the latest driver for your touchpad or mouse by visiting the device manufacturer’s website.<br />
<br />
Also, to be on the safer side, check if your computer is infected.<br />
<br />
If you have antivirus installed on your computer, get the latest updates for it on a regular basis. If you don’t have one, you may download Microsoft Security Essentials on your computer and run it.<br />

    <title>Problem With Dolby Digital Plus on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ggabunia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem With Dolby Digital Plus on Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello. I bought my Laptop (Acer Aspire VN7-591G) With Window 8.1 installed on it. One of the applications it came with was Dolby Digital Plus - and it was an amazing product, it made my laptop much louder and the voice was much cleaner. But soon after
 the purchase I upgraded to windows 10 (in about 2 days). After the upgrade, dolby digital plus still remained and when it's turned on, it does work fine. But the problem is, it keeps turning itself off.<br />
When I open a new Video File, when I play new mp3 File ,when I open a new Video - every time, it turns itself off and I have to turn it on again.<br />
And when I play a game, it becomes really difficult. For example, when I open GTAV, it turns off dolby digital plus. when I minimize the game windows, turn it on and maximize the game, it once again does the same. similar things happen with other games as well.<br />
<br />
Could you tell me what I can do about it? I tried searching for a new version of Dolby Digital Plus, but I couldn't find any download links for dolby digital. Then I downloaded newest Sound driver (for Windows 10), but after I installed it, dolby digital was
 gone completely so I restored the previous version.<br />
I have a friend who has the similar problem with dolby digital after upgrading to windows 10, so I'm pretty sure the problem is not specific to my PC.&nbsp;<br />
I'd be grateful for any suggestions.

            Thank you. I seem to have found the solution on Acer support page - I turned off&nbsp;&nbsp;the "Hey Cortana" option from Cortana settings and Dolby Digital seems to be working fine since then.

    <title>USB Headset doesn&#39;t Work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chriscollins_773  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Headset doesn&#39;t Work</h2>
                    I have a Sentey Symph headset and it worked on my old desktop when I plugged it in.&nbsp; Ever since I got my new laptop I wasn't able to use my new headset because when I plugged it in no sound would come in and the microphone wasn't picking up anything.&nbsp;
 There is a yellow triangle in the control panel (Devices and Printers) I tried troubleshooting it and it said It wasn't able to reinstall drivers.&nbsp; (By the way my laptop makes a noise whenever I plug it in.)

    <title>Windows 10 Photos App&#58; Change default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark_524  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Photos App&#58; Change default</h2>
                    I just changed over to Windows 10 and have been pretty happy...for the most part. Not crazy about the Photos App. How do I change so that it isn't the default photo option? AND How can I empty the photos that have been downloaded already? Is there a way
 to empty the entire library without having to go pic by pic? Many thanks.

            Amit...many thanks for the quick reply. Yes, I would like to empty the library in the photos app without deleting them from their original files in 'My Pictures'. I have them organized as I like them there and would prefer to have them in one place. I
 have attempted to delete them from the photos app in groups but it is time consuming, would prefer to clear library completely if possible. When I initiated the photos app it automatically downloaded all of my pictures from 'My Pictures'. Do I uninstall the
 app completely? And yes, I don't want the photos app to be the default app to open my pictures whether they are stored in 'My Pictures' or 'My Documents'. I would like to have the photos app as an option but I prefer to use Corel and/or photoshop. Many many
 thanks for your help!

<li>Open the image location (from location where you are trying to open image file).</li><li>Right click on image, click on <strong>Open with</strong> and select <strong>

<p><span>This will help you to open the images with the preferred app. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: The photo app will automatically fetch the images from the My pictures folder. You may try to change the image source in the photos app. So the preferred images will open in the photos app.</span></p>

<p>If your Task Manager has been disabled (unless you disabled it on purpose), then you definitely have another problem to accompany your first problem.</p>
<p>The usual advice is along the lines of "something has been disabled in Group Policy", and that is probably true, but if you are using XP Home, there is not Group Policy Editor in XP Home and that really doesn't tell you where to look in the Group Policies
 even if you could run Group Policy Editor. &nbsp; You need to know how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Here is a comprehensive solution that will work for all versions of XP and do not require hunting around in the Group Policy Editor to find where things have been disabled. &nbsp;If you happened to have the documentation for Group Policy Registry locations, there
 would be no hunting, but most folks don't have that documentation either.<br />
<br />
Unless you disabled these tools on purpose, the chances are good that your system has a malicious software infection.&nbsp; The malware knows what tools you are going to use to try and find and remove it, so the malware disables the things you are most likely to
 use and keeps them from running so you can't find it.<br />
<br />
Whatever malicious software tools you are currently using or have been using have failed to protect your system.<br />
<br />
The malicious software will be happiest to fool you into thinking you need to so something drastic to fix your system - like a Repair Install, System Restore point, or a total reinstallation of XP.&nbsp; That is what it would like you to do, but such measures are
 not required.<br />
<br />
You need to fix the immediate problem of the tools not working, then scan your system for malicious software when you are done.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
No matter what kind of malicious software scanning tools you have already used, they are unlikely to fix this problem because they cannot tell if the changes to your system were on purpose (you or an Administrator made them) or some malicious software changed
 them, so the scanning tools will leave these things alone (this is usually a good thing).<br />
<br />
If your Task Manager is afflicted in this manner, there are probably other things that also don't work - like Registry Editor, System Restore and Command Prompt, so fix them all at once even if you haven't found out they are broken yet.<br />
<br />
These registry commands will remove the registry entries that are stopping the programs from opening.&nbsp; Even if the registry entries are not there, these commands are safe to run.<br />
<br />
Before making any changes to your registry, back up the registry with this popular free tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
Open notepad to create a new text file:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
notepad</p>
<p>Click OK to open a new notepad file.<br />
<br />
Copy and paste the following lines of text into the new notepad file. <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]<br />
"DisableTaskMgr"=-<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]<br />
"DisableRegistryTools"=-<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System]<br />
"DisableCMD"=-<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]<br />
"DisableTaskMgr"=-<br />
[HKEY_USERS\.default\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]<br />
"DisableTaskMgr"=-<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon]<br />
"DisableCAD"=dword:00000000<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\SystemRestore]<br />
"DisableConfig"=-<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\SystemRestore]<br />
"DisableSR"=-<br />
</strong><br />
<br />
Save the new text file with a .reg extension to your desktop or someplace you can remember with a name you can remember, something like:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
enableit.reg<br />
<br />
After saving the file, close notepad.<br />
<br />
Locate the enableit.reg file on your desktop and double click it.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can right click the enableit.reg file, choose Open With... and select the&nbsp;Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative to the question... Are you sure you want to add the information to the registry?<br />
<br />
You should then see a message that the information was successfully entered into the registry.<br />
<br />
If the Registry Editor has also been disabled, you will not be able to run any of the registry changes to fix the rest of the problems, so you must first enable the Registry Editor from the Run command.&nbsp; Even if the Registry Editor is not broken, these commands
 are safe to run.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter (copy/paste would be safer) the following text:<br />
<br />
<strong>REG add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 0</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK and respond in the affirmative if prompted about an overwrite message.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter (copy/paste would be safer) the following text:<br />
<br />
<strong>REG add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 0</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK and respond in the affirmative if prompted about an overwrite message.<br />
<br />
Now that the Registry Editor has been enabled, you can run the enableit.reg file again to fix the problems.<br />
<br />
Depending on circumstances, your tools may work right away, but in order to prevent the "did you reboot your system?" question later, go ahead and reboot your system now and then test to be sure things are working again.<br />
<br />
Enabling the tools in this manner fixes only the symptom of the malicious software infection but does not fix the real problem (the system is currently or has been infected with malicious software) so you are not quite done yet - your system could still be
 infected.<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs then troubleshoot any remaining issues.<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired. <br />
<br />
You can also delete the enableit.reg file when you are done.</p>
<hr />
<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>
<p>I decided to save up points for a new puppy instead of a pony!</p>

            Hi Salem,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Please see the below options:
<br />
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

<p>I had a similar issue in v1803... back then I was unable to adjust the brightness at all on a dell501x/i5-460m (first gen) system... Yes, I know that laptop is ancient but with an SSD is as good as new and the screen is amazing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted MS by phone and they said that it was an extra feature and "old laptops" were not supposed to work with the new version of Windows and I should contact Dell for support... planned obsolesce!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a 2-3 months they released a KB to fix their own bug.... Can anybody confirm if this issue is affecting the Intel HD 8.15.10.2900 driver?</p>
<p>

                    hi guys. i can't change my default playback/recording device... <br />
whenever i try to switch default device, nothing happens, it just stays on the same device as it was before, and this is a real big problem because i have a usb headset..
<br />
i've also tried to disable the device(s) that i don't want to use, but that doesn't work either..<br />

<br />
2 = yes<br />
<br />
3 = yeah<br />
<br />
i did download the correct driver, which i got from the asus website.<br />
<br />
<br />
today i called asus support and asked them what to do. they told me to restore the computer to the factory settings. so, let's hope that'll fix it :)<br />

            If you installed Windows 10 during the free period then it’s now tied to your account so all you have to do is run the media creation tool to upgrade, you may have to do a clean install so backup your personal files &amp; make sure you have all the installation media for your programs, or use a third party tool to create a system image before upgrading then any problems you can just use along with the recovery media (created within the imaging program) to return quickly.
<br />If you didn’t install Windows 10 then I’m sorry but the free upgrade has now expired.

            If you have personal files - photos or other files then yes you’d need to back up those &amp; download .exe files of any programs you haven’t got the disc for, save also all keys/licenses for said software.
<br />Good luck, keeps us updated on the reinstall.

<h2>            The HID-compliant touchscreen doesn&#39;t load on startup on Windows 10 after recent update.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: The HID-compliant touchscreen doesn't load on startup</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently updated to .164. I felt it was a long awaited update. although it fixed a lot of bugs on windows 10 mobile. But for PC the .164 update has a new bug that is troublesome. I have a hp Omni 10 tablet. It has been working good enough. after the
 .164 update i was having some troubles with the touchscreen e.g. after i restart my tablet, touchscreen won't work at times. i thought of doing a reset. but reset stuck midway and i had to install windows from scratch. No problem there. after windows update
 updated to the new .164 update, the problem started again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>the problem: every time i restart my tablet, there is a high chance that the touchscreen won't work (almost always)</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i did: i used a USB mouse and keyboard to login and open device manager. there was this device with a yellow exclamation mark. i uninstalled it. did a "scan for hardware changes" and the touchscreen installed. started working as expected. i restarted
 again. and again the same problem. now i have to routinely do the uninstall thing to get back my touchscreen functionalities.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am able to use touchscreen in the bios, recovery, everywhere. it's only after windows startup that the touchscreen goes bonkers. so i assumed it was more of a windows problem than hp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my last resort is heading back to windows 8.1 now. please help.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for the update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A <strong>Code 10</strong> error is generated in Device Manager in one of the following situations:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Device Manager</strong> cannot start the device.</span></li><li><span>One of the drivers that the device needs does not start.</span></li><li><span><strong>Device Manager</strong> has insufficient information to recognize the error that is bubbled up by the device driver.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> In this situation, the
<strong>Code 10</strong> error can be a very generic message that indicated some kind of unspecified driver or device problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have already tried updating, uninstalling-reinstalling the touchscreen driver, I suggest you to try
<strong>compatibility mode</strong> option by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Compatibility mode</span></strong><span> runs the program in the current version of Windows using the settings from previous
 version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Download the latest driver setup file from the manufacturer’s website or locate the downloaded driver setup file of the previous operating system in your PC.</span></li><li><strong><span>Right-click</span></strong><span> on the driver setup file
 and click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the
<strong>Compatibility</strong> tab, check the box <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode</strong> for, select
<strong>Windows&nbsp;10</strong> operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></li><li><span>Once the driver is installed in compatibility mode,
<strong>restart</strong> the PC for the effective changes to take place.</span></li><li><span>Check if the issue is resolved.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You can also follow the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard and type <strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the top most search result and follow from step 2 from the article

<h2>            Sleep Mode - How I fixed my Windows 7 upgrade to Windows 10 sleep problems.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>How I fixed my Windows 7 Ultimate upgrade to Windows 10 Pro (Sleep Mode).</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 10 almost 2 weeks ago. The experience was OK except for one huge nagging problem. My system would no longer go to
<strong>sleep and wake up properly</strong> without crashing and restarting or getting BSOD (<strong>DPC_Watchdog_Violation errors</strong>). Sometimes it just wouldn't go to sleep at all. The screen would go black but the hard drive light would start to go
 crazy along with the fan throttling up with the lid closed or when the timer ran down to put the system into Sleep mode. Several times it got so hot that I felt the system would damage itself and I had to hold the power button to do a hard shutdown. This is
 totally unacceptable for a system that worked perfectly on both Windows 7 Ultimate and 8.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>I have been dealing with this issue since day 1 and I have spent several hours each day since trying to find a remedy to fix this problem. After hours and hours of reading through the threads on this forum I ran into dead end after dead end. And like many
 people who upgraded <strong>NONE</strong> of the fixes or suggestions (and yes, I've tried them all) that other community members or Guru's suggested have worked to make the system perform the way it is supposed to. I simply need a system that will go to sleep
 an return to where I left off. It may be an hour, it maybe 2 or 3 hours, or even a day or two. I just need the system to go to sleep and wakeup like Windows 7 and 8 did.
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>So last night at 3:30 am, after reading a few more responses to my forum questions I came to a point where
<strong>I realized this wasn't going to be fixed.</strong> I was moments away from downgrading back to a perfectly working Windows 7…. But just before I started the process I decided to backup the data on my drive. I went to my closet to retrieve a backup drive
 and low and behold I found a Kingston SSD drive sitting in the box that I keep my backup drives in. I totally forgot I bought this SSD a few months ago from Newegg in an online special they had. That got me thinking…. I had already made an installation DVD
 using the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Creation Tool Info">
Windows 10 Media Creation Tool</a> (I like having a hard copy of the OS) so I thought, "What the heck?"</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I grabbed a screwdriver, popped the cover off the back of the laptop and removed both hard drives and installed the SSD. Re-Installed the battery, plugged it up and placed the Windows 10 DVD in the drive. Long story short, about 30 minutes and several reboots
 later I have a WORKING and activated installation of Windows 10 Pro on my Dell XPS 17. Best part is SLEEP works! Its fast to power down and it wakes back up where I left off when I close the lid (manually) or when the system hits the timer limit (lid open).
<br />
Yahoo! It finally works!</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>I'm currently typing this post on the new full installation of Windows 10 Pro on the SSD I installed. The system boots and shuts down quickly and all updates and drivers installed correctly except for one driver. Dell installs a "<a href="http://ftp.dell.com/FOLDER01168946M/1/Chipset_Driver_XWJWG_WN_4.10.0036_A05.EXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="free fall sensor driver link">free
 fall sensor</a>" to protect the hard drives from accidental falls. After retrieving the "STMicroelectronics 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer" driver from the Dell website all is now in perfect order. The only bad thing? The system is totally devoid of any of my
 previously installed programs and data. Huge pain in the butt to get it back to the way I need to have it to be a working and productive system. I have a lot of info and programs to move over and install so its gonna be a while. I'll probably just swap the
 drives out until I have time to make the move fully from my old drive. </div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>My thought about this whole process?…. <strong>What a bunch of baloney! </strong>
<br />
Microsoft has had plenty of time to have this resolved since <strong>SLEEP problems first surfaced back in
</strong><strong>October of 2014</strong>. Consumers should never have to deal with these kind of problem and this should have been fixed months ago in pre-release versions for the beta testers and engineers to work out. I hope you are hearing this Microsoft,
 the <strong>upgrade process is BROKEN </strong>and simply doesn't work for many people across many different hardware platforms. I really tried to avoid doing a complete and clean install and spent hours and hours trying to avoid it. Microsoft should probably
 be promoting a clean install instead of upgrading. The only kicker here is you have to activate Windows 10 from an upgrade situation if you don't have Windows 7 or 8 media (DVD).
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Doing a simple upgrade would make life sooo much easier! Unfortunately, doing a clean install using the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Media Creation Tool Info">
Media Creation Tool</a> seems to be the only true solution to having a working copy of Windows 10 on my Dell XPS 17. I suspect this will be the only way many others will be able to get a working Windows 10 installation as well.
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>So what does this mean for many of us that are experiencing problems?</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>1) You will have to <strong>upgrade</strong> from your current version of Windows to Windows 10 (broken)
<br />
2) <strong>Activate</strong> Windows 10 on your machine <br />
3) <strong>Create</strong> Windows 10 DVD or ISO file using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool
<br />
4) <strong>Downgrade</strong> and then backup your programs and data (you could also backup at step 1 before you do the upgrade)
<br />
5) Wipe the existing drive and&nbsp; do a full "clean" install or install a new drive and keep the old drive as a working backup of Windows 7 or 8.
<br />
6) Re-install all of your old programs, data and tweaks. <br />
7) Finally enjoy Windows 10</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps many you to keep from pulling your hair out. Unfortunately, its not an easy solution but it does work… finally.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and let me know what you think!</p>

            <p>So, the drama doesn't end....</p>
<p>I finally get Windows 10 to work correctly via clean install onto a new drive and I now find out that I can't revert back to Window 7 on my old drive because Windows 10 says files needed to go back have been deleted from my hard drive.... **** Microsoft!
 You have got to be kidding me, after roughly 2 weeks I can't go back to a working Windows 7 because there are files missing? I didn't delete any files and have been extremely careful not to change anything on that drive knowing I would probably be going back
 to Windows 7. Unbelievable!!!!! I feel like Microsoft has stolen my drive and working OS... this is too much MS BS!!!</p>

            I imagine that this would work, but having to manually put my computer to sleep when I step away is not as big an inconvenience as resetting EVERYTHING. Thank you for working on this, but I'm going to have to wait until the people I paid fix the product
 they sold me. I'm not the most computer savvy, but I am pretty certain that a sleep function is relatively simple and wouldn't take more than an hour or two of dev work.

            You would think? That as much chatter as there has been about this issue a "hotfix" would have appeared rather quickly to help the innocent people who trusted MS with the "free" OS upgrade. But no, just crickets from the behemoth. It's well documented
 on this forum that this SLEEP issue has been a problem since October of 2014! I knew better than to jump on the wagon too soon and like many others, I'm paying for it with frustration from a company who doesn't seem to care who they screw. I'd be happy to
 just go back to the way things were before the upgrade but now that has been conveniently broken by MS when I used the Media Creation Tool to make an install DVD. Why, why, why....?

            I also have a Dell XPS 17 L702x laptop. I am experiencing the same Watchdog Violation errors coincident with using sleep mode. If I disable sleep mode, everything is fine. I installed Windows 10 as the normal upgrade to my Windows 8.1 Pro installation,
 after accepting the online upgrade. Other than the sleep mode issue, Windows 10 is performing quite well. My hard drive is a 1TB Samsung 840 EVO SSD. I have been considering reverting back to Windows 8.1 pro and will probably do so if this issue is not resolved
 by Microsoft. Sleep mode is an integral part of using a laptop computer.<br />

<p>The Sleep mode issue has been well documented as has been an ongoing problem since October of 2104. I like the "Clean install" that I did from the DVD I made with the Media Creation Tool the best. Windows 10 boots really fast and goes to sleep and wakes
 up almost instantly. Unfortunately the upgrade I did from Windows 7 on the original drive boots faster the lack of a functioning Sleep mode is frustrating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BEWARE!!! After trying to fix the sleep issue for the past 2 weeks I decided to go back to Windows 7.
</p>
<p>I now get this error. And I did not remove any files!!! Microsoft has hijacked my laptop and won't let me have my old working system back!</p>

<p>Hello everyone.<br />
I'm terribly sorry for you Airdog99,cause on my end we ended up finding an easier method for you to fix this.<br />
<br />
Turns out that a specific driver causes all this **** and a simple downgrade is all it takes.You can
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power/sleepshutdown-issues-on-windows-10/a026306f-63ee-4e44-86d2-a4e92d0e202e">
follow this link</a> to end up to the post that has the easiest solution (and the most solid fix IMO)<br />
Thanks for attempting to help the community though.Sorry again I wish this could have been found quicker.<br />
Worth to note:This driver fix isn't 100% solid thus your computer might still face these problems even if you attempt it.I can confirm it worked on my PC but I have seen posts all around saying that it still didn't fix the issue.Nevertheless it's quick and
 worth a try just in case.If it doesn't work then I guess Airdog's fix would be the only one that might fix your issue.<br />
