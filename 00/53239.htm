<h2>            Bluetooth Arc Mouse Issues</h2>
                    My new arc mouse sporadically disconnects from my computer, but when I go into my Bluetooth settings it still shows the mouse as connected.&nbsp; The only solution I've found to work is to turn off and restart my entire computer.&nbsp; Help please!

    <title>Windows 8.1 account issues, get the error 0xd0000072. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mlang18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 account issues, get the error  0xd0000072.</h2>
                    <p>So, I've been having some <strong>severe </strong>issues with my Quantum View 10.1 tablet, more specifically with my Microsoft account on the device.</p>
<p>It's running Windows 8.1 with Bing, and I've had no problems with it until recently.</p>
<p>It started when I was offline for a good while with my tablet, and after I got back online one of my apps, Halo: Spartan Strike, wouldn't login to Xbox again. It got hung up on "signing in" and never went anywhere. I dismissed it as an error specific to
 that app.</p>
<p>Today I tried opening that app again and was greeted with an error message reading "We couldn't sign you in, [email address]</p>
<p>Sorry for the interruption; we just want to make sure this is you. Tap or click OK to confirm", courtesy of the Windows Credential Manager UI Host process. The error just kept popping up over and over after hitting "OK", and the only way to stop it was to
 end the process via Task Manager.</p>
<p>I attempted to access the Windows Store and it never opened, instead hanging up on the green screen with loading symbol indefinitely. All other apps relying on a Microsoft account signin also generated the same error as Spartan Strike.</p>
<p>I then tried applying a fix recommended on this site which involved switching my account from a Microsoft account to a local account and back, however this has backfired spectacularly as I've been unable to reconnect my Microsoft account. Every time I complete
 the account connection process I'm greeted with error 0xd0000072.</p>
<p>Can anyone provide me with a fix that doesn't involve the Apps or Account troubleshooters, as I already tried both those as well as a large number of other fixes that did nothing?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
                </div>

I don't believe that is possible. sorry. I think there might be software out there that will only allow your kids to watch certain ratings of movies other then that, no.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</span>

<p>Reset your home network and clear your xbox's cache for starters. If you are playing on a wireless connection consider plugging in if possible. Some people say port forwarding also helps as well. Good luck.

<h2>            Windows 10 Files missing during install</h2>
                    <p>I apologise for being a bother.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried to clean install WinX (i prefer that over Win10, sounds cooler) and it went rather well until it started getting files ready to install and, all of a sudden, it had trouble finding some files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm using a USB created with the media tool and I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to actually get these "files" to appear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>again, sorry for being an inconvenience with such stupid, vague questions. I just haven't been able to use my laptop for months and I really want to get it working again.</p>

<p>Amigos,</p>
<p>Realmente não tem jeito! Já fiz algumas tentativas em adquirir jogos da europa, cujos valores são atrativos em relação ao nosso preço, porem a maioria não roda em virtude do sistema Pal, unico que rodou foi Aliens x Predator, credito ter os dois sistemas
 ou ser free como mencionou o amigo Leobsl furia. Ultima aquisição de teimoso foi o DVD de Medal of Honor, que não rodou e esta parado em minha gaveta, comprei realmente pelo valor de $17,00 E equivalendo a R$40,00 reais. Quem tiver interresse em trocar por
 outros jogo NTSC, estou aberto a negociação. Contato tambem poderá ser feito pelo e-mail : *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>

<h2>            The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing</h2>
                    <p>Bring a big fan of Diablo I decided to give the Van Helsing games a shot and honestly really like them!&nbsp; Granted the online aspect is virtually non-existant because it has a pretty niche community but honestly for anyone who enjoys games like Diablo and Path of Exile, I really recommend this series.&nbsp; You can grab all three games for about $45 USD, even less if they're on sale.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Product Key &#126; Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Product Key &#126; Windows 8</h2>
                    I bought a Sony VAIO with Windows 7. I can find the Product Key of Windows 7 in the back side of my Laptop.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then, my VAIO is crashed and my Recovery Disks also crashed. So, I tried to install Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, it says Windows 8 has to be activated (In the Properties of My Computer, it says Windows 8 is activated, but in my screen it still says I have to activate the Windows. Not sure why it happens).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question is, can I use the Product key of Windows 7 to activate my Windows 8? Is so, how?</div>
                </div>

            <p>No, you cannot use Windows 7 product key to activate Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see error 0xC004F061 when you try to activate Windows 8, it means that you're using a product key for an upgrade version of Windows 8 and a previous version of Windows wasn't on your PC when Windows 8 was installed. To install an upgrade version of
 Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. </p>

    <title>Suggestion&#58; Mobile Style Autocorrect Option for Windows 8 like the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> binsonio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suggestion&#58;  Mobile Style Autocorrect Option for Windows 8 like the one seen on Windows Phone.</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft and everyone,&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the proud owner of a 64GB Microsoft Surface RT with Touch Cover and&nbsp;I love the device.&nbsp; This is my first Windows 8 machine and I am very much enjoying it in this form factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My one gripe with it has to do with how Windows 8 handles autocorrect for non-traditional keyboards such as the Touch Cover and the On-Screen keyboard.&nbsp; However, I think this could be easily rectified with a small&nbsp;OS update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the touch cover is a good idea and certainly better than the on-screen keyboard, I find that the typing experience on mobile Windows 8 devices&nbsp;would benefit greatly from the kind of Autocorrect system seen on Windows Phone.&nbsp; A Full&nbsp;Autocorrect system
 that applies OS wide and not just limited to specific applications such as Microsoft Word.&nbsp; One that treats the keyboard input like how a&nbsp;mobile device does rather than a desktop/laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student using my Surface RT mostly for note taking in class&nbsp;and
 for word processing, I&nbsp;find that I&nbsp;am constantly having to go back to&nbsp;correct little typos that would have been automatically corrected on my Windows Phone.&nbsp; A dropped letter here, a mistake there, an accidental press of "n" instead of "space".&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted,&nbsp;many&nbsp;of
 these&nbsp;mistakes are on my part.&nbsp; But, I type just as fast on my Windows Phone and with&nbsp;just as many&nbsp;errors - except they are&nbsp;very effectively fixed by the autocorrect.&nbsp; I believe the typing experience of Windows 8&nbsp;on my Surface with Touch Cover&nbsp;and any other
 touch device would be greatly improved by the option of&nbsp;autocorrecting&nbsp;mistakes much like it does on Windows Phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me&nbsp;clearly state&nbsp;that I do not think this is a hardware issue.&nbsp; I think this is an issue of&nbsp;reasonable human error in combination with new devices&nbsp;designed for mobile use.&nbsp; I believe these&nbsp;inconveniences can be rectified by non-intrusive software improvements
 on Windows 8/RT via "Patch Tuesday".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Implementation</strong>:</p>
<p>The default for Windows 8 should&nbsp;remain as it is.&nbsp; Many people using computers would not like their typing to be autocorrected by default (myself included).&nbsp; But, since Windows 8 was designed with mobile and touch devices in mind, it would be great if there
 was an option to turn&nbsp;on this Windows Phone style Autocorrect through the keyboard menu.&nbsp; Here are some suggestions for how it can be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>1)&nbsp; Through the onscreen keyboard styles selection menu.&nbsp;(the menu where you can select a full keyboard, or the one set up for thumbs.)</em></p>
<p><em>2)&nbsp; Toggle through "WINKEY + SPACE" as it currently is for languages.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These options allow the settings to be changed on the fly and minimizes confusion for current users who may not be in need of Autocorrect for their current device.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<p>Would this be possible?&nbsp; Is this already in the works for the future?&nbsp; Do others think that this would be a good idea?&nbsp; I think that it would not be a hindrance to any users who do not have a current need for Full Mobile Autocorrect.&nbsp; On the other hand,
 it would be of great benefit to those on the newer forms of PCs&nbsp;and modern Tablets.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other suggestions for implementation are welcome.&nbsp; I just want to get the idea out there.&nbsp; Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this were to be implemented, I would have the perfect device for my mobile needs.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Robinson</p>

            <p>Sitting eith my surface rt in my hands, trying to type thid, I couldn't agree more with you. A software update for the keyboard would be a ginourmus relif! I've been thinkimg the exact same thing - have also wondered if the Company that produces Swiftkey
 for smart phones could make an app for win store. It rraly would make thr user expiriens much much better!</p>
<p>Using this tablet fir studying and notetaking primarily, this upgrade would magically changr a lot of frustration in to&nbsp;a plessent writting expirience!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i've written this whithout correcting anything - all or modt of theses musspells woukd autocorect with a software like the one we are talking about, thud making thr wrutting wxperience much smother and more pleasent)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Upvoted. I didn't get on board until the second generation, but now I'm all in with a surface pro 2 and touch cover. Universal autocorrect is high on my wish list&nbsp;for the device.&nbsp; Fortunately this forum has it implemented, but I wish there were an app or
 a system setting to turn it on and off for all typing,</p>

            I gotta put my hat in for this too, I just got an HP spectre x2 and while I love it and think windows is much better with a touch screen then people give it credit for 2 things need to be adjusted.<br />
<br />
1) the on screen kb. it frequently covers up text input fields when holding your screen in landscape.<br />
<br />
2) OS wide autocorrect (that can be turned off and is off by default)&nbsp;

            I could really do with this. I'm suffering trying to take nites durung cinferences and being abke ti keep uo whikst correcting every other word! This is especially prominent&nbsp;with the letters "A" and "P"&nbsp;that are hard to&nbsp;ail for&nbsp;when touch-typing (AZERTY
 keyboard).&nbsp;My classmates with their posh Macbooks have no problem -&nbsp;what di yiu think abiut that, Microsoft??

<p>Hi I've been having problems with Fifa 14 when playing locally with my friend only one of us seems to get the achievements and gameclips to pop up even though we are signed into our individuals profiles on separate joypads. Does anyone know why this is happening
 or have any ideas how to get around it? Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I suggest disabling your anti-virus temporarily, then installing the driver and restarting to see if the issue resolves.</p>

    <title>Help in deleting built-in administrator account in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help in deleting built-in administrator account in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to revert to Windows 7 after several complications with Windows 10 (won't let me use any other browsers other than Edge, won't let me download, won't let me open programs&nbsp;or games).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has only been a day since I posted this, so the offer should still stand for returning to 7 for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try to reset it to 7, it says that I need to delete the built in administrator account. But when I try to do that, it says that "you cannot perform this operation with built-in accounts." (I'm doing all this in the local account that is also
 an administrator)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I'm at such&nbsp;a loss at what is going on and I&nbsp;just want to go back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p>However, I am still having some problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the command prompt and typed net user administrator /active:no and it read "The command was completed successfully."</p>
<p>

            <p>Sorry, I thought it would expand</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Before you can go back to a previous version of Windows, you'll need to remove any user accounts you added after your most recent upgrade. The accounts need to be removed, including their profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You created one account (Administrator)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Accounts Other users to remove these accounts, and then try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, when I tried to follow this advice, the built in administrator account is nowhere to be found (as it was disabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also know about the way to confirm this using Run&gt;lusrmgr.msc that the administrator account was indeed disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you, again,&nbsp;for your time and patience</p>

            <p>Sure, just drag each to the edge of the screen (remember: until your pointer bumps the edge and stops, not just the window touches the edge), and it will "dock" (Microsoft calls it "snap") to the edge of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember also that the command prompt width is fixed by the size of the text (it has a set number of columns of text in the terminal window), so it won't take up half your screen, but it will still dock to the side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what it looks like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a28274f-de20-4d85-82f4-45e3e65a9fa6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of dragging until your pointer bumps, you can also press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin7.jpg" />&nbsp;and the

            My PC detects all others just fine, be it DVD or CD. &nbsp;And the game has not been installed on any other PC. &nbsp;I messaged Activision through Facebook and they just said that it may not be compatible with Windows 10. &nbsp;But the Original COD and COD 4 both of
 which are game of the year editions instead of the original release work perfectly well.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Update fails because TrustedInstaller is failing to Start due - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whateverworks1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update fails because TrustedInstaller is failing to Start due to bad path to cbscore.dll</h2>
                    I'm getting the 80080005 error when attempting to run windows update.&nbsp; I tracked this down to the fact that the Windows Module Installer is failing to start.&nbsp; Using ProcMon I was able to track down that TrustedInstaller.exe is failing to start.&nbsp; It's failing
 due to the following:<br />
<br />
TrustedInstaller.exe QueryOpen C:\Windows\servicing\0.0.0.1\cbscore.dll FAST IO DISALLOWED<br />
TrustedInstaller.exe CreateFile C:\Windows\servicing\0.0.0.1\cbscore.dll PATH NOT FOUND<br />
TrustedInstaller.exe QueryOpen C:\Windows\servicing\0.0.0.1\cbscore.dll FAST IO DISALLOWED<br />
TrustedInstaller.exe CreateFile C:\Windows\servicing\0.0.0.1\cbscore.dll PATH NOT FOUND<br />
<br />
I searched and cbscore.dll is actually under:<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft-windows-servicingstack_31bf3856ad364e35_6.0.6002.18005_none_0b4ada54c46c45b0<br />
<br />
I've tried to figure out where TrustedInstaller.exe gets the path for cbscore.dll but I've had no luck.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me where TrustedInstaller.exe gets this path?&nbsp; Or more generally how I can fix this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            Did the McAfee free-trial (that came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it) expire before you purchased &amp; installed McAfee Security Center?<br />
<br />
Does <strong>Installed Updates</strong> list the <strong>System Update Readiness Tool... (KB947821)</strong>?<br />
<br />
I'm afraid the only tricks left&nbsp;up my sleeve&nbsp;are (1) running a thorough check for malware, (2) doing a Repair Install of Vista, or (3) formatting the HDD &amp; doing a clean install of Vista.

<h3> fionamckechnie  say:</h3>
<h2>            XPS L702X with windows 7 pro. Can I upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1">My XPS L702X with windows 7 pro is still an amazing laptop with amazing sound with JBL speakers and the windows Maxx audio.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">Can I upgrade to Windows 10?&nbsp; if so has there been an update on the sound issues or any other issues, it seems a real shame to have to get rid of an incredible laptop so I can get the windows 10. I do not want to sacrifice the sound
 so if there is a way to upgrade this machine I would love to know how as windows 10 is all this machine is missing. Thank you.,</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">Also a note to MS if there has not been a fix for this particular laptop please could you consider looking into it as I am sure i am not the only one who loves this XPS machine.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">Thank you again</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, I know about what is needed to upgrade... I was just putting it out there that on the off chance there maybe a way around the sound issue. I now there are a lot of resourceful people out there. No harm in trying :) I may still find
 a way so will keep looking and asking around. I appreciate the feedback though :)</p>
