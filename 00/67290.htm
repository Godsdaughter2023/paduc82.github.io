            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is the information about your Router from Verizon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.actiontec.com/doc_files/MI424WR_Vz_User_Manual_4.0.16.1.45.160_v4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.actiontec.com/doc_files/MI424WR_Vz_User_Manual_4.0.16.1.45.160_v4.pdf</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chapter 2:</p>
<p>"<font><font>The “Login” screen appears. Enter the default user name (admin) and password</font></font></p>
<p>(password) in the appropriate text boxes, then click </p>
<font><font>OK</font></font><font><font>."</font></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>That link contains all of the setup information, including how long to hold the reset button</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><font><font>
<p>Reset Button</p>
</font></font></i><font><font>
<p>To restore the Router’s factory default settings, <strong>press and hold the Reset button</strong></p>
<p><strong>for approximately ten seconds.</strong> The reset process will start about
</p>
</font></font><font><font>ten </font></font><font><font>seconds</font></font>
<p>after releasing the button. When the Router resets, all the lights on the front</p>
<p>panel turn off, and then some of the lights start flashing. The Router has completed</p>
<p>its reset process when the Power light glows steadily green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font>I suggest that you contact Verizon if you continue to have problems.</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font>Cheers.</font></font></p>

<p>
</p><p>This has been messing around since I installed W8.1 a few days ago, its the only update I have left and it keeps failing. Sometimes it downloads, sometimes it sits at 0% for ever.&nbsp; If it does download and go to install it again seems to run for ever and
 then fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have manually downloaded the update and the same thing will happen, installation runs over an hour and again fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error codes are all different, but a couple are&nbsp;800F0902, 80073712, I am using the in bult security if that matters, no 3rd party software</p>

<p><span>Hi Leo</span></p>
<p><span>By pure luck I got both Skype for Business and OneDrive to log on.</span></p>
<p><span>I got an Office update with a new version of Skype and hoped my issue was solved. I tried to log in but the result was the same
 1.1 Service unavailable.</span></p>
<p><span>For some reason I pressed the Browse Back button on my mouse, and the login prompt seemed to send the login information again.
 Resulting in a successful login. Did the same with OneDrive. Error -&gt; Browse back -&gt; successful login.</span></p>
<p><span>Since I was able to log in on my old Mac but not the new, could this be a simple speed and timing issue? The login prompt sending
 the information before Skype and OneDrive is ready for it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards</span></p>

<h2>            Mouse Pointer become weird</h2>
                    I don't&nbsp;know since when, but my mouse pointer become something like this (taken from camera). And for some reason its 'real' position is different than what it shows on the screen. This happens after quite sometime pass after starting my pc and it back
 to normal after restarting it. Any fix for this? I'm using 1920x1080 Resolution on 14 inch display and 125% scaling.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b9de662-95ce-4c92-8521-bb8439d8da05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b9de662-95ce-4c92-8521-bb8439d8da05" /></a>

<p>Dear Mr. Vil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have the similar problem. I think there's an error in loading the image used for the cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59b8eebb-01c7-43c0-ab26-18897452b398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59b8eebb-01c7-43c0-ab26-18897452b398" /></a></p>
<p>(IMG 1)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6f70144-8f7a-4d44-9842-c87ca2cc2f88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6f70144-8f7a-4d44-9842-c87ca2cc2f88" /></a></p>
<p>(IMG 2)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMG 1 shows the cursor as it normally is. IMG 2 shows the flawed type, the cursor for when a process is running in the background. Both images are of approximately equal scale (sorry for the photo, but cursors don't appear on print screen). Normally the
 cursor is supposed to just change by adding a circle. Here the resolution is bad and low, the size changes relatively so that it doesn't point adequately/correctly. It's ugly, but foremost annoying.</p>
<p>This problem usually comes after a while of using the computer. Not entirely sure, 1-2 hrs use maybe? Nothing noticable I've done other than surf the web and editing some Word-documents. I've tried changing the cursor setting to another pre-approved setting
 type, but this only temporarily fixes the problem. It reappears shortly after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had no performance issues with my laptop. It's a Lenovo Ideapad 720 S, 14 " model with Intel Core i7 processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you have some suggestions as how to fix it. Thanks.<br />
</p>

    <title>Offline Installation of LifeCam Studio - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Offline Installation of LifeCam Studio</h2>
                    I have recently been tasked with the installation of several LifeCam Studio Webcams onto XP SP3 machines.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, the one issue that is occurring is the installation wants an internet connection available to install the necessary drivers, even if I download the executable from the product support page.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a workaround for this to enable an offline installation? The client I am installing these for cannot allow an internet connection to be available on these machines, for security reasons.</div>

    <title>Windows 10 constantly rebooting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kzwix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 constantly rebooting</h2>
                    <p>I've installed Windows 10 yesterday evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fresh install, on a brand new 1TB NVMe SSD, with an Intel 7700k, 16GB ram, 500W power supply, no graphics adapter (I use on-board graphics, at the moment), 2 HDD, 2 SATA SSDs, and 5 fans, one of them being the huge ventirad above my CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday evening, my Windows 10 rebooted twice, in less than 1h time of active use. Once while I was playing Hearthstone, another time while I was busy browsing the web for an explanation, using EDGE. (both reboots were not even 15mn apart).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fed up, I shut down the computer, and used my laptop instead. Today, I've retried it. In about 3 hours of use, it has already rebooted 4 times, and NEVER while "idle", I was playing again, or typing this message on the "infected" PC (yes, at this point,
 I'm going to have to refer to Windows 10 as a malware, if this keeps going on - here, typing from a 8.1, which never put me through such ****), or doing whatever, but my PC was "active" (keystrokes, mouse input, etc.), and I didn't even get a warning that
 the computer would be restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the first reboot today, I saw a screen telling me that Windows was working on an update (so I think, at least for that one, it was update-related)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, what do I have to disable to keep my PC from randomly rebooting at most inconvenient times ?</p>
<p>I've looked at the Power options, as some people seemed to say it could be the cause, but they did look fine (and I've disabled the "sleep" and "screen save" timers, to no avail).<br />
I've mentioned my power supply and my hardware, so that it doesn't seem like a lack of power - I should hardly use half of what my PSU could provide, I guess, nor should it be because of a CPU overheat - I put my fingers on top of the thermal exchanger, or
 on the caloducs, they are at ambient temperature, not scalding hot or whatever...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, what could be the reason ?<br />
<br />
I've tried disabling the "automatic reboot after updates", by preventing the "Reboot" task in the Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\UpdateOrcherstrator from reappearing. Didn't work (it doesn't reappear, which is exactly as intended, but there are STILL
 unwanted, random reboots).<br />
<br />
Which services should I disable, which options should I choose, which system files should I edit, patch, surgically clobber with a hex editor, or whatever, to get a working PC which does NOT reboot at random ?</p>

<p>Could be a hardware issue.</p>
<p>I would get a memory test program that will test your SIMMs for errors. Preferably running one at a time.</p>
<p>Other options are taking the hardware out and putting one drive back in at a time and run the machine for a few hours to see if any one of those causes the reboots.</p>
<p>Do you check your CPUs temp? Maybe it is overheating.</p>

<p>I had put my hand on the ventirad's caloducs, and on the thermal exchange plate. Both times, I had found it to be at ambient temp, after a reboot. Last time it did it, I looked in the BIOS, and saw that the CPU was around 32 C°, which is perfectly correct.
 The PCH was at around 50 C°, but I doubt that would be enough to make it fail, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for memory, of course, it *is* possible, but I still think it's highly unlikely that would be the cause. I will download a memory test program, and hope it won't reboot before the test is over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same for my SSDs and HDDs, they served me well in the past, so I don't see why they would cause reboots now.</p>
<p>However, I'm ready to try and disable them, for now.</p>
<p>As for the CPU and motherboard, unfortunately, I won't be able to switch them off or swap them out, so I'll just have to assume they are OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I'm pretty certain it comes from Windows 10. I mean, I ALSO have a problem when trying to power off (right click on Windows menu, choose the submenu to log off, reboot, sleep, or power off, carefully click on the option to power off, and my PC
 stops... before starting again. So, in my book, this is called a REBOOT, not a power-off.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible for Windows to reboot because a service is disabled ? I highly doubt it *should*, but with this new system, I'm ready to believe a lot of things about Microsoft...</p>

<p>I have now had 2 users with windows 10 creators and the reboots are happening automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first was laptop and it was after the 5 PM update window, but today on a second PC unit it is doing it before the hours of operation are expired.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is about 6 reboots and then it is stable. There were only 3 items with the 8-8 updates on the first laptop, and 3 updates for 8-9 on the 2nd laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is not honoring their own controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Greg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed from the media created by the tool, and I installed on a clean SSD. So, there shouldn't be any reason for Windows 10 to have problems because of "old" files or whatever. Also, I made a "repair" install too, because the tech support gal I contacted
 was quite insistent about it, but it didn't solve a thing (merely reset my configurations...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my problems, I have two:</p>
<p>- Random reboots at random times, usually while doing something on the computer, and ALWAYS without any warning.<br />
- Computer rebooting instead of shutting down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both those problems seem to stop when I remove a few of my drives (I physically disconnect the SATA data link, leaving the power supply cords attached to the SSD or HDD I disconnect).<br />
My initial config had a M2 SSD (where Windows 10 is installed), and 5 other SATA drives (physical ones, having one or more partitions on them): 2 SSDs (250GB each), 3 HDDs (2x2TB, 1x3TB)</p>
<p>With that, I experienced very frequent reboots (I remember getting as much as 4 in less than 3 hours).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I disconnected ALL my SATA drives, and gave it a go. The system was stable, and BOTH problems disappeared (the "Shut Down" button, when right-clicking windows menu, then "log out or shut down" submenu, working fine this time). Tested it for two evenings,
 with not a single reboot, or whatever. Works fine in that way, but, obviously, I want to be able to connect my drives...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I tested with ONE SSD connected. Worked fine too.</p>
<p>So, I added a HDD, too. With one SSD and one HDD, the system still seems stable, I've been running it for two days or so like this, and didn't notice any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I tried reconnecting a SECOND HDD. And when I did, the system became unstable again, rebooting me twice in less than, what, an hour ?&nbsp; Plus, the reboots made no sense at all, once, it was in the middle of a game, with 3D and all, so that might have
 been a power consumption thing, or whatever, but the second time, I was merely browsing using Edge, without any "power hungry" task on.<br />
<br />
Of course, the reason might have been a physical problem on that specific HDD, but I disconnected the OTHER HDD, and kept that one, along with the SSD, connected, and disconnected the first HDD I had connected, instead. I tried it all yesterday afternoon &amp;
 evening, and didn't experience a single reboot. Plus, the computer shut down when told to.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I'm pretty sure there must be a software problem linking both, and that it is probably in the power management part of the OS. I've read that Windows 10 has quite a few problems about it, and I tried setting up a personal power management profile, but to
 no avail yet - I couldn't find options whose values would "explain" the problem (at least, to my moderately competent sight, on those matters).</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ian, thank you for your advice, I'm going to run the Power Troubleshooter this evening, because you might be on to something, there. If anyone has other advice for me, please don't hesitate to contribute.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep you all informed about the evolution.</p>

<p>Well... I was certain I had answered, but I cannot find my post... so, here I go again:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7d8d05f-39bc-4ec9-b6d7-3f245d9b8753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7d8d05f-39bc-4ec9-b6d7-3f245d9b8753" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There WERE several windows installed, at different points in time, on several of those disks. I can say with certainty that one was on one of the SSDs, and it's highly probable that all HDDs have had one installed, in the past. Most still have a Windows
 directory, too, but that's not definite proof, as I sometimes did a "full copy" of lower capacity disks into higher capacity ones, when I lacked time to sort what I needed copied or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might even be one EXT4 linux partition in the mix (on disk 4, the middle one is likely to be one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, I fail to see how systems I do not boot on should affect the normal working order of my Windows 10 system ? &nbsp; I mean, that they *might* have an effect on the Windows Boot Loader (trying, maybe, to include some of them), I could understand. But once
 booted, why would windows reboot randomly ? Or fail to stop properly, and reboot instead, when instructed to shut down ?&nbsp; Please enlighten me if you have answers to these questions :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(Also, I disconnected one SSD shortly after having taken this screenshot, and kept the rest online all evening. I did NOT have any unexpected reeboots, this evening, so... I really do not understand why. I'll continue testing this config tomorrow.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Oh, and one last note: I just ran power troubleshooter, which found that USB ports weren't allowed to shut down independently yet, and activated that option. No other changes were made by it (or, at least, reported to me).</p>

</p><p>Here is my reply:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any drive marked Active is going to cause the BIOS/UEFI to stop to query it for bootable System files since the Active flag only exists to point to a bootable partition.&nbsp; It is always wrong to have any other than the partition actually
 booting Windows marked as Active in a Legacy MBR install and needs to be corrected because it will also almost always interfere at some point.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case D is marked Active but doesn' t appear to be bootable itself so should be marked Inactive:&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Then Disk 4 has an apparently abandoned EFI System partition which is only intended to boot a UEFI system drive which is formatted GPT.&nbsp; If you don't have a UEFI bootable OS on the drive then the drive should have it's files moved off to wipe it of all code
 with <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Diskpart Clean Command</a> or at the minimum deleting all partitions to clear the partition table (which doesn't remove old boot code however).&nbsp; Then reformat as a data drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally the apparent actual OS drive is Disk5 which we know is the booted OS because of the presence of the Boot flag, and boots itself from C drive itself as evidenced by the System and Active flags on C.&nbsp; This is OK but not optimal.&nbsp;
 First, the drive with the bootable OS will boot faster if it's the first drive in order because all those other drives are causing it to pause to query each, and spend extra time querying the errant Active drive D, and EFI System drive if this is a UEFI system
 that's set to also boot legacy drives.&nbsp; Second, if this is a UEFI system using the new replacement for BIOS the OS should optimally be installed to UEFI and not Legacy to take advantage of enhanced drive security, boot level mouse support and other features
 of the modern UEFI firmware.&nbsp; If this isn't a EFI system then the presence of a EFI System partition on a drive is just sloppy and wrong.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to debate whether these clearly wrong configurations are causing your present problem, but in any case they are wrong and would be corrected if there is any concern for Best Practices.&nbsp; Their present condition would
 also be expected to cause problems anyway.</p>

<p>I deactivated the formerly active partition on D:. &nbsp; As for the GPT partition, I'm not gonna change this for now, because that volume is quite full.</p>
<p>Also, I do not recall Windows 10 asking me whether I wanted a GPT or MBR install, so, well, here I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I maintain that, in no event whatsoever, should this affect a BOOTED system. I mean, that it might confuse the BIOS/UEFI, I wholeheartedly agree, but once Windows starts, whatever the "reason" (be it because the BIOS/UEFI chose that partition as
 "start" partition, or because the boot loader from another partition ran the system from this one), then all those points become moot, as I guess you'll agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, on a running system, I really fail to see what incidence code that should not get to execute might have. That's a bit like telling someone that the commented-out commands in some script might be executed nonetheless...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As for the rest, the system was stable yesterday evening, as I already wrote, but when I stopped it, it "rebooted" instead of power down, and I had to manually press the power switch to stop it from going on again. I'll test it again this evening, when I'm
 back from work, and let you know if anything seems different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT: The PC rebooted of its own volition at 8:51am... I see no update in the update history which could explain this, and, once again, I had no warning whatsoever]</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />You don't need to pay anything if you already have your Skype number. The call will be charged to the person in China.
<br />

<h3> rocknrob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 version 1803 April 2018 update broke bluetooth volume control.</h2>
                    <p>My pc automatically updated to the April 2018 update, version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting my PC I notice my volume control via Bluetooth will not adjust the volume anymore. Speakers are Creative T30</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if I am in WMP or iTunes the slider changes the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I use my Microsoft keyboard volume keys or the speaker Icon on the taskbar the slider moves but no volume is changed. However if I slide all the way left the volume turns off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone else having issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or is a Microsoft patch already required?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling driver and rebooting but no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Forum issues</h2>
                    
<p>No idea if I am posting to the right place, but I seem to constantly have problems with the forums and I don't know if there is something I need to do or if my profile is somehow broken?</p>
<p>Firstly, I often actually have issues coming to the forums at all. I can go to xbox.com and go to support, then xbox forums and everytime I will see this:</p>
<p>http://i.imgur.com/trUAFLL.png</p>
<p>I need to actually refresh that same page two or three times to get there, plus I am actually signed in despite it saying otherwise. It can and does also happen when opening new links as well, really annoying.</p>
<p>Then secondly on the left you can see my profile.<br />
Not only does it have an old avatar but it doesn't show any of my Xbox One achievements.</p>
<p>The new profile pic and my Xbox One achievements show correctly here.</p>
<p>http://live.xbox.com/en-GB/Profile?Gamertag=electronicpunk</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>It has actually being going on for a while, only more recently frustrated me due to checking the preview forums, so yeah I have clean installed Windows 10, see on my work computer.</p>
<p>Bizarrely, I have actually also just tried it while logged into my wifes forum account and that works, so I think it is somehow profile related?</p>
<p>Obviously quite an old xbox gamertag, since I have had it I have merged all kinds of hotmail accounts, merged, renamed -- but its all working surely or I wouldn't be able to post at all!</p>
<p>Error occurred posting that the first time of course -- but lets me add that I am surprised that 2 years after the Xbox One launch the forums still show the old gamertags!</p>

<h2>            Screen Sharing does NOT show iTunes videos</h2>
                    Ok. I use a mac with the latest OS and have the latest Skype Update. She is using a pc with the latest Windows 10 update with the latest Skype update for windows. What I try to do is share my screen and play a movie from my iTunes program. When the movie
 starts it plays normally on my screen but on her screen, all she can see is a grey screen. The window that is playing the video is grey on her screen but plays just fine on my screen. I have already gone through Skype setting and everything says it should
 allow her to see the video. I also tried with Netflix and got the same results.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen only on this particular file?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which application are you using to play this file?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to boot your system in safe mode and then try opening the folder having .mkv (Matroska) Format Media files.</p></span>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><strong><span>If
</span></strong><span>the issue does not exist in Safe Mode then t<span>ry to set your computer in
</span>Clean Boot state.</span></p>
<p><span>By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></strong><span><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow
<b>Step 7</b> in the provided link to return your computer to <span>Normal startup mode</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<b>Start</b><span>Collapse this imageExpand this i</span>, type <b>msconfig.exe</b> in the<b> Start Search</b> box, and then press ENTER.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<b>Continue</b>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<b>General</b> tab, click the <b>Normal Startup</b> option, and then click <b>OK</b>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:
</span></b><span>Try to scan your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and
 other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded.
 To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may scan through Microsoft Security Essentials from the link below:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:
</span></b><span>Also I would suggest you to update video card driver for hardware and check if the issue still persists.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:
</span></strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> If you don’t find the drivers in Windows updates, go to manufacturer’s website
 download the latest drivers and install it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<h2>            Start up loop - Blue Screen Error STOP&#58; 0x0000007B --  0xFFFFFFFFC0000034 as second parameter</h2>
                    I'm using a Sony Viao with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I updated an 'asp net 4' something-or-other ... then immediately after the pc came up with errors, shutdown and hasn't booted into windows since.<br />
<br />
Everything was fine before this update.<br />
<br />
Its stuck in a loop where it looks like its starting and then a blue screen flashes up and takes it back to the begining.<br />
<br />
I have tried to boot in safe mode and tried all the other options but nothing works!<br />
<br />
The blue screen says:<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.<br />
<br />
If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Check for viruses on your computer. Remove any newly installed hard drives or hard drive controllers. Check your hard drive to make sure it is properly configured and terminated. Run CHKDSK /F to check for hard drive corruption and then restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Technical information<br />

*** STOP: 0x0000007B (0xFFFFF880009A98E8, 0xFFFFFFFFC0000034, 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000)<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
I do not have start up disks or recovery disks.<br />
<br />
I can not lose the data that is on this PC so doing a clean restore isn't an option.<br />

I've so far spent the last two hours searching and trying things and nothing has made any difference.<br />
<br />
When trying the Vaio recovery alt+f10, it gave me a different message of "os not detected on c drive. cannot boot into windows"?<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            UPDATE<br />
<br />
So it&nbsp; turns out I had contracted the 'Windows Recovery' virus!<br />
<br />
The only way I could log in was to install a new version of windows. Once installed and re-booted, it booted in to my regular account. Once inside it canme up with so many errors that it was just unbelivable! It was also a give-away when the recovery/fix field
 had a 'buy full version' link at the bottom!<br />
<br />
I found this link which explains how to get rid of it <br />
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-windows-recovery <br />
<br />
I had to download the files to usb then put them on the desktop of the infected pc.<br />
<br />
I have been though the process and rebooted and the virus seems to have been removed.<br />
<br />
I am currently running the program that restores the hidden files and I have just seem my desktop return, so hopefully all will be restored back to normal soon!<br />
<br />
Many thanks for the input. Without it I couldn't have narrowed things down and got back in to the OS.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Has this been the case since the day it was installed?&nbsp; It's possible for a user to install something that would just affect their user account, for example software that would auto-start.<br />
<br />
Download this Microsoft tool (autoruns) - <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a><br />
<br />
This will tell you what's set to automatically run for the system and a user, check both accounts and make sure that what's set to automatically start on the slow account is also present in the fast account and if not, try disabling / removing it.<br />
<br />
Let me know how you get on.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jon<br />

 I need them back on my computer where they were!!!! HELP ME PLEASE!!!!! Everything is changed around on my computer and I wish I had NEVER installed Windows 8!!!&nbsp;

            <blockquote>well, if you would stop being so high and mighty --&nbsp; a lot of us had new computers with software already factory installed ( word, Skype, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp; we did not install it from discs and the only reason some of us did a REFRESH
 was because we were told to.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had lost my Yahoo Mail app after doing a software&nbsp; update.&nbsp; I was told that if I did a REFRESH I would get the app back and not lose anything except apps that I installed from discs, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; ......&nbsp; NOT --&nbsp; oh yes, the yahoo
 mail app is back --&nbsp; but everything else is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; no word, no Skype.... </blockquote>
Sounds like you just didn't understand what would happen and what certain things were defined as (windows store apps, what desktop apps were pre-installed by the OEM, etc.) but now you are no longer ignorant of these facts and installing these items should
 be rather trivial.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Microsoft Word came pre-installed on your Windows 8 (not Windows RT) system?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If so that just means that the OEM (the manufacturer/assembler of the system) installed it (from disc, etc.) - it's still "installed from something other than the Windows Store".&nbsp; Sure - *you* didn't do it - but neither did Microsoft - so the REFRESH would
 not include it.&nbsp; Ask the manufacturer how you get Microsoft Office back (if it was included and wasn't just a trial?)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Skype is also basically a desktop app.&nbsp; Just because your OEM also pre-installed it doesn't make it something that wasn't installed via something other than the Windows Store.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro upgrade stuck at 71&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently upgrading my Windows 10 to Windows 10 pro on a Dell XPS 13 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working fine - gradually getting through 'copying files' stage and starting the 'Installing features and drivers' stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has now stopped at 71% overall completion and 91% installing features and drivers stage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been like it for a good 90 minutes now and I'm beginning to consider a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shed any light on why this is taking so long and if I should go ahead and do a reset or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many thanks :)</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Family Features Blocking Chrome</h2>
                    Alright, I connected my account to Skype and as soon as I did that Microsoft Family Features began to block Chrome.&nbsp; I've attempted to get around this by switching to a local account on my computer, but this didn't work and it keeps asking me to verify
 'your account'.&nbsp; This is extremely aggravating because it's never done this before the past three years I've owned this computer.&nbsp; I've also attempted to log in using my Microsoft account but it gives me the same issue.&nbsp; Even when I try to send an email to
 allow me to use Chrome it just says "Sorry, try again later."

<p>Did all you describe, but the chat history I have on my desktop has more history than what shows up after transfering to Windows 10.&nbsp; The Windows 10 Skype seems to only go back as far as April 20, 2017.&nbsp; What gives?</p>

<p>Thank You for reply! </p>
<p>
</p><p>But is there any chance at all to transfer somehow history from classic Skype to Skype UWP? It's only reason I haven't started to use Skype UWP because I need to keep all history.</p>

<h2>            Visual Studio Remote ios Agent Configuration Error</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I am trying to connect to Remote Agent on Mac. I have npm, node.js and homebrew installed. I have also remotebuild installed and it spits out the remotebuild certificate. I have Xcode and iTunes installed and active. But Once I try to connect from VS 2015
 "Tools for Apache Cordova" and input the certificate info I get the following error: Unable to connect to remote iOS build server: Unable to connect to the remote server.</p>
<p>I also tried using unsecure mode and just IP address. When I run remote test on ios terminal i get the following code:</p>
<pre><code><span>ds</span><span>-</span><span>njp</span><span>-</span><span>083</span><span>:~</span><span> aivomac$ remotebuild test</span></code></pre>
<p>Remote build server listening on [https] port 3000 Please view/edit server configuration at /Users/aivomac/.taco_home/RemoteBuild.config. You many need to run 'remotebuild saveconfig' to generate it. You will have to restart the server if you update the
 server configurations. Error: taco-remote test failed. connect ECONNREFUSED 10.0.0.85:3000 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/remotebuild/node_modules/q/q.js:126 throw e; ^</p>
