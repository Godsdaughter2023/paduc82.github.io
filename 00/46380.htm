                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Mail issues

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><b>Did you receive an error code or message? </b></div>
<div>No</div>
<div><b>Please enter the error code or message you received </b></div>
<div>N/A</div>
<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Mail are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
</p>
<p>In WIndows Live Mail, when I create messages to send,&nbsp;when the program&nbsp;has a recognized display name for recipient email addresses,&nbsp;the program won't let me see the email address&nbsp;itself. It instead just shows the recipients display name. This can often be
 a problem, especially when the recipient has multiple email addresses, and I need to see which one the reply is going to. Right clicking also does not help this situation, as there is no option to show email details. Also, sometimes, it would be helpful to
 cut and paste the email address (not the name). How do I change the settings on this so that it always displays the email address.
<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, here's an example: <br />
If I draft&nbsp;a message to John Doe whose email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. <br />
In most email programs, that will display as "John Doe" &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;, so you can see display name and email address.
<br />
But in my WindowsLive Mial program, once it has a dispaly name for an email address, all I see is the display name: John Doe.
<br />
However, I always want to also see the &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; part. <br />
<br />
How do I change this setting, so that it will always display the full email address?
<br />
<br />
Also, if there is currently no way to change this bothersome setting, how can I get in touch with the Microsoft Group who handles this type of issue, so that they can add that option to the program, and so that I can find out once they have added it?

            &gt; <em>when the recipient has multiple email addresses, and I need to see which one the reply is going to.

<br />
</em>If a contact has more than one email address, the one being used will be shown in parentheses after the

How are you addressing messages? The easiest way is simply to start typing some part of the contact's details into the address box.

You can submit feedback at https://feedback.live.com/default.aspx?productkey=wlmaildesktop, but you won't get any reply and you certainly won't be informed if ever they decide to change the current behaviour, which seems to satisfy your requirements if not
 precisely in the way you'd like it to.<br />

            Thank you for the reply.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have specified at my concern is about names and email addresses which are not in m contacts, and that most of my messages are addressed by replying to messages I have received.&nbsp; Many of these are ones which I do not
 want to add to my contacts folder.<br />

            <p>Messages received from contacts who are not in Contacts will have the display name, email address, and Add contact.</p>
<p>If you click Reply, only the display name is seen.&nbsp; You know the email address before you click reply.</p>
<p>If the display name and address were showing in a Reply, it would mean that that contact has more than one address (personl, other, work) for that contact in Contacts.</p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Choose something else to do. Because of your past behavior, you can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t send messages.&#38;quot&#59; I have a clean history though.</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have already chatted with support from both Microsoft and the Xbox team. When using the Xbox app on both my Windows 10 PC and Windows 10 Mobile phone and attempting to send a message to my friend, I get a pop up box with the
 message&nbsp;"Choose something else to do. Because of your past behavior, you can't send messages." It has already been confirmed by two technicians that I have no bans or suspensions or&nbsp;enforcements on my account. The app itself is somehow treating me as if I
 have bad behavior. And there are two ways this was confirmed. Logging in to&nbsp;Microsoft's website and sending a message through the website works completely fine. I was also directed to download the Xbox One&nbsp;SmartGlass app on my phone. I was able to send a message
 with the SmartGlass app. So the Xbox app is not allowing me to send messages. Both the apps, PC and Mobile, are version 19.19.28029.00000.</span></p>
<p><span>Just to add, I don't own an Xbox. I merely have the app and never really use it. It was on August 11, 2016 that I decided to attempt to use it by sending a message to someone I know who owns an Xbox. And upon first use, I get
 a message as if I have a negative remark to my account.</span></p>
<p><span>Would greatly appreciate any help on resolving this issue with the app.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Xbox.com still works and allows me to send a message. I just downloaded the Beta Xbox app. I was able to send the message without any error messages. The official Xbox app still does not let me send a message. If the Beta app doesn't change much, than
 I can only hope that it fixes the issue when it goes live.</p>
<p>Now, I still have to figure out why the messages aren't reaching him. :( &nbsp;(separate issue aside from being able to send a message)</p>

<p>Did you find any resolution to this? I'm having the same problem (missed this thread before I posted, apologies). &nbsp;Are you able to actually play online with a friend - is it just the messaging that doesn't work? That would be ok as communicating with someone
 on a PC isn't really an issue. &nbsp;Still annoying though!</p>

<p>The only resolution I got was using the Beta Xbox app. When trying to send messages I wasn't receiving any messages about past behavior. I can't state anything about playing online as I don't do that. I don't even own an Xbox and I don't play many games
 on Windows apps. I only wanted to try and use the app for communication purposes. I was still able to send a message from the website. I was getting this error from both my Windows phone and Windows 10 PC. But even when I was able to send a message, the recipient
 wasn't even getting it. Not sure on that problem now. But at this point in time, I'm starting to not care about it anymore. It's not working correct for me and I have other means of contacting the intended person. I merely wanted to try something different
 out, ended up failing on me, so no longer really interested.</p>
<p>Sorry I couldn't be of much help, but I haven't gotten much help in this either.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t create system image because restore and efi partitions are not ntfs &#40;windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Windows 10 on a brand new system. But when I try to make a system image it fails. It claims one of the drives in the image are not NTFS. And that right. There is an "EFI system partition and a "rescue partition". And they have nothing in
 the column for fils system (other tools show they are FAT32). But I did a plain Windows 10 install. Why did they end up FAT32 then if NTFS is needed to backup the system? And what do I do to fix this? Can I convert the partitions to NTFS or might I end up
 with a non bootable system then?</p>

            <p>Tried making the image on an external drive with only NTFS partitions. Same error.</p>
<p>I also have two internal drives (one SSD and on HDD) so I tried making the image of the SSD on the HDD. Can it influence that the SSD has unused space (setup by the Samsung software)?</p>
<p>Is there any way to get a more detailed error message (that tell more details)?</p>

                    I have audio jack hot switch problems that will not allow headphones or speakers to work.&nbsp; Only the internal speakers function.&nbsp; The problem seems to be the generic Microsoft HD audio driver disallows the Realtek HD audio driver to not function... Driver
 battles are driving me crazy!

            Hi TnJ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See here how to block a driver that is interfering: 
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />  I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems.  If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1) First try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.&nbsp; It seems that the external jack still does not hot swap, remains in internal speakers.&nbsp; I have a new HP laptop and I am pretty sure it came with this problem.&nbsp; I have been able to get it to feed to a plugged in speaker, but always reverts
 back to internal speaker. All Realtek drivers and functions appear to be normal, however the sound manager does not allow any EQ setting or selection of priority playback devices, just stuck on internal.&nbsp; The blue tooth works fine, I guess I will just have
 to use that instead of headphones or external hard-wired speaker...&nbsp; I had some of this trouble with my old HP Pavilion but the DTS system seemed to offer more control of sources and I could fix this jack problem quite easily.&nbsp; I see many people have problems
 with Realtek.&nbsp; Why did HP change from DTS?</p>

<h2>            How can I block specific apps or games in MS family safety</h2>
                    <p>How can I block specific games in MS family safety or any other way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i want to allow my kids to do homework when they like but limit gaming to a few hours per day. I can see how to only allow specific website but not how to limit games, played using CD's on their login's not on the web. Really i want a list of installed
 games or progammes on the PC and a box to check if a specific thing is banned. its not age specific as some of the addictive time consuming games are for youngsters, ie Minecraft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each has their own login-in and there is one games login, so how do i stop them playing games when they like?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC's are W10 and W7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather not buy third party software.</p>

<p>

                    I just got my windows 7 up and going.&nbsp; Mapped a network drive and installed a networked database program.&nbsp; When I am using the workstation, everytime I try to access the program and sub programs within it, I get a security warning stating that the publisher
 cannot be verified with option to run or cancel.&nbsp; It is the same pop up i get when running a downloaded .exe file.&nbsp; How do I correct this.&nbsp; All I am doing is accessing .exe files on my server.&nbsp; Everytime I access them, I get this warning.

<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>The <span>
file that you try to access from the network drive </span>does not have a valid digital signature that
<span>verifies</span> its <span>publisher. That’s the reason you get the message.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>This is the result of Microsoft trying to protect users from malicious programs. The message will appear for any shortcut or executable that is hosted on a network share.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>To resolve the issue, follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>First, determine what server the shortcut is hosted on.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Tools</strong>, then <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the ‘security’ tab.<br />
Once you are on this tab. Make sure you first click "Local Intranet", and then the "Sites" button. Click it.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the form that is displayed, click ‘Advanced’.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You will be shown a list of sites that are in the "Local Intranet"<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To add your server to the list. Type
<em>file://server</em> where 'server' is the name of your server, Click ‘Add’.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click OK, on the rest of the dialogs to get out of the settings for Internet Explorer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now, <span>you </span>
can create shortcuts that point to that server, and no "Publisher cannot be verified" dialogs will be shown.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> khompewter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way we can be financially refunded because of the toxicity of Sea Of Thieves&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This game is so toxic, and the gameplay amounts to cyberbullying and the audio charts allow people to bombard you with cursing, and they call you pejoratives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you take this feedback to Rare/Sea of Thieves and they are super arrogant and not considerate of their player base in any way that construed recognizing they are CUSTOMERS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would feel some sort of compensation is justified just for the aggravation of dealing with Rare's unwillingness to acknowledge the systemic toxicity in their creation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately not. Online interactions are not rated nor guaranteed and thus aren't qualified for a reason to refund.

            While you can't do anything to stop players from being toxic and you can't get a refund, you can go into your game settings and make it so that you can never hear anyone that you're not in an Xbox Party with. This way, they'll only be able to interact
 with you via the default text prompts that the game allows. Many streamers of the game do this to make sure that rando trolls aren't interfering with what's being broadcast on their stream. Hope this helps!

<p>Well that is an unsatisfactory resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be burning a lot of customer goodwill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether Xbox and Rare can divest themselves of responsibility and say "Your unpleasant experiences are not our problem, even though these are our products and our creations", that is putting a lot of customer ill-will out there without being considerate
 of the consumer journey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly not motivated to recommend or make future purchased in the Xbox technology branch.</p>

All games in North America - regardless of platform - that are rated by ESRB (that is to say, all console games) and have multiplayer components carry the same advisory: "Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB". Every multiplayer game on every platform will
 have bad seeds, and I'm sorry you've run into some. Again, as has been noted, such interactions are not reason for a refund of a game.<br />
<br />
However, as has also been noted, you have the power to deal with that toxicity, by reporting such players using the tools in your console. Everyone has the same tools on Xbox Live, and they work the same for all games.

            You can block and mute toxic players, also report them if needed. I don't think you can get a refund at this point as this is not a qualifying reason for a refund.

            That's a stretch. The product is fine. You cannot possibly control every player's interaction, as people cannot be controlled. It'd be different if the game was inherently broken. It is not.

            In the gaming industry, online interactions have never been guaranteed by the company. Just like in real life, a business can not control your interactions with other customers or their interactions with you. The best we can all do is report a violation,
 ignore the user/person, and move on with our heads held high. Customers that violate a businesses ToS will be dealt with accordingly. You will find this same attitude towards toxic customers everywhere you go. We all need to help to make our public surroundings
 a better place.

<h2>            How to recover lost data from Storage Spaces&#63;</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;I set up a new Windows 8 computer with 4x2TB Western Digital internal hard drives for storage (not system drive). They're set up using Windows Storage Spaces in a parity formation (I think it's similar to RAID 5). In a moment of lunacy, I accidentally
 quick-formatted the drive and have lost it all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have about 1TB of vital information: Pictures / Music / Videos / Documents and also saved settings files for mostly adobe and picasa software. (and Outlook)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a further 500GB-1TB of other stuff which would be nice to recover. I used to use the drives in a HP Microserver (WHS11) before and formatted the drives when putting them into the Windows 8 computer. All the files were saved on a single
 partition (S:) . I've not written anything onto the drives since,</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried using R-Studio, but can't figure out what configuration to set it up to recover from Storage Spaces Parity.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks</div>
                </div>

            I actually completely feel your pain.&nbsp; I just recently wanted to make a couple of simple changes (at least I thought they would be simple) to my setup and ended up deleting over 1TB of media including photos, 200+ movie library, pictures (which included
 my wedding and baby), and videos.&nbsp; I tried every program I had heard of to recover these files and nothing was working.&nbsp; Someone on another forum ended up telling me about a FREE program that recovered ALL of my files, called Testdisk:
<a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk</a>.&nbsp; It's a little difficult to figure out at first but once you do it's a very powerful recovery tool.&nbsp; I basically figured it out just enough to get it to work.&nbsp; Take
 a look through this and see if you can figure it out.&nbsp; If not let me know and I'll do my best to help!&nbsp;

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I recently added 2 3TB drives to a 'simple' storage spaces pool and next day after a reboot both drives were showing error of unrecognized configuration and the only option I get is to 'reset' which erases all the drives data. I downloaded testdisk and
 needed some help on how to use this application to recover both drives. The disks show healthy under disk management as "<span>storage spaces&nbsp;</span><span>protective partition" but don't have assigned letters ie 'F', 'G' etc. &nbsp;Basically how do you scan the
 2 drives at once with the idea of recovering a storage spaces virtual partition as I only see an option to scan to one disk drive at a time.&nbsp;</span><span>I am using windows server 2012 Essentials. Any help you can provide me with using this to scan multidisk
 storages spaces would be very helpful. Thanks.</span></div>

            Hi RBridg.&nbsp; I think you're better served posting on the testdisk forums.&nbsp; I used the program earlier this year and learned just enough about it to recover the files I needed.&nbsp; Since I haven't used it in a while I'd have to walk myself through it, and right
 now the computer that has the drives that I recovered files from has basically crashed.&nbsp; Plus considering the files were on drives that were set up as storage spaces there might be something different that has to be done to recover files.&nbsp; Their forums are&nbsp;a
 bit hit or miss in terms of response, but they have a couple of dedicated members who help users out and I definitely think they'd be able to better help you.&nbsp; Sorry, but hope this works out for you!&nbsp; I really do feel bad, it's heart wrenching when you do
 something like this.

            Storage Spaces uses a propriety form of software RAID and so I found that all conventional approaches to recovery were useless. Also, when suffering this crisis, I found that most reputable recovery companies were also reluctant to claim they'd be able
 to recover everything despite wanting to charge large amounts of money to try. They were effectively wanting to charge me and use me as a Guinea pig at the same time. Things may have improved since then, but I really don't recommend Storage Spaces to anyone.
<div><br />
<div>I have since moved to using Stablebit Drivepool and Scanner and can recommend both. Also easily recoverable if things do go wrong.</div>

    <title>Bungie IS Working on a Title Update&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattkohl101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bungie IS Working on a Title Update&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Linky:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?p=27532174#post27532174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?p=27532174#post27532174</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Urk posted on another website's forum (How do you lazy link with the new set up?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real big quote that confirms the Title Update's existence: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>"<span>None of this is meant to excuse any of the missteps away, mind you. We've already got a fairly significant "postmortem" in the works. Every one of our wounded will get a thorough jab from our bayonets."</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you keep going through the thread, Urk talks more about Halo related things!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the real question is why so long and why so tight lipped about it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the thing is they're giving control to 343i's. Obviously going to slow down the process quite a bit. Who knows, 343i's might even be the ones to actually pull the switch and get the Title Update Live!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not to mention that Halo isn't even their game anymore. They're done with the series completely and are working on a new project. Slows the process down as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I think that the Halo: Reach engine's hugely more complexity compared to 2/3's makes it just that much slower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons are, that doesn't matter. Just knowing that they're working on something to improve the experience for us gamers is outstanding!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bungie rocks, period!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be too, but companies like Bungie are VERY tight lipped about major things they do to the games. I guess Urk has been posting on that website for years and it's definitely him!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was just an off-hand comment on a random forum. They usually post nothing about their Title Updates until the week before they come out. The official announcement should be sometime relatively soon, like the next month or two. I'd keep checking the Weekly
 Updates and hopefully they'll finally officially announce something soon!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing I'm most looking forward to is more Forge World stuff, like a new Forge World map with a whole bunch of different looking palettes and the way everything looks! The thing keeping this game so entertaining and alive to me is the Forging. The only
 annoying thing is everything is gray-ish and looks a lot alike!</p>

<h2>            Projector suddenly disconnects from the laptop during watching the movie</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have new and powerful Asus G752VY with Windows 10 Home. When I connect it to my Sanyo FZ-700 everything is working fine for a while (I use it to watch movies) and then suddenly the projector screen goes black and shortly after that the screen disconnects
 and I need to disconnect and connect my HDMI cable again to make it work again. This issue happens multiple times during the film.<br />
<br />
Never had this kind of problem before. I have up-to-date nVidia drivers, up-to-date codecs and brand new HDMI cable. Therefore, I'm guessing that it's some sort of software problem, not hardware, and most likely connected with Windows 10, as on Windows 7 this
 problem was <strong>non-existent.</strong> Tried different players, same problem, although on All-player it is more rare than on Media Player Classic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to browse the web, but when someone has this problem, they get the answer to "update the drivers" or "change the cable", and both solutions are not applicable to my case. Please help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<h2>            On Skype 8.33.76.40, I&#39;m not seeing the Split View option.  Is there something special I have to do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>If you'd like to move this to the Skype For Desktop subcategory in the Skype Insider Preview category, that would be great, since you've removed the option to directly post there, there's only "Release Notes" and "Access to Preview Builds" available, neither
 of which fit the question I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Skype 8.33.76.40, and I'm not seeing the option for Split View like what I'm reading about in the news.&nbsp; Is there something special I have to do to get Split View to show up as an option?</p>
<p>

    <title>Persistent Fault Bucket errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gpgainsforth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Persistent Fault Bucket errors</h2>
                    <p><span>Dell Support Assist System Events report Fault Bucket warnings from August 2 to today, August 17, 2015, with Event Name: WindowsUpdateFailure3, apparently persistent failure to Upgrade to Windows 10 Home.
 We have Windows 7 and do not want to get into a temporary Windows 10. One of the warnings is:
</span></p>
<p><span>Fault Bucket 94089049, type 20
</span></p>
<p><span>Problem signature: followed by string from P1: to P8 (AutomaticUpdates) to P10: 0</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, when at work on documents, I see small black windows opening and closing.
</span></p>
<p><span>At the end of February this year I wrote for help from the Microsoft Community about a mysterious sequence of
<strong>Application Errors </strong>Fault bucket 25386, type 19 Event Name BEX64 Response: Not available Cab Id: 0... etc. On March 7 I received an email from MS:&nbsp;<em>“We noticed that the question hasn't been marked as Answered yet and we were wondering if
 you resolved the issue.” </em>With no help forthcoming by May, I was sufficiently desperate and stupid to fall for a “Team Viewer” scam but managed to pull out before any damage was done when this fake MS Assistance team requested my credit card number. And
 that ended my search and my frustrations with no more Fault Bucket warnings until now. Thank you for your patience. As I am not at all well versed in IT, I would be grateful to anyone who could "walk" he through a solution. Leo Abroad.

<h2>            May 19, 2011 Update Question</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am wondering if after i get the update, and says that it bricks my system.&nbsp; Microsoft said they would replace bricked systems. Here is the question: Do they replace systems where the warranty has expired? I don't want to update my system, and get
 screwed because i am not covered by a warranty. Does anyone know the answer to this?</p>

<p>The update on the 19th does not cause issues with consoles.</p>
<p>[quote]Clearing up some confusion</p>
<p>Clarification time! The console replacement plan that is the subject of some of today’s headlines is related to a previous update, NOT the system update that has been in public beta and will be deployed shortly.
</p>
<p>The new disc format that is part of the beta has been rigorously tested across all Xbox 360 models and there are no known compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Hope that clears a few things up.</p>

<p>Moreover, users with affected consoles would have <i>already </i>received an email to their address associated with their gamertag advising them that a previous update has caused a possible problem.</p>

            Hi Lawrence, I don;t know what you have tried so far, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer 
<br />
<br />Navigate to a folder with jpg files 
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon (tab), choose large, medium or small icons 
<br />
<br />Then click the Options button at the end of the View Tibbon 
<br />
<br />On the View Tab on the resulting dialog, uncheck 'Always show icons, never Thumbnails' 
<br />
<br />Then click 'Apply to folders' and confirm that 
<br />
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />That should fix this problem . . .

UniBlue shortcuts and the 'Ask Toolbar'...you may<br />
want to uncheck those)<br />

<h2>            Cannot start Alliance of Valiant Arms</h2>
                    When I start AVA, I get the message: Intel 82945(R) is not tested. You may experience odd behavior. Then the logos appear and the game starts. Soon, I get another message: [ava:exe:0x4ad2bbad:0x119a200]:0x005E3DF0:0x005EF72:0x00213160:0x006681AC:0x0066800F:0x006676FB:0x00665CBE:0x0034BEEA:0x007F7ECC:0x007F7F86:0x007F8080:0x00706FF9:0x0033FF98
 Would you like to send error messages to developers by email? I read a solution that this can be solved by the language pack, but I don't have my CD to install with. Can someone give me a link to the download or find a file(s) and upload to a website to download?<br />
