    <title>Windows 10 update has blocked Internet access - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 update has blocked Internet access</h2>
                    Windows 10 ran an update last night and now my internet access has been blocked. Wifi connection is good and internet connection to the wifi modem is good (I'm writing this on my iPad). I have tried using the diagnostic tool, turning off the firewall,
 rebooting the computer, but nothing helps. Please help!

            I upgraded to windows 10 from windows 7 ultimate and first thing i notice is that the internet is connected but the access is restricted. I tried trouble shooter, but it didn't fix it. So I tried to revert to windows 7 to see if I could try again, I did
 and internet access was still restricted. I ended up having to reinstall windows to fix everything and other problems arose which kept me busy. This has happened to me twice and this post is the only thing I have found that relates to my problem. If any one
 can help me it would be greatly appreciated. If not its fine, at least i'll know if I can upgrade with out issues or not.

            <p>I am having the exact issue with the upgrade from windows 8.1.&nbsp; I also tried to trouble shoot without success and reverted back to 8.1 after the failure with the same results. I do not have a hard copy of 8.1 to reinstall, so now I am stuck. I used a family

This is very frustrating. I have been unable to reach technical support for the past four hours. Please advise how to correct this error.<br />

            I'm using W10 for a long time now, and lately I got a problem with it. I was using old version of system, then I decided to update it, so I launched the Windows Update Tool or whatever it is called, I've downloaded the newest version of Windows and after
 a week, system downloaded a mini update that is not even shown anywhere and my Internet connection is blocked, I'm connected to my router but can't access anything. I'm going back to the old version which is making my pc work slower... But I know that I will
 have the Internet access back for a while because update will show it self again and again.

            I also have this problem. my Asus Essentio (1 terrabyte memory) desk top worked fine before the latest (NOT SO GREATEST) Microsoft update. I am hardwired into my router and after updating, (which took over 2 hours) my internet connectivity is gone. Checking
 through control panel shows I have no connectivity, but cannot determine the problem through the trouble shooter. I ended up resorting to the previous Windows 10 version. I have tried updating Windows 4 more times with the same results. Last time Windows updated
 without my consent and locked me out of my term paper. I had to re-write it because I couldn't save changes in Word beforehand. I am so sick of problems when updating. Last update I lost my credentials and couldn't get them back unless reset my previous version.
 I wish Microsoft would get their act together and fix these issues before releasing the latest crappy update. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIX THIS ISSUE BECAUSE MICROSOFT WILL FORCE ME TO UPDATE THIS SUNDAY!

    <title>Xbox One Keeps Signing Me Out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eggsdofly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Keeps Signing Me Out</h2>
                    
<p>The house I live in has 2 Xbox One consoles. Since I am the family member with Gold, my home console is upstairs, connected to my cousins TV while my personal console is downstairs in my suite. For some reason, the console upstairs will constantly sign me
 in, signing me out of my console downstairs in the process. Since they get the benefits of Gold for me being attached to their console, is there any way that I can keep it from signing me in constantly without having to remove my profile from their Xbox or
 change the home console status? Kinect has been calibrated without any of them in the room, I've gone through most settings that I can think of but I have no idea how to fix this issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>New Motherboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonnald  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Motherboard</h2>
                    <p>So I bought some new pc parts, had some hardware failure. Now with the new parts, the main problem being the motherboard, I can't reactivate my copy of windows 10. I went through all the steps necessary to attempt to reactivate it, none are working. I even
 spoke to 2 different windows reps, lets them remote control my desktop and watch them do the exact same steps I already went through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They then give me 3 options.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>1. Rebuild my old pc to get the product key off of it. Well, since it's broken, that's not actually an option.</p>
<p>2. Give them a receipt/invoice for the copy of windows 8 I upgraded off of. Which was around 5-7 years ago. I don't have nor would have I ever held onto a receipt for a product I no longer use for that long. And the receipt/invoice for the old Motherboard
 I used, which I actually do have since newegg seems better at keeping records than Microsoft apparently.</p>
<p>3. Buy a new copy of windows 10. I'm not doing that. There is no reason I should have to pay for this software twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't they simply check my account to verify I own a legit copy of windows 10, check with me to verify that yes I AM that person, and then simply activate my copy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>They should have all the records for when I installed/activated it in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update - I said screw it and bought a key off ebay. This is still a terrible system. There is no reason the OS should be limited to specific hardware. Hardware breaks, it's actually a relatively common thing, which I'm sure they know about. This is just
 a way for them to milk their customers to buy their product more.</p>

            Hello Leonnald
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, my name is G.Paz, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />When installing Windows 10, the digital license associates itself with your device's hardware. So, if you make significant changes, Windows will no longer find a license that matches your computer.
<br />In order to solve this issue, you can follow the steps on the link below: 
<br />

<br />
<br />Let me know if that work for you. Good luck!!

<p>How did you obtain your Windows 10 licence originally. Was it part of the free upgrade, was the original licence or Windows 10 licence installed by the manufacturer of the device. (OEM)</p>
<p>If it is OEM it cannot be transferred to new hardware (motherboard). You nee to buy a new licence.</p>
<p>If it is retail then you may need to licence key or contact Chat Support, during office hours.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When the free upgrade to 10 was done, it assumed the license of the Windows version that was upgraded.&nbsp; &nbsp;In your case this was undoubtedly an OEM license, which is tied to the original hardware it was installed on.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, one of the conditions of the free
 upgrade to 10 was that it would be free for the life of the computer where the upgrade took place.&nbsp; New motherboard = new computer insofar as the licensing terms are concerned.&nbsp; Your ignorance of the license terms doesn't affect the enforcement of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you had "solved" the situation by buying a key on eBay.&nbsp; This will soon put you in the same boat because those keys are always bogus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Diane
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Media usage rights are permissions to use a protected file in a particular way. Windows Media Player, as well as some online stores and devices, support or use a type of DRM known as Windows Media Digital Rights Management. I would suggest you to refer
 to the below provided links and use the steps provided to resolve the issue-</div>
<div>You may refer to the sections how do I download or restore media usage rights -<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Windows-Media-Player-DRM-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Windows-Media-Player-DRM-frequently-asked-questions</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Please refer to the below mentioned link to resolve the issue:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929642</a></div>
<div>The steps mentioned in the link are for Zune, but it holds good for all Digital Rights Management issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> On a Windows 7-based computer, you must run Internet Explorer as an administrator before you update the security component of Windows Media Player 12. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<div>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>All Programs</strong>.<br />
Right-click Internet Explorer, and then click <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong> You can also try the <span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=105000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ResetDRM Tool</a></span> and see if the issue can be resolved.</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You have an issue with accessing the directory on the computer. </span><span>It must be difficult for you. We will work as a team and get this sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<p><span>Please answer these questions-</span></p>

<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you trying to access the path through “Run”?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you able to access the path after removing the space between “dir” and “%”?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1–</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1-</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You need to check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span> </strong></p>

<p><span>Note: Make sure you get the computer back to Normal Mode after performing the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Proceed to Step 2, if the issue does not occur in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2-</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform a Clean Boot.<br />
<br />
Placing the computer in a Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to perform the steps from the article-<br />
<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: You need to follow Step 3 from the article to get the computer back to Normal Startup after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2-</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Since the issue is pretty recent, I would have you perform a System Restore to undo the changes made on the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the articles-</span></p>

            There are two answers to your question:<br />
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">To reset your password: </span>Use your Windows Repair CD to boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode, then perform a System Restore to set Windows back to a point well before you set the new password.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">To prevent this from ever happening again:&nbsp; </span>
Running a computer with a single admin account is about as risky as having just one single a car key. Why not plan ahead and create, test and document a.second admin account?<br />

<div>Please don't SHOUT! we can hear you perfectly well in normal case :)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From what you say, it's possible that when you used the recovery disks to reinstall the OS, it also installed another AV - did you uninstall it, and run the manufacturer's removal tool before attempting to install AVG?</div>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fsutil<span><span>&nbsp;</span>is a command-line utility that you can use to perform many FAT and NTFS file system related tasks, such as managing reparse points, managing sparse files, dismounting a volume, or extending a volume. For us to isolate the issue,
 we suggest that you start your PC in safe mode. Please refer to this article on how to do it:

<p>
</p><p>After running the command you provided, pdf files can now be safely associated to Microsoft Edge (opens when double clicking). However, the other apps like Photos, Drawboard PDF still doesn't work. It seems the last command was focusing only on 'SystemApps'
 which excluded apps such as Photos and Drawboard PDF.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. It worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually reset both the Photos and Drawboard PDF app and now they opens without any problem when I double click any file associated to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I maybe asking too much, but is there a way to batch reset all the apps? I can certainly reset all of them one by one. But it would be wonderful if there's a powershell command or something similar to do this all at once.</p>
<p>

            The only PS command I know happens to be the one provided earlier in the thread, that re-registers all the Store apps. Don't know of any that specifically triggers for all apps whatever it is the Reset button does.

<h2>            Audio Problems with IDT 92HDxxx HD Audio &#40;Dell Latitude E5520&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have audio problems with the Win 10 final release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Latitude E5520</p>
<p>IDT 92HDxxx HD Audio</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If I use the built-in Win 10 driver ("High Definition Audio Device") I can hear speakers/headphone, and switching between speakers and headphones works fine BUT my laptop microphone IS NOT usable ("Not plugged in").</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If I use the latest driver from Dell (IDT 92HDxxx HD Audio Driver) I can initially hear through speakers but as soon as I plug in headphones I can't switch back to speakers (i.e. switching between speakers and headphones does NOT work) and my
 laptop microphone DOES work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be happy to provide more info and to assist in debugging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated,</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span><span> </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if this helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method1:</strong> Try to uninstall and re-install the&nbsp;Audio drivers. </p>

            <p>I'm experiencing exactly the same problem. <br />
<br />
I got a partial resolution&nbsp;using the old Windows 7 ITD drivers (IDT 92HDxxx HD Audio V.1.16.0 A03&nbsp; Dated: 21 March 2011, downloadable from the Dell site)&nbsp;With those I can get the microphone array working&nbsp; and see multiple ports in the device manager. However
 as above&nbsp;I have the same problem&nbsp;as John, in that using headphones appears to be a one way thing, and to get back to speakers requires a reboot.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Using the default drivers windows 10 defaults to,&nbsp;the only audio input and output devices shown in Device Manager are&nbsp;are the speakers, no microphone array is detected.<br />
<br />
The hardware ID's for the audio are<br />
HDAUDIO\FUNC_01&amp;VEN_111D&amp;DEV_76E7&amp;SUBSYS_1028049A&amp;REV_1001<br />
HDAUDIO\FUNC_01&amp;VEN_111D&amp;DEV_76E7&amp;SUBSYS_1028049A</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there's an update soon, seriously considering rolling back to Windows 7.</p>

            I am having this issue with my Dell Latitude E5520.&nbsp; Audio was working last week and then all of the sudden I no longer get audio out of my speakers.&nbsp; Haven't had a chance to try headphones yet.&nbsp; I tried several different drivers for IDT, but nothing has
 changed.&nbsp; Anyone come up with anything else to try?

<p>
</p><p>No it has not been resolved. Nothing has changed (see my 1st post that started this thread for a description of the problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After each Win 10 roll-up update I have switched back and forth between the built-in Win 10 audio driver and the latest IDT driver from Dell, but neither works any better than before. I wish Microsoft and/or Dell could make some progress on this issue.</p>

            <p>It seems (and I'm not quite sure how, or why) that I've got the speaker &amp; headphones working properly at last. &nbsp;I did a clean install of windows 10, then before setting up the machine fully used CTRL-SHIFT-F3 to enter sysprep mode. &nbsp;From there I installed
 the missing drivers (Card reader, impact sensor, etc.), then finally replaced thethe sound driver - all the files I used were extracted from the latest version of the Windows 7 Enterprise Driver CAB dowloadable here&nbsp;http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/enterprise-client/w/wiki/2177.latitude-e5520-windows-7-driver-cab&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the build on a spare HDD, so it's not something I've used exhaustively yet but from control panel, system sounds I could play sounds through either device, albeit there's a slight delay swapping from speakers to headphones and back. The Microphone
 array also works, but does need manually setting as the default once the drivers are installed.<br />
<br />
Hope the above helps some of you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info Rob_D_</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am using all the same drivers that you refer to in the CAB, though I did not install them in sysprep mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have never had a problem when testing with system sounds, I have found a reliable way to bork the IDT audio driver:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) open Internet Explorer, go to YouTube, and begin video playback (with audio of course) - sounds play through speakers</p>
<p>2) plug in headphones - sounds stop playing, video playback usually crashes</p>
<p>3) pull out headphone jack - still no sound, video playback still crashed</p>
<p>4) refresh YouTube webpage - no change</p>
<p>5) restart IE - no change</p>
<p>6) restart laptop - audio still borked but oddly enough system sounds still work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing the same test in Chrome doesn't completely bork the audio driver but you have to restart the browser whenever you switch speakers/headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Microsoft's built-in audio driver, speaker/headphone switching works fine (including Youtube in IE) but the mic array is not recognized. I would be totally happy to use Microsoft's built-in audio driver if only it were able to recognize the mic array.</p>

<h2>            Folders transfered from Android show as zero size with no files in them.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my Sony Z2 Android phone, I have been moving a number of folders containing photos taken on the device.&nbsp; The files and folders have been moved over WIFI using a Syncing tool on Android that transfers files and folders onto my Windows 8.1 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noted on many occasions that files (particularly those that are in folders quite deep within a folder structure) are not recognised by Windows when clicking on the main parent folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Folder A</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Folder B</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Folder C</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">Folder D</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px">Folder E</p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px">Folder F</p>
<p style="margin-left: 180px">Folder G - Holds 5 jpg files - 1mb in size each&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create this structure in Windows, clicking Properties on 'Folder A' shows
</p>
<p>Size: 5mb, </p>
<p>Contains: 5 files, 6 folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was to copy it from Android, it shows </p>
<p>Size:&nbsp;0 bytes</p>
<p>Contains 0 Files, 6 folders&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried this on a copy of XP that I kept from last year to dual boot, it shows the same thing for the folder structure.&nbsp; Is this something to do with a change in file system between Android and Windows?&nbsp; I note that if I was to copy the files transferred
 from android and paste the exact same folder structure on my desktop for example, the file and folder size is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            What hardware does the OEM license consider as being part of the original system&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've heard that when we use an OEM license to install Windows10 on a system, we cannot use that license on another PC even if the first PC stopped working. So there are two scenarios:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I install Windows10 OEM home edition on a PC and the hard disk fails. When I replace the hard disk with a new one, I'll need to reinstall Windows and activate it with the same OEM license. Is this allowed?</p>
<p>2. Same as above, but this time the motherboard is faulty (let's say it becomes faulty a few months after PC purchase) and needs to be replaced. After replacing the motherboard, can we continue using the same OEM license?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which bunch of hardware does the OEM license encompass? </p>
<p>Alternatively, is there any place where the OEM license rules are explained in plain English?</p>

<p>For the terms of the license the motherboard and processor is the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you replace like for like activation will fail because it will be detected as a different board, the parameters used to identify such a change will still identify it as being different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However replacing like for like (or as close as possible to) can be classified as a repair in which case the Activation call centre can allow the transfer.. If an upgrade then you have to buy a new license. In the Activation screen there is an option to
 enter a new key to the installation on the drive.</p>

<p>1. I install Windows10 OEM home edition on a PC and the hard disk fails. When I replace the hard disk with a new one, I'll need to reinstall Windows and activate it with the same OEM license. Is this allowed?</p>
<p><strong>Yes, that is allowed. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Same as above, but this time the motherboard is faulty (let's say it becomes faulty a few months after PC purchase) and needs to be replaced. After replacing the motherboard, can we continue using the same OEM license?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you replace it with an identical motherboard, it is permitted.</strong></p>

            Hi Kevin.    I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Does the SD card show up in Device Manager and is working there?
<br />
<br />Does it show up in Disk Management when you scroll down the drive map at bottom?  If so does it have a drive letter?  If not right click to assign one.   
<br />
<br />Both above are accessed on Power Menu by right clicking Start button.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>I'm having a heck of a time using my HP Stream. I haven't been able to complete any tasks lately because I keep getting the pop up which says I need to free up some space.&nbsp; I want to free up storage space without losing important files and such. Can I delete
 the BIN file? it's 1.00 FB of space on my C drive.&nbsp; It's in "blobs.bin" and the file name is ; C/Windows/WinSxS/ManifestCache .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't know what VOL file is. I'm attempting to clean things up and when I searched for gigantic files, 6 things popped up that are taking up a ton of space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please point me in the direction of a self-help site or where on the Microsoft web page I can research this and do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            How big is your drive? I see most (all?) Streams have 32GB drives.  Many (most?) people with 32GB drives have been having similar problems.  
<br />
<br />
<br />32GB DEVICES ARE TOO SMALL …
<br />
<br />If you have a 32GB drive, you have my condolences (I just barely dodged that particular bullet myself). 
<br />
<br />MS says that Windows 10 only needs 20GB to install, making a 32GB drive appear adequate. 
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a>
<br />
<br />But, in the “real world” that is not the case. MS and computer builders like to add “free sample” software (aka "crapware").  Over time, add some Windows updates, and system checkpoints and oops, you very quickly no longer have the 6-8GB of space required to do the major spring/fall updates.
<br />
<br />Go to this Feedback and upvote it and do ADD your comments:
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/Vgqfjb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/Vgqfjb</a>
<br />
<br />MS has marked it “We’ve got it”, but that is not enough. They need to be “encouraged” to produce a publicly documented fix for the problem they have created. One option is to recreate a "small drive" version of the Win 10 install that installs core features then prompts you for additional requirements specific to your machine and usage.
<br />
<br />The wiki / article (next link) includes many tips and techniques you can use to free up space on your drive.
<br />
<br />Or, you can bite the bullet and do a clean install of 1709 Fall Creators Update, or even 1803 Spring Creators Update. In the long run, even with re-installing lost applications it may be faster that fritzing around trying to free up enough space.
<br />
<br />If you have this problem, please vote on this feedback to MS: <a href="https://aka.ms/Ilgpij" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/Ilgpij</a>  I am asking that they make repeat update failures a more urgent warning message.

            Hi Tori, you would be amazed how many users of HP Stream ask the exact same question here every day . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only two answers, don't update or backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 a- that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Windows 10 not booting, repair tools not working</h2>
                    <p>When I purchased my current desktop computer, I also purchased the Microsoft Windows 7 Professional. Later on, almost 2 years ago (late August, I believe) the system automatically upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Now, Windows 10 isn't booting anymore, I get a blue screen telling me there is an error 0x000000e and that the file \Windows\System32\winload.exe is either damaged or missing.</p>
<p>Using my brother's laptop, I downloaded a Windows 10 ISO image from Microsoft, created a DVD and booted with it, but none of the repair options is working, as it seems they can't locate the Windows partition, although it is there, as I can see it and list
 the directories from the command line console.</p>
<p>Letter C: is assign to some small special Windows system data. Letter D: is assigned to the Windows 7/10 system running installation (again, I can see it from the command line console). Letters E: and F: are assigned to work files storage only.<br />
Now, in desperation, I decided to install Windows 10 from the DVD I created using the ISO image I got from Microsoft, but I am asked for a product key which I have no idea what it is, as I can't see it because Windows isn't loading.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>The main problem seems to be that the repair tools look for a Windows installation on C: while it is on D:, as I pointed above, C: is System Reserved. Now the question is: why is it not possible to "tell" the repair tools where the Windows installation is?
 Why? Is there any logical reason? Makes no sense to me, unless I believe that is due to careless programming... The very same applies when attempting to install Windows 10 (without the product key) to D: while keeping the existing files and settings - it just
 won't allow to do that.</p>

<p>Just want to let you know that none of the ideas from the article you suggested worked. The option "upgrade this PC now" just leads to installing the Home Edition without a choice. The same happened when I downloaded the system, selecting the Windows 10
 option (for both Home and Pro Editions) — I was given no choice. And it makes sense, as the tool was detecting the Windows 10 Home already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried a <em>radical</em>&nbsp;solution: opened Windows 10 Home Settings / System / About and changed the product key to the one from Windows 7 Pro, and the upgrade started automatically. Took only a few minutes (as the base system was already installed,
 of course.) I should have tried this right after installing the Home Edition, but I wasn't thinking right, and also didn't know that keys from previous Windows versions could be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my PC is now running Windows 10 Pro, version 1703, build 15063.332.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and for trying to help.</p>

    <title>windows 10 is a nightmare&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tanyagomes  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 is a nightmare&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    ever since I installed 10 my computer is getting worse and worse! I cant turn off the touchpad ( I use a wireless mouse). I'm getting the coloruservice.exe error, my computer is crashing all the time, and when it does and restarts I have to manually restart
 several times before it comes back up. and on top of that it for some reason has reinstalled the webroot program that originally came with the computer. I cannot delete it! I have uninstalled it several times but everytime the computer shuts down&nbsp;webroot comes
 back. the computer is now running 2 antivirus programs neither of which can be uninstalled! If I go back to windows 8.1 will this fix the problem? I spent thousands of dollars on this computer and I will raise holy hell if Microsoft does not correct this problem!
 Please someone help!!

            <p>Lets face it.&nbsp; Windows is an absolute mess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I start up my Mac and pretty much everything just works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start up my brand new PC and all of a sudden&nbsp;I need to have a PHD on files and drivers and antiviruses and firmware, &nbsp;and all kinds of stuff, just for it to do the basics.&nbsp; It took about 2 weeks for the PC to stop updating itself every time I turn the
 thing on.&nbsp; Yes At least now windows 10 is intuitive when it comes to turning the computer on and off, but a lot of other functions are stupidly technical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish all those &nbsp;engineers at the&nbsp;monolith called Microsoft could learn to do the&nbsp;basics right.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Forget about voice controlled dodads.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't they try the software out with normal people before they release it?</p>

    <title>Reputation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reputation</h2>
                    
<p>I had a chat with an online representative for Xbox live and they directed me to post my concern/question here. She said this is where I can get a hold of the enforcement team. If this is not the right place, any advice or direction would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p><br />
I am one of those players that seriously only plays Xbox for one game, and that game is Madden. Rarely do I ever play any other game, especially online. All of my feedback comes from the madden player community. Now I can't say that I am perfect when it comes
 to online behavior. I will admit that if someone quits early on me, I do send a message that states "#RageQuit". Can this be seen as provoking; yes. However, in no way is it degrading. The messages I receive back are way worse in nature compared to a simple
 message suggesting one has just in fact raged quit. I feel that because I do not play any other game online, my feedback is based entirely on this one game. If I was to play say Call of duty or Titanfall online, it may even out my negative feedback to madden.
 I have played madden for years and I am usually in the top 1% of the rankings, which means people are in fact going to "hate" on me. People get mad and routinely say that I only run hurry up and have one formation. That may be true for some of the games I
 play depending on the skill of the other person. If one cant stop my multiple reads on one play and it put points on the board, why would I abandon it? Because people don't know how to adjust their defense to force me to another play and become frustrated,
 I receive negative feedback that is not evened out because I don't play any other game online. Correct me if I am wrong, but I didn't think running hurry up or same formation is against the rules. Do people think its annoying and would prefer seeing multiple
 plays? That would be a whole other discussion, but not one that should violate any code of conduct that I am aware of. Could I not send provoking messages? Yes. And believe me, I have learned that now. All the research I have done says that I can raise my
 reputation by playing more online and not receiving negative feedback. I am completely down for doing so, and this time I will refrain from sending any type of message if one quits. The problem I am running into is I seriously can't find anyone to play. So
 my question comes down to, is there any other way to raise my reputation? If, in fact, my messages of "rage quit" do violate the code of conduct then I am %100 okay serving my time in the "avoid me" category and learning my lesson. From what I can see people
 have mainly reported me for cheating and unsporting. I could see unsporting for maybe taunting them after they quit, but cheating? One formation is not cheating. I run into really good players that know how to shut a certain offense down. If I can't find anyone
 else to play, how can I show that I have learned my lesson? If I don't play online for some time to reduce the amount of negative feedback my account receives, how long will it take before I start to see it improve?</p>

<p>Again, thank you to anyone for the insight/advice. I know I am not perfect when it comes to code of conduct, but this reputation thing may just do the community more justice than people give it credit for. Please forgive any typos/misspellings.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that once you get an "avoid me" rep you will only be matched with those of similar rep.</p>
<p>If no one else has the same rep, or lower than you, you are never going to find a game.</p>
<p>I would suggest playing with friends only for the time being, as this "could" raise you rep back to normal.</p>
<p>Not sure if playing privately does raise or lower your rep.</p>
<p>Sending messages to other players is a sure fire way to get them to bad rep you.

<p>It happened to me..If you do anything like send a message to someone they will avoid you. If you get avoided enough time you reputation will go down and it takes a month or two of playing online for it to go back to green(Good). So my tip to you is no matter
 if they rage quit or not DO NOT send any messages to someone you don't know. Whether they're wrong or not, they can report you and it does affect you on xbox one.</p>

<p>The only way to raise your rep is to play online multiplayer without getting bad reports. This can be difficult if there are not enough players with similar rep to fill a game. It is true that your best bet is to try to play with friends to raise your rep,
 and do not send random messages no matter how bad you want to. I suggest that you go to this forum:
<a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.uservoice.com/</a> and look for a topic that covers this. There have been a lot of people on the support forums with the same problem, who want to see the rep system changed and this forum is the
 best chance to see that happen. If you can not find a topic that covers this, start your own.</p>

<p>I have the (at least one can hope) absolutely most abysmally horrid reputation on Xbox 360 I hazard to guess - AND yes my "gamer rating" is, as is proper, 5 stars out of 5 - why? Well, the professionals and the teeming, swarming throngs of...product users...ahem...juridically
 operate by criteria of different order and quality: the "reputation" part is purely the modern industrialized, post-modernistic ape-herd...er, I mean...quantitative majority of consumers...and how their cerebral limitations, er, I mean, how their humanistically
 valuable input, is an artifact of their own Jungian projective shadows, the stuff of the "folk-spirit" of the demos, the "volk-geist", out of which "populistic genius" leaders such as that one eminently forgettable Bavarian hysteric schizoid slavishly enviously
 obsessed with Judaic cultural mastery, - the stuff of the "common man" such people &nbsp;tap into, as members of this fetid, cththonic realm themselves, er, I mean, DERP: "common wisdom" is KING and high-school head-counting is ALL IN LIFE... YEP...</p>
<p>THEN: actual cognitively intelligible, responsibly coherent gamer analysis from those of us not in the routineer strata, uh...or, not oppressively in proletarian fetters, or however the Marxist clerisy has molded the minds of today to think...
</p>
<p>Well, when the horrifically laughable, absurdly comic "reputation" of 99% NEGATIVE - and YES SIR DARN PROUD! (OVER-AGGRESSIVE- LOL, I suppose that is when I actually TRY...then, UNSPORTSMANLIKE, etc. - here the presupposition is to be sporting is to be idolatrously
 mentally unbalanced: is irony and a sense of perspective, a lack of absolutist valuation of merely winning out of all context, and keeping an even-minded proportionality of viewpoint refusing to fetishize mere victory and numbers in a simulacra of simulacra,
 a VIDEO GAME, holding to delusive priorities so petty above other, higher echelons of values - this is really "unsportsmanlike"...? I never cheat, and only antagonize the dishonest, the managerial element knows if ever I was subject to "inquest" due to ironic
 reports from authentic hackers or cheaters) - when my "REP" is then openly set in public view alongside, in apparent incongruity, the golden perfect assessment of the "initiated"...well...I can sit and think and sleep well...IN SHORT... :)</p>
<p>[AND NO I am not an egghead 50-year old, no language insults, I have heard all the crowd-ist reactions imaginable, and do not give a darn... I am 28 or 29, I forget - and my erudition is only a "problem" in places of cultural barbarity, such as Americanized
 Anglo-Saxondom...]</p>

    <title>Need a way to reverse stereo for 2-in-1 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need a way to reverse stereo for 2-in-1 laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have a convertible 2-in-1 laptop, the kind where you can fold the screen 180 degrees to turn it into a tablet. There is a major design flaw in Windows 10 - it does not take the screen orientation into account when outputting audio. If I have my system
 in tablet mode and the keyboard is facing away from me instead of towards me, the speakers are reversed relative to my orientation - the left speaker is on my right, and vice versa. This makes games unplayable when using the device's speakers. This problem
 comes up when I position the laptop like a "tent", with the screen towards me and the keyboard away</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ============</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; / \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Screen &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; \\</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /------- &nbsp; \\==========\\</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; Right speaker<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 should have a built-in way to reverse the stereo output, and an option to do so automatically when the screen orientation changes. My phone can handle such a simple feature - why can't my computer?</p>
