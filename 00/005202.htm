<h2>            Excel XY Scatter Plot Problem after lastest updates installed</h2>
                    <p>I created a series of XY scatter charts in Excel last week with no problem.&nbsp; After the latest update they all look like this.&nbsp; If I recreate the chart within a worksheet, it's fine.&nbsp; However if I move it to a new worksheet, I get the same results as below.&nbsp;
 This is going to cost me hours of work to recreate and update.&nbsp; How do I get the charts to work again?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Rowerjen,<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tested to insert a XY Scatter Plot in my worksheet.<br />
When I change the size of the plot into&nbsp;<strong>0.1*0.1</strong>, I get the same icon like yours.<br />
<br />
Double click the icon or right click the icon and choose “<strong>Format Chart Area…</strong>”.<br />
Choose the <strong>S</strong><strong>ize &amp; Properties</strong>&gt; Change the height and width of the plot to see if the plot revert to be normal.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If the suggestion above doesn’t work for you, please confirm the information below:<br />
1. Capture a screenshot of your Office product name and version via this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What version
 of Office am I using?</a><br />
2. Try to run Excel in safe mode to see if this issue is caused by third-party add-ins:
<strong>Windows + R </strong>&gt; <strong>excel /s</strong><br />
3. Please provide the steps you insert the plot and the Excel file related to this issue to us for test via&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox?tm=1527043803062">Private Message</a>.<br />

<p>Hi Gloria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this on one of the charts, and the option to change the size is greyed out.&nbsp; Selecting or de-selecting Locked under properties does not change this.&nbsp; See first screen shot.&nbsp; Tried to run excel in safe mode.&nbsp; Neither excel/s or excel/safe worked.&nbsp;
 See 2nd and 3rd screen shots.&nbsp; Tried double clicking on the icon while holding down the ctrl key.&nbsp; That didn't work either.&nbsp; Fourth screen shot has the version.&nbsp; To create the scatter plot I:</p>
<p>1) selected the data</p>
<p>2) clicked insert, then clicked the scatter plot icon under charts.&nbsp; This created the graph on my data tab.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3)Right clicked on the chart</p>
<p>4)Selected Move chart</p>
<p>5) Selected New sheet - at this point the chart appears in the format that I sent you, and I can't change the size.</p>
<p>

            Hi JerryLewis,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information.<br />
<br />
For the safe mode: there is a blank space between excel and /: excel /s. Just copy the words I type. Please try again and let us know the result.<br />
Please refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Open Office apps in safe mode on a Windows PC</a>.<br />
<br />
Please help confirm the information below to better understand your situation:<br />
<br />
1. According to your description, you have this problem after the update and no matter creating a chart with a worksheet or moving a chart to a new worksheet works well before the update.<br />
I have tested this issue in the same environment as you: Office 365 ProPlus Version 1804 (Build 9226.2156 Click-to-Run).&nbsp;<br />
I follow the steps you provide: Select data and create a Scatter Plot&gt; Right click and choose move chart to a new sheet.<br />
The Scatter Plot works normally instead of changing to the icon you provide in the screenshot after I finish the steps above.<br />
<br />
Also, I create a chart in the previous version: Office 365 ProPlus Version 1804 (Build 9226.2126 Click-to-Run).<br />
Then I update to the latest version and open the chart, I don’t have the same problem as you.<br />
So this issue may not be related to the Office version. Try to do the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
online repair</a> and see the result.<br />
In addition, the latest version is released as Version 1805 (Build 9330.2078), try to update to the latest version and let us know the result: File&gt; Account&gt; Update Options&gt; Update Now.<br />
<br />
2. We still hope you can provide the related file to us for test via <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/thread?id=4704d214-fc42-4533-9cae-2e279f167975">
Private Message</a> because there may be problems in the file itself.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>It does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled office (now on version 1805 Build 9330.2087); run repair - both quick and full to no avail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running excel in safe mode didn't work until I installed the latest version, and now does, but the chart is still garbled.&nbsp; I will de-identify the data and send you the file via private message.</p>

<p>Apologies for the late response. I understand that you unfamiliar with the steps on how&nbsp;you can&nbsp;make your Calendar events private. Let me guide you on the steps to make your events a private one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that their features were removed when the interface of the calendar has been changed. However, I'm glad to inform you that keeping your events private was retained. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <a href="https://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Calendar</strong></a>.
</li><li>Click the event that you want to change the privacy settings. </li><li>Click <strong>View Details</strong>.</li><li>On the left side of the details screen, you should find the checkbox for <strong>
Private</strong>. Mark that checkbox and then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If you want to know more which features are removed from the calendar, you may refer to the link below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-calendar/some-of-the-hotmail-calendar-features-are-not/429c2c6d-12ce-4038-8a6c-6008b5b87992"><strong>Some of the Hotmail Calendar features are not available on Outlook.com</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps. If you have clarifications, feel free to post back for further assistance.</p>

<h2>            People App No Longer Connected With Facebook - Mail&#47;Calendar Update The Cause&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On my Nokia Lumia 1520, my contacts in the People App used to be connected with my Facebook friends.&nbsp; For some reason yesterday they no longer show as being connected.&nbsp; This applies to Messaging as well- the contacts used to have an icon based on the picture
 associated with the contact that came from being connected to Facebook.&nbsp; Also, I do not see a way to reconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened some time ago (months or years) and it was associated with a disagreement between Facebook and Microsoft, iirc.&nbsp; One or the other (Facebook/People) changed to disable the connection.&nbsp; This was later changed back so that they could be connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that Mail and Calendar were updated on November 20th. Could that be what caused it and I didn't notice the lack of People/Facebook connectivity until yesterday?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else notice this?</p>

<h2>            Is there a solution to the connectivity issues between my Nokia Lumia 920, and the Plantronics Voyager Legend bluetooth headset&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Nokia Lumia 920 phone and a Plantronics Voyager Legend bluetooth headset. &nbsp;The Legend is the latest and greatest in Plantronics line, and the Lumia 920 is top of the line Windows Phone...but they do not play well together.
<div><br />
</div>

ThaneHumphrey</span>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the forum entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be better to contact the manufacturer of the Phone, to verify if there are compatibility issues.</p>
<p>it might be that the head set is not fully compatible with the windows Phone.</p>

<p>What does Plantronics say about this?&nbsp; Quite honestly, their response would be the most helpful.&nbsp;

            Hi KambuiBrown,
<br />You can't top them from trying to recall but if you read the message, recall won't work. It actually only works in very limited circumstances.

<h2>            Only some of slide masters are inheriting whilst others are creating new slide masters</h2>
                    <p>I have two slide decks which are different sizes and have different layouts. The master slides share names so when a slide dropped from one deck to the other it should inherit master slide with same name and reformat accordingly. However, only some of the
 masters are inheriting whilst others are creating new slide masters with a '1_' prefix.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First question is why are only some slides inheriting and second question is how can I fix it so it inherits all the slides with the same names?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have a read of this: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-powerpoint/copying-slides-between-presentations-and/1f4d46bb-c60e-4907-9f0f-a43c06c766e6">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, if you have multiple Slide Masters in a pres, a pasted slide will inherit the Slide Master used by the preceeding slide to the location of pasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice: don't use multiple masters!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

            <p>Hi Rich</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had read you previous post. However, this does not seem to be the case, as some of the slides inherit the new layout whilst some do not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus I have another deck where this works - the only difference between these two decks&nbsp;being the&nbsp; object placement&nbsp;and formatting&nbsp;but the size&nbsp;being the same.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that when the slides are of a different size then it only inherits some but not all of the new slides</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>MH</p>

            <p>Hi Andria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue. Your answer here does not provide any information what to do if I use the account that joined the domain. The TechNet forums DO NOT have any information about this error at all (I've searched TechNet forums for 0x80860006 error code
 that I am getting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am stuck and 100% blocked&nbsp;with the bad Win10 build that I cannot update because of the issue that Dmitry outlined above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Eugene</p>

</p><p>I'm having the same issue and just pushing people out of Insiders to TechNet doesn't make sense. My understanding is that since we are Insiders, we should use this channel for this type of discussion on a pre-realiesed version of Windows 10. Please verify
 if there is any solution for domain accounts.</p>

            <p>I found the solution: </p>
<p>1. Open the old windows&nbsp;store (green icon) </p>
<p>2. Choose an App/Game (not free) and press BUY</p>
<p>3. Press BUY again , don't worry you don't have to buy anything</p>
<p>4. Enter your credentials (user name &amp; Password) </p>
<p>5. When you see the screen with your credit card details STOP - there's no need to purchase anything
</p>
<p>6. Go back to "get insider builds" check if the problem is solved - it worked for me :)

            This workaround worked, however it's strange that we can't link the live account to the domain account anymore. Maybe a different procedure in Win10 compared to Win8?<span>

<h3> sandhurstassociates ltd  say:</h3>
<h2>            TLS Certificate failure at MX Host &#34;hotmail-co-uk.olc.protection.outlook.com&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are working as a Email service provider and sends out our clients Emails.&nbsp; We are Certified Sender Alliance (CSA) accredited Email sender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently we have noticed that some of the <em>h</em><em>otmail.co.uk</em> and <em>
h</em><em>otmail.com</em> addresses do fail the Certification validation at MX Host
</p>
<p>"Hotmail-co-uk.olc.protection.outlook.com"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this affect Email delivery if the sending MTA, requires a TLS Secure connection to communicate between the two?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we have seen this failure, the deliverability of our emails to Hotmail addresses has massively dropped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something Microsoft aware of? We have a slight doubt that It may have something to do with the Certificate failure I mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sample TLS Check Result is added.</p>

<h2>            Check if value already appears in list, but not if it is in a contigous block</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If I have a&nbsp;column of data which contains groups of values.&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be only one group containing any particular value.</p>
<p>e.g.:</p>
<p><br />
aaa<br />
aaa<br />
aaa<br />
bbb<br />
bbb<br />
bbb<br />
bbb<br />
ccc<br />
ccc<br />
ccc</p>
<p>
</p><p>etc.</p>
<p>But I&nbsp;need to highlight (conditional formatting) any&nbsp;cells where the value contained appears in another cell in that column OUTSIDE OF THE CURRENT GROUP.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>aaa</strong><br />
<strong>aaa</strong><br />
<strong>aaa</strong><br />
bbb<br />
bbb<br />
bbb<br />
bbb<br />
ccc<br />
ccc<br />
ccc</p>
<p><strong>aaa</strong></p>
<p><strong>aaa</strong></p>
<p>ddd</p>
<p>ddd</p>
<p>ddd </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the above, all cells containing "aaa" are highlighted because there&nbsp;is more than one group of cells for "aaa".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the formula to determine this please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers<br />
Rich </p>

            <p>Sure!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I should first&nbsp;apologize. I was in a bit of a creative mood earlier, though of course this should never be something which I allow to compromise my giving the most efficient, practical solution to a problem posed on a public forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not there's anything greatly wrong with what I posted, and it will work, though suffice to say that the two expressions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>COLUMN($N:$O)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SIGN(ROW($1:$2)/2-3/4)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>which resolve to:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{14,15}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{-1;1}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>respectively, are convoluted to say the least, and in fact only in there since the use of array constants is forbidden within formula-based Conditional Formatting rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that is not to say that those array constants cannot first be stored as Named Ranges, which are then perfectly admissible as part of CF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, as to the formula, and using the values as you originally posted, this part:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>($A$2:$A$16=$A2)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>simply returns an array of Boolean TRUE/FALSE returns as to whether each of the entries within that range is equal to that in A2, i.e.:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>By reciprocating an array of row numbers for the same range with this array, i.e.:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ROW($A$2:$A$16)/($A$2:$A$16=$A2)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>which is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16}/{TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>we get:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{2;3;4;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;12;13;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!}</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AGGREGATE is a nice function which can be employed as a non-array alternative in many situations. What's more, with the 2nd parameter set to a 6, it will also ignore any errors within the range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the reason for the above reciprocation, since, taking advantage of the fact that division by Boolean TRUE and FALSE returns is equivalent to division by 1 and 0 respectively, we know that only row numbers which satisfy our condition will remain in
 the resulting, post-reciprocation array; those which do not meet this condition will result in #DIV/0! errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first parameter for AGGREGATE is not constrained to just a single value. By passing an array of values, as here (14 and 15) - we can obtain a result which comprises both the smallest and largest value from the above array, such that:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>AGGREGATE(COLUMN($N:$O),6,ROW($A$2:$A$16)/($A$2:$A$16=$A2),1)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>which is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>AGGREGATE({14,15},6,{2;3;4;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;12;13;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!;#DIV/0!},1)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>returns:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{13,2}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>These values correspond, respectively, to the largest and smallest row numbers from our range for which the entry is "aaa".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't got time or space to go into a detailed explanation of MMULT here, suffice to say that, in this use, and with an appropriate second array, it can be employed as a substitute for subtraction, such that:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MMULT(AGGREGATE(COLUMN($N:$O),6,ROW($A$2:$A$16)/($A$2:$A$16=$A2),1),SIGN(ROW($1:$2)/2-3/4))</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>which is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MMULT({13,2},{-1;1})</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>gives:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{-11}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We then add -1 to this value:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{-12}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>since this tells us (ignore the minus sign for now) that there are precisely 12 rows (inclusive) between our first and last occurrences of the string "aaa" within our range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if all of the occurrences of the string "aaa" were in contiguous cells, then of course this would mean that we should have precisely 12 such occurrences. Hence, we also construct:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>COUNTIF($A$2:$A$16,$A2)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>which is here&nbsp;simply 5, and then compare the two results, such that, finally:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>=COUNTIF($A$2:$A$16,$A2)-1+MMULT(AGGREGATE(COLUMN($N:$O),6,ROW($A$2:$A$16)/($A$2:$A$16=$A2),1),SIGN(ROW($1:$2)/2-3/4))&lt;&gt;0</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>which is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5+{-12}&lt;&gt;0</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e.:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-7&lt;&gt;0</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>is clearly TRUE, and so this cell will be highlighted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>

    <title>New Outlook Email Display Format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merlinjr01  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Outlook Email Display Format</h2>
                    <p>Is there anyway to revert to the previous email display. The new format takes up too much space for me. The single line format allowed me to scan emails quickly when looking for a specific response, could see more items listed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not see the advantage (for me) with the new three-line format. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And it seems to slow down my access to email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, (1)&nbsp;I can't scan the list, (2) it takes longer to open and review an email, (3) I cannot moved through email using the up and down arrows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, this is a counter-productive change.</p>

            I agree totally. &nbsp;I liked my Outlook email program the way it was before. &nbsp;The new inbox is much too busy. &nbsp;Also, I get about 60 emails in my Junk folder every day. &nbsp;I only read a few of them and occasionally move a few to other folders if I want to save
 them. &nbsp;Then I delete all the others. &nbsp;I used to be able to do this in one simple step by clicking on Empty. &nbsp;Now there is no Empty to click on when I'm in the junk folder. &nbsp;I have to delete all of the emails in the Junk folder and then go into the Deleted
 Items folder and click on Empty.

            Unfortunately, turning of the reading pane does not change the layout. The three-line format is much too busy and takes up valuable screen real estate, and does not add any significant insight to the email content.

<h2>            HELP&#33;&#33; Synching &#34;caused&#34; a loss of data on not one but TWO HTC PPC680 Mogul&#39;s</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, tech specs first then background of the issues (this IS kind of a long post - I apoligize in advance):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2: HTC PPC 6800 Moguls (from Sprint) (One business, one "personal")</p>
<p>1: HP Pavilion 7940us notebook. 3gigs ram, Vista ultimate (32bit), blah, blah, blah</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Background": The business 6800 is a few months "older" so I had actually been synching THAT one on a regular basis with my laptop (since the laptop IS for business travel anyway).&nbsp; I've had some "issues" with both phones AND laptops lately
 so was plesantly surprised when, for the most part, the new phone (business) and the new laptop seemed to "hit it off" rather well and synch seamlessly; notes, calendar, contacts, Epocrates, everything.&nbsp; Replaced my personal phone (which was a 6700) with another
 6800 and elected to NOT synch until I was more sure about the laptop since I was still having some network issues unrelated to mobile phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, about a week - 10 days ago, I was on a trip and stupidly forgot to bring a charger so left the business phone on charge in the car (it was late) and decided to charge the personal phone via the laptop.&nbsp; (THIS is when all of my troubles
 begin by the way...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the WMDC screen popped up and asked if I wanted to set up a new partnership (my personal phone has a different "name" from the business one); I clicked "NO" since all I wanted to do was charge it.&nbsp; In order to keep my eye on things I kept
 the WMDC window open while I worked on some other things on the laptop (17in screen).&nbsp; The synch bar/symbol never showed (nor did synch center pop up on the task bar).&nbsp; I eventually went to bed a few hours later after unplugging the phone.&nbsp; The next morning,
 went to a bunch of meetings and stuff, made some calls/took notes, checked email, etc. When I returned to the room, I switched out phones leaving my personal phone in the car and bringing my business phone in the room to charge and synch.&nbsp; The next day prior
 to a meeting, received a phone call yet there was no caller ID eventhough the caller was someone who had been added to contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISSUES:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Business Phone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a.&nbsp; After "synch" there is ZERO contact data on phone</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Calendar data matches info from personal phone</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Email data matches info from personal phone (i.e. NADA)</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Notes (call, personal, business) match those from personal phone and ONLY go back to April.&nbsp; As an aside, notes were saved to the mini-card but THAT didn't seem to matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.&nbsp; Personal Phone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a.&nbsp; After "charge" I now have about 20 business (out of 200) contacts sprinkled throughout contact data and am missing some FORTY personal contacts - they are just GONE, no numbers, names, addresses nothing.&nbsp; There are another 10 with
 various fields that are blank (no phone numbers, no names, no addresses, etc)</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; I seem to have some random blend of business/personal appointments; however, NOTHING older than the date of the charge (I changed out the 6700 for the 6800 in Feburary08!!).</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; I somehow have Outlook email info on this phone eventhough I've never setup outlook ON the phone; the TWO POP3 accounts that were on the phone were simply gone (luckily the emails were still on the card).</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Notes (call, personal, business) ONLY go back to April.&nbsp; As an aside, notes were saved to the mini-card, but THAT didn't seem to matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp; Laptop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a.&nbsp; Contact data matches that of my personal phone (NOT what was there prior to charging).&nbsp; Thanks to Microsoft Connector/Live/etc. MSN is now ganked as wellb.&nbsp; Calendar:&nbsp; Outlook calendar appears to be normal PRIOR to JAN08.&nbsp; Between
 April 08 and now, there is a polyglot of appointments with a 2 week gap (the time after the "charge" during which I've tried everything I could think of to recover data).</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Gone</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; Notes:&nbsp; I ONLY have call notes from April08 forward (prior to this fiasco, I had call notes dating back to 2001).&nbsp; I have a few business and personal notes from earlier than 2008 HOWEVER, every single note NOW has a "created date"
 of 07JUl08 (date of charge) - even call notes which, looking at the call it is attached to obviously did not happen on that day &lt;whig&gt;. (Microsoft apparently changed things in MSN as well so notes are not longer supported there).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; "Smartphones" are essentially baby computers - does windows mobile have a "restore" capability built in?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Does "no mean no" NOT apply to software for some reason and if so, did I just miss that somewhere or did I get bitten by some weird bug?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I'm NOT concerned about the laptop - most of the data there was backed up; the problem however, is that although the restoration of business data on the business phone and laptop is 90-95% covered, there was a fair amount of information
 tangentially related to business on my personal phone just as important and the fact that the "charge" even "ate" it off the mini-card means it's gone forever unless I can find some method of restoring at least some of it
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fMSDN%2femoticons%2femotion-6.gif" /></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; How do I keep from reproducing this problem again?&nbsp; (By that I mean, when I go to set-up my personal phone to "synch for the FIRST time; since the phone and laptop STILL say that there have been no "relationships esstablished", how do I
 ensure that files don't get lost between the 3 devices?)</p>

<p>There may be a program out there that can restore the files on the card as long as you have NOT used it to write new data.&nbsp; You will have to search for that.</p>

<p>I don't know what to advise you there.&nbsp; It should not happen if a relationship has not been established.&nbsp; I suppose when you attach a device with no relationship, when the popup appears beginning the process, just click GUEST and it definitely
 will not happen.</p>

<p>"Not built-in but there are great backup programs available such as Spb Backup or Sprite Backup."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trueeee, but those back-up programs ONLY work if you FIRST synch with some sort of computer - which I had not yet done (at least with the personal phone).&nbsp; One of the reasons I'm not worried about stuff on the business phone/laptop is because
 I have Spirte loaded <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fMSDN%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Absolutely!&nbsp; If you did not setup a partnership there is no way it should have transferred data.&nbsp; I have never heard of that happening before .... very strange."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hehee, that's what Sprint, Microsoft, HP, Circuit City (where I purchased the laptop), errr my IT guys, and my IT "geek" friends have all repeated to me.&nbsp; Sprint tech support (in-house and phone) and CC&nbsp;however have actually looked at both phones
 and laptop confirming that NO relationship has been set up, data has been dumped/changed/moved around between the 3 and they're all scratching their heads saying "weird."&nbsp; Microsoft, Sprint, and CC tech support have ALL said that WMDC will synch even if no
 relationship has been established.&nbsp; That seems "strange" to me &lt;shrug&gt;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem with programs that can restore files on card is that I'd have to synch in order to do so; I'm a "bit" worried about trying to do so at this point in time.&nbsp; I guess my biggest question is this; is there ANYTHING I can to at this point?
 If not, guess it's time to "nuke and pave" and start all over from scratch with all 3 - bleh

<p>That absolutely can not happen!&nbsp; If there is no partnership setup then there have been NO files written to the PC that the device reads to begin the sync process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a myriad of devices that I use with no partnerships setup.&nbsp; I attach and setup as a guest.&nbsp; There is never a process for syncing because it does not know what to sync.</p>

<p>Hehehehe, maybe I should ship you the laptop and 2 phones to verify as well then
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fMSDN%2femoticons%2femotion-6.gif" /> lol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I "kid you not" as soon as I realized I had "nothing" on the business phone in contacts, weird changes on personal phone in contacts/notes/calendar/tasks/etc. and even stranger stuff on the laptop, I didn't attempt to "do" anything other than
 drive straight to the nearest Sprint tech center where they took the laptop and business phone in the back (very rare that they will touch a laptop without a card, but even THEY were "intriqued" I guess).&nbsp; 45 minutes later, the guy came back with 2 techs scratching
 their heads and had me go over the "steps" again (and again and again, and again &lt;shrug&gt; lol).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We tried Advanced tech support at Sprint with no luck then I headed home and tried my IT guys then Circuit City (no luck).&nbsp; Circuit City called Microsoft - Microsoft wanted "us" to check for an "alternate/guest" account under control panel/mail
 options (the idea being that for whatever reason, a guest synch had been conducted with a guest account being set-up somehow).&nbsp; There's only one account (well, 2 since I have outlook with business manager), but no "guest."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ANYWAY, I guess what I'm "hearing" is that I'm fluxed with regards to recovering data from the pda's right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for everything by the way - you've been the only person who has given ANY answers that make anything CLOSE to "sense" since this started /whig! lol</p>

<p>I'm laughing as I'm reading your post (the hehehe) because I looked up at my previous post and it read as if I was yelling.&nbsp; To the contrary ... I was saying like an explanation that IT JUST CAN'T HAPPEN.&nbsp; Yet I know it was happening to you.&nbsp; It is so wierd
 because it is NOT supposed to happen nor have I ever heard of it happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, I wonder if the issue is related to the second account?&nbsp; I've not used business manager before ... no need but I wonder if there is a relationship.</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint online - Create Microsoft Account for external Users using work email</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had read posts regarding problem of granting access to emails which are not MS Account.</p>
<p>Earlier there was the possibility to create new MS Account completing working email.</p>
<p>My understanding is that currently such option is disabled.</p>
<p>The question is if there is another possibility to grant access to externals which do not have professional MS Account?</p>
<p>Is the only way to ask them (externals) for their private MS account email address and then grant the access in the SharePoint?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p><span>You can try signing up a MS account with a work email address on this

<p>About sharing SharePoint contents with external users who don't have a Microsoft account or an Office 365 account, there are two scenarios:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; If we share the entire site with them, they have to sign in to SharePoint site with a Microsoft account or Office 365 account. About this feature, I'd invite you to vote for this
<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration/suggestions/32762044-about-inviting-external-users-in-sharepoint-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
idea</a> in our SharePoint UserVoice to submit your feedback and improve our products. UserVoice is best way to let related team to understand customers' requirements. We appreciate your understanding and thanks for letting us know we can serve you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b.&nbsp; If we <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-sharepoint-files-or-folders-in-office-365-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
share files and folders</a> with them, the external user does not have to access these folders and files with an Microsoft account or an Office 365 account. After they click the sharing link from the invitation email, it will verify the user by sending verification
 code to the work email address. You can consider sharing files and folders as a workaround instead of sharing the site with the external user who does not have a Microsoft/Office 365 account.

<p>Are you trying to read the installation disk from a Blu-Ray DVD drive? There are reported problems with these new drives and Office installation disks. Try creating a folder on the new computer and copying the entire disk's contents into the folder (including
 any<em> hidden</em> or<em> system</em> files). Run the<em> setup.exe</em> program directly from the folder. It seems that the disk read problems are usinally involved with the installation program.
 As an added bonus, the installation itself will be faster.</p>
<p>Addendum: right click the<em><span> setup.exe</span></em> program and<em> Run as administrator</em>. It may not be necessary, but it cannot hurt and could potentially bridge over a problem.</p>

<p>Hi Newsjunkie82,</p>
<p>To send from a shared mailbox, we need to have send as access to shared mailbox. If you not sure whether you have send as permission to shared mailbox, you can use the PowerShell to check and assign send as permission as below steps:<br />
a.<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using PowerShell</a>.<br />
b. Run the cmdlet below to check if you have as send as access permission to shared mailbox:<br />
<strong>Get-RecipientPermission -Identity "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" -Trustee "username"</strong><br />
c. Run the following cmdlet to add send as permission of the shared mailbox.<br />
<strong>Add-RecipientPermission "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" -AccessRights SendAs -Trustee "username"</strong></p>
<p>In <b><a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a></b>, to let the shared mailbox show up in your “From” list<br />
1. Log in to your mailbox using Outlook Web App.<br />
2. Click New mail above the folder list. A new message form will appear in the reading pane.
<br />
3. Click the more options menu , and then click Show from.<br />
4. Select the email address that displays in the From field and click “Backspace” keyboard to delete it.<br />
5. Type the name of the user for which you have permission to send email. If you don’t see the name in of the person you want to send From box, you can click Search contact &amp; directory to search the directory of your organization.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear or you encounter any issue when following the steps above, please post back with detailed description, we will give further assistance.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that there are corrupted data files on the system or there was a recent update installed on the computer that affected your Office apps. However, for us to fully identify the root cause,
 we need to gather additional information. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the computer connected to a domain?</li><li>Is this happening to a specific Excel file?</li><li>What is the current version and build number of your Office? To determine which version of Office you are using, click this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, <span>
, we suggest recreating the Excel file and check if you will still experience the same issue. If so, kindly perform an online repair via Control Panel. The instructions on how to do so are posted in this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</span></p>

            I am facing the same problem with MS excel. Anytime I try saving a file with external links, the Excel crashes. Please note, recreating excel file is not an option as it is a large database of our office and is used by hundreds of people everyday. The
 solution above also did not work as the Modify button in Apps was disabled. :(&nbsp;

<h2>            I can&#39;t update my Skype account.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a big deal, but I've been trying to update my skype for like 3 months and every time I try, I get the next error:</p>
<p>https://ibb.co/7SRJP5T</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few things that are not working well and I assume is because my Skype is not updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone can help me out with this.&nbsp;</p>
