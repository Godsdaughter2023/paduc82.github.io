<h2>            access denied to c&#58;drive and to all windows programs.i mistakenley denied my system access to my c&#58;drive</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
This afternoon I tried to install home group. When I did so I got a message that windows could not setup homegroup for this pc. (im not sure if this is relevant, but it is the last thing I did with windows before my problems started.)
<br />
- At this moment when I try to go to c:\&nbsp;i get an access denied message. <br />
- When i go to c:\Users\Patrick then it shows my files and directory. <br />
- When I open a word document from that directory it works (so I have read access).
<br />
- I cannot make a new directory in my home directory.<br />
- When i start for instance&nbsp;mmc i get Windows cannot access...... error code 0x800704b3 After diagnose i get a error that troubleshooter could not start error code 0x80070005. (it happens with all windows utilities.<br />
- When i start safe mode it reboots after a seconds (after it displayed the users)<br />
- When i try to enable the admin account in the command prompt it says access denied.<br />
- when i try to access settings with UAC, it does not respond.<br />
- When i start a program normal (like VS2008) it starts up, when i do it as administrator I get the same error as when im starting mmc.<br />
<br />
I have my PC from Vista, <br />
<br />

            HomeGroup only works for Win7-to-Win7. So I'm not sure what you did. Try a System Restore to before you did whatever it was you did. You can boot with your Vista DVD and access System Restore from there.

<h2>            Win 10 to black screen NO CURSOR on Toshiba Satellite laptop</h2>
                    Installed Windows 10 on Toshiba Satellite laptop (from Win7) and on restart ended up with black screen, NO CURSOR. The computer is frozen after entering the password. I hit F12 (as it says when you turn on the computer) &amp; got to 'Boot Device' but don't

<p>Hi DebraTomlinson1,<br />
<br />
The issue that you are experiencing could be due to a software conflict or a corrupted system component. I'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you referring to the major Windows 10 update (1803)? If yes, have you tried installing all the latest cumulative and security updates?</li><li>Do you have a 3rd party anti-virus installed on your computer?</li><li>Are you getting the same issue on a different user profile?</li><li>Can you send us a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13776/windows-use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot</a></strong> of the pop up message?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, to isolate the issue, please try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></strong>.
<span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1,
 Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista.</span></li><li><span>Try creating a new user profile. <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here's</a></strong> how.
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'll wait for your response.</span></p>

<p>There is no set way of it happening.&nbsp; Everything I go into-whether it be in Excel, email, game or just looking at something.&nbsp; Pop up screens keep coming up.&nbsp; You have to close them and sometimes you lose whatever you were doing?&nbsp; As I am typing this I have
 had several different screens pop up.&nbsp; Sometimes it is the Start up screen, sometime Cortina screen, sometimes just ads and sometimes it is a small box with different actions to be done?&nbsp; It is so aggrevating that I am about ready to go back to windows 7 or
 8.</p>
<p>also sometimes if just moves your cursor off the page.&nbsp; I happens continually and never stops.</p>

<h2>            KB2919355 update fails when it is nearly ready</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have desktop PC. Motherboard Asus P8z77-v running windows 8.1. It has intel core I7 and 32 GB ram. Installation is quite "standard" but page file is not on c-drive because I have 120 GB ssd-drive and it has not enough space for page file, begause it is
 32 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem (I use below wrong terms, because I have translated below terms from Finnish. Os is Finnish, but I use English in UI)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have twice tried to install KB2919355. </p>
<p>Download and install proceeds ok and after installation it asks rebooting.</p>
<p>I accept reboot. </p>
<p>I installs updates ok during shut down.</p>
<p>goes down and starts to configure windows</p>
<p>Everything goes fast until 76 % is reached. In this point it stays hanging for log time.</p>
<p>After log wait it reboots.</p>
<p>Tries to configure windows another time.</p>
<p>Again it reaches 76 % and hangs.</p>
<p>After that it says "Failure configuring Windows. Revering updates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It rolls back long time and reboots several times.</p>
<p>It rolls back to state which was before this update trial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update history is after rollback empty and Last update check is "never".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update KB2919355 was suggested by automatic updates and was only update which was suggested at the time I started the update. So I thing updates were run in right order.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some corrupt files or missing files. I have windows update log and cbs-log but I can not investigate those so properly that I can found what the problem is and how can I try to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BR</p>
<p>Laakspen</p>
<p>PS: I updated brand new Asus laptop also with KB2919355. It went ok, but 2 drivers was removed (Wlan and audio). I found drivers and installed those. Now it works.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>This is now clear.</p>
<p>My windows 8.1 had component store corruption (KB2819355 installation had corrupted it) and it could not be fixed by any tool. Only way to get it working was remove Media Center and repair Windows with 8.1 installation DVD. Almost all programs and settings
 worked after repair. And now it is updated with latest </p>

<h3> i have bill gates  say:</h3>
<h2>            organizing files and folders</h2>
                    I am the only user and the owner of my computer.&nbsp; Mr. Gates and Vista have decided how to organize my personal folders and will not allow me the permission to move them and organize as i wish - I get the message that I do not have permission to move videos
 from my documents folder to my videos folder.&nbsp; I also don't have permission to change other settings on MY OWN personal, private computer.&nbsp; your FAQ's don't answer this issue.&nbsp; I purchased this computer, with your operating system from HP, yet your chat support
 says my product (less than one year old) does not qualify for support unless I want to enrich your coffers by $50.00 per hour - not even knowing if you can help -YOU ARE THIEVES - I HATE MICROSOFT MORE WITH EACH "IMPROVEMENT" YOU MAKE TO YOUR OS.&nbsp; I NO LONGER
 USE YOUR OTHER PRODUCTS AND WILL CHANGE TO LINUX INSTEAD OF GIVING YOU MORE MONEY TO AGGRAVATE ME WITH WINDOWS 7.<br />
ware<br />
BILL GATES, MICROSOFT, WINDOWS DEVELOPERS&nbsp; - this is poor customer service.&nbsp; I use free and shareware products that are as good or better than yours, and allow me to configure and control my own computer - www.openoffice.org is better than MS Office.&nbsp; www.mozilla.org
 for firefox is much better and SAFER than internet explorer. <br />
<br />
GATES and MICROSOFT, you may be big now, but there is a growing backlash and I hope see you fall.&nbsp; Your actions and disregard for your customers and our desires will be your downfall.&nbsp; the more you try and create a monopoly, the more competition you will have
 that will end your rain.&nbsp; <br />

            It sounds like a permissions issue to me - what you want to do can be done.<br />
<br />
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></span></a><span>.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
To fix this problem with the folders, take <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
ownership</span> of the folders or the drive (as an administrator) and give yourself full rights.&nbsp; Right click the folder/drive, click on properties, go to the security tab and click on Advanced and then click on the Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the
 name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for replace owner on sub-containers and objects
 and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; You can now change them from read-only (even if the main folder says they still are read only - you can have access yourself as the owner).&nbsp;
 You can keep them as read-only for other users and guests and even administrators (though they can take ownership themselves and gain access if they so desire and there really isn't much you can do to stop this except protect the folder with a password using
 a 3rd party product.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps!<br />
<br />
P.S. Personally, I'm very happy with Microsoft and almost all of their products and will no doubt continue to use them.&nbsp; Perhaps it's because I've been extensively trained in their use and have few difficulties doing whatever I want.</span></p>

    <title>Computer not showing up on other networked computers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikemen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer not showing up on other networked computers</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 computers on a home network (C1, C2 and C3). &nbsp;C3 is a new machine that was added yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 3 machines are logged in under my microsoft account and have the file and printer sharing allowed for both private and guest networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C1 and C2 are listed under Network in File Explorer and can be accessed on all 3 machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C3 shows and can be accessed on C1 but doesn't even show up on C2</p>
<p>
</p><p>C1 and C2 show themselves on their own Network list but C3 does not</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas of how to fix this?<br />

    <title>Running Outlook Express &#38; old XP files within Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xp-er  say:</h3>
<h2>            Running Outlook Express &#38; old XP files within Win 7</h2>
                    My old XP machine died so I removed its "C" drive as it is OK, &amp; fitted it to a new win7 machine as its "D" drive.&nbsp; I can now see this drive &amp; its folders etc in the new Win 7 machine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I would now like to be able to either run this drive in a separate XP environment in Win 7, or at least be able to run my old outlook express complete with all its identities &amp; folders as before but in this new Win 7 machine. naturally I am hoping that any
 new program will "See" these files and import them with little interference from me. But I am quite happy to manually select them if necessary.<br />
<br />
I copied all the complete outlook express "Identities" folder, - 12.8 gigs worth, from the old XP machine's "C" drive, - (now the new machine's "D" drive),&nbsp; to a new folder&nbsp; into the "C" drive, labelled "Outlook Express Files"&nbsp; hoping that I could transfer
 these to a new mail program within its "C" drive,&nbsp; but no luck. The files are there OK but obviously any new programs which I tried&nbsp; (Mozilla Thunderbird &amp; MS Outlook)&nbsp; would not allow me to pick them up.
<br />
<br />
I now would like to use my old "Outlook Express" if possible in the new Win 7 machine.<br />
<br />
Are you able to help me.<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div>I tried everything except the clean boot. I did not try that because the link you sent me to was for Windows 7/8 but you know the issue I am having is Windows 10. Anyway, the device will pair but not connect. It also gives me a message that the device
 did not install properly. Well, I tried installing it about 15 times and it did not work. I am running out of patients with this OS and seriously considering going back to my old version. Your thoughts????</div>
BTW, W10 sees the devices, says it has paired with the device &amp; tells me the device did not install properly. Please figure this out. If it helps: I am connected to an LG external monitor of which I disabled the sound.</div>
Thanks.

            Since you are considering rolling back 1803 to 1709, you should also defer it from happening as there seem to be issues. Try to install this after a month or two when more cum packs are released stabilizing 1803 further. (Roll back can be done only if you were upgraded during last 10 days i.e. you are within 10 days roll back window)

<h3> mkm1990  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tried to shut down my computer and it froze. Now the desktop won&#39;t load and I get a message saying Windows Explorer is not responding</h2>
                    <p>Original title: <strong>Possible virus?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Windows Vista Home Premium on a Toshiba Laptop. The last time I tried to shut it down it froze (got as far as the last screen showing 'shutting down', then didnt). The next time I turned it on the desktop wouldnt load completely (white screen,
 not desktop icons, can access start bar) and if I click the desktop I get a message saying 'Windows Explorer is not responding'. I attempted to run antivirus scan, but that also froze. I ran Microsoft defender a few times, and it always freezes on C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe.
 While I can access internet explorer, I cant click any links that would open a new page (freezes once again). Finally I still cant do a complete shut down or a restart. If it's a virus, how can I fix the problem when no antivirus software will run?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! I've just moved to the other side of the world, and have little knowledge of computers (but I'm great at following instructions!). The last thing I need is for my laptop to be so stuffed I cant contact home..</p>

<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave File System, Web,
<br />
and Network running (Script and Behavior are also recommended in Ver 6+).<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall<br />
<br />
Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)<br />
<br />
IE - Protected Mode<br />
<br />
IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)<br />
<br />
I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Avast 7.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y</a> &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor's Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />

<br />
=======================================<br />
<br />
Don't type in the sfcdetails command, copy and paste it.<br />
<br />
Many of the files sfc can't fix are not important.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; CMD&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
put the command from below (copy and paste it) into that box and then hit enter.<br />
<br />
<span>findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt <br />
<br />
that creates the sfcdetails.txt file in the folder you are in when you run it.<br />
<br />
So if you are in C:\Windows\System32&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then you will need to look in that folder for the file.<br />
</span><br />
How to analyze the log file entries that the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker (SFC.exe) program
<br />
generates in Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><br />
<br />
That creates sfcdetails.txt&nbsp; in C:\Windows\System32&nbsp;&nbsp; find it and you can post the errors into a message
<br />
here. NOTE :&nbsp;there probably are duplicates so please only post each section of errors once.<br />
<br />
You can read the log/txt files easier if you&nbsp;right click on Notepad or Wordpad then RUN AS ADMIN - then
<br />
you can navigate to sfcdetails.txt ( in C:\Windows\System32 ) or cbs.log ( in C:\Windows\Logs ) as needed.
<br />
(You may need to search for sfcdetails.txt if it was not created in the default folders.)<br />
<br />
=================================================================<br />
<br />
Did you do the memory checks and update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major<br />
on-board and separate device drivers?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<h3> margaritavilleaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            This Blu-ray Disc&#39;s digital signature is not recognised or is invalid.</h2>
                    <p>This is my third blue-ray disc burner purchased in four months.&nbsp; Every time I burn a AVI movie&nbsp; with chapters and menu buttons, from 2 different application tested, the final results says CONGRATULATIONS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of these blue ray burners are also play back movies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep receiving Error message saying "THIS BLU-RAY DISC'S DIGITAL SIGNATURE IS NOT RECOGNISED OR INVALED.&nbsp;" The tech support, of last purchased blue ray burners says it is WINDOWS ERROR MESSAGE and not the blue ray burner since it is the 3rd one I have
 purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In device manager shows all proper files are installed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then why am I receiving these digital signature not recognized.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there someone in the Windows 8.1 community help me with this issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The blu-ray disc will start the movie, you can see the chapters and buttons for play and Scenes to choose, but then the error message pops up.&nbsp; I am sooooo disappointed.&nbsp; Wasted over 7 disc on a 25 pack Memorex BD-R Single layer 25gig disc Set.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>You mean my third Blu-ray drive the past four months.&nbsp;&nbsp;All having the same results as "&nbsp;This Blu-ray Disc's digital signature is not recognised or is invalid. "&nbsp;&nbsp; Make is BUFFALO.&nbsp; Compare to the first two Blu-ray Disc burners/players, BUFFALO came with
 a installation disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then burn my 7th Blu-ray disc successfully.&nbsp; But when I tested it to play.&nbsp; I received the same error message "This Blu-ray Disc's digital signature is not recognised or is invalid. "&nbsp;&nbsp; I then communicated with BUFFALO technician whom said it must not
 be ASUS, LG or BUFFALO device problem but a window's problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, Microsoft Community steps in solving this issued never became successful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I myself felt defeated and went ahead and paid for yet another upgrade in four months on my application&nbsp; PowerProducerDVD&nbsp;from CyberSuites again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tested each of&nbsp;the disc I burned from&nbsp;each burner that was purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They all played perfect.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I learned a lesson from all this frustration I&nbsp;have experienced this last four months.&nbsp; That the application programmer has more power than&nbsp;MS window 8.1 environment&nbsp;programmers since all the troubleshooting with windows never supplied a recognizable&nbsp;Blu-ray
 Signature to be compatible for MS windows 8.1 to play back what we burn on Blu-ray disc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Blu-ray Signature is not necessarily a device driver where we keep troubleshooting by removing and reinstalling device driver.&nbsp; And to think I purchased the&nbsp;brand
 new laptop 4 months ago from the Microsoft on-line store and purchase the new version of the CyberSuites to learn to make my home movies and burn them on Blu-ray disc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this put me behind, my Window 10 previews, updates and testing the environment.&nbsp; I am afraid to upgrade my present computers with Window 10.&nbsp; I may just have to stay within the same laptop I have tested it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really could use some compensation for all the tears and frustration I went through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I new Surface 4 tablet can heal me.&nbsp; Will you please past this email to your supervisors or Microsoft Seniors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not the hardware which is at fault but rather the content. It's similar to visiting a site which security software determines to be dangerous, that is to say, there's a risk of downloading malware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the advice on this site regarding invalid certificates: <a href="http://powerdvd.helpmax.net/en/settings/blu-ray-disc-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://powerdvd.helpmax.net/en/settings/blu-ray-disc-settings/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>DRM which is an acronym for Digital Rights Management may also play a role. If the movie you want to burn is copyrighted, copying it may fail because Blu-ray drives contain copy protection mechanisms which are required by law. See:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray#Digital_rights_management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray#Digital_rights_management</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Blu-ray discs also have signals embedded in them to disrupt unauthorised copying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are third party tools designed to thwart copy protection mechanisms and you can find them easily enough using any search engine. But there's no guarantee that they'll actually work.

            <p>It was still frustrating that the brand new Windows laptop purchased in Microsoft on-line store, with new Installation from CyberStuites, and 3 new different Blu-ray burner/player would not allow me to play what I burn of my home made photos and videos taken
 from simple digital camera's. </p>
<p>
</p><p>No copying of store brought digital movies was ever attempted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had problems making my friends and family's photo's and videos in the past 5 years until Windows 8.1 and Blu-ray disc player's came out.&nbsp; It was still unfair that this error message&nbsp;"&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>This Blu-ray Disc's
 digital signature is not recognised or is invalid. "&nbsp;</strong></span> kept existing with all the troubleshooting and investing and exchanging equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no help until the same company CyberStuites upgraded their PowerProducerDVD application and added the Digital Signature the Windows 8.1 needed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should have provided that.&nbsp; They are always widows updating but failed on their on device detection.&nbsp;&nbsp; I sorry but I am still disappointed by all this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I should not have taken 3 brand new current brand of Blu-rays disc player (ASUS, LG, BUFFALO) all stating it will&nbsp; burn and play your videos,,(saying CONGRADULATIONS after burning them) on your current brand new Blu-ray disc then (giving the error message"<strong>&nbsp;This
 Blu-ray Disc's digital signature is not recognised or is invalid. " to not run on the Windows 8.1 )
</strong>When all three was compatible with Windows 8.1.</p>

    <title>how does one undo permission changes and restore the status quo ante - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardlvnb  say:</h3>
<h2>            how does one undo permission changes and restore the status quo ante in Windows 7, version 6.1 &#40;2011&#41;&#63;  I tried System Restore, but it keeps not completing successfully.</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded a routine update for Adobe Reader, and it had an error, which asked me to change a specific file permission and then re-install the update. I did so, everything seemed OK. Having been taught the new trick, I then proceeded to change permissions
 on a few other files for which I had been receiving "failure" notices on my automatic daily backup. Since then, every software program I have sought to use has not worked properly, and most have outright failed. Bummer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am thinking that I must 'restore to factory settings' and will lose all my data and software settings.&nbsp; Not fun.&nbsp; Appreciate any helpful suggestions, Please &amp; thanks.</p>

            <p>The website got me proceeding, thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounded like a fruitful suggestion and I was eager. I have grown to rather appreciate this system of chat-room question &amp; answer help over the past couple of years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did create system restore disc and I did proceed to boot computer from the system restore disc.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I got the same error, something to the effect of: "System Restore failed.&nbsp; System restore was unable to read Program Files (x86)/HP Digital
 Imaging/Graphics/ar).&nbsp; File information was corrupted in the System Restore Attempt."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Perhaps if I uninstall all my HP printer &amp; scanner software and then try System Restore?&nbsp; Perhaps Restore to Factory Defaults is not such a bad option after all?&nbsp; I would love to know what you think :)&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>I could report also an interesting symptom of whatever is going on with my computer.&nbsp; It will not download any updates or software, it just blinks and does nothing.&nbsp; I had the thought, "well, supposedly I have automatic backups of most of the files in question,
 perhaps even including some system settings (I don't really know, actually).&nbsp; Perhaps I can just do a 'restore' from my online backup service and everything will be peachy?"&nbsp; In the event, my backup &amp; restore software that goes with the online backup service,
 would not work and would not reinstall, so that idea is out.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You can bet I will do a system image somewhere when all this is over.&nbsp; :)</p>

 blocks the unsecure content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to always see the unsecure content by giving up your security, you can set it to ignore the error and "always load the content".</p>

            <p>When in the mood for something else but shooting and fighting off opponents I go to crime puzzle&nbsp;oriented like Sherlock Holmes, have some in transport now.</p><p>Devils Daughther is the latest at about £27, and former Crimes and punishment is rather cheap at about £18. But check out reviews a bit, they seem to be a bit different in what you can do and move around. Devils Daughter is more like open world as I understood reviews.</p><p>Seems that reailers have a hard time distinguish between action and adventure games.&nbsp;</p><p>In my view Adventure would be the genre not involving so much shooting - but seems most list just about everything action in there too.</p><p>I guess that genre would be empty for Xbox, more or less.</p>

            <blockquote> 
 <p>
</p><p>The problem is that on the one hand you say "non shooter based exclusives" but on the other mention The Last of Us, which has shooting mechanics in it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Like Brandiesel1 said, the closest you'll get is Tomb Raider, but considering its now available on the PS4 as well, its no longer an exclusive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But if you can over look the fact that its not an exclusive we could mention loads of story drive games, stuff like Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition (cheap these days), Diablo 3 (again really cheap these days), Wasteland 2, Dying Light, Divinty Original Sin, Ryse Son of Rome &amp;&nbsp;D4.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Like I said, most if not all of them are available on the PS4, but does that really matter? at the end of the day a good game is still a good game, doesn't matter if its available on other platforms.</p>
<p> 
 </p></blockquote><p /><p><br /></p><p>Generally, the term "shooter" references a particular genre, not whether you actually "shoot" something. For instance, the Call of Duty titles are often categorized as either "shooters," or "FPS/First-Person Shooters." The Last of&nbsp;Us would be categorized as an "action-adventure." GTA V is also action-adventure. The Elder Scrolls are RPGs. World of Warcraft is an MMORPG. There are also sub-genres, but when speaking in general, the genre alone&nbsp;will often&nbsp;suffice.</p><p><br /></p><p>The reason I ask for exclusives is because when it comes to games that are available for both consoles, you should always buy it for the PS4, due to the fact they&nbsp;look and run better. The Witcher&nbsp;3, as you mentioned it, runs at 1080p on PS4, but only 900p on the Xbox One. I'm not going to buy it for the Xbox One knowing the system can't fully handle it. Grand Theft Auto V runs native at 1080p on PS4, but has to use dynamic scaling for the Xbox One. Battlefield 1 can't ev

</p><p>The reason I ask for exclusives is because when it comes to games that are available for both consoles, you should always buy it for the PS4, due to the fact they&nbsp;look and run better. The Witcher&nbsp;3, as you mentioned it, runs at 1080p on PS4, but only 900p on the Xbox One. I'm not going to buy it for the Xbox One knowing the system can't fully handle it. Grand Theft Auto V runs native at 1080p on PS4, but has to use dynamic scaling for the Xbox One. Battlefield 1 can't even run at 1080p on PS4 (900p), and it runs at a meager 720p on the Xbox One, which is barely even HD. That's pretty much why I'm looking for exclusives.</p>

There are rules and regulations against such behavior and you achieve nothing by trying to convince XBOX owners that they are getting a raw deal.</p><p>For the third year running, I've bought additional Xbox One consoles even though my first Xbox One was perfectly functional. You could argue that I'm throwing good money after bad, or that I have more money than 'sense', but trust me, if I wanted to buy ANOTHER&nbsp;platform, I'd have the means to do it. Your argument that the PS4 outperforms the XBOX is nothing more than rabid fanboyism, and not even the thrice-recycled likes of The Last of Us would sway me from the XBOX heartland. </p><p>You wanted a system exclusive that tells a

            <p>My PC destroys all!, joke.</p><p>I would recommend Quantum Break, I really enjoyed it. The story was spot on, the gameplay was good and I even enjoyed the TV episodes - they flow well with the game. The only complaint I can see with Quantum Break is that some people thought the game&nbsp;was too short, but I felt like I got my moneys worth because of how well put the story was.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> maximumextreme  say:</h3>
<h2>            Port Forwarding</h2>
                    
<p>I appologize in advance if this is in the wrong area of the forums, but I need help. I had port forwarding on my other pc with no probelm at all, but now since I got a new pc and a new dual band wireless N router the port forwarding doesn't work. I did everything
 the same way as last so I'm not understanding why it's not working. Everytime I hit enable and save after I enter everything in I lose my internet. My router is a Cisco Linksys EA2700 router, and I tried following the manual's instructions on port forwarding,
 but still nothing. I didn't have to set up a static id on the last time, but is it required now with newer routers? Any help would greatly be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>your xbox or PC need a static IP Adress. Look at your Router and look what Adress your PC gets. Then go to DHCP Reservations and give this IP always to your MAC Adress. The Port Forwarding should now take this IP Adress. Then it will work. The Router can´t
 use UPnP so you need to Forward ports. </p>

<p>Port Forwarding only works for 1 IP. Maybe your Router give your PC always the same IP that´s why it worked. And your new PC gets another internal IP.

<p>Please make sure that UPnP and DMZ are not enabled in the router as they can conflict with Port Forwarding. And, the PC can continue to run fine on Dynamic (automatic) IP addresse assignment while the Xbox uses manual (fixed) addressing.

<p>The ports are forwarded. Looking through the Linksys forums people posted that port 53 shouldn't be forwarded. As soon as I deleted that port and kept the other ports my internet started working again. Port 53 was open on the other router that I used to
 own but for some reason with the new EA series of Linksys routers, port 53 must not be forwarded. Anyway, I'm good to go now and no static id is required.&nbsp;Thanks for your help everybody.</p>

            <p>It won't be exactly the same as the Xbox Rewards rebates.&nbsp;Since you're at 5 stars, you would earn an extra 100 points for every $1 you spend instead of just the 10 points per $1.</p>
