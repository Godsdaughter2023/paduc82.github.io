                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When I updated to windows 10 today I installed it using media creation tool. Everything was fine except some of the apps did not work. It said i could not install it. I also play games
 &nbsp;and after the update it was unplayable. Really really laggy. So how do i fix this? (ERROR CODE 0x800F081F. Also my internet connection is perfectly fine i dont know why is it asking me to make sure that i am connected to one. I have tried both online and
 offline installation of the Framework 3.5 and none of them work I don't know &nbsp;what to do at this point.I thought I would go back to windows 7 and it would fix the problem but it won't let me do that either. I tried restoring the computer to factory settings
 thinking that might fix the problem but no it did not. I also went to "Turn Windows features on or off" and selected framework 3.5 but that also did not work.</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f391fb7-b572-47a7-b377-31af0ed786c3" />

            <p>I am getting the same error and same situation like Luka.B whenever I try to install Dot Net Framework 3.5. The only possible way is that to degrade Windows 10 back to Windows 8.1 or 8 and then install the Dot Net Framework 3.5. But actually this is not
 the proper solution. There should be a solution to install the Dot Net Framework 3.5 in Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have tried the solution exactly which you replied to Luka.B but it didn't work either.Please let me know ASAP when the solution is available.</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the problem continues, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix Windows Update corruption errors. To do

            Thanks for a reply but like most answers here it was what I had already tried. This is about the forth or fifth time (past year) after an windows update that my two computers developed corruption. I've scanned them both for viruses (three separate programs),
 used trouble shooting Win programs, the DISM... etc... --- Sometimes the DISM does correct but a few times I get the " can't find source" problem. Being a non Computer Science degree ( I am lucky if I am in preschool with my knowledge) like type, person. I
 wished there was a help that could explain&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;me - in my simple level - how to correct, find the way to fix the 'lost source file' (heaven knows I have tried),&nbsp;I have reverted to (three times) to&nbsp;a Reset as the only way to correct or fix the problem. Needless
 to say this can be a real pain in the **** and a waste of half a day. Did reset&nbsp;yesterday and SFC scan and DISM checks are all good now. Thanks for the thought tho.... Some ingenious peep at MS or anoth

<p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 exactly happens when you try to do the Windows update?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 have you tried to fix the adapter issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you have any issues in connecting to a network on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The error related to the Microsoft ISATAP adapter is ignorable. You can refer the below article for more information on this:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On a Windows Vista-based computer, the Microsoft ISATAP adapter appears with a yellow exclamation mark next to it in Device Manager, and you also
 receive an error message</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;932520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;932520</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any issues in connecting to a network on your computer, I suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the Network Adapter and check if it
 loads the driver for ‚ÄòISATAP‚Äô.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Start. In the Start Search box type "devmgmt.msc" and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Expand
 "Network Adapters", double-click on the entry of the wireless network device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 the tab "Driver", click "Uninstall".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Start. In the Start Search box type "appwiz.cpl" and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Remove
 the entries related to the network adapter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Then
 reinstall the driver with your driver CD. After installing, re-create the connection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alternatively, you can try to uninstall the driver from the Device Manager, then go to the computer or the device Manufactures website download the
 latest driver for your Network Adapter and install it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: I suggest that you create a System Restore point on your computer before uninstalling the Network Adapter</span></span></p>

<h2>            Confused about hardware error or the software error - WINDOWS 10 - MEMORY_MANAGEMENT &#47; KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a Lenovo G500s laptop which I purchased in 2013 (and have extended warranty till September 2016),</p>
<p>Recently, after upgrading to windows 10, that is about 6 months ago, I started noticing slow boot and slow execution of programs.</p>
<p>I also use bulky software like Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, Illustrator and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a error one day mentioning "MEMORY_MANAGEMENT" and restarted the laptop. After the restart, the system was running fine. Also, sometimes it would take forever to boot when I start the system and then I have to press and hold power key and restart again.
 Everything was fine until yesterday, while I was working on my project, I got the following error "KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR", upon which my laptop restarted and failed to boot. It said "checking media... IPV4 [BOOT FAILED], checking media... [IPV6 BOOT FAILED]
 and restarted again and again. I called Lenovo Service Centre and the support team directed me to BIOS to change the boot order. After doing that also I got a message "Boot device missing or failed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to install a TRIAL windows CD to boot up the PC and then when I had to choose the partition to install windows, my hard disk was shown empty! (Capacity: 500gb free space: 500gb). I was shocked, I chose to continue the installation and then ran Recuva
 and found just 40% of my data, in which 20% was either damaged or corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also run CHKDSK and found this:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7353ac4b-75a9-4ea6-a256-c86473b58fa5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7353ac4b-75a9-4ea6-a256-c86473b58fa5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My data is gone and I am unable to decide that the problem was caused by HDD or Windows.</p>
<p>Please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>(PS: After installing windows 10, my hard disk usage was mostly on 100% all the time, I suspect if it was because of wear and tear of the HDD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I need activation for my windows but I don't know how can I get it. My initial windows 8 was original. Is there any way to get previous windows installation key? If yes, please do help.</p>

<h3> rockwell lancer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Show My Desktop Background on Start on Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I've been working with Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter, and I've been attempting to convert it into a workstation that operates in a manner nearly identical to Windows 8.1. I've installed the Desktop Experience, and I've been trying several different
 attempts to show my desktop background on start, like in 8.1, including editing Group Policy settings and adjusting the appropriate registry values. Yet no matter what I've tried, the check box under Taskbar and Start properties that allows you to show the
 desktop background on start is still greyed out, and the OS is activated. It's also worth noting that the start screen can only have a solid colour background; I cannot change it to have a design such as those in Windows 8 and 8.1, though I can change the
 colours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that this is not a critical issue, and the OS is working identical to Windows 8.1 in nearly every other fashion, however, I just thought I would see if there is perhaps another way to solve this issue as it seems as though there must be a way
 to enable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would we greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>

<h2>            have 2 hard drives, with different operating systems on them</h2>
                    
<p>I am upgrading. I took a hard drive from another pc. It has windows vista on it. Am using another hard drive with XP on it as a slave. But it won't recognize the 2nd hard drive other than a shortcut that my friend created. I think it has to do with the group
 policies in Vista? Or is it that the 2 os's won't play nice with each other? I can't reformat either drive until I get a back up on them.</p>
<p>Eventually, I plan to reformat each drive, but want to back up each drive, so I can't reformat at this time</p>

<p>You do not&nbsp;normally take a Hard Drive, with an installed OS,&nbsp;out of&nbsp;one Computer and put it in another to Boot from it.</p>
<p>You may be causing yourself all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>There are Motherboard&nbsp;Hardware Drivers involved for each Computer they are installed with.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>And there are Licencing Rules:</p>
<p><span>If Vista came preinstalled on your Computer, or it&nbsp;was an OEM disk you bought, it is classified as an OEM licence, and is non-transferable.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
The OEM Vista Licence is tied to the original Computer it is installed on, and&nbsp;dies with the Computer.<br />
You can NOT transfer it to another Computer/Laptop<br />
<br />
If a Retail&nbsp;Vista&nbsp;Licence, you may transfer it to another Computer/Laptop.<br />
But, it may only be installed on one Computer at a time.</span></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a set Process&nbsp;for dual-booting Vista and XP, if that is what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>You will have to follow it at the link below:</p>

<p>Its unfortunate this has happened to you but you really should not move your console when their is a disc inside, for precisely this reason.<br />
<br />
Try installing the game to the HDD, it may run off there if the damage to the disc is not too severe, failing that if a friend has the game ask if you can borrow their copy to install&nbsp;to your HDD. Then&nbsp;it may run off your disc just enough to boot up from the
 HDD (again this depends on the damage though).<br />
<br />
The last thing I could suggest is to take the games to a local retailer, many provide disc resurfacing services for a small fee. If none of these suggestions work then as far as I know your only remaining option would be to purchase new copies of the games.<br />
<br />
(And remember never move your console in the future if there is a disc inside, as this will happen every time).<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-6.gif" /></p>

<h2>            USB-MIDI device not recognised or installed properly on Windows 7 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been reading many threads but none was able to help me solve my issue. I am using:
</p>
<p>Windows 7 Pro x64 </p>
<p>Intel Icore 7 processor</p>
<p>Motherboard: Z97 PC Mate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to use my M Audio MidiSport 1x1 but with no luck. I tried installing it multiple times even as administrator and in compatibility mode. I can see the Midisport under programmes but it only shows up as unknown device on Device Manager under USB
 Controllers. On it's properties it says there are no drivers installed. Even auto update or manual update don't work.</p>
<p>USB ports are fine as I'm using a Focusrite as audio interface and all other ports work too.<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried it on my laptop which is running Windows 10 and it gets detected with no problem. Drivers install very easily and the device shows up on sound, video, controllers on DM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed that on device manager on my laptop there are software devices such as Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator, Microsoft GS Wavetable and Microsoft RRAS Root Enumerator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that this is what's missing from my Windows 7 PC? I couldn't find anything similar. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>sppsvc.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kn4fod  say:</h3>
<h2>            sppsvc.exe</h2>
                    <p>Recently,&nbsp;sppsvc.exe, the Microsoft Software Protection Platform, has decided to give my computer a really hard time. For the last day or so, it has been randomly using up most of my CPU, and really bogging down the performance of my machine. The computer
 is an older machine, and is rendered nearly unusable by this constant CPU usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What exactly does the program do that causes it to use so much CPU? I realize the program checks to see if my copy of Windows 10 is genuine or not, but why does that take such a ridiculous amount of processing power? Honestly, I don't see why it would be
 necessary to execute the program more than once. Simply verify a copy of Windows 10 is valid and poof- no need to run the program again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(PS- unsure if this is the right area to pose this question, but this seems to be the most logical topic choice.)</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search, right click Services app to Run as Admin, scroll down to Software Protection to Stop the service and set it to Disabled.  See if that helps.
<br />
<br />If not go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            The program is part of Windows. It is important (to MS) because it confirms you have a valid Windows license.  It should not use that much CPU, but many people have reported that it does "run wild" using 35% CPU or more.

Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

                    <p>I'm sorry to repost the same subject but someone got here before me and it was "done to death". If I ask a question in the current post, nobody will see it as it has been done to death.

<p>
</p><p>I installed YTD and a timer program that would signal me after a set elapse of time. Either program installed Rocket Tab. I began to get the dos window on start up and my pc ran slower and Google and Wikipedia took a century to load. Google used to take
 one-tenth of a second and Wikipedia even faster.&nbsp;I deleted Rocket Tab and the folder in C: programs. But Google and Wikipedia still take a long time to load and all subsequent searches take an extra long time. I went into Regedit and deleted a couple of keys
 named Rocket Tab. It has installed itself in a lot of places. But everything is still slow. Any suggestions?</p>

            Dear Freddie: I have Googled&nbsp; client.exe and rocket tab. And it seems to be a widespread and common problem even to the point where people have created other programs to fix client.exe and rocket tab. For a price. Freddie, why do you, as well as others,
 point out the obvious? What I want is a free fix.&nbsp; I know what I will do and that is use my Windows disc to do a reformat if people on this site do not give me a step by step list of instructions on how to undue the damage done by rocket tab. Freddie, tell
 me that the sky is blue and that water is wet and ice cubes are cold. But hey, the creators of Linux and Windows wrote these beautiful programs but did not include a technical manual on how to fix problems. Bill Gates got rich and the creator of Linux said,
 "Have it for free and......good luck!"

            <p><em>Dear Freddie</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Thanks for the condescending address.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>For a price. Freddie, why do you, as well as others, point out the obvious?</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Two reasons: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You never uttered a word about what measures you had already taken, obvious or otherwise.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You would be amazed to learn how many posters overlook the obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>What I want is a free fix.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Who doesn't?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I know what I will do and that is use my Windows disc to do a reformat if people on this site do not give me a step by step list of instructions on how to undue the damage done by rocket tab.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Is this meant to be a demand or a threat? If this is the way you address volunteering respondents then your chances of someone composing a step-by-step list of instructions are slim.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Skype automatic update</h2>
                    Skype automatically updated the new version and when I went back to the classic version it was fine until the next day when I signed on again it went back to the new version.&nbsp; &nbsp;How can I go back to the old classic version and keep it?

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7fbe0174-084c-4b46-8912-fbff64074f4d" title="RubenH">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There was an issue with the installer of the classic Skype for Desktop 7.40 and lower.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue was in the program that installs the Skype software and not in the Skype software itself.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With that, we strongly advise you to utilize the new Skype for Windows 10. Also, please be advised that there is no option to disable or turn of automatic update. The system will be rolling out the updates and will ask you to install the latest version of
 Skype to ensure we&nbsp;&nbsp;introduce new features, improve existing ones and fix bugs.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Family Safety several bugs with Screen time &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> styx_win  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Family Safety several bugs with Screen time &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently migrated to Windows 10 (from Windows 7 - I actually did an upgrade first, and then a clean install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using 3 accounts and one of them is for my child.</p>
<p>I did not have any Microsoft accounts before, so we created 3 new Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I created the account for my Child, I did it from Windows 10 via : Settings &gt; Account &gt; Family &amp; Other users: Add a family member.</p>
<p>I used the wizard to go through the creation of "Child" type account, and&nbsp;created a new Microsoft account (as my child did not have one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the account was created, I just logged on the computer with his account making sure everything was working fine.
</p>
<p>I logged-off from his account and went back to my account to go and "Manage family settings online" in order to enable some screen time restrictions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my child account I enabled a total of 2:30 hours during week days with a maximum until 9:00pm.</p>
<p>I disabled any Web filtering or app filtering (I am only using the screen time feature - all the other features are disabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then<strong> my child noticed that he cannot access google (www.google.com) or youtube (www.youtube.com).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I started investigating on that with the help of Microsoft support on chat.</p>
<p>We tried&nbsp;enabling and disabling web filtering several times to see if it makes a difference but nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to disable screen time, and I got surprised when I realized that with screen time disabled, my child's account can now access www.google.com and www.youtube.com !</p>
<p>I re-enabled screen time to check that, and sure enough, with screen time enabled : no access to www.google.com or www.youtube.com from the child's account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So<strong> I believe I found a bug with the screen time feature of family safety as it blocks access to google and youtube</strong> (while it has no reason to do so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I noticed, when the child's account is logged in, there are 2 processes that are consuming an excessive amount of CPU : "Family safety Monitor" and "explorer.exe"</p>
<p>Each of those processes is consuming 25% of CPU (actually I have a quad core i5, so each of these processes is actually consuming a full core).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, two last things I noticed: </p>
<p>&nbsp;- the family icon in the task bar does not always appear properly: sometimes the icon is invisible (although you can still hover over the invisible icon, you know it's here, but without an icon). Sometime you can see the little popup notification when you
 hover over it (that indicates how much time left you have) and sometime you cannot see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- when the screen time expire, sometimes if you just log out just before it actually expires and log back it, it will not log you out anymore, even if your screen time has expired: so the child can stay as long as he wants ...&nbsp; another annoying bug ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I do hope we will soon get fixes for those bugs in the upcoming updates, because I think, so far, Windows 10 is a regression when it comes to family safety.</p>
<p>(I also do not like the fact that family safety has to be managed online vs.&nbsp; locally offline on the computer, but that's another topic...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading all that, and please Microsoft, take the time to reproduce the problems and fix them :)</p>

            IF I may add to the list of problems, I would like to inform devs that I occasionally get sent back to the lock screen from my Screen time controlled account while doing work. It just randomly happens. That, and when I run out of time and leave the pc
 running, the computer starts looping between the lock screen and the time's out screen every half a minute or so.

<div>
<p>Here the problems still occur, every time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- impossible to connect to www.google.com or www.youtube.com from my child's account<br />
&nbsp;- explorer.exe and family safety monitor processes are consuming 1 full core each (so a total of 2 cores on my system) when my child's session is open (and not even doing anything)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I also noticed that from the child's session, when you hover over the family safety icon (which is invisible by the way .._)&nbsp; in the notification icons, sometimes it makes the task bar and start menu crash (have to restart explorer.exe). And sometimes
 it even makes the system unstable to a point that you need to reboot (saying that the taskbar and Cortana could not be open while opening a new session and that it will try to start it next time).</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did create a new Child account to test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The outcome is the same : Cannot access www.google.com&nbsp; or www.youtube.come&nbsp; when screen time is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here a bit more details about how I tested:</p>
<p>1) logged in with my account (administrator)</p>
<p>2) created a new child account</p>
<p>3) logged out</p>
<p>4) logged in with the new child account</p>
<p>5) tried to connect on www.google.com and www.youtube.com : it works&nbsp; (as expected)</p>
<p>6) accepted the invitation email to join the family</p>
<p>7) logged out</p>
<p>8) logged back in with the new child account</p>
<p>9) tried to connect on www.google.com and www.youtube.com : it works<br />
10) logged out</p>
<p>11) logged in with my account (administrator)</p>
<p>12) when to family safety setting and<strong> enabled screen time for the newly creates child account</strong></p>
<p>13) logged out</p>
<p>14) logged in with the new child account</p>
<p>15) tried to<strong> connect on www.google.com and www.youtube.com : does not work</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this shows the reproducibility of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did notice a few other things while I was testing:&nbsp;the CPU consumption of explorer.exe and family safety monitor processes was not crazy all the time: on the first login with screen time enabled&nbsp;on the&nbsp;new child account, explorer and family safety monitor
 processes where behaving properly (0 to 1% cpu used). The family safety icon in the notification bar was also appearing correctly.</p>
<p>But then as I started signing out to go back to my administrator account and then log back in with the child account, I noticed that those 2 processes (explorer.exe and family safety monitor) where having a crazy CPU utilization (25% each - which is 1 core
 each on my 4 cores system), and at the same time, the family safety icon in the notification bar is "invisible" (there a blank spot instead of showing the icon).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So in the end, the main issue is still there : cannot access www.google.com and www.youtube.com when screen time is enabled.</strong></p>
<p>And on top of that, explorer.exe and family safety monitor processes often go crazy on CPU utilization, especially when signing out and back in accounts (like signing in the child account, then signing out and signing it to an adult account, signing out
 of the adult account and sign in back to the child account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope you can get a fix for that, because in the current state, family safety is not really usable ....</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After applying <strong>the big November update</strong> for Windows 10 (Threshold 2),&nbsp; it seems that<strong>&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the issues I mentioned before are now fixed</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am glad that the systems now allows proper access to www.google.com and www.youtube.com while using screen time feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Unfortunately</strong>, it looks like <strong>sometimes</strong>, <strong>
the family safety monitor process and the explorer process still go crazy and consume a full core each</strong> (and in which case, the family safety icon in the notification area does not appear, it is&nbsp;"invisible", but you can still hover over the invisible
 area and&nbsp;check when you'll get logged out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed 1 thing regarding the icon for family safety in the notification icon area: when you hover over the icon to check how much time is left (or actually when you'll get logged out), it seems to indicate an incorrect time/date. (like the system
 is supposed to log out tonight at midnight, but it says that it will log out tomorrow at 3PM&nbsp; ( I am in eastern timezone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So some good improvements, but still some work need to be done regarding the family safety feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Winsxs problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have two problems with my winsxs folder. One is that when I open windows explorer, and check the properties it shows that my folder is a couple of MBs. In a few seconds, the size grows to 5 GBs. This&nbsp;happens every time I go into the properties.&nbsp;My second
 issue is the temp folder in winsxs. There are two folders in the temp folder, one is pendingrenames, which is empty, and the other is pendingdeletes which is full of files. I was told that this is a scavenging process of windows, but I rebooted a few times
 and there are still the same amount of files. Is it safe to delete these?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>What you are describing is normal.</p>
<p>Anytime you open a very large folder, you will see the behavior that you are describing where the size is enumerated.</p>
<p>There are a lot of mysteries with the Winsxs folder. It's main function is the Servicing Component.
</p>
<p>There is no real documentation about exactly how the scavenging process works, except to say that the files in the pendingdeletes folder will eventually be removed. All of the files in that folder are older components that were replaced by a newer update.
</p>
<p>I do know that if a recent update is removed, for whatever reason, the files associated with that update will be moved from pendingdeletes back to their original location in the Winsxs folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h3> user-v  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to access some keys on keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly my keyboard started taking multiple keystrokes even on a single press of the key . I checked working out through
<strong>keyboard settings</strong> from my <strong>control panel</strong> and opted for turning on the
<em>bounce keys</em> under <strong>SET UP FILTER KEYS</strong> option.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Though it has enabled to take a single key stroke but now my shift key and the other&nbsp; like
<strong>@</strong> ,<strong>*</strong> , <strong>&amp;</strong>,<strong> _</strong> ,
<strong>+</strong> , etc. are still &nbsp;not working.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am unable to work this way. Please help ! I want to restore the normal functioning keyboard.</p>

<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Boot the computer in safe mode and check if the keystrokes work, if it works fine then place the computer in clean boot stae and check for conflicting 3rd party app or service.</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong>Boot the computer in safe mode</div>
