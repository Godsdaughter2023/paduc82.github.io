<h2>            Skype always showing me as Offline</h2>
                    <p>Hi hope someone can advise,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my friends tell me that I am showing as Offline.</p>
<p>But according to Skype at my end I am Online, and I can change this but they cannot see this change.
</p>
<p>(All of my devices see this change as when logged on as me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot receive IMs form anyone but strangely they can call me and that works fine, but as I use Skype for IM mostly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Online/Offline setting on Windows PC (Win 10 Pro) Mac, iPad and iPhone I can change this setting be it cannot be seen by my friends still (oh I did also try the web version of Skype and got the same result again all of my devices see the
 change as when logged on as me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made sure all devices show me as Online and then singed out of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also uninstalled of all of my devices and reinstalled it&nbsp;and got the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am still showing as Offline to friends :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to of happened since the last update.</p>

<h2>            BIOS problems &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Satellite C55-B5300 laptop that has been on the Windows 10 build program for months now (had Windows 8 when I bought it over a year ago). All has been fine until 3 days ago when a Toshiba Service Station popup appeared with a software
 update for the BIOS. I pressed the button...it reflashed the BIOS...and that was the end of logging onto Windows (it tries to, but "freezes up" after about a half minute in the Toshiba welcome screen. I found a way into the Toshiba Automatic Repair program,
 of which there are several options tabs, and none of the options do any good. The only tab tab that will function correctly is for reloading Windows 8.1 ( new install), which I did. I can now log onto Windows 8.1 . My files and programs are gone, like I expected,
 and the PC seems to function normally, except there is no internet functionality. I looked at the "Device Manager" list of devices and found four devices with no drivers: Network Controller, PCI device, PCI Encryption/Decryptio

            Simply go to your PC/Laptop maker's website and get all the necessary audio drivers from its support page for your unit.<br />
<br />
If you haven't already done it, don't forget to re-install chipset, Lan etc drivers from the same page.<br />
<br />
Or use the disk (CD) that probably came with your machine.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

BTW : msinfo32.exe&nbsp; will tell you all about your PC and its part of XP.<br />

 especially as I can't download it in the first place. It appears to also be causing issues with downloading Adobe Reader, Skype updates and probably others programs.

            <p>Hello SpLawson, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the delete those files from safe mode and check that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access the link below to boot the computer in safe mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists then try to run a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure that the computer is virus free.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>thank you for the reply. I deleted the EmieSite/UserList in safe mode and also when I again started in non safe mode. They are still there.</p>

            <p>Hi Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the EmieSite and EmieUser folders are still there after doing a disk cleanup. I have also found that the MS Update that should have resolved this issue is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and look forward to any other suggestions on how to solve this one. I have also run sfc/scannow with no issues found.</p>

            <p>Hi Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the Emie folders are still there. I looked at the properties of IE and while I had one that was installed as IE10 that was in compatibility mode for Windows 7 (which i deleted from downloads) opening the IE in the program file gave 2 accounts as "Trusted
 Installer" and another as Account Unknown (S-1-15-2-1). The IE that I have installed is in compatibility mode for Windows Server 2008 SP 1. I tried to manually delete how the message back was that this needed permissions from "Trusted Installer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The EmieUser and EmieSite folders seem to be associated with membership to a domain. I did have a few issues with @telstra.com domain and being unable to close an account. I have attached a screen shot that was taken when trying to close the account.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d99cdd149-6000-49b1-a38f-e6840f863030" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I delete the IE that I seem to have, no I don;t know who the trusted installer is. I am pretty sure I haven't had anyone else do anything on this laptop since it was in for repair - by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer isn't in the programs and features, so the fixit can't find it and when I manually enter the product id I am asked for a different string of numbers.

<h2>            W10 - losing ip connection to ISP, drops DHCP and defaults to APIPA  IP address</h2>
                    <p>DHCP and DNS clients are set to automatic and are running, but after a shutdown and restart there is no internet connection and a&nbsp; APIPA&nbsp; default IP address is given. The IPv4 has to be set from Auto to manual and the DHCP server addr input. Then after running
 the network trouble twice and having it 'fix' DHCP, the internet is usually accessible again. Using ATT uverse router and if it is deleted to remake,&nbsp; Networking &amp; Sharing's Make a New Network Connection does not see the ATT router. It is a wired connection,
 not using wireless. Mcafee firewall was turned off to troubleshoot but this did not make a difference. HP P2 computer originally on W8.1, upgraded the network card driver but there is not a W10 version available.
</p>
<p>Everything was&nbsp; working perfect until sometime in early December 2016 and hasn't working since. No additions except windows&nbsp; and Mcafee updates.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. I had already found an article on the web that suggested this same instruction and tried it along with a few others before posting my issue. They did not resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>I was able to hook up my W10 laptop to the same network and ATT router. It connected to the internet without a problem so I started to go through the settings to find what made the difference. Turns out the Homegroup was corrupted somehow? W10 said it needed
 to do a repair on the Homegroup and after I had to recreate a new Homegroup. Once that was completed and rebooted, the HP P2 is now thankfully picking up the correct IP again and connecting to the internet without any issues.
</p>
<p>Why it worked for over a year without an issue and broke in early December remains unsolved. The computer was down for months and took way too much time to resolve as usual. W10 is such a headache.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />    Unstable connections and slow speeds
<br />    Sell your information to 3rd party advertisers
<br />    Insert java or scripts into your computer for advertising
<br />    Often ban HTTPS browsing
<br />    Use basic insecure protocols
<br />    No customer support

<h2>            PC crashes while watching videos</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a refurbished PC which is about 2-3 years. It had Windows 7 on it, then I upgraded it Windows 10. I think, not 100% sure, that since I upgraded, every time I watch a vdo, the PC crashes. Mouse freezes. Cannot do work the keypad either. I am not 100%
 sure that this is the reason. I then have to switchoff the PC then restart it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to happen when I watch vdos even from trusted sited such the BBC. It happens on all browsers, Chrome, Explorer and Firefox. I have, however, noticed, PC does not crash when I watch vdos from You Tube.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled Windows 10 (after doing all the necessary backups, etc) and the same problem is occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be a vdo card problem? Or could it be a monitor problem as I have a rather old monitor? Or is it a totally different issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanx</p>

<p>Hi R Patel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the factors you mentioned play a part in the problem you are facing when watching online videos on the computer. Apart from your graphics card and browsers, other services may be causing the crashes. We'd like to collect additional information to help
 you better in resolving the problem. Kindly answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you encounter any error messages when the computer crashes?</li><li>What antivirus software are you using on the computer?</li><li>Are you able to play local videos without running into problems?</li><li>How did you reinstall Windows 10?</li><li>Have you checked if your drivers are updated?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend installing updates for both Windows and your drivers for the adapters on the PC. See
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a> to know how you can get the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will also help if you disable your antivirus and check if there will be changes when playing videos on the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, check if you have the latest Flash Player installed. Search for the update online and download it through the official software download page, or refer to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3189031/update-for-adobe-flash-player-in-windows-10-version-1607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Ruz San,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I do not encounter any error messages when the PC crashes. Everything freezes. The mouse curser cannot move, nor can any keys on the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I am using Avast Anti virus</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Even local vdos from Google photos crashes the PC. Vdos from You Tube seem to working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Not sure</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. All the drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disable my antivirus, am I not vulnerable to having more problems with the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have the latest version of the Flash Player as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>R Patel</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling your antivirus program on the PC is a way to test if the software causes conflicts when you play videos while it is running. Once you are able to check if there will be changes, you can enable the software again. If you are not comfortable with
 disabling your antivirus program, disconnect your computer from the Internet to prevent threats from getting into the system. You can play locally saved videos to see if the PC will still crash while the antivirus software you are using is turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option you have is to use Windows Defender for the time being. Check if the same behavior will occur when a different security software is running.</p>

    <title>Slow network response for network printers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard in portland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow network response for network printers</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium from Vista. I have a dual boot system with XP on the second hard drive. I performed a clean install on both partitions.<br />
<br />
I have two printers hooked to the network, a Konica Minolta 2300 DL and a HP C5180 all in one. It takes over 3 minutes for a printer packet to start the Konica printer in Win 7 and I cannot install the HP printer as the installation software times out before
 the printer can respond. Both printers ping just fine and the software finds the HP printer on the network, it just takes too long for the network to respond. Pinging the printers brings packet responses in mere miliseconds.<br />
<br />
The Realtek LAN drivers on the Gigabyte mother board are being reported by Win 7 as being the correct drivers. How can I fix this?<br />
<br />
XP computers on this network get network printer responses in about 10 seconds.

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>Do you have the latest drivers installed for the printers?</p>
<p>The drivers I see on the Manufacturer’s website for the devices listed by you are as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-42045-2&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=uk&amp;os=228&amp;product=1153481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-42045-2&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=uk&amp;os=228&amp;product=1153481</a></p>
<p><a href="http://onyxftp.mykonicaminolta.com/download/SearchResults.aspx?productname=Konica Minolta 2300 DL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onyxftp.mykonicaminolta.com/download/SearchResults.aspx?productname=Konica%20Minolta%202300%20DL</a></p>
<p>I don’t see any driver for Windows 7 released yet. However, you may try running the drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>To learn how, see:</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></p>
<p>Having installed the drivers, try connecting to the printers by turning off the firewall. Also try installing the printer softwares. See if it goes successful. Make sure to turn on the firewall later on.
<br />
<br />
If it doesn't, run the <strong>Fix it</strong> provided in the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Fix printing problems by resetting the print spooler</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2000007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2000007</a></p>
<p>If this doesn’t help, then the next step would be to remove and add the printers again.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><strong>Add or remove a printer</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Add-or-remove-a-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Add-or-remove-a-printer</a></p>
<p>This should do the trick.</p>
<p>For other common problems that you might encounter while trying to add or use network printers, including Bluetooth or wireless printers, see:</p>

    <title>Bluescreen on start up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noliam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluescreen on start up</h2>
                    Hey, <br />
I have a Dell Studio 1555 that I just bought recently, and I am running Windows Vista Home Premium 62-bit.
<br />
<br />
I have had a problem where I would constantly get a blue screen on start up, and my system rebooting after dumping physical memory, and the proccess repeats, disabling me from entering the operating system.<br />
<br />
I have contacted Dell about the problem and they suggested that it was because my RAM was fried, so I sent it in about 3-4 weeks ago. Now the problem has come back, only it happens randomly and will eventually go away if I enter safe mode and restart from safe
 mode. <br />
<br />
Please help, I am using this laptop for university and I am worried that one day I might not be able to enter my OS again, losing all of my assignments and data, and a computer to work with!
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

            Hello, to transfer your photos from your phone to your computer, you will need to connect the phone to the computer via bluetooth, or if your phone has a slot for a micro SD card, you may use that also. Once you have connected the phone via USB, Windows should automatically recognize the phone that is plugged in. Now, go to file explorer and see if your phone's directory shows up there.
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions! :-)

<h2>            Skype for business external contacts</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with Skype for business. I am able to add and IM external Skype for business users but not working at all for normal Skype users. All the necessary DNS records have been created and are currently in place. External access is set to On except
 for blocked domains (there are no domains specified) and public IM connectivity is set to Let people use Skype for Business to communicate with Skype users outside your organization. All users have been enabled external contacts as well. As stated previously,
 external contact to other Skype for business users works fine, only regualr Skype users cannot be communicated with. The only thing I did notice was teh domian setup was still saying Setup iin progress</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone point me in the right direction in terms of troubleshooting and hopefully resolving this?</p>

<p>Hi Theodoros Chatzakis,<br />
<br />
Can Skype users receive the notification from the web-based Skype, please follow the steps below to have test:<br />
<br />
1. Sign-in one Skype user in <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype website</a>.<br />
2. Add the Skype user as contact in Skype for Business desktop client.<br />
3. The Skype user should receive the confirmation in website&gt; accept the confirmation&gt; check whether they could communicate via conversation.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, what do you mean by&nbsp;<em>domian setup was still saying Setup in progress
</em>? Could you please provide us some screenshots to clarify this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Huni </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Headphones Won&#39;t Play &#91;Solution&#93;</h2>
                    <p>I hope I'm posting this correctly! I found a solution to my audio problem when I upgraded to Windows 10 and I'm hoping it can help someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For record, I have an HP Pavilion g6, and was upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered when I upgraded that sound would come out of my speakers just fine, but when I plugged my headphones in, they wouldn't play at all. I've spent the better part of 2 or 3 hours trying to figure this out and was getting extremely frustrated, but
 I'm too stubborn to leave well enough alone so I kept at it.</p>
<p>I tried resetting my drivers, reinstalling them, so on and so forth. Nothing worked. In my Playback Devices section, I only had 'Speakers' and 'AMD HDMI Output', which was greyed out and said it wasn't plugged in. I'm not computer illiterate but I'm not
 magic tech whiz either, so after trying everything else I could find on google, I decided to try and fix the AMD, and see if that did anything. I stumbled across this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-PC-Sound-and-Audio/AMD-High-Definition-Audio-Device-Not-Plugged-In-HP-Pavilion/td-p/1501975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just followed the solution just below the question word for word. And now, voila! My AMD is still greyed out, but I now have 'Speakers and Headphones' instead of just 'Speakers' and i also gained 'Communications Headphones'. These are the same playback
 settings I had on my old operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I can help someone out with this knowledge! Have a great day :)</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 700 v2 -- Windows 7 x64 drivers</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just purchased a <strong>Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 700 v2.0</strong> combo for my<strong>Windows 7&nbsp;x64</strong>,&nbsp; that is&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 700 v2.0</p>
</li><li>
<p>and a Wireless Mouse 700 v2.0</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Both keyboard and mouse are working well. The problem is that on the Device Manager they<strong>appear only as HID-compliant devices</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>there is no support for those devices in Intellipoint 8.0 (x64)</strong></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Where can I <strong>download Windows 7 64-bit drivers</strong> for Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 700 v2.0&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <div>My keyboard worked fine and then suddenly it stopped working. This fix worked for me in Windows 8:</div>
<div><br />
Step 1.&nbsp;
<div>Open up this location:&nbsp;<i>Control Panel \ Hardware and Sound \ Devices and Printers</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 2.</div>
<div>Now right click on <i>"Microsoft Wireless Transceiver"</i>&nbsp;and hit <i>"Properties"</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 3.</div>
<div>Click on the <i>"Hardware"</i> tab, click on the driver and hit <i>"Properties"</i> down in the left corner.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 4.</div>
<div>Click on the <i>"Hardware"</i> tab and click on <i>"Change Settings"</i> down in the right corner. Now click on the&nbsp;<i>"Driver"</i>&nbsp;tab and then on<i> "Update Driver Software...".</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>Step 5.</div>
<div>Now the fun part. I do not know how this was in Windows 7 (maybe the same?), but in Windows 8 you will do it like this. Click on "<i>Browse my computer for driver software"</i>&nbsp;and then on
<i>"Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 6.</div>
<div>Now click on the driver&nbsp;<i>"USB Composite Device"</i>&nbsp;<u>NOT</u> on the <i>"Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 700 v2.0"</i>. And click continue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Final Step 7.</div>
<div>If the keyboard is working correctly, then do <u>Step 6</u> again just that you now update your&nbsp;<i>"USB Composite Device"</i>&nbsp;driver to the "<i>Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 700 v2.0"</i>&nbsp;driver. And it should look something like
<a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/707/keyboarddriver.png/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> (this is on Norwegian):</div>
<div><br />
<div>And your done! Hope this helps.</div>

<h2>            The ordinal 18 could not be located in the dynamic library link SHEL32.dll</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have been recently faced with the above error when restarting my computer. I can log into Windows,&nbsp; however, I am met with a blank page. I have attempted to boot into safe mode, however, logging in meets me with the same error.<br />
<br />
I was not doing anything out of the ordinary prior to restarting. I was installing a custom theme, however, the Shell32 dll was not changed. I reverted to my original theme which has been functional for over a year now and am met with this error in what seems
 to be out of the blue.<br />
<br />
I have not updated drivers recently and have Windows update turned off. The only change I made to the computer in the last 24 hours was hook up a new HDD to the hotswap bay on my case.
<br />
<br />
Is there any viable solution to this without full reinstall?<br />
<br />
Note: I cannot launch CMD. I have tried Win + R and nothing happens. CTRL + ALT + DEL works, but even launching Task Mgr displays the error again and nothing happens after clicking OK.<br />

<p>I have my current laptop which runs on Windows 10 and has Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;I have a new laptop with both Outlook 2016 and Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;I have a feeling it is a bit much to hope to copy my emails from the old laptop to Outlook but I would like to
 be able to transfer the emails on Live Mail from my current laptop to the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried copying to a usb with the windows live mail option but without success. &nbsp;I then tried copying from the hidden folder and now on my new computer have the folders and they say the emails are there but I can't read them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original emails are still working on my current laptop. &nbsp;Is there a way to successfully copy these across to the new laptop on windows live mail as both are running on windows 10?</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is that both computers running same version of Windows Live Mail?</li><li>When you say copying emails to USB, are you doing this manually or using Export&nbsp;option?</li><li>If it is through Export, is that file getting saved with <strong>.iaf</strong> file (Internet Account File)&nbsp;extension?</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Yashwanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current laptop is on WLM 2011 and the new one is on 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both export and manually</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the account which gave me the .iaf file but when I tried to import there were no emails at all - it takes all of a second to create so it clearly isn't actually copying the emails (I probably have over 500).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the emails but nothing happened with that either :(</p>

</p><p>An alternative, which might be preferable if there are not too many messages to be transferred:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create a temporary folder on your desktop to contain the messages to be transferred.</li><li>In this folder, create folders corresponding to each folder whose contents you want to transfer.</li><li>Rearrange the windows on your desktop so you can see both Windows Live Mail and the desktop folder (tip: click in a window and press Windows key&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/876dd555-0728-4126-8caf-24b9665fc6ab" />&nbsp;+
 left arrow key to pin it to the left-hand&nbsp;half of the screen, etc.).</li><li>Select messages<span>1</span> in a Windows Live Mail message list, then drag them across and drop them on the corresponding folder in the desktop folder.</li><li>Copy the&nbsp;desktop folder to the new machine's desktop, e.g. over the network or using a USB drive.</li><li>Reverse the process to drag messages from a folder in the desktop folder&nbsp;into the message list of the corresponding folder (create new ones if necessary) in Windows Live Mail.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>One caveat: dragging out of Windows Live Mail into a file system folder will generate a new file for each message. The file will have the subject of the message as its file name and .<strong>eml</strong> as its extension. Files with the same subject will
 have a serial number appended to the file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the subject of a message ends with a period ( . ), the file created will have the extension
<strong>._eml</strong> to avoid having two periods together. Check carefully before copying the folder to the new machine that there are no messages like this; if there are, right-click on the file name, select
<em>Rename</em> and remove the underscore ( <strong>_ </strong>)character. If you don't do this, drag and drop will fail ...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, the official export and import doesn't work but dragging the files in and out seems to have worked on a small test so I shall continue with this method.</p>

    <title>unsolicited auto-scrolling in the wrong direction - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diadochos  say:</h3>
<h2>            unsolicited auto-scrolling in the wrong direction</h2>
                    <p>Often when I move my computer's mouse, my display scrolls up or down a significant distance, even though all I wanted to move was the cursor arrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's really remarkable is it almost always goes in the wrong direction. You'd think that even if the direction it went in was completely at random, it would still go the right way half the time.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; And a lot of times the place where I wanted to
 be on the page goes completely out of sight.&nbsp; Can anybody tell me how to stop this annoying behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It had been suggested to me that this could be a Windows problem.&nbsp; But that now seems overwhelmingly unlikely, since I just upgraded from Win7 Pro to Win10 Pro.&nbsp; And in fact it wasn't really an "upgrade" at all - it was a clean install, and it was actually
 done by remote control by a Microsoft technician.&nbsp; So the possibility of corrupt system files seems quite remote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I considered the possibility of malware.&nbsp; But I'm told my system is clean by all my antimalware scanning programs (Avira Antivirus Pro, Malwarebytes Premium, IObit Advanced SystemCare and Glary Utilities), and I've also had real-time protection
 not only from Avira and Malwarebytes, but also from WinPatrol, SpywareBlaster and CryptoPrevent, and none of these reported any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought the problem might be with my mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I should mention that I know this has nothing to do with the auto-scroll behavior that can be toggled off and on by pressing the scroll wheel on top of the mouse (a Logitech M325).&nbsp; I know this because there are two "tells" that would indicate that:
 1. when the scroll wheel is toggled, a clicking sound can be heard at the moment of toggling, and 2. whenever auto-scroll is "on", that status is indicated by a symbol that is visible onscreen.&nbsp; Neither of these pertains, so I can state with confidence that
 the scroll wheel is definitely NOT involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought my mouse might have gone bad.&nbsp; But Windows says it's working properly.&nbsp; Just to be on the safe side, however, I replaced the battery in the mouse.&nbsp; But that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I thought my mouse driver might be corrupt, so I tried to reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, first I tried to simply update the driver.&nbsp; But Windows says I have the most up-to-date driver, so it won't let me update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I would have to uninstall the driver in order to reinstall it.&nbsp; But what if something goes wrong?&nbsp; Then I would have NO functional mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And maybe the problem isn't with the mouse at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there any diagnostic software I can run, that would help determine what the problem is?&nbsp; Or does anybody have any other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer that all auto-scrolling stops entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>Hello Diadochos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience and at the same time we appreciate for the effort you have put in to resolve the issue. Let me assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to understand the issue better, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the PC you are using?</li><li><span>What type of a mouse are you using, is it a PS/2, USB or a wireless mouse?</span></li><li><span>Did you try a different mouse device to see if it works? Or the same mouse on a different PC?</span></li><li><span>Did you d</span>etermine whether it is application specific?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check for the latest updates in Windows 10 which helps the PC&nbsp;to make optimal&nbsp;use of Windows 10 capabilities as well as fixing&nbsp;any missing&nbsp;links in performance of the operating system.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To check for updates now, go to <strong><span>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update,</span></strong> and select
<strong><span>Check for updates.</span></strong> If Windows Update says that your PC is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, if you have any other mouse software that is installed, such as Logitech or touchpad software, that software may conflict with your mouse settings/performance.</p>
<p>To uninstall programs in Windows 10, follow the steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Windows, search for and open <span>Programs and Features</span>.</li><li>
<div>On the <span>Programs and Features</span> screen, select the software program you want to remove from the list and click
<span>Uninstall</span> or <span>Uninstall/Change</span> at the top of the program list.</div>
</li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If it still doe snot help, follow the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Try to check if changing the Scroll settings(Scroll Rate)&nbsp;helps to make any positive impact.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PC Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>PC and devices </strong>&gt; <strong>Mouse and touchpad</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the drop down menu marked with the words <strong>Roll the mouse wheel to scroll</strong>, to select whether you want to
<strong>scroll</strong>&nbsp;multiple lines at a time, or an entire screen. You can even use the slider given underneath to finely adjust the number of lines you want the mouse to
<strong>scroll</strong>&nbsp;in one go.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run the Windows in built troubleshooter to identify any potential driver related issues present in your PC.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
tab<strong>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the <strong>Hardware and Device </strong>
option from the list. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to run the <strong>Hardware and Device
</strong>Troubleshooter. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>Since you have already tried to install/reinstall/update the drivers which did not help, I suggest you to rollback the drivers and check if it helps this time.</p>
<p>Double click on the mice device driver in <em>Device Manager</em>. Then Click on
<em>Driver tab </em>and select&nbsp;Rollback.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important: If your drive is performing well and there is no error, Rollback driver button will be grayed out as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Write to us with the updated status and the required information related to mouse scroll functionality, for us to be able to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>Hi, Sayan -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct in assuming your given name is Sayan, and your surname is Ghosh?&nbsp; If I got it backwards, I apologize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you for responding to my request for help.&nbsp; I will try to answer your questions as well as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; What is the make and model of the PC you are using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo ThinkCentre M75e 5042 A7U</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; What type of a mouse are you using, is it a PS/2, USB or a wireless mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logitech M325 - wireless, optical</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Did you try a different mouse device to see if it works? Or the same mouse on a different PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one other functional wireless optical mouse, a Gigaware (model unknown), with its own USB receiver.&nbsp; I
<strong>CAN </strong>see if I have the same problem while using it, but first I will try a different approach to solving the problem (see below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have no other working PC on which to test the mouse with which I have been having the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Did you determine whether it is application specific?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is definitely <strong>NOT </strong>application specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;To check for updates now, go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security
</strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong>, and select <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just double-checked, and my computer was already up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Next, if you have any other mouse software that is installed, such as Logitech or touchpad software, that software may conflict with your mouse settings/performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mouse driver is from Microsoft, not the mouse manufacturer, Logitech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Try to check if changing the <strong>Scroll settings </strong>(<strong>Scroll Rate</strong>) helps to make any positive impact.<br />
&gt;<strong>PC Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>PC and devices </strong>&gt; <strong>Mouse and touchpad</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I toggled <strong>Scroll inactive windows when I hover over them</strong> from
<strong>On </strong>to <strong>Off</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>THIS </strong>is the "different approach" I mentioned above that I will first try to rectify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help so far.&nbsp; I will report back to this thread in a day or so, as soon as I can determine whether or not the problem is fixed.</p>

            <p>I would say a windows 10 issue.</p>
<p>Logitech ex110 using a usb dongle ( very old) omi ( wallmart </p>
<p>mouse and keyboard) usb receiver on the same win10pc and both scroll reverse unless I click the middle mouse button.</p>
<p>This can be set to auto&nbsp;scroll or universal&nbsp;scroll.</p>
<p>Win10 seems to be setting its own function for the mouse regardless of &nbsp;what the user decides or using 3rd party software because I get two different cursors at the same time.</p>
<p>It does not matter if I use the logitech software or not, change the</p>
<p>scroll lines too more or less.</p>
<p>Win7 &nbsp;using a logitech ex520 &nbsp;with no issues but when win10 was on this pc, the same thing.</p>

            <p>Hi, kjl1956, thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;I would say a windows 10 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had neglected to mention that I had had this same problem before I upgraded from Win7, so at least at that point it was a Windows 7 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I think it probably <strong>IS </strong>a Windows issue as you suggest, because so far, at least, I haven't observed this behavior since toggling
<strong>Off </strong>the <strong>Scroll inactive windows when I hover over them</strong> option in
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Devices </strong>&gt; <strong>Mouse and touchpad</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem could not have been carried through from Win7 to Win10 upon upgrading, however, because, as I said, I had had a clean install done of Win10.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I think that maybe having
<strong>Scroll inactive windows when I hover over them</strong> set to <strong>On
</strong>may have been the default setting for both versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally have not had the problem that you have been having with two cursors being present, so I think you must have a different problem than I have had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you are able to get your problem resolved.</p>

            Your question is not clear. If you need to know whether you want to use your existing landline / mobile number as caller ID, you can do that. If it means whether you want to call up any landline / mobile number, then you need to purchase Skype subscription / credits.

            Hi Eddie,
<br />
<br />Sorry that is not possible, to use a phone number in Skype for people to contact you, you must purchase a Skype number, then pick a number in your Country/region and a Skype number will be assigned to you . ..
