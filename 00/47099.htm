<h2>            Getting error when opening a program</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>So I get this problem when ever I open some of my video games like league of legends it doesn't open for me. After i click it a window pops up with the message This application was unable to start correctly (0xc000000d). Click OK to close the application.</p>
<p>I saw some other people have this problem and I tried their solving methods but none of them worked. Would appreciate some help with this cause this is really annoying.</p>

<br />
<br />Did you try reinstalling the game?

<p>Hi rooneytune.&nbsp; You have posted in the Windows 7 Forum however I will try to help anyway.&nbsp; I am sure a Moderator will move this topic when it is reviewed.</p>
<p>You may have what is known as a "dirty bit" set on your volume.&nbsp; This can happen for various reasons, one being an improper shutdown.</p>
<p>Lets find out.&nbsp; Go to Start &gt; Run and type:</p>
<p>cmd.exe</p>
<p>and click ok.&nbsp; A command prompt will open.&nbsp; Type the below command after the prompt and hit enter:</p>
<p>fsutil dirty query c:</p>
<p>Does it report a dirty bit?</p>
<p>If so, type the below command and hit Enter:</p>
<p>chkntfs /x c:</p>
<p>and reboot.&nbsp; This will stop chkdsk from running when you next restart.</p>
<p>Once you have rebooted, open a command prompt again and type the below command and hit Enter:</p>
<p><span>chkdsk c: /f /r </span></p>
<p><span>reboot again and chkdsk should run all 5 stages and hopefully clear the dirty bit.</span></p>
<p>If a dirty bit is not reported, just try the last step I posted.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>
<p><span><br />

<p>Hello ambnewwindows7,</p>
<p>On the Virgin Website, in the&nbsp;Q&amp;As section, it does&nbsp;state that Virgin Mobile Broadband2Go is compatible with Windows 7. Do you get an error when trying to install it on Windows 7?<br />
<br />
The WindowsActivationUpdate.exe is for Windows 7, Windows 7 and Windows 2008 server. It is not intended to run on Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
<br />

<p>Is the disc at least recognized? Are CDs or Blu Rays recognized?</p>
<p>The disc function is not connected to the xbl core service. So it may be an issue with your disc drive. As there were lots of problems with drives not reading game discs properly, but reading movie or music discws, your console ma ybe in need of some service.</p>
<p>Meanwhile as workaround you may try holding the disc a second longer when the drive tries to take it and then release the disc.

<p>So I have a interesting inquiry about my Xbox One, Just recently about two weeks ago, I'm having trouble getting only some of my discs to read or be recognize by my disc tray. Here the kicker though games such as Dragon age inquisition, Alien isolation,
 Evil within, Assassins creed unity, are all reading fine and dandy all games are new when they were released or came out so they have no scratches or scuffs anything, brand new. Read just fine. Destiny will not read at or be recognized, its a relatively old
 game so yes it has a few nicks and dings so i understand why its not reading , but i just bought Dying light on the 28th of January. No scratches no dings at all, Xbox one will not read it half the time, i have to keep Hard resetting and putting the disc back
 in several times. Then it finally reads, also i noticed a grindy noise when i put dying light in every few times or so. So why is a brand new game not reading like its suppose to where my older games read just fine? is their something wrong with the way the
 dying light disc was made or Am i just going crazy? This grindy noise only happens with Dying light and Destiny so far and also Diablo 3 reapers of souls. Now how game some games read while others will not and yes Diablo and &nbsp;Dying light were brand new when
 they were not being read by the disc tray. Destiny not so much. Also my console has no issues reading things such as DVDs or Blu-Rays. Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro goes to tablet mode when screen is closed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geek-in-hawaii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro goes to tablet mode when screen is closed</h2>
                    <p>I tried the Windows 10 upgrade and all went well, at first. When I tried to use it on my office desktop set up I found a deal breaking flaw. Windows 10 switches to tablet mode when the screen is closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm at my desk I plug my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro into the AC adapter, USB hub and an external monitor, then I close the screen and slide it under my monitor stand. This worked fine under Windows 8.0/8.1. The system would remain at the desktop and I could
 work comfortably with a proper keyboard, mouse and monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Windows 8/8.1 the system would only switch modes when the screen was opened well past 180 degrees, but under Windows 10 it also switches to tablet mode when the screen is closed, or more accurately, less than about 45 degrees open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8/8.1 screen from 0-180 degrees = "Laptop" mode (would switch at roughly 250 degrees open).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 screen from 0-45 degrees = Tablet mode. Screen from 45-180 degrees = Laptop mode. Past 180 degrees = Tablet mode (again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen should only switch to "Tablet mode" when it's opened past 180 degrees. NOT when it's closed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE/DRIVER PROBLEMS:</p>
<p>The final nail in the coffin for Windows 10 came when I tried to get all the updates to the OS and drivers. After several updates (and many, many reboots in between) the system became so slow it was completely unusable. I couldn't even use the built-in feedback
 app to report this because everything kept hanging up. Finally gave up and restored my Windows 8.1 backup image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be keeping an eye out for solutions to these problems and will give 10 a try again if I find any, so if anyone knows how to fix these issues please share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Tim</p>

            <p>Overall, I am liking the Windows 10 features. However, I'm experiencing the same problem with switching to the different modes for my Lenovo Yoga 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I didn't like that tile start menu screen and that side bar swipe feature that Windows 8/8.1 had, the positive thing about Windows 8/8.1 was that I had no problem with switching between the 4 different modes. I can go from Laptop to Tablet to
 Tent to Stand mode with ease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I updated to Windows 10, when I close my laptop, it would go into tablet mode. When I open it later, it would take several minutes before it would change back to landscape and/or it would stay in tablet mode. When I want to remain in the landscape
 in tablet mode it would not let me and it forces me to have a portrait view. Even when I want to go into the Stand or Tent mode, it would not switch automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sad that I cannot have that flexibility and enjoy my yoga like I can before the Windows 10 update. I might just go back to Windows 8/8.1 just to have that flexible and easy mode switching feature if this problem is not fixed soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please fix this problem soon! I really like Windows 10 and I would like to continue to use it!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>If you don't like the Windows 8/8.1&nbsp;tile screen, install Classic Shell which puts a real start menu back into Win8. Windows 8.1 with Classic Shell is actually pretty nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure Windows 10 will be fine in a few months, but for now I prefer having a computer that works. 10 is still far too buggy IMHO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is big on quoting the numbers of computers which have upgraded to Windows 10 in their advertising, but I wonder how many of those have switched back to Windows 7 or 8? I'm sure my computer is part of their count, even though I only used 10 for
 a few days.</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem with tablet mode switching in windows 10.&nbsp; You can just turn off automatic switching (uncheck the make windows more touch friendly when using as a tablet).&nbsp; Then select always ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also remember that Lenovo has not officially stated that the Yoga series are ready for windows 10 so it is likely that some of the functions are not going to work well or at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not happy about it either but I understand.</p>

            <p>This worked for me, and my yoga 2 pro is set to lock when it sleeps from closing the lid. &nbsp;Go into Settings (not Control Panel) &gt; System &gt; Tablet mode. &nbsp;The slider at the top toggles tablet mode on and off. &nbsp;I found that if I set:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I sign in: Go to the desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I'd be ok when opening the lid. &nbsp;I could then set:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this device automatically switches tablet mode on or off: Don't ask me and always switch</p>
<p>
</p><p>and it would behave as I expected. &nbsp;Presumably if I ever unlocked it in tablet mode it might be a bit weird, but I don't really do that. &nbsp;You can always go back to Settings and switch manually if this happens.</p>

</p><p>I'm not happy about it either but I understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>With the newer 1511 build of Windows 10 things have improved a lot in terms of hardware compatibility and stability. Unfortunately the tablet-mode-when-screen-is-closed bug persists (and the fugly yellows), but other than that, Win10 runs great on the Y2Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is much, much faster than any previous version of Windows, and it has been extremely stable. Note that I am on a clean install, though. Before trying a clean install, you must do the upgrade from Windows 8.1 first, and make sure W10 is activated (if you
 want the free upgrade). Then you can use their media creation tool to make a bootable USB drive for the clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wiped my SSD drive by creating a new GPT partition table and left it blank (all un-allocated space) before booting off the install media. Win10 partitioned and formatted the SSD while installing, and after it was done I installed the following drivers
 from Lenovo's support site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Intel Chipset Driver for Windows 8.1 (64-bit), Windows 10 (64-bit)<br />
2. Intel Graphics Driver<br />
3. Intel Management Engine Interface for Windows 8.1 (64-bit), Windows 10 (64-bit)<br />
4. Intel Rapid Storage Technology for Windows 8.1 (32-bit, 64-bit), Windows 10 (64-bit)<br />
5. Synaptics touchpad driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also installed the Lenovo Transitions software, even though Windows 10 said it was incompatible. Without it your keyboard &amp; trackpad will only turn off when folded all that way around to tablet mode (they are active in stand or tent modes). Transitions
 fixed that and has not caused any trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been thinking about installing Energy Manager, even though Win10 says that's incompatible as well. As I recall that was the fix for the fugly yellow color issue. Just haven't gotten around to it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been running on Windows 10 since early January and it's been rock solid. Quite a pleasant surprise from previous version. I always set up my machines to dual boot with Linux, and used to spend 90% of my time in Linux, only booting to Windows when I needed
 to run something Windows specific. &nbsp;But since installing Windows 10, I have been spending a lot of time in that OS and it's been a pretty good experience so far. There are still some Windows annoyances (like how they @#$% hide important settings), but they
 are fewer and further between than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And speaking of hidden settings, there is a different power profile for tablet mode that, as far as I can tell, is completely inaccessible to the user. When I'm on my external monitor with the Yoga's screen closed, the system sleeps very quickly, no matter
 what I set in power management. And that is with the system set to NEVER change modes! It stays in desktop mode, but still switches to some hidden power profile when the screen is closed (and yes, I have it set to "do nothing" when I close the screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware-wise it's been great. Everything works. Screen, camera, microphone, headphone jack, speakers, keyboard, trackpad, wireless, USB 2.0 &amp; 3.0 ports, HDMI, SD card drive, and almost all the hot keys (the only hot key that doesn't work is the Airplane
 mode key, but that's easy to access in Win 10 anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only nagging issues are switching the power profile when the screen is closed, and the fugly yellow colors (the latter of which can probably be fixed by installing Lenovo Energy Manager, but like I said above, I haven't tried that yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, that's my experience so far with Windows 10 on a Yoga 2 Pro (i7, 8GB DRAM, 256GB SSD).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not sure if I follow you. They have at least my device listed as fully compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft and Lenovo have partnerships. Most of the major vendors do. They are able to play with RTM releases way earlier than you and I do. RTM stands for "Release to Manufacturer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manufacturers are supposed to test their hardware and report back bugs. Microsoft is supposed to fix them. If it is not and issue with Microsoft, it is supposed to tell the manufacturers what they are doing wrong and how should they fix the issue. If a component
 or its drivers are broken with a new release of Windows, it is the manufacturer who should push the component manufacturer to release a new driver, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, Windows 10 runs pretty well on the Yoga 2 Pro as is. The Win8 version of Transitions is about 95% stable under Win10. I have occasionally found that my keyboard is not turning off when folding the screen back, because Transitions has silently

            <p>Sorry for the long reply...<br />
<br />
Sounds like&nbsp;you were using Microsoft Office Picture Manager...<br />
<br />
When you go to Edit Pictures and choose Compress Pictures / E-mail messages...<br />
it reduces the pixel dimensions of the photo to&nbsp; : 160x120&nbsp; (that's basically a<br />
thumbnail size)<br />
<br />
Then...when you close Picture Manager...it displays a dialog that says: <br />
</p>
<p>There are changes that have not been saved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't Save&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancel<br />
<br />
If you choose...'Save' and did not rename the files that you compressed...<br />
the compressed files will overwrite (replace) the originals and once the<br />
program is closed...the original files are not recoverable. (As long as <br />
Picture Manager is open...you could go to...Edit / Undo Compress Picture...<br />
but once you close the program...there is no recovery.)<br />
<br />
To save the compressed (resized) version as a new file and not overwrite <br />
the original......you would have to go to...File / Save As...and enter a new <br />
name for the selected&nbsp;photo. </p>

<p><span>Hi Drtgs,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the settings in Windows mail and change it accordingly and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Windows Mail.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Navigate
 to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Send and select Plain Text Settings</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Make
 sure the</span><span>setting is set to 76 characters and change it accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 Windows Mail and check if it works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Power cycle the computer and check if text wrap functions normally in Windows mail.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shut down your computer the proper way if possible, via your "Start" menu.</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Unplug your computer – Unplug your PC from its power cables from the computer. For a notebook or laptop, remove
 the computer's battery and then un-pug its cord from the laptop. It is not enough to switch off your surge protector – you must unplug the cord from your laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Wait for at least 30 seconds to one minute after the computer is shut down completely. This will allow enough
 time for any residual power to drain out of your different devices. You can speed up the process as you wait, by pressing the power button on your unplugged computer, which will help to drain all the power that is left over in your PC's motherboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and check if the text wrap functions normally in Windows mail.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>

            I fixed by problem (along with a few others) by restoring my computer to factory default. From what I found searching the web, my problem was likely caused by a virus. My task manager was blocked, I couldn't turn off&nbsp;my laptop and other&nbsp;similar problems.
 Even after removing the virus, the problems continued. After restoring my computer to factory default, everything works perfectly. Thanks for trying to help anyway.

<h2>            Half Life 2 Orange box edition can&#39;t open door</h2>
                    
<p>I am stuck on level Nova Prospekt.</p>
<p>I am trying to open a door but it will not open.&nbsp; I have got up to the part where you unplug the creature that is being tortured and so opened the barrier and i have gone into the room that has a lever to open the door to get upstairs.&nbsp; I have gone upstairs
 and and gone into the control room and i have pressed the button that should open the door downstairs so i can continue the game.&nbsp; My problem is when i press the button for the door downstairs it turns green for a second then goes back to red then my game
 auto saves and the door is still closed and i am unable to open it as the button to open the gate does not work any more. Is there another way to get passed this door as i am now stuck and getting very frustrated with the game</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/88ab4375-d753-4458-affd-6a0bca926462">BonganiMnisi</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. Going over the issue you've reported, I can definitely understand your frustration. However, rest assured we are here to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are able to hear the sound out of built in speakers, that is a great start. Now in order for the sound to be sent to your headphones once connected, you will need to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <strong>DO NOT</strong> connect your headphone/earphone just yet.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Right click</strong> on the <strong>speaker/volume icon </strong>located on the task bar, next to the clock (Bottom right)</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>Playback devices</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed to step 4, I have a question for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Between</strong> the two choices: <strong>Speakers and Headphones</strong><strong> which one has the Green checked mark</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If it is set the Speakers</strong> (<strong>Checked), go ahead and play any media and</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. <strong>Connect your earphone/Headphone</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.) <strong>Did the green checked move to headphone now</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>b.) If yes, do you have any sound of out of your headphone?</p>
<p>c.) &nbsp;If no, is the headphone showing as default Device? If not set as the default Device, simply click on "Set Default" below and check for sound now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. &nbsp;If after applying the default value to your headphone/earphone and still not getting any sound out, please try out a different headphone that you know has no sound issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still no sound, you most likely have a bad jack and for that you will need to contact our
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give the above steps a try and let us know how everything worked out for you.</p>

<br />
If you have many computers using one printer, may I suggest that you buy a cheap mini Print Server and connect the printer directly to your router or hub, rather than using the flaky method of Printer sharing on a computer that has to be on before anyone else
 can print?

    <title>Can&#39;t put wired and wireless computers on same homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carter698  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t put wired and wireless computers on same homegroup</h2>
                    I have a newbie question. I can't figure out how to put a wired computer and a wireless computer in the same homegroup. Here's my setup:<br />
<br />
I installed Windows 7 Pro on two computers, one connected to the LAN port of my wireless router (Linksys WRT610N) and the other has a wireless-N card. Both can connect to the internet fine. When I click on "Map entire network" from the Network &amp; Sharing window,
 both computers show up, and the diagram of the router and switches appears correct. However, since they are not on the same "local" network, Windows 7 doesn't offer the option to join each other's homegroup.<br />
<br />
After partially giving up on homegroup, I tried the option of using usernames and passwords to share files between the 2 computers (instead of homegroup.) If I click on "Network" from the wireless computer, the wired computer shows up, with the folder I have
 set to "shared." (Partial success.) However, if I click on "Network" from the wired computer, the wireless computer does NOT show up.<br />
<br />
All I want to do is share folders across these two computers. What is the best way to set up the network?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            Not sure which question you were answering, but you obviously didn't read my question before you posted this answer straight from the windows help page. Thankfully, I've answered my own question.
<div><br />
<div>After a lot of reading, I suspected a firewall problem. I reinstalled Windows on the wireless computer and before installing the same Norton security suite I had used before, I tried sharing the folders again, and voila! it worked. So, I'm not going to
 install all of the ____ that comes with the Norton security suite, and instead go with a more straightforward solution of an antivirus program like AVG combined with the firewall that comes with Windows 7.</div>

<h2>            Tripeaks Daily Challenge for 3 May 2013</h2>
                    
<p>Is the 3 May TriPeaks daily challenge game winnable?&nbsp; The goal is to get 45,000 points.&nbsp; I have played it over 100 times and the most points I have been able to get is 39,900.&nbsp; I was able to get 24,700 points&nbsp;by completing&nbsp;the first board.&nbsp; The second game
 does not seem to be&nbsp;winnable.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am able to clear every card but one on the second board but&nbsp;wind up with a total of only 39,900 points. In analyzing the deck and the second board, I have determined&nbsp;it is impossible to clear every card on the board.&nbsp; As a
 result, there seems to be no way one can reach 45,000 points.</p>

<p>The second board cannot be solved. &nbsp;If you analyze the cards there is no winning solution. &nbsp;At the end of the shuffle deck the last 4 cards are Queen Spades, 6 Hearts, Ace Diamonds, King Clubs. &nbsp;The 6 Hearts should have preceded the Queen Spade not the other
 way around. &nbsp;This then would have resulted in a wining solution. &nbsp;Without solving the second board it impossible to get to 45,000 points. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I was able to solve the challenge, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it isn't impossible. &nbsp;Maybe you need to better utilize the first board to get more points. &nbsp;Keep trying.</p>

<p>The key is HOW you solve the first board. &nbsp;In tripeaks, the next deal depends on the order of the cards at the end of the first deal. &nbsp;So, in the first deal, it's not about getting the most points, but rather the order of the solution. &nbsp;If you do that right
 on the first board, the second board is solvable. &nbsp;Try varying how you solve the first board. &nbsp;HINT: you will leave the 9, 8, 7 at the top of every peak if you do it right.</p>

<p>The above tips are correct. &nbsp;This took me several tries as well. &nbsp;I never did find a way to beat the second board but it is possible to get up to 31700 points on the first board. &nbsp;If you do that, you can reach 45000 points with four cards still left on the
 second board. &nbsp;Here's another hint I discovered while playing today: If you use "Undo", your next move will start you over at 100 points and you will lose your run bonus even if you had a run going. &nbsp;So, if you must undo, go ahead and undo all the way back
 to the last time you drew a card before you started your run.</p>

<p>Try finishing up the first board leaving the 9, 8, and 7 last (they will be the top card of every peak). &nbsp;A 10 till come up, and just go down the line. &nbsp;This will make the 2nd board solvable.</p>

<p>Ray1222, I haven't observed that behavior - I have finished the first board in several different ways and it didn't seem to have any effect on the order of the cards in the second board.</p>
<p>That being said, for ALP1983 and anyone else still struggling, here's a solution (perhaps not the only one, but this will get you there).</p>
<p>SPOILER ALERT!</p>
<p>BOARD 1</p>
<p>Take Right K, Q, J, Right 10, 9, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A</p>
<p>Draw 2 cards</p>
<p>Take 5, Left 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A, 2,</p>
<p>Draw 1 card</p>
<p>Take 7, 8</p>
<p>Draw 1 card</p>
<p>Take 5</p>
<p>Draw 9 cards</p>
<p>Take J</p>
<p>Draw 3 cards</p>
<p>Take 3</p>
<p>Draw 5 cards</p>
<p>Take 9</p>
<p>Score: 31,700</p>
<p>BOARD 2</p>
<p>Take 5, Right 6, 7, 6</p>
<p>Draw 1 card</p>
<p>Take Left Q, K, Q, J, Right 10, J, 10, 9, 8</p>
<p>Draw 1 card</p>
<p>Take 10</p>
<p>Draw 2 cards</p>
<p>Take 5, 4, 3, 2, Left A, 2</p>
<p>Score: 45,100</p>

            Hi,  adboom
<br />
<br />You could also check to see if there are some sectors of the hard drive damaged.
<br />After you correct the damaged sectors you can enter with Windows Virtual and backup your files and then reinstall Windows
<br />
<br />Take a look to the following link, there is a step by step guide 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-allinone-boot-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-al...</a>

<br /><a href="https://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>
<br />
<br />Process: 
<br />1. Enter your USB drive or CD
<br />2. Enter Dos Programs 
<br />3. Enter Hard Disk tools 
<br />4. Enter HDAT2 4.53 (Test/Repair Bad Sector) 
<br />5. Then auto &amp; choose your keyboard United states (or wait it will do automatically here) 
<br />6. Press Enter &amp; Press Drive level tests menu 
<br />7. Enter Check and Repair bad sectors 
<br />8. And now it will start, it takes a lot of time, so wait until it finished.

                    <p>Laptop suddenly will not shutdown or restart when clicking the option. I used the laptop daily and has been fine. I noticed windows update or install in progress so I let it complete. When it is done installing the update, still will not let me shutdown
 or restart. I left the laptop on overnight and no change this morning. About to do hard shutdown unless there is another alternative re hard power down (something I do not like to do). Please recommend?</p>

<p>Hello Dave,<br />
<br />
<br />
The article provided by <em>Marvin</em> is about how you can perform a clean boot, wherein it was not mentioned that in order to see the steps, there are drop-down links for each primary Windows OS that you need to click. Refer to this image:<br />

<h2>            When I play Mahjong Titans and click on a tile, I have to click several times before the tile will light up. </h2>

            I've had this problem since installing Windows 7 back in October. All of my Microsoft Updates are installed and all of my drivers are current. I have had to re-install windows 7 several times, for different reasons, and still have this problem. I usually
 close the game and restart it and it will run fine. I feel this is a flaw in the games source code and is just one of those things that happen now and then.

<p>I have the same problem. I also have this problem with solitaire and frecell. The only way I can get the games to work correctly is to disable aero features. (Iuse task manager and turn off the Desktop Window Manager Session Manager). I know it's a workaround
 and I hope there is a fix for this problem soon.</p>

<p>I have already tried these and several other possible solutions, including reinstalling windows. All drivers are latest windows7. Problem still exists.</p>
<p>I have also searched numerous forums and found quite a few references to this exact problem and several other 'aero' related issues in windows 7. Many references were made to the fact that these problems didn't exist on these same systems when running Vista
 aero. The problems occurred after upgrading to windows7. Also, many of the systems have "high-end" gaming video cards,&nbsp;both from ATI and nvidia. The users indicated that there were no problems running demanding 3d games, but the problems only happen with 2d
 applications. I understand that Microsoft made some changes to how aero uses system resources in Windows7.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if the engineers moderating these forums would do an in-depth analysis on all the aero related issues found in these forums and come back with a substantive solution or solutions. It seems that all the "solutions" start and end with
 "try clean boot" and "update your drivers". While that is good advice, most of the postings I see are way beyond that level of troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>

            <p>Edge is not a complete product yet I had a setting changed for one of my friends so that all flash will play on IE (Internet Explorer) not edge...</p>

<p>
</p><p>that setting is<strong> on </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried open it&nbsp;in IE and flash works as it does in FF and google chrome so this is an Edge issue not seeing flash or something.

            I've been having trouble with flash player in Edge on some sites for a while.&nbsp; It got worse the other day Flash player updated and more sites wouldn't run videos.&nbsp; Tried changing &nbsp;settings, all kinds of things that didn't work.&nbsp; Just for the heck of it
 I went into Edges advance setting and turned of Flash Player!&nbsp; BOOM, all the sites I went to are now loading and&nbsp;playing&nbsp;videos!&nbsp;Don't know why but try it and see what happen. &nbsp;In internet Explorer checking Active X fixed it!&nbsp; Still having problems with Firefox
