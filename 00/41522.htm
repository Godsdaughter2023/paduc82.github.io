<h2>            BitLocker&#40;&#63;&#41; prevents my boot up</h2>
                    
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>I am running Windows Vista Ultimate on one drive and XP pro on another one. Normally I boot Vista, but since I needed a document on the other drive I swapped the drives. When I tried to boot the XP drive I got the message "We're sorry for the inconvenience,
 but Windows did not start properly." and the options between going into safemode, last working configuration or start normally. I tried normal boot first, safe-mode and last known config after that, but they all result in a restart and back to the message.
 The same happened on Vista after I swapped the drives back.</p>
<p>The reason why I addressed it to this Forum is that I recently installed some upgrades, including BitLocker, which I believe is the cause of this problem. I have not experienced anything like this before, but right after the installation the problem come
 up. Secondary the program is made to lock down and "protect" its contents when removed etc. Third it locked two drives (BitLocker needs two partitions to work), while the other two internal drives I have are working fine.</p>
<p>The only trouble I have with my theory is that I did not do anything with BitLocker after downloading and installing the Vista upgrade. Is the default setting really "enabled" and is it no other important settings that needs to be confirmed? I have tried
 setting up all the drives exactly as before, with no further luck. I feel that this program protect the drives content from myself, the owner!</p>
<p>I have tried to search the web for similar problems, but found nothing that helped me. Hope you guys can! Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jan.</p>

<p>Hi Mextli,</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;If the hard drives are not encrypted, you may try performing a system restore from the Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
<p>i)&nbsp;Boot the computer from the Windows installation disc<br />
ii)&nbsp;Windows automatically run as the hard drive is blank, and will load files; this may take some time .The Windows Vista install will begin to load.<br />
iii)&nbsp; Now select your install Language, Time and Currency Format, plus keyboard type, once you are happy with the settings, Click on "NEXT" to continue.<br />
iv)&nbsp;From the next screen click on "Repair Your Computer" to continue. Windows will now search for Windows Installations.<br />
v)&nbsp;From the next screen select the operating system on which you wish to do a repair. Select it, then press "NEXT" to continue<br />
vi)&nbsp;You are now at the "Recovery Options" menu.<br />
vii)&nbsp;From the "Recovery Options" menu select "SYSTEM RESTORE".<br />
viii)&nbsp;The "Restore files and settings" menu will appear, click "NEXT" to continue.<br />
Now from a selection of "Restore points" select one which you wish to restore too. Then click on "NEXT" to continue. You are now given an option to restore other disks along with the operating system drive. If you have no problems with them then just restore
 the main drive.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
ix)&nbsp;Now you are asked to confirm the restore point. Click "FINISH" to continue, or "BACK" to select another drive or restore point. You are now asked one final time to confirm that you wish to continue. Click "YES" to continue or "NO" to select another drive
 or restore point.</p>
<p>x)&nbsp;"System Restore" will now initialize.</p>
<p>System Restore will now restore files, Finalize the restore.<br />
Once done, it will tell you if it has been successful or not, if so click "RESTART" to restart the computer, if not then try a different date.<br />
Once rebooted and you get to the desktop, you will get a confirmation of the restores success. Click "CLOSE" to continue.</p>
<p><strong>B)</strong> If the hard drives are encrypted, you may have to post your queries to the TechNet Community for more assistance:

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I get a straight answer on store shipping&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My first time placing an order in the MS Store was on Friday 11/27/15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First and last.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ordered a Surface Pro 4 and paid for Express shipping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My order was in before 1pm. My device was supposed to be delivered yesterday. I haven't even received a tracking number yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My order still shows "in process."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've called customer service service 3 times and each person I spoke with gave me the run around in a different way but did not answer any questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm frustrated on too many levels to list here. &nbsp;Why can't customer service give me a definitive answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I knew there were going to be problems like this I woulda bought the device at Best Buy instead. They still charged me sales tax, so what was the point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will never again order direct from MS.</p>

            <p>I recently assisted a client with ordering a SP4 i5 8gb 512gb from the Microsoft Online Store.</p>
<p>My client has received the accesories but the Surface Pro has yet to ship. &nbsp;We were given assurances by the people at the Paramus, NJ MS store that there would be no delays in shipping this configuration after they contacted someone at Microsoft. &nbsp;When we
 ordered it online there was no mention of any delay nor was anything mentioned on the email order acknowledgement. &nbsp;When i contacted ms support via the 887 number no one was able to give me any firm info as to when the sp4 would ship. &nbsp;I explained that shipping
 was time critical for my client as he will be traveling for an extended period of time and that if they could not ship by 11/06 the order would have to be cancelled.</p>
<p>So now because MS can not give me any info on when shipment will occur i will be forced to advise my client to cancel the order and return the accessories. &nbsp;Very annoying for my client and because i recommended the sp embarrassing for me!</p>
<p>I have been in this business for many years and have never experienced such a group of disinterested, ineffective persons as I have encountered at Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was given a case number for what it's worth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone at Microsoft who can actually help me?</p>

            I cannot say when I have ever been more upset about terrible customer service. It was THE worst I have ever experienced. I ordered a Surface pro 4 in Oct...between then and the shipment my credit card changed and they sent me an email to contact them.
 I did on the phone and got someone who said they could help me. we went through all the info and she said she needed to get some "tools" to get it done. I was on the phone for 10 min and she said I needed to talk to someone else and she connected me. after
 another 20 min she said she could not help me and I needed to go on the website which was not working. after an hour or two I was able to get on the system and add the new credit card but could not delete the old and could not update the card on the order
 (or maybe I am too stupid to figure out how to switch it on the order). I assume putting the new card would make it ok but was not hopefull. The next evening I called to check on the status. did not work...have now been on the phone for over an

            I am experiencing the similar issue.&nbsp; I placed my order on 10/16.&nbsp; My order confirmation said it would ship on 11/20.&nbsp; It's now 11/24 and I have no tracking from UPS.&nbsp; What makes me more upset is they shipped my type cover and I have no SP4 to use.&nbsp; They
 messed up on the shipping on the type cover as well and ended up sending it out on expedited shipping at their cost.&nbsp; The customer service reps keep making excuses and never tell me when its shipping.&nbsp; They keep telling me wait 24 hours and if you don't have
 the email tracking info, then call back.&nbsp; I call back and they tell me the same thing.&nbsp; I will never preorder from MS again.<br />

            My story is exactly the same. SP4 256G i7 ... supposed to ship on Nov 20th. I've been on the store support chat twice, approx. half an hour of my time each time, and they tell me nothing. Today, the person said I had to wait 3-7 days (presumably after
 the promised ship date?) for "them" (who, Microsoft?) "to get it." (Whatever that means.) So will wait two more days, and then try to figure out what to do next. Thing is, they could save themselves so much bad press just by letting us know that they are behind
 schedule and providing an updated shipping point. So frustrating!<br />

            I called back today because the support tech told me to wait until the last day the device is scheduled to arrive based on the shipping I requested.&nbsp; The support tech I spoke to today told me because of the demand that the shipments were delayed and are
 scheduled to ship on Monday.&nbsp; I asked that MS provide some sort of consolation since they missed their ship date and delivery date and she said she could cancel my order or offer $20 store credit.&nbsp; Nice customer treatment.&nbsp; They would rater lose money then
 try and help out a customer.&nbsp;

            <p>They seem overloaded with orders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll get your Express shipping when the package is in the hand of the carrier. What you received is the order confirmation only. Once processed, the carrier will receive the electronic label - not the actual package. This is when you'll get the tracking
 number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, don't get too excited. Few hours will pass before the carrier gets the package. From that point, you'll get the Express delivery. One word : PATIENCE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have any promotion code, it's much faster to go the the nearest BestBuy. Sadly.</p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called MS customer service for a 4th time, and after getting the run aroundagain, demanded to speak with a manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After being put on hold for a while I spoke with a "supervisor " who I explained my case to once again. She also tried to give me a line of scripted nonsense. After pressing her for several minutes she finally put me on hold again, and when she came back,
 she informed me that my order was scheduled to ship on 12/11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why was this information not available to me before I submit my order, or at the very minimum, when I initially called CS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked her to cancel my order and refund me since the item had not shipped, and she said "it is impossible to cancel and order that is in process."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only recourse was to contact paypal to file a dispute which can take 10 days to process, and 5 days for the refund to clear my bank. &nbsp;If I was sure that my Surface Pro 4 was going to ship on 12/11 I'd leave it, but I don't put it past these schisters
 &nbsp;to string me along until March.</p>

            You need to get it together and not over react.&nbsp; Yes, Microsoft Customer Service is totally useless, in fact I'm not sure what purpose they serve.&nbsp; They cannot get or provide scheduling info beyond telling you when an order has already shipped.&nbsp; There
 is absolutely no communication between customer service and the location that actually builds/ships the SP4.&nbsp; I have talked with Microsoft support personnel at a local MS Store and they confirm this is so even for them.&nbsp; The 12/11 date was likely a completely
 bogus date given to you to get you off their back.&nbsp; Chances are from my recent personal experience that your order will probably ship tomorrow or Thursday and u will receive an email as soon as it ships with tracking info.&nbsp; So be&nbsp; patient and give it 2 more
 days.&nbsp; <br />

                    <p>The other day I accidentally bought an Xbox Live card that is worth $25 or for 3 Months. I originally wanted to buy a gift card to the store for $25, but I had not noticed until I entered that code. I haven't used the code yet, and I was wondering if I could trade this Gold card for a $25 gift card for the Microsoft store.</p>

            My Win 10 installation had additional problems to be power issues mentioned here. So I gave up, deleted Win 10 and reinstalled. Everything seems to be working much better this time and the power issues have gone away.

<h2>            Download file dialog box stuck in infinite loop</h2>
                    <div>I tried to download a file (from a trusted source) to install a program. I have talked to the publisher and no one else has had this problem with this link. This is what I did:</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Clicked on link in the email that was sent</span></div>
<div><span>This brought up the view downloads dialog box.</span></div>
<div><span>It asked if I want to run or save CWSetup.exe.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>I clicked run</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>That brought up another view downloads dialog box.</span></div>
<div><span>This one asked me if I want to run or save IEExplore.exe. If I click either one, it just brings up another view downloads that says the same thing.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Even if I just let it sit there, it just keeps bringing up view download dialog boxes with other program names and I don't even know what they are.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>If I try to open a program like Outlook, I get a view download dialog that has outlook.exe (run or save). That happens with most anything I try to run so I can't do anything at all. Even things in the control panel. It just keeps going in an infinite
 loop of view download dialog boxes. Most of the program icons on my desktop are now just Internet Explorer icons and not the pictures they were.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>My computer was having no issues until the moment I clicked run in the download files dialog box. It is now like any .exe I try to run triggers the download dialog box to come ip.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So, I can't do anything because I can't run Outlook or Explorer, or most any other program. a few do run. I am using my iPad to email because my computer is now completely useless.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Do you have any suggestions?</span></div>

    <title>Does XP not support burning DVDs or need reinstallation&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slickrcbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does XP not support burning DVDs or need reinstallation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The CD-RW/DVD-ROM combo drive in my oldest working Windows computer just failed. I replaced it with a DVD+/-RW salvaged from a broken newer computer. The computer originally came with Windows 98SE (I said it was my oldest), but I had installed the drive
 that could only read DVDs prior to upgrading to XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the hardware wizard detecting the new drive would have told XP that it can now burn DVDs, but everything about the built-in burning keeps talking about "copy to CD" or "write to CD" and even prompting me to "insert a blank CD".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does XP service pack 3 not support burning data to DVDs using the built-in tools or do I need to reinstall or repair XP to get it to recognize that the CD-only burner has been replaced with a DVD burner? It would be easier to just find some free 3rd party
 tools. I don't have anything to use since I salvaged a burner that was built in to another broken computer (blown capacitors on the motherboard) that was given to a recycling center after being stripped of useful things like a spare hard drive, burner and
 a 56K fax/modem on a card. (the modem might not be useful these days, but the fax is).</p>

            <p>I am afraid that "native" DVD burning was not introduced to Windows until Vista. XP does not support native DVD burning. You can however use 3rd party burning software.&nbsp;Most "retail" burning hardware will come with a CD providing a "lite" version of such
 software, for example Nero.</p>

            The only moving parts in your computer are fans.&nbsp; Sometimes when running a benchmarking program the system will be stressed, and perhaps your CPU (or GPU) started to heat up and what you heard was a fan reacting to that.&nbsp; If the fan was dirty/dusty, it
 might have been out of balance which would created more noise than normal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably&nbsp; nothing to worry about.&nbsp;

<h2>            Microsoft Lifechat LX-3000 headset constant crackling noise</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently purchased the Lifechat LX-3000 headset, but most of the time there is a terrible crackling noise on all sounds that come throught the headphones. Sometimes, for a very short while, it's okay.. but most of the time, they're completey useless
 to me for this reason. They connect via USB, and after a bit of research, found that this may be causing the problem, due to the headset not using the computers sound card. How can I fix this issue and use the product I payed for??</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Headset &#40;Astro A10&#41; has choppy audio</h2>
                    I have had this going on for a while now, and I have no clue why. Whenever I play on my Xbox, the audio gets really choppy, however, when I use my headset on my iPad, PC, etc., this doesn’t happen, meaning it’s a problem with the controller/console. I’ve
 tried hard resetting my Xbox, restarting my Xbox, (via the guide), checking for updates for my controller, resyncing my controller, and the list goes on. I’ve looked up multiple guides telling me how to solve this glitch, yet nothing seems to work. It’s starting
 to drive me crazy. <strong>Help.</strong>

            Hi there, I would recommend contacting Astro Support if none of those solutions worked. You can contact them here:&nbsp;https://help.astrogaming.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?mobile_site=true for assistance as they may be able to to help you fix the issues.

            You could also contact Xbox support as it could be a issue with the Console or controller. You can reach them here: support.xbox.com/contactus for assistance as they could also troubleshoot the problem if it's not the headset.

<p>Are you a Dashboard Preview member? If so then you should report it via the Xbox Insider app reporting function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be a controller/console issue as I too have been experiencing intermittent audio issues on my Turtle Beach XO4 Stealth headset. I noticed something interesting for one of those occasions that I had also streamed via Mixer. During playback of the
 VOD, I noticed that the audio issues I had been hearing in the headset weren't present in the VOD so that leaves me thinking that Microsoft has some issue with the audio feed being sent from the console to the controller and/or chatpad headset jack.</p>

            <span>I finally figured out whats going on with most of these issues. Its a power issue. After quite a bit of trouble shooting, I unplugged certain electronic devices plugged into my surge protector and it fixed the issue
 right away. Thats why a lot of people get some kind of fix after restarting because it is a power issue. Too much on one surge protector or certain devices interacting with the whole surge protector. Try it out and I promise you it will fix it as soon as you
 unplug whatever is effecting it. Also keep in mind whatever is plugged into the second outlet on the wall as well. I hope this help all of you cause this was driving me crazy!</span>

<p>
</p><p>Have removed McAfee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have run Data Lifeguard Diagnostic. Both the Quick Test and the Extended Test gave a Pass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have run the System File Checker. Think it took about half an hour before it came up with "Beginning System Scan.". Then it went through the verification phase and got to 100% complete. Then it gave the message "Windows Resource Protection could not perform
 the requested operation".</p>

<p>Scanhealth seemed to go through OK and reported that there were problems which could be fixed.</p>
<p>Restorehealth appeared to get to 100% complete but reported Error 0x80240021, followed by:</p>
<p>DISM failed, No operation was performed.</p>
<p>Here's the link to the log file:&nbsp;http://1drv.ms/1MWdrfA</p>

    <title>Photo editing problem on Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laram&#233;rn&#246;kasszony  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo editing problem on Win7</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
I just bought a new Nokia Lumia 900 phone. I would like to edit my photos on my PC (Win7), but I can't modify them. I synchronised my photos with Zune and copied all of them to an another Folder on my PC, I tried to edit them with ACDsee Photo Manager and Adobe
 Photoshop too, but it always failed, and an error message comes out everytime 'Can't write output file'. Only Paint allows me to modify the photos (I dunno why). I have the right Security settings in the Folder Properties, but when I open the Folder's Properties
 window, it says that its write-protected.<br />
On my General tab there are 2 checkboxes:<br />
1. write-protected (only for the folder's files)<br />
2. hidden<br />
<br />
The 1st one is always ticked...when I try to untick, it opens a window and offers 2 radiobuttons:<br />
1. Save changes for only this folder<br />
2. Save changes for this folder, the subfolders and the files.<br />
<br />
I can only choose the 2nd one, and when I click on 'OK' nothing happens...when I reopen the Properties and General tab of the Folder, the write-protected checkbox is still ticked.
<br />
The strange thing is that, I can edit/modify every photo on my PC, except the Lumia captured ones..only Paint allow me to modify them. What&nbsp; is the problem with the Folder or the photos? What can I do?<br />
<br />
PS: I've already wrote to the WP7 Forum, and they suggested this section...hope somebody can help me...you are my last hope!
<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
Lara

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Button turns blue when I move the cursor over it and doesn&#39;t do anything when I left click.</h2>
                    <p>I have tried as many of the fix options as I could find on the internet including everything on this Microsoft Community site.&nbsp; None&nbsp;have made&nbsp;any difference.&nbsp; I have done a full reset twice to no avail.&nbsp; The first time I recreated everything I had done
 before.&nbsp; The second time I added a non-Microsoft account as my main account.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; I am running on an ACER Aspire with 4Gb RAM and 500Gb hard drive.&nbsp; Fortunately I was able to get Settings on the taskbar and I utilize that for most things.&nbsp; Right click
 on the Start button works.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Probably not what you want to hear but timing is everything.&nbsp; After waiting for almost 3 weeks for someone to respond with a solution I was about to give up.&nbsp; I decide to try one last time so over the weekend I did the Windows 10 restore AGAIN but this time
 leaving all data on the system and loading O/S only.&nbsp; After the reset I added my normal userid and tried once again to "left click" the start button .....&nbsp; it still turned blue but IT WORKED !!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no logical reason for it to work this time that I can determine&nbsp;but I'll take it !&nbsp;</p>

<h3> warrior161  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 won&#39;t boot from recovery drive</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create a "just in case" Recovery USB stick for my working Surface Pro 4. I have tried "Create a recovery drive" with "back up system files...", and without system files but with downloaded Windows 10 recovery files. I've tried doing
 the same using Rufus to generate a UEFI FAT32 stick. None of them will boot on my Pro 4. Even if I go into the UEFI and have the USB as the only boot device (it just drops through to the UEFI).
</p>
<p>I have also tried turning off security. </p>
<p>I have used various USB sticks of various sizes all 16GB or more. </p>
<p>My Pro 4 boots from a Paragon Hard Disk Manager stick and from a Windows 10 USB using "MediaCreationTool1803.exe".<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are a lot of references to this problem online, is anyone going to sort it?</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Touchpad Scrolling Does Not Work&#47;Disabled.</h2>
                    After fooling around for a while because my wireless mouse would not work, I noticed the scrolling on my touchpad on my laptop does not work. There's not option for a touchpad under the Devices stuff, so what's going on and how can I fix it?&nbsp;

            <p>This may vary depending upon make and model, but for my Netbook:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;start&gt; &lt;control panel&gt; &lt;mouse&gt; [Device Settings] tab, select your touchpad and make sure its enabled. If you click [settings], there may be some extra options in that menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Netbook also has a &lt;fn&gt;&lt;f10&gt; option to turn the touchpad on or off. If yours has a similar button, make sure the touchpad is turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, If you look in Device Manager is the touchpad listed and shown as enabled? Probably under Mice and other pointing devices.</p>
