<h2>            Deleting in Excel.</h2>
                    In Excel the&nbsp;delete&nbsp;key will work only on a single cell. &nbsp;If multiple cells are selected, the clear icon in the ribbon must be used. &nbsp;Word will delete multiple cells in a table just with the delete key. &nbsp; Why can't we have that feature in Excel.

            <p>The [Del] key works fine to delete the contents/formulas in multiple cells in Excel 2010 for me.</p>
<p>If you mean to actually delete the entire cells, use the DELETE entry in the Cells group of the Home tab.&nbsp; It can be used to delete just a few cells or entire rows/columns.&nbsp; It has a pull-down tab that you can choose from several options and the resulting
 action (delete entire row/column or delete cell/cells and either move those below the deleted ones up or those to the right of the deleted ones to the left).</p>

<p>System acting up tonight - pardon the extra post - wouldn't let me edit the earlier one.</p>

            <p>1. Emails in the Deleted folder will be purged after 10 days. </p>
<p>2. The " recover deleted messages " option can only recover those deleted less than 5 days ago.</p>
<p>In short, after 10 days&nbsp; from the day they were deleted, those messages&nbsp;will be&nbsp;gone for good.</p>

                    <p><span>Hi
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am using Outlook 365 2013 and my data usage is outrageous - more than 6gb a day - just from Outlook. I live in Australia with
 very expensive metred connections so I need to resolve this - I can't just use metred connections settings as I do need to use my email everyday.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have 5 email addresses in the account - 4 IMAP and 1 POP. I didn't set this up and I only have limited knowledge of these
 things but I need to get this resolved asap so any help would be massively appreciated. These are business email addresses so I can't use gmail - I rely on Outlook and use it everyday but with a 200gb monthly limit in my new place I'm pretty screwed by Outlook
 at the moment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks</span></p>

            <p>Hi Rachael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Data usage is dependent on the size of the emails that you are receiving or sending. Especially if they have large file attachments, that would use up your data as well. It goes with other applications you have that uses your connection. We would love to
 assist you with this but that would be handled by your internet service provider.</p>
<p>

            It really isn't anything to do with the size of the emails or my internet provider so if you could provide another response that would be helpful. The emails I receive are text based and rarely with attachments. It's also nothing to do with other applications
 - my data usage from the last 30 days is 31.48 gb (I've hardly used it over the festive period) and of all the applications and programs, Outlook has used 29 gb! So it is definitely a problem with Outlook.

<h3> truthof42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a watermark, only when printed or saved</h2>
                    How can I create a watermark that ONLY appears when the document is printed. Ideally, the water mark would also appear if the document is was saved to another directory. The reason for this is that we want our ISO documents to have the label of "uncontrolled"
 whenever a document has been printed, but this would not be a very good idea the original document also said uncontrolled.<br />
<br />
Warm Regards,<br />

            What you want to do is stretching Word somewhat. For ISO documents you would probably be better served with "Change control" or "Document Management"&nbsp; software to handle "control" of this documentation.<br />

Here are some tips you may be able to adapt to your needs:<br />

<span>Macro to toggle “DRAFT” Watermark</span>
<p><span>From: "Cutler, Wendy SDES:EX" &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Date: Thu, 20 Apr 2000 15:08:42 -0700</span></p>
<p><span>Here it is: when a new document is based on a template that has the DraftWatermarkInsert code executed, it puts the watermark on every page (via every header). When you toggle a DraftOnOff button, it
 executes DraftWatermarkOnOff, which makes the text hidden or not and turns Show/Hide to Hide. I also like the fact that as a byproduct, when the document is no longer a draft, the paragraph marks get turned off.</span></p>
<p><span>Right now I have Autonew execute the DraftWatermarkInsert code. I'd think you could run it on the template itself so new documents would just get the headers with that already there. I'd be interested
 in opinions on whether it's better to have the watermark already in the template or have it added to new documents via the autonew, or does it matter? I think by 'better', I mean from a maintenance viewpoint. Our workgroup templates are on the LAN. We don't
 use any global templates (and in spite of everything that's been written here, I haven't learned what that means or where they would be, though I'm sure I've saved the notes that explain that).

<p>Now to put the watermark behind the text, you need to put it in the Header of your document. You can think of it as slipping the watermark under the text. To automate the process, you need to record a macro to insert the watermark. Once
 you have created a macro, you can quickly add your watermark whenever you want.</p>
<p>Open a new, blank document. Turn on the Macro Recorder by either choosing Tools|Macro|Record New Macro or by double-clicking the REC button at the bottom/middle of your Word window in the status bar. Type a name for the macro. Because
 you will need to record a new macro for each AutoText watermark you insert, again it helps to name them logically. Change the ending part of the name to match the watermark that will be inserted, such as InsertWatermark_Confidential and InsertWatermark_Draft.</p>
<p>After you type a name for your macro and click OK, Word begins recording your keystrokes. So choose View|Header and Footer. By default your insertion point will be within the Header. Click Insert|AutoText and choose the name of the appropriate
 watermark. Once the Textbox is inserted into the Header, click Close in the Header/Footer toolbar to close the header. Then press the Stop Recording button on the little Macro toolbar the turn off the Macro recorder.</p>
<p>When you're done recording, you now have several macros that insert appropriate AutoText watermarks into the Header of your document. The watermark text you created is displayed behind your document text. The watermark may be difficult
 to see if you made it really light, so it may not show up until you print the document or view it within Print Preview.</p>
<p>These macros can now be added to a custom toolbar or menu so you can apply each watermark with a quick click. For more information about adding macros to a toolbar or menu, as well as learning how to share these macros, see this article:

<h2>            E72 - Nokia messaging</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last weekend I've bought the E72 and I have some trouble in getting the Nokia messaging at work. First I defined my work's email account via Lotus Notes Travler. Afterwards I created a connection to another e-mail address (choosen "Other" as e-mail service
 in the wizard). I was able to retrieve my mails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Afterwards I read about Nokia Messaging, so I've created an account (with my gmail address) and deleted my personal account. However when creating a new mailbox with the log in data for Nokia Messaging nothing happens and I just return to the screen where
 you can select the mail service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some additional info:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connection is WIFI</p>
<p>Country : Belgium</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you need to connect the phone to the Nokia messaging system ? Do I need to perform a reset (soft(?) - hard(?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tnx in advance for helping me solving this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last weekend I've bought the E72 and I have some trouble in getting the Nokia messaging at work. First I defined my work's email account via Lotus Notes Travler. Afterwards I created a connection to another e-mail address (choosen "Other" as e-mail service
 in the wizard). I was able to retrieve my mails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Afterwards I read about Nokia Messaging, so I've created an account (with my gmail address) and deleted my personal account. However when creating a new mailbox with the log in data for Nokia Messaging nothing happens and I just return to the screen where
 you can select the mail service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some additional info:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connection is WIFI</p>
<p>Country : Belgium</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you need to connect the phone to the Nokia messaging system ? Do I need to perform a reset (soft(?) - hard(?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tnx in advance for helping me solving this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<h2>            Will Office 365 University Expire after I graduate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>If I were to buy Microsoft 365 University this semester, would my &nbsp;4 year subscription end after I graduate? I graduate in December, so what would my usage with 365 University look like if I were to get it now? Would it just be better to get a regular 2010
 or 2013 Office, instead?</p>

            Your four year subscription will end after four years unless you renew it.<br />
<br />
Much as I try, I cannot get to like Office 2013, and I don't like the idea that the busybodies at the NSA have easy access to your on-line data, so if it was my money, I would be inclined to buy Office 2010 on disc from a retailer with stock (Amazon?). However
 as it is no longer available from Microsoft you may not be able to get any educational discount, unless your educational facility has it available.<br />

            I agree with Graham, unless there are specific 2013 features you NEED, my personal preference is to stay with 2010 or earlier.&nbsp; As well as buying it new, you do have the option of buying a "used" 2010 Retail (boxed CD) license from someone who has upgraded
 to 2013 and is happy to recover some of their "investment" in 2010.&nbsp; A school is a good place to find used copies.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Take a look through the forum and you'll see that many people are having "adventures" installing 365 and keeping it running.<br />
<br />
Sorry to say, but things are not as clear cut as that about how long the 365 University license will stay working.<br />
<br />
I contacted MS support, and after a minimum of run around (compared to many horror stories I've heard) apparently MS "automatically" checks your student status on the anniversary of you activating it. Support were not able to provide any documentation to support
 this, but the implication is that if you are no longer a student, ie your EDU address is no longer active (but it may be a deeper check) then you no longer qualify and they will automatically deactivate your license.&nbsp; If you learn otherwise, especially with
 documentary support, please let us know.<br />

</span>- FAQ for Office University ID validation (annual student validation)</b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Q: </b>How often does my academic status need to be verified? </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>A:</b> Once a year. Or, we should say, once every 12 months from your last verification date.
</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Well, that is a little disconcerting. So I used the contact link on that page and had the following conversation to get clarification on the need for academic verification.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The answer is “maybe”. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The short answer is, contrary to what the advertising says, the subscription is only good while you are a student and for at most 1 year after.<span>&nbsp;
</span>MS automatically verifies your academic status every year, so after you graduate, when your anniversary date rolls around your subscription will be cancelled.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At the end of the conversation, there is a slight hope that the automatic renewal verification is simply a check to see if your EDU email address is still active. In that case, if the school allows you to continue to use your EDU email after graduation,
 you could continue to use Office 365 University.</p>
<p>For your edification, here is the whole conversation,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:01:57 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>no problem, I will be here ... &lt;grin&gt;</p>

<p>I see here you &nbsp;have &nbsp;an inquiry about Office 365 University?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:05:35 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I have a question about the Office 365 University subscription terms.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offer says the subscription is good for 4 years after you provide proof you are a student, after your "academic status is verified"....
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This FAQ page expands on that: <a href="https://www.msacademicverify.com/AVE/FAQ/Default.aspx?pid=26FD2679-84F3-4111-A0FE-340D5CF03032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</span></p>
<p>It says quote</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Q: How often does my academic status need to be verified?
</p>
<p>A: Once a year. Or, we should say, once every 12 months from your last verification date.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question is. If I buy 365 university in my last year and it is verified then, what happens to the subscription one year later when I have to verify my academic status again an I have graduated?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:09:11 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good question, the verification will conduct one time only, just to make sure that the customer is really a legit student from a certain university , and it will last for four years or until the subscription ends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:10:28 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would hope that is true. If it is true, then the FAQ has to be corrected because it gives a very different impression. Is your interpretation available online anywhere that I can see?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:15:15 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is true, and that is what we are trained to give the details for our product. Once your Office 365 University is activated on your Microsoft Account with the confirmation that you are with the University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subscription will stay after 4 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:17:34 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need a link that contradicts the content in the FAQ. I provide support to people who are asking this question and they need to see something "official" from MS as confirmation. Right now all they see is that FAQ entry that says they
 will/could be "ripped off" after just one year of use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if I can point to them to a web page that says what you have just said, they will believe me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:19:29 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please send me the link again containing the FAQ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:20:01 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure here it is <a href="https://www.msacademicverify.com/AVE/FAQ/Default.aspx?pid=26FD2679-84F3-4111-A0FE-340D5CF03032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:22:36 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just stay on the line please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:22:49 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:29:11 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What does being verified mean? </p>
<p>A: Simply put, being verified means that the academic status of a user has been confirmed by the verification source (usually a school, organization or commercial student identity provider) selected by the user within the Academic Verification
 Engine. Each user has to be verified as a student or educator before taking advantage of the education product offers in this site. We verify student status the first time they visit, and then once a year thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:31:06 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I have is with the last line “We verify student status the first time they visit,
<b>and then once a year thereafter.”</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:32:36 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verification will be automatic, it will send email to your school just to check that you are still associated with them.</p>
<p>Same as what I have said that no need for you to update since the email will go directly to your school for the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:34:22 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>YES, that is precisely the problem. Office 365/2013 just came out. A student who is graduating this year or next year buys it. After they graduate they will no longer be students and what you are saying is that the subscription will be
 automatically cancelled before the 4 year term is up because they are no longer students. That is FALSE ADVERTISING!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:43:41 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ron you have a very interesting question which the first time I have encountered, to better answer your question is for you to verify the school policy on how long they will keep your account as an active student, and for the Product
 title itself it's a University, it's for student and I get your point for the graduating issue, but it's with school's policy that will provide you the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:48:33 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have encountered this question several times. I finally decided to try and get official clarification. Lets face it, no school is going to tell MS a former student is still a student (for up to 3 years) just to allow the student to
 continue to use Office University. THAT would be a VIOLATION of their agreement with MS. Your interpretation of the license terms means that the price of Office 365 University has increased MANY times compared to the Office 2010 Academic Offer which was US$100
 for a license with no time limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:57:43 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ron, this is a fact that there will be administrator on your school that will take care of your school account, now they will be the one who will take charge as to when your account is still valid with them, and each school I believe
 that they have their own policy with school accounts which they can only answer that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:59:44 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, that is an interesting twist. Do you mean that the "academic verification question" is "is this school email account still valid" rather than is this person still a paying student (or paid staff)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>8:06:53 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ron, an honest answer is that I don't know the content of the email verification since it should have privacy as to the administrator will be the one who can read and will reply for the verification. So if you want that question be answered
 your school office is the appropriate to contact with that, there is so called school policy right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>8:08:03 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK. Thanks for you help. Even though I don’t like it, I have my answer. Office 365 University is good while you are in school and for no more than 1 year after you graduate no matter how much time remains in the 4 year subscription. Feedback</p>

            That's odd. I just got off the phone with a Microsoft representative and she says that as long as you're a student the first time you subscribe, it should last 4 years regardless of whether you graduate in between &nbsp;or not. I'm graduating in June and she
 reassured me that I will still be able to use it till October 2020. I was ready to ask for a refund and pay for a different package but I think I'll take her word for it...

            <p>Looks like they changed/clarified the wording for 365/2016 University.&nbsp; It now says the subscription is good for 4 years.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remember correctly the description was that the license was good for UP TO 4 years. The implication was that they could cancel it if you graduated and they found out you were no longer a student.&nbsp; Apparently they have not done that, at least I have
 not seen any reports of that happening. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just looked at the current MS License Terms for 365 Home/Personal/University. It is useless, it says nothing specific about the term or use limitations other than it is only for use by the student.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/UseTerms</p>
<p>
</p><p>University 365 /2013 also allowed the user to buy 1 additional 4 yr subscription extension after 3 years into the first one if they were still a student. I have not seen mention of this in the 2016 advertising.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update points to one user for programs, has documents in folder for different user.</h2>
                    <p>The last major update really messed up my computer. First, it looked like I lost ALL of my documents. I went to my various doc folders (Documents, Music, etc.) and they were all empty. Using Finder, I discovered there are now two users, Me.laptopxxx and
 Me. The pointers were all pointing to Me.laptopxxx but all my data files were in Me. I changed all the pointers in Finder, such as Quick Access to the folders that actually had the data, so I can now find my files. I tried printing something, and nothing printed.
 Turns out my computer is logged into Me.laptopxxx, and programs and printers can't find documents in Me. I can sometime browse to point to the documents, but my printer just hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this schizophrenic computer. How do I change the defult user from Me.laptopxxx to Me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may just switch back to a Mac if I can't get this fixed.</p>

<p>Hi, John, thanx for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is less than a year old. The problem started after an update that announced itself as the Windows Fall Creators Update upon completion. I have made no changes to my computer since then except adding my printer and installing tax software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there was an update that had failed several times, but I do not see that update in the list of updates anymore. I have seen no error messages since the update, but now that you mention it I do remember seeing the computer say that one of the big recent
 updates had failed and it was reverting to the previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only kind of troubleshooting I have done is to search through settings (made no changes) and to search online for information. I did update the Quick Access links in Finder to point to the correct folders holding data in user ME. The computer, however,
 logs into Me.laptopxxx and programs look for data files in this user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is any help, I have attached the list of installed updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom</p>

<p>So you could manage Accounts if other accounts are available to manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the ways to do that is from Control Panel and the other is from an app called netplwiz.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the Control Panel where you should see and be able to manage users just click on the win logo in the taskbar and type Control Panel and hit the Enter key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Control Panel Opens select <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">User Accounts</span> then click on
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2bc66ca-37a9-445d-b1dd-bbc96d596c94?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2bc66ca-37a9-445d-b1dd-bbc96d596c94?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the netplwiz you can Hold the windows key and hit the R key to start the Run Dialog and type &nbsp;&nbsp; netplwiz.exe &nbsp; then click on OK</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55269e07-bfe7-4d76-bcdf-5ed60600649f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55269e07-bfe7-4d76-bcdf-5ed60600649f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And it will open a User Dialog that should show registered Users that should be showing up at the login screen.</p>
<p>Also you could make some changes here if you wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7681b1a0-1206-4625-9425-911896e40ce1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7681b1a0-1206-4625-9425-911896e40ce1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if any of this will help but it should get you to where you can make some changes if you want.</p>

            That looks like it might work, but it has been years since I have had to edit the registry and I have forgotten how to do it.

<h3> fjm81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extreme lag in skype messages</h2>
                    <p>For the past month or so, I have been experiencing extreme lag in sending (and sometimes receiving) skype messages.&nbsp; It can sometimes take up to a minute for a message to go through.&nbsp; When I click send (or hit enter), the message will have the "sending..."
 status.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, sometimes receiving messages is slow, and downloading pictures/emojis is painfully slow as well.</p>
<p>I'm using a Win7x64 with the latest Skype version (8.3.x).&nbsp; Tried uninstalling and reinstalling Skype, and it hasn't helped.</p>
<p>In an office environment with a good Internet connection, and where colleagues do not experience this issue, so it's something with my machine.</p>
<p>Anyone experience similar issues?&nbsp; And any suggestions on how to fix this?</p>

                    Can anyone help me figure out why all of a sudden this is not syncing? It's not even a new section. It is one that I made months ago...

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The error code&nbsp;</span><span>0xE000002E<span> </span></span><span>that you see in OneNote means that it needs to refresh but cannot do so automatically. This is typically a temporary issue and should resolve itself the next time a full sync occurs.
 If you don’t want to wait for the next automatic sync, you can force a full sync by pressing
<strong>Shift+F9</strong> while OneNote is running.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persist, try to verify the sync status by following the steps below:<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>I</span><span>n OneNote, click&nbsp;</span><strong>File</strong><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>Info</strong><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>View Sync Status</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>I</span><span>n the&nbsp;</span><strong>Shared Notebook Synchronization</strong><span>&nbsp;dialog box, click any notebook icon with a yellow triangle warning over it to see the name of any section that’s causing sync problems.</span></li><li><span>C</span><span>lick the&nbsp;</span><strong>Sync Now</strong><span>&nbsp;button next to the notebook containing the section.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I</span><span>ndividual notebook sections can occasionally stop syncing properly. If you have a single section that isn’t syncing with the rest of an otherwise up-to-date notebook, you can try the following workaround:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>I</span><span>n the same notebook, create a new section.</span></li><li><span>C</span><span>opy (don’t move) all of the pages from the old section into the new one you just created. You can do this by right-clicking each page and then clicking&nbsp;</span><strong>Move or Copy</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>W</span><span>hen all of the pages have been copied to the new section, press Shift+F9 to manually sync the notebook. If a progress bar appears, wait for it to finish.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I</span>f following these steps successfully syncs the pages in the new section that you created, you can safely delete the old section and then continue working in the new. After the old section is deleted, you can rename the new section to the same
 name as the deleted section.<br />
<br />
If these steps don't work, section sync errors or problems can also be caused by a corrupted section located in the Notebook Recycle Bin. If you no longer want that section, you can delete it from the Recycle Bin to stop the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>I</span><span>n the OneNote notebook, click the&nbsp;</span><strong>History</strong><span>&nbsp;tab, and then click the&nbsp;</span><strong>Notebook Recycle Bin</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>R</span><span>ight-click the section (or page) and choose&nbsp;</span><strong>Move or copy</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Y</span><span>ou can also&nbsp;</span><strong>Copy</strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>Paste</strong><span>&nbsp;the pages or content in the section to another page or section. Once that's done, you can delete the original section or page.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we'll give you further assistance if needed.</p>

<h2>            Creating new bullets in Outlook and ADDING to the Bullet Library</h2>
                    <p>In ref to locked thread:<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have Office 2016 Desktop installed (not OFC360).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2013, any new bullet formats I created were captured for use in the bullet Library for future use in the next meeting invites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can create bullets with color/font size/etc. for that instance but on creating a new invite, I have to re-create that same bullet again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the method/steps to creating and retaining new bullet format in Outlook Meeting invites? Thanks.</p>

</p><p>I'm just a reg user with high level OS understanding of previous experiencing with the Office product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ADD newly defined bullets to the library for use on any future work product within Outlook. Not find a previously defined document, copy out the bullet and then apply to the current work document in Outlook.</p>

<h2>            No notification on messages sent to myself</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my OS phone to Windows 10 and although I am enjoying some improved features there are a few bugs.</p>
<p>In the Outlook Mobile App, when I send myself a message I do not get notified on my phone and the message is not in the notification list - the message is in the inbox.</p>
<p>This also happens if I send a message from one of my other accounts on the phone to the other.</p>
<p>When I copy myself on a message sent to other person, I do not get notification on the phone, but the message is in the notification list (the swipe down on the top of the phone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why?</p>

<p>Thank you once again for your message but either you or I are totally missing the point.</p>
<p>There is no <strong>Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features </strong>on my <strong>Settings</strong>. Please note that I am using windows 10 on my phone - a Windows phone not Android or IOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in the apps list (which is not under <strong>Settings</strong>), Outlook Mail does not have the option to uninstall it, only to pin it.</p>

</p><p>The issue that you might be encountering is notifications being turned off in Settings. To isolate the issue, let's try enabling the notification settings of the app. Please follow the steps below:</p>

</p><ol>
<li>Go to<strong> Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications and actions</strong>.</li><li>Under notifications and actions, go to <strong>Get notifications from these senders.</strong></li><li>Tap the <strong>Outlook Mail app</strong>.</li><li>Enable the notifications for the app.</li></ol>

<p>First of all yes all the settings are like that (the menu is slightly different with one additional switch on the top called simply "Notifications").</p>

<p>Thank you for letting us know. The issue that you're having might be an error with the latest OS update. In this case, we suggest that you perform a hard reset to rule out any software issues. This will remove your photos, apps, musics, and other files.

<p>Hi Arnie,</p>
<p>I was hoping I could avoid a hard reset. Have you seen my <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail-win_phone/not-getting-notification-of-emails-arriving-and/db002ddf-6f79-43a1-b5b9-f71546b44f70">
other more general question?</a></p>
<p>Do you think it is still necessary?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to check what the process would be on a hard reset, would windows 10 be installed immediately? Or will I have to go through the windows 8.1 install and then through all the windows 10 updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When will the back be restored? Upon the first installation or only after the installation of all updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also need one advice. When I first installed my phone I did it with a outlook.com account/ID. Since then I have subscribed to office365 Business but I never changed the into the office 365 ID. Would you advise my to do it now? I understand that I would
 have to them manually rebuild the whole app environment, subscribe to all the podcasts, etc. Do you see any advantage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate your advise.</p>

<p>Good day.</p>
<p>We have an Office 365 tenant and I'm a global administrator. By default, global admins are automatically verified admin in Yammer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We just recently noticed that two of our global admins are not verified admin in Yammer. After 2-3 days, their admin rights were back with us doing nothing in the portal. Today admin rights are missing again.</p>
<p>Please advise what is the cause of this problem.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h3> hobgoblin2009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sent Mails getting cut off sometimes, Why&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everybody,<br />
first i have to say sorry for my bad english.<br />
<br />
Then i try to tell you my issue.<br />
Sometimes it happens, that, when i write and send an E-Mail with Pocket Outlook, the aceptor of the message receives the email getted cut off<br />
after few sentences.<br />
It does not happen very often, but alway when i write a bigge mail, this gets cut off.<br />
This can be very annoying, when you don't know the problem why this happens?<br />
<br />
I&nbsp; got this problem on my "old" HTC Kaiser and on my "new" Xperia X1 with original WM 6.1.<br />
<br />
I also got friends, who got the same problem, and don't know how to solve this issue.<br />
<br />
Can you help me please or can you tell me why this happens? Perhaps i can avoid this problem?<br />
Thanks

<p>Does the recipient also have a Windows Mobile device? There is an option that lets you download the rest of the message or you can configure Outlook Mobile to download the entire message. In the email options, you can configure to download entire message.
 What email service do you use?</p>

            Because you indicated that the issue is with BOTH of your devices, I'm wondering if it is because of the mail provider you are using.&nbsp; Does the issue occur if you use, for example, your hotmail or live account?

            With both, <br />
<br />
i have a german web.de account and a live.de account.<br />
I also tried with a gmx account, the same.<br />
<br />
It always happens when Mail ist sent via SMTP.<br />
<br />
It dies not happen when you sent via Exchange.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to sent you the lines via PM?<br />
Then you can check it out.<br />
<br />
But as told above, i am not the only one who got this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Very strange issue particularly because it is happening on two devices.&nbsp; If it was only on oe then I would be tempted to say it is the device but with two different devices, it has to be related to the mail provider.<br />
<br />
have you tried deleting the email account and setting it up again manually (not auto detect)?

            No it cant, because i tried 3 different Mail Provider, included Hotmail.<br />
It's a bug in Outlook Mobile in all Windows Mobile 6.1 Roms.<br />
<br />
I also set up my Email account manually.<br />
I tried everything to find out why.<br />
<br />
In german boards, the problem is also knwon, but also no solution.<br />
Perhaps Microsoft should look for it.

<br />
I'm not experiencing it on my 6.1 ROM so I would hesitate to say it is a bug in ALL.&nbsp; I'm wondering if it is ONLY in your location...

            I have been having this same problem with my Samsung Saga Verizon phone, using WM Pro 6.2, for several months. Some of the emails I send, from an account configured with the same parameters as my main email account with Time Warner Cable ISP&nbsp; on my PC,
 will get truncated when I send them from the Saga. I send dozens of emails a day back and forth, many to the same address. Some will get truncated and some will not, regardless of the length of the email. Emails sent on this account, to the same destination,
 from my PC never ever get truncated.<br />
<br />
This happens regardless of whether I am using the Verizon cell network to transmit them, or my home WLAN, from the Saga.<br />
<br />
When it happens, the sent email is always preserved intact in the Sent Items folder on the Saga. If I then send another copy of it back to my own email address, and check it on my PC (or on the Saga ) I can see the same truncated message that the original recipient
 is seeing. <br />
<br />
I have hard reset and rebuilt the Saga many times in the past few months for the " usual reasons " with Windows Mobile, but it has never corrected this problem. Clearly it seems to be an issue with Outlook Mobile.
<br />
<br />
Searching tonight for a solution (which led me here) has revealed many similar forum&nbsp; posts dating back to Outlook 2003. So it isn't a new issue.
<br />
<br />
I would sure like a solution. <br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Diane,<br />
Are the account changes verified? It may send a mail with a link to confirm, and the changes may need a few hours to propagate through the system.<br />
Since the phone is new, a factory reset may be the best option. In Settings &gt; about = reset my phone, then start over. Please first verify that all is well in the account details regarding age, location and time-zone, on a PC:<br />

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 FREE UPGRADE</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had Windows 8.1 OEM version and upgraded to Windows 10 Insider Preview and currently running build 10130. Now that release date is announced and many things about free upgrade are being announced by Microsoft, I would like to know if my Insider Preview
 version will automatically get upgraded to Licensed version when Final Version is release in July or I have to first revert back to Windows 8.1 OEM version and then receive&nbsp; Free upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise</p>

    <title>Conditional Formatting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hawkwinduo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Formatting</h2>
                    <p>I have an "Expiration Date" field in a report with conditional formatting rules already on it to highlight if the date is between Now and Now +180 as well as &lt; Now</p>
<p>These are currently working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need is another expression to highlight the field if the person is newer that 6 months (Expiration Date isn't needed during this time)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can pull the&nbsp; "Report Date" from a field in a table or the query that the report is created from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>currently I am trying to use the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expression is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [tbl01]![ReportDate] &gt;= Date() -180</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried variations of &lt;=, +180 and using a Between statement</p>
<p>The other issue i have is that when i try to run the report i get an enter parameter dialog box for tbl01 that i don't want. if i leave it blank the report works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Have also tried putting the formatting into a different field in case there was some conflict ion with the other formatting rules but that didn't work either.</p>

            I don't believe you will ever need to reference the table name in an expression like this in a report. Every field name in a report's record source should be unique. If it isn't, then you should give it an alias in the SQL/query. 
<br />
<br />I would simply remove the table name since it seems to be causing the issue. 
<br />[ReportDate] &gt;= Date() -180       
        </p>

            If the Reportdata is not in the Recordsource of the report, then you will need to use a DLookup to find it. If it is, then using the table identifier is unnecessary.
<br />
<br />Also I would use the DateAdd function
<br />[ReportDate] &gt;= DateAdd("d",-180,Date())

<p>Thanks for the assistance. I won't be able to post an example DB for various reasons.</p>
<p>The Dateadd is useful for many other things i'm doing but doesn't solve my current issue.</p>

<p>[ReportDate] &gt;= DateAdd("m",-6, Now())</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i enter in a date that meets the criteria it works, things turn blue. but i want it to pull from the ReportDate Field from tbl01. When i use the expression builder i get.</p>
<p>[tbl01]![ReportDate] &gt;= DateAdd("m",-6, Now())</p>
<p>
</p><p>this still prompts me to enter a date, things don't turn blue.</p>

            You would need to add tbl01 to your report's record source or use DLookup() or some other solution to get the ReportDate into the report's Record Source.

<br />This assume that tbl01 is a one record table. Otherwise you do need a criteria to specify the record.

<br />So the Conditional formatting becomes:
<br />
<br />DLookup("[ReportDate]", "tbl01")&gt;=DateAdd("d",-180,Date())

    <title>selected fonts change back randomly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            selected fonts change back randomly</h2>
                    I had made many changes to my fonts in Outlook. They reverted back to the default.&nbsp; I changed just the size to 12 and they reverted to the default. Now only the read mail and the "FROM/SUBJECT/RECEIVED" row at the top is size 12.&nbsp; It happened between 8am
 and 4pm today and I have not closed/reopened Outlook.&nbsp; If I check the options they still show size 12.&nbsp; I had to create a new profile a couple of days ago as Outlook wouldn't accept mail from Gmail and it wouldn't let me update the gmail password in setup
 so I had to create a new profile. I lost my contacts in the process. How do I make these changes stick?

            Are you changing folders or changing the view? The fonts in the message list are in a view and changing the view or switching folders may use different fonts.  Resetting view will also change the settings - you should make a new view, not edit the default views.

<p>I didn't change views (this morning they are small again for unread mail) or folders. I have changed them in these two places:</p>
<p>View Settings (with the cogs)/Other Settings and looking now they all still show 12pt Segoe UI but the fonts have reverted. And I did a search for fonts and was given the Outlook options window, chose Mail/Stationery and Fonts and edited all three font options
 there which are still set at size 12 this morning. I have touched all three font settings, had the font change, and closed Outlook, and reopened it. It has kept the larger font, but it has done this before. I do not see a place to make a "new view".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my imap password is now set I don't want to mess with it, but if it happens again I will try this window.&nbsp; There were two places I was taken before, one didn't have the password at all ( file/ account settings/double click account) and the other ( file/
 account settings/repair/advanced options/let me repair/repair)&nbsp; either wouldn't let me highlight the password, or once it did it told me that there was a problem and outlook couldn't make the change.&nbsp; You might want to go over to the "can't download gmail"
 thread and suggest this window. The only thing that has worked over there is to create a new profile.</p>

<p>Yesterday I saved the view with a name and this morning it has reverted again with the new mail at font 10.
</p>
<p>I went to View/Change View and selected the new view "mine" and it did not change the text so I guess it didn't really did not pay any attention to the view I had at the time. I edited the view "mine" and the fonts were all set to 12.&nbsp; I poked them and the
 view changed.&nbsp; I wouldn't take a nickle in a bet that this won't happen again tomorrow.</p>

            Ok. This morning, again, the font reverted. I went to View and Change View. It was on the view "mine2" which I set up yesterday after resetting the font by just going there and saying "ok".&nbsp; I chose "mine" which was the one I did three days ago and it
 put the font back to 12. So you can't say that the view doesn't know that it's supposed to be 12.

    <title>Macro to split tabs by name to separate workbooks - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Macro to split tabs by name to separate workbooks</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a large Excel workbook with 2000+ tabs.&nbsp; Each tab is named according to a project # and task&nbsp;# (001111.001, 001111.002, etc.). Some projects will have one tab and others may have 80 tabs - each named as described above.&nbsp; I would like to have a macro
 that separates each set of project tabs to it's own workbook.&nbsp; It would be great if the workbook would just have the project # as its name (such as 001111).&nbsp; I have searched through all the articles and haven't found an answer that fits exactly what&nbsp;I need.&nbsp;
 Thanks you so much for any help you can give.</p>

                    Im trying to make a query that will intern becom a report. What i would like to do is make on input box re-ask for input multiple times to get as much information in the report as i can. is this possible?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            It's not clear from your post just what you have in mind by "re-ask for input multiple times".&nbsp; Do you want to return records which have one of several values in a column for instance, e.g. by entering a number of customers' names to open a report orders
 which returns orders made by any of those customers.&nbsp; If so then the simplest way is to launch the report from an unbound dialogue form which includes a multi-select list box of all customers, so you'd open the form, select as few or as many customers as desired
 in the list box, then click a button to open the form.&nbsp; To do this set up the list box like this:<br />
<br />
For its RowSource property:<br />
<br />
SELECT CustomerID, Customer FROM Customers ORDER BY Customer;<br />
<br />
For other properties:<br />
<br />
Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lstCustomers<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0cm;8cm (Access will automatically convert these to inches if you are not using metric measurements)<br />
MultiSelect:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple or Extended as preferred.<br />
<br />
Add a button to the form to open the report, called rptOrders in this example, with the following in its Click event procedure:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varItem As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strCustomerIDList As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strCriteria As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.lstCustomers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ctrl.ItemsSelected.Count &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In ctrl.ItemsSelected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCustomerIDList = strCustomerIDList &amp; "," &amp; ctrl.ItemData(varItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading comma<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCustomerIDList = Mid(strCustomerIDList, 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = "CustomerID In(" &amp; strCustomerIDList &amp; ")"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport "rptOrders", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View:=acViewPreview, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WhereCondition:=strCriteria<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "No customers selected", vbInformation, "Warning"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
Or do you want to enter values for one or more different columns, e.g. taking orders as an example again, you might want to return rows made by a particular customer and/or for a particular product, i.e. you can enter a customer, and return all orders by the
 customer regardless of product; or a product, and return all products ordered regardless of customer; or enter both and return all products ordered by the specific customer.&nbsp; If so then you can create a form with combo two boxes in which you select a customer
 and product, and create a report based on a query which references the combo boxes on the form in its WHERE clause like so:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;WHERE (CustomerID = Forms!YourForm!cboCustomer<br />
OR Forms!YourForm!cboCustomer IS NULL)<br />
AND (ProductID = Forms!YourForm!cboProduct<br />
OR Forms!YourForm!cboProduct IS NULL)<br />
<br />
NB: the parentheses around each OR operation are essential here to force them to evaluate independently of the AND operation.<br />
<br />
You then open the report from a button on the form with code in its Click event procedure like this:
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport "rptOrders", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View:=acViewPreview<br />
<br />
You don't need to filter the report by means of the WhereCondition argument in this case as the query restricts the report by referencing the controls on the form.<br />
<br />
If it's neither of these are what you have in mind then post back with a detailed description of exactly what you want to do.<br />

            Yes, you can have three separate parameters in a query.&nbsp; If they are on different columns put each on the first criteria line of each column in query design view; that translates to an AND operation.&nbsp; If they are all on the same column put them on separate
 criteria lines of the column in query design view; that translates to an OR operation.<br />
<br />
It gets more complex if you want to combine OR operations (on one column) with AND operations (on different columns), and it's often easier to do this in SQL view, where the logic will be more readily apparent.&nbsp; If you do enter parameters in SQL view, however,
 don't switch to design view, but save the query in SQL view.&nbsp; Otherwise you'll find Access has moved things around, perhaps quite considerably, in design view and while the query will work in the same way, the logic will not be very apparent.<br />
<br />
But when applying multiple criteria it's far better to do it via a dialogue form where the user can enter (or select from a list box as in first the example I gave) all the parameter values in one go, rather than being prompted successively for them.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, a query is not really converted to a report. They are separate objects, with the query as the report's RecordSource property.<br />

    <title>List of Figures, charts error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            List of Figures, charts error</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Greetings to everyone,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I have used Microsoft office especially word consistently over the past decades but I recently get into a problem I can't seem to understand the root.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
When I create a list of figure, chart or table automatically, I immediately get a big list in repetition. This could turn a 20 page document to over 300 pages.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
The document itself became too big that it cant be sent via ordinary email at just 27 pages. I am not sure why this problem is occuring and I have not found anywhere online where this same problem has been reported.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I would appreciate any has suggestions or hints why this is happening? Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <span>I figured out the problem.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>I had created each figure in a textbox to ease dragging around the document.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>I do not know how it happened but each figure I have in a text box has been duplicated over 1000 times. So I cleaned
 all the figures by deleting the duplicate figures in them.</span><br />
<span>Now the word count looks a bit normal. I will automate the whole figure and chart list again and see if it works
 fine.</span>

<p>A problem occurred with my Dell laptop, in order to fix it, i had to restore factory settings. As this removes all software, i then had to reinstall Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007 however my product key repeatedly returns an invalid message. Is this because
 it can't be installed a second time? Or have i somehow mixed up discs and their respective product keys?</p>
