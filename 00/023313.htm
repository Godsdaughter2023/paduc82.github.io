<h2>            Delete and reuse email address attached to custom domain</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of members accounts at a&nbsp;custom domain (domains.live.com) which I would like to convert from a full account (with email box)&nbsp;to an alias (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg607702.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg607702.aspx</a>).
 I have tested this and it works well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that if I delete the account then I understand it takes 270 days for the email address to become available as a working alias and I need it to be instant.&nbsp; Is there any way I can get these member accounts deleted and immediately recreate them
 as aliases?</p>

            <p>Hi 5h0d5n,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you would like to recreate a deleted account without the timeframe of 270 days. I apologize though but this is the standard time for accounts to go through the inactivation phase and for the username to be fully available again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            I am having the same problem with recreating deleted accounts.&nbsp; The response you provided may be fine for regular Outlook.com accounts. However, this is absolutely unacceptable for custom domains.&nbsp; I own this domain and any email accounts that are associated
 with this domain.&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to find out what needs to be dome in order to release the deleted account immediately.&nbsp; If you're unable to provide an answer, please provide the contact information for someone at Microsoft that can resolve this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand the accounts under your domain went into inactivity and is unacceptable to you, let me assist you regarding this. Let me first inform you that the inactivity period has been increased to 365 days. Even if the accounts are under your domain,
 they are still affected by the inactivity rule as these accounts are under Microsoft. They still need to sign in to the account so that it won't be marked as inactive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to ask if you have more questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

I suggest that you read the posting before your reply.  My accounts didn't go into inactivity. First, I have manually deleted some account and I am now unable to recreate them.  Second, I am paying for my email account.   



The reason why I have setup a custom domain instead of using your public email accounts is precisely to have more control over these accounts.  That includes adding, deleting, recreating, or anything else I need to do with my email addresses to conduct my business.  I understand that for public email addresses there is good reason for locking email accounts for an extended period.  However, there is no valid reason why Microsoft (or anyone else) can hold my own domain addresses hostage.  



Apparently, the people monitoring these communities are trained to respond from a script.  I demand that my email accounts be released or someone needs to provide one **** of a good reason as to why this cannot be done.

<br />
<br />Microsoft has dropped support for the Desktop version of OneNote in favor of the App version for Windows 10 and that has been removed form the Office 365 download . . . 
<br />
<br />Check this link for downloading OneNote 2016, it will work with your version of Office

                    I'm using windows 8.1 and signed in with a&nbsp;microsoft account.&nbsp; It shouldn't be asking me for credentials at all - other apps don't have to.&nbsp; Not only does it make me enter creds, it forgets them every time it starts and wants me to sign in again.&nbsp; That's
 annoying to the point of uselessness.&nbsp; Am I doing something wrong, or is this just a huge oversight?

</p><p>I've got the same complaint.&nbsp; Every single time I connect my Microsoft Band to my computer the dang Microsoft Band Sync desktop program asks for my username, password, and my authentication code.&nbsp; (I have 2-step authentication on my MS Account).</p>

            <p>The same 2fa problem exists with xbox music pass... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this: disable 2fa from your profile. open the health app, login. Now go back to your profile and reactivate 2fa. It's a bit of a pain but it's a 1 shot fix. Afterwards see if it will accept just your password (or if it even caches your password).&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Chomelchizo,<br />
<br />
I would like to suggest you work with your members in a SharePoint document library. A document library provides a secure place to store files where you and your co-workers can find them easily, work on them together, and access them from any device at any
 time. For example, you can use a document library on a site in SharePoint Online to store all files related to a specific project or a specific client. Adding files or moving files between folders is as easy as dragging and dropping them from one location
 to another. For more information: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-a-document-library-3b5976dd-65cf-4c9e-bf5a-713c10ca2872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What is a document library?</a><br />
<br />
Besides, if you have any other questions, please feel free to post a new thread in this forum, we are willing to help you separately.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

    <title>Powerpoint Password changes on its own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laward3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint Password changes on its own</h2>
                    <p>I have to share files with clients and I used to be able to put a password on the powerpoint presentations and send them. I don't want them to be editable and I want them to need a password to open them. I used to be able to just set a password for opening
 and it would work just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I set a password and it works, but then when I try to open the files the next day, it says that the password is incorrect!! I don't understand what is going on! I keep a password log so I know that the password is the correct password. I also tried
 saving them as a .ppt instead of a .pptx and that makes no difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me with this frustrating problem! At the very least, I need to be able to put a password for opening on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Lori&nbsp;</p>

<h3> cher208  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2019 Cannot send email</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded my desktop MSO2013 Pro to MSO2019 Pro Plus, but after upgrade I can receive but could not send email for all my email accounts, either gmail, yahoo mail (which are on IMAP/SMTP) or event Outlook mail (which is on MS Exchange).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message pop up is 'The operation failed. The messaging interfaces has returned an unknow error. If the problem persists, restart Outlook'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know about SSL or POP setting issue, so I've double check the setting/configuration for all my email accounts, could not spot any error (anyway I did not change any setting before or after upgrade).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I notice that during the process of checking the SSL or POP setting (which is Account Setting, Email Account, click 'Repair' or 'Change'), the MS Outlook Test message (gmail to yahoo mail or vice verse) initiated by the repair process was successfully
 send out and received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So not sure why I cannot create a new message and send out. Anyone can help? I'm running Win 10 build 17134</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I have an Exchange 2010 account that I sync with my HD7 using ActiveSync. Last night, I cleaned up my inbox on my phone, sorting emails into folders or deleting. This morning, however, when I got to my desktop, I see all the emails still in my inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shouldn't moving an email into a folder on my phone move it in Exchange as well? I checked with my phone who has an iphone and also connects via ActiveSync, and he says that his emails do indeed move on the server when he moves them on his phone.</p>
<p>Is it a setting somewhere?</p>

<p>Hello aland7169,</p>
<p>Using Exchange with WP7, the way syncing works is like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you make changes to your Exchange account on your phone (ie...Moving mail to folders, deleting/reading email).</li><li>Those changes aren't reflected on the Exchange server until the next phone sync. (It does not happen instantly)</li><li>The phone will next sync next time there is mail to be picked up. </li><li>When the phone makes a call to the server for the newly arrived mail, the changes you made on the phone should now be reflected and synced on the server side.</li></ul>
<p>This is by design, so that the Exchange client isn't using battery to sync unnecessarily every time you make a change.&nbsp; If you wish to see instant syncing when making changes, you can manually tap the sync icon at the bottom.&nbsp; Or you can simply wait for
 the next passive sync/mail delivery.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Danny L.</p>

    <title>My E90 review - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vmoisa  say:</h3>
<h2>            My E90 review</h2>
                    I have my new Nokia E90 for several weeks now and I had the chance to thoroughly "evaluate" it. I must say I am coming from a Nokia 9300 / 9300i, which means that I am influenced by them (I have used them for over 2 years now)<br />
<br />
First the good stuff about the E90:<br />
- SPEED - it is extremely fast compared to 9300i and all functions benefit from this. Everything works as it should be, including Internet browser, meaning that the waiting times are at a minimum on all applications.<br />
- 3G - I do not use video-calling too much, but my God the Internet at 3.5g is fast compared to GPRS ! Internet at high speed makes live much easier, while another very good aspect is the ability to make calls and stay connected on the Internet at the same
 time (impossible with GPRS).<br />
- You always have the possibility to choose the access point when needing an Internet connection. Every time an Internet connection is required, you are asked which access point should be used. On 9300i this wan only available for Internet Browser, while the
 E-mail program was much more difficult in this respect.<br />
- Larger inner screen. While 9300i dsipaly was only 640 pixels, E90 has 800. This in a benefit only for Internet browsing, even though most pages these days require 1024. Never the less, a step forward.<br />
- The keyboard is lit (finally) ! Very good !<br />
- The phone software can be up-graded by the user. This is a very smart move from Nokia ! No new software available for Nokia E90 just yet, though.<br />
- It has vibration alert. Good for meetings.<br />
- Power-up is done maybe 5 times faster than 9300 / 9300i. A Big step forward.<br />
- In two weeks my E90 never hanged-up, while 9300i would have hanged-up several times in this time.<br />
<br />
The bad stuff:<br />
- Missing shortcuts. Nokia 9300i is GREAT when it comes to shortcuts. The new E90 does not have too many shortcuts and some of them do not even work in all applications. I am especially missing the Ctrl+T for full screen (its lack is most annoying in Internet
 Browser and Acrobat reader) and the Zoom keys (Chr + arrows up and down) Having a BIG keyboard but being forced to work through the menus to perform simple tasks is AWFUL. A big step back from 9300i.<br />
- Missing buttons on the right of the screen. Not only that E90 has only two buttons on the right of the screen (compared to 9300 / 9300i), but they are normally full with "Options" and "Exit". 9300i was very smart: have important functions on those 4 buttons
 on the right of the screen, while keeping a proper, computer-like menu on top of the screen. Another step back from 9300i.<br />
- Internet Browser does not allow to open a new window, unless a web page is opening a new window. You do not have anymore the option of opening a link in a new window. So we have now an Internet Browser which is performing slightly better than the one in 9300i,
 but with fewer functions. Another step back from 9300i.<br />
- E-mails are displayed without the "To:" and "Date:" field, unlike in the 9300i. If you want to see when the message and to whom it was sent, you have to check the "Message details". Again, why the big screen if it in not user properly ?<br />
- No fax. I cannot believe this ! Another step back from 9300i.<br />
- Computer has only basic functions and it does not know the order of operation (in the 21st century !). This is step back compared to the very good computer available on 9300i.<br />
- It does not show the phone number of the person calling, only the name. If a person is calling and the contact has several numbers in memory, you do not know from which number that person is calling from. The 9300i was showing the number on the inner display
 (not on the outer display though). For me this is a big problem since I have to reject calls from some numbers and accept calls from other numbers, for the same contact name. Of course I can go around it by putting the same person on two contact names with
 different number, but why ? The displays are huge, so the number of the caller would easily fit on the screen. Another step back from 9300i.<br />
- Search function for contact was very much simplified. You can no longer search a contact by company name, job of phone number. Even though this function was slow in 9300i, at least it worked. Another step back from 9300i.<br />
- Keyboard keys are very stiff. The keyboard on 9300i was perfect in terms of ergonomic (at least for my fingers) They keyboard on E90 gives me cramps on fingers because I have to press much harder on keys.<br />
- Keyboard is touching the screen and leaves grease mark all over it. Very annoying because you have to clean the screen very often.<br />
- No BACK-UP to Memory card function anymore ! I have to keep a back-up copy of the phone in my computer, instead of the memory card. If my E90 gets broken, I will have to connect the new one to a computer. Another step back from 9300i.<br />
- Multitasking have a strange meaning on the E90. You can no longer have opened in the same time the Messaging program and several messages. If you open a message, the entire messaging program is blocked with it. If you want to see two E-mail messages in the
 same time, you have to close one of them and open the other. Same, if you open a document from File Manager, the entire File Manager is blocked until you close the document. Another MAJOR step back from 9300i.<br />
- Calendar does not show the "Number of years" for anniversaries. Another MAJOR step back from 9300i.<br />
- Notes are no longer on the Desk, but in a separate program. This new program is very good because it searches for E-mail addresses, web addresses and phone numbers in the notes (something which 9300i was not doing), but the notes are no longer sticking on
 your face. The display is big, why use it ?!<br />
- Text documents (.txt) are opened by default in an viewer which does not allow editing, just viewing (?)<br />
- I do prefer the Office programs (Text editor and spreadsheet editor) on 9300i. Quickoffice might display the documents better, but it has one very annoying "feature": you have to switch from edit mode to viewer mode. Why ?<br />
- I did prefer the Picture Viewer and the Music Player on the 9300i. The new ones want to be smart an search for available pictures / music all over the phone. I just preferred to tell the software which folder I want to see / play. Maybe it is a matter of
 taste and this was a response to the iPod (which is definitely not on my taste)<br />
<br />
The two new major features added on E90:<br />
- GPS is EXTREMELY slow on acquiring the position. I actually use it with an external GPS mouse connected to the phone via Bluetooth. It work 10 times faster !<br />
- CAMERA: all pictures have a blue tint, while the camera button is very hard to be used. On top of this, the long time from the moment the button is depressed until the picture is taken makes the camera almost impossible to use in real life. To obtain acceptable
 results you need to take pictures in full natural light, on static subject, and with a lot of patience. So forget about the camera. Moreover, in my line of work I am not allowed to enter with a camera phone on some of the customer's premises, so I have to
 leave the phone outside and change the SIM to another phone.... Why do we not have the choice to have the phone without the camera, like on E50 ?<br />
<br />
All in all:<br />
- If you do not count the incredible speed and the 3G, E90 is a step back from 9300i on almost all functions.<br />
- Nokia 9300i was designed for power users, having in mind the person which is using a PC computer at full capacity and expects a similar performance from a Communicator. Nokia E90 was designed for kids who want to show off with an expensive phone, not for
 power users.<br />
- I was expecting from Nokia just a 9300i communicator with 3G and 10 times the speed. It really does not need anything more, hence the camera or GPS.<br />
- The fact that I can have the same application running both on the large inner screen and on the smaller outer screed is of no use for me. If I wanted to use the applications on the smaller outer screen I would have bought the Nokia N95.<br />
- I do not think I could come back to Nokia 9300i because it is VERY slow compared to Nokia E90. But just for speed and 3G I have to make A LOT of compromises.<br />
- However, if I brake the E90 (which is very easy with a phone of this size), I am not sure I will pay the same money for it again. I will probably buy a new 9300i which is very cheap these days and incredible value for money.<br />
<br />
Now, I would very much like to have somebody tell me that I am wrong and that all the features that I am missing so much actually exist and I just did not see them...<br />

            I could not agree more with your comments.<br />
<br />
I have just one statement that explains all this...<br />
<br />
"Symbian Series 60"<br />
<br />
They used Symbian Series 60 on it instead of continuing the development of Series 80 that powered the previous Communicators. Series 60 is designed to be navigated and used with your thumb/finger on smaller screens and therefore most of the ease of use the
 keyboard offers has been stripped, hence the reason half the time the short cuts and lack of overall screen usage does not appear to be suited to the E90.<br />
<br />
I don't know what influenced them to do it whether it was a commercial cost saving decision or a practical one but it really has negatively impacted the E90. Yes it continues to be a uber cool toy and you look the business when you whip it out but it's lost
 a hell of a lot of its usefulness if your trying to get some serious use out of it.<br />
<br />
Having said all that...I believe if you never had the chance to use the 9300 most of the E90's faults will wash over you and you will muddle along just fine with it because you will never know how much better it could have been. It's still a very useful tool,
 just not as useful.<br />
<br />
Also, the one advantage of bringing it to series 60 standard is that firmware updates will probably happen much more quickly and the range of software available will be greater.

            Why not just post a link rather than take up an entire page?<br />
<br />
Anyway, the reason for S60 on the E90 is quite simple.<br />
<br />
Take a 9300i Communicator and type an SMS on the outside. Then stop, and open up the Communicator and finish it. Can't be done because there are 2 different OS's on one device. S60 combines the inside and outside into a transparent OS. The other reason is quite
 simple. More software for S60 than S80. Developers are happy to have to develop for only one OS rather than for 2. Any software you are running on S60 will install and run on your E90. Third, things change, and times move on. The E90 is more powerful, and
 faster than any of the previous Communicators.

<br />
I totally agree that E90 is a very powerful unit. However, my complains are mainly about software. The way I see it, Nokia preffered the simple way: just bolt a QWERTY keyboard and a huge screen on a N95 and that's it. If they were only changing the software
 a little bit, at least to keep the same functions as 9300i and it would have been a trully astonishing Communicator. Now it is just something you have to compromise to live with. It is a real shame...

            After almost 2 weeks of working well, my E90 crashed. First I was not able to speak through the Bluetooth headset even if it was connected to the phone. Than the phone suddenly tuned itslef off and refused to turn on from the power button. I had to remove
 the battery and than start it again. Now it works well.<br />
<br />
However, I've learned two lessons:<br />
1. Turning the phone off does not turn it off completely. You have to take out the battery.<br />
2. E90 has a serious problem, so I have to check it from time to time, just to make sure it is still working... No comment.

There is a button with a light bulb on it, in the upper left corner of the QWERTY keyboard, below the "Desk" button. Be advised that the keyboard light is dim and you will only see it in near total darkness. Good luck !

No, no, no.. I did not say the keyboard light is TOO dim, I just said it is dim. For me it is perfect, nothing to change there.

            Ok, so you are using Outlook desktop software, not Outlook on the web. (This was posted to the outlook on the web forum) 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; to compose messages I have already the option for HTML 
<br />Ok. If you clicked 'do not ask again' in a dialog box, you need to edit a registry key to show it again.  Is the box you are talking about the compatibility checker when switching formats - it tells you if you might lose images, etc?  That is the HTML/Plain text Compatibility Checker - 
<br />keyHKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\Data
<br />Value: SettingsWordMail

            The link button is active only if you have more than one section. Each header/footer can be linked to (or unlinked from) the corresponding header/footer in the previous section. So if you have enabled both "Different first page" and "Different odd and
 even," you will have three separate headers and footers, and the First Page Header/Footer in section 2 can be linked only to the First Page Header/Footer in section 1; same for Even/Odd Page Headers/Footers. For more on headers and footers, see

            Are you requesting read/delivery receipts? That is the only time you'll have tracking information.
<br />
<br />After the receipts are retuned and processed, the sent message is updated and a button added to the ribbon.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92ebc309-58f7-465e-a3b2-3b950b809cd0?upload=true" />

            It only comes up once the tracking is processed. Did you get the receipt back? If not, it's not going to show, If yes, open the tracking message to trigger processing. If it has the TNEF data on it, it will update the message. If the TNEF data was removed by a mail server, it won't update the message. 
<br />
<br />Messages within Exchange server should always update automatically.

            <p>I have been tasked with creating a way to track large evidence files for an accreditation review. It would be very useful if I could have section tabs that detailed the argument and pages that I could color (including the tabs to the right of the page) to
 denote when evidence is sufficient, deficient, and incomplete (Green, Red, yellow).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than creating a notebook for each criterion, I cannot figure out a way to track evidence to argument unless I can change the page tab colors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this make any sense?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can help I would appreciate it.</p>

<h2>            Option Button Problem&#63; Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a couple of option buttons that for some reason aren't unclicking. They are ALWAYS pressed. It doesn't bother me but it looks like it's already &nbsp;clicked causing some people to actually&nbsp;think it's already clicked and making them&nbsp;not pressing it, causing
 them not to activate a macro. <strong>How can unclick an option button without having to add another one to my worksheet?
</strong>I've already tried recording a macro that unclicks it, but it seems like it doesn't recognize me clicking it.&nbsp; So that doesn't work. But I don't need a vba or formula I need steps, that way i can record it to one of my necessary macros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, and thank you to everyone who helps me!</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6700&#58; Difficulty Removing the MicroSD Card...</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am new to this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently purchased a Nokia 6700 Classic and just yesterday wanted to remove the MicroSD card that came with the phone so that I can put in my own 8GB card. However, when I tried to press the card in slightly to release the lock (as per instructions
 in the User Guide) it could not be pressed in... I ended up just pulling the card out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is: have I unwittingly damaged the lock mechanism when I pulled the card out? Or, was the lock mechanism jammed in the first place (as I could not press the card in)? Or, are the instructions in the User Guide wrong? (that is, there is actually
 no lock mechanism and the right way to remove the card is to just pull it out).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any information/input/advice is much appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warmest regards,</p>
<p>C Y Poh</p>

<p>Hello gbabia, thanks for the info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also called Nokia Malaysia this morning, and according to them to remove the MicroSD card all I need to do is to pull the card out using my fingernail against the raised curved edge of the card... there is no push-in-and-release lock mechanism; this
 is at least the case for units sold in Malaysia. Also, I found out that the tap-to-mute, tap-to-reject-calls and tap-to-display-clock functions are all disabled for Nokia 6700 Classic sold in Malaysia... oh well, just my luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Have you tried starting Word in Safe mode, as part of troubleshooting? See <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Work-with-Office-safe-modes-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1#__toc312758060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If Safe mode works, that limits the number of possible causes to three: a damaged Normal template, corrupt registry entries for Word, an add-in. Try it and report back with your results.</p>

            <p>Safe mode seems to work fine. However, I was having this problem before wiping my system and reinstalling Windows. It seems odd to me that a damaged template, corrupt registry entries, or any of the default add-ins would would be present after a format and
 fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked add-ins and didn't see anything unusual there.</p>
<p>I deleted the templates and that seems to have fixed it for now. </p>
<p>I noticed that Office hadn't updated the November patch yet either, so I forced that update too. Thanks for the help and here's to hoping everything keeps working!<br />
</p>
<p>Edit: About 5 minutes later the same laggy typing is back.</p>

            <p>Startup folder was completely empty and the only COM add-in is for Onenote, and was already disabled by default. I will try to delete the reg entry for it and report back. It seems like every once in a while Word can "recover" and speeds back up to normal
 for a while. It seems that switching back and forth between Word and another window may be what causes it to slow down, but it's hard to say. I had my browser snapped to one side of the screen and word on the other and it still slows to a crawl. Without fail,
 every time I exit Word and re-open the file I get another 5 or so minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANY other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I'm just using it in safe mode 99% of the time now and it works well enough...I just don't like to settle for 'well enough'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            You should also try renaming the Normal template in Word and delete Word's registry entries. These steps are covered in the article at
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/921541</a>. Note that the article may not be updated for Office 2016 yet, which means that any reference to a version number must be replaced with
<strong>16.0</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I tried everything on that page, deleted all of the mentioned reg entries, all of it. The issue has changed slightly though, now instead of the typing freezing up the rest of the application freezes. If I try to click on anything in the ribbon bar nothing
 happens. I cant switch from HOME to INSERT or VIEW or anything, except for FILE. FILE brings up the correct menu options but when I click the left arrow to go back it's the same. &nbsp;This is happening within seconds of opening Word now.</p>
<p>This is what was happening before too though, it's just that I wasn't able to type anything before while the app froze and now I can. I can't even change font or anything since none of the ribbon works at all. None of the buttons highlight as if I'm not
 even moving the mouse over them.</p>

Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you! <br />
<br />
I understand that text messages from the same contact create another thread in your Lumia 530. Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.
<br />
<br />
