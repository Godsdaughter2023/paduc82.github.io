<h2>            Program Not Installing&#58;-  Microsoft C&#43;&#43; x86 Appears to have Failed.</h2>
                    <p>He Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to install some software when I got the massage, 'The installation of Microsoft C++ 2015 Redistributable Package (x86) appears to have failed'. This happened to two programs so far. This is a new installation of W10 which only went on yesterday.
 The same thing happened last week with a new installation of W10 and a MS technician said I had corrupted data so I needed to reinstall windows again which I did and it worked, but I had to later uninstall that W10 for other reasons. I can't keep reinstalling
 W10 as I'm running out of reactivations for some of my software and I have already had to ask two companies to reset my activations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the MS technician told me today that I had several different versions of the 'Microsoft C++ 2015 Redistributable Package (x86) ' in my system which was causing conflicts so she told me to get in contact with the software manufacturers of the affected
 SW and ask them to tell me exactly what&nbsp; version of Microsoft C++ 2015 Redistributable Package (x86) that their SW requires and then she will be able to help me fix it for good. But I thought I would also ask people here what they thought? Any idea how to
 fix it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Windows 10 on Surface Pro 3&#58; Activation status revoked after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lonaysta h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 on Surface Pro 3&#58; Activation status revoked after normal using for 3 days. What&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows Insider since October 2014 (for a desktop) and upgraded my Surface Pro 3 to Windows 10 on 29th. Confirmed the activation status after the upgrade, then went ahead and did a clean installation. After the clean installation (also on 29th) the activation
 was done automatically. However, just now (August 2nd) I was prompted that the OS is not activated. So something happened and revoked the activation license on my Surface Pro 3? This is so weird and unbelievable. This device is still listed under the account.microsoft.com/devices
 of my MSA.</p>
<p>How could I get the activation status back? I don't have the time for a reinstallation. If there is no way, I'll just use this "deactivated" version since I don't really need any further personalization on this Surface Pro 3 (it was all done).</p>

            <p>Sorry but none of those articles help with my situation. </p>
<p>As I said, my Surface Pro 3 was upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 taking the upgrade offer, confirmed activation status, then I did a clean installation, and confirmed the activation status again.</p>
<p>Suddenly the activation status is LOST and it asks me to activate it again out of no reason. There is no roll back for this device now since it is running a CLEAN installed Windows 10. Besides, I don't have the time to re-work on the whole configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still shows 0xC004C003.</p>

            <p>I also have this issue. Do you have a dock for the Surface? It occurred for me after being connected to the dock.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was advised by someone at Microsoft that a clean install is not an officially supported method for the Surface and you should just do an 'upgrade'. I, like you, prefer clean install but looks like it could have some consequences.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am rather disappointed.&nbsp;I also have the same error activation code and had been working fine until just 3 days ago.

            I also meant to add that I think there are a few bugs with the activation system, it is very sensitive and seems linked to the Network Adaptor.

<h2>            Xbox One - HDMI out port faulty</h2>
                    
<p>I am having problems with my xbox one HDMI out port being loose. I have tried 3 different HDMI cables to ensure it is not a faulty cable.</p>
<p>With each cable, it has to be propped up to show video. If it is not propped up then the video cuts out.</p>
<p>Is there a fix for a loose/faulty HDMI port on the xbox?</p>

<h2>            microsoft wireless keyboard 3000 V2 does not work&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! I recently bought a keyboard (microsoft wireless keyboard 3000 V2) for my new PC (windows 7 64-bit installed) and i simply can't get it to work! The installation of intellitype pro 8.0 works perfectly and I am able to choose my keyboard model from
 the list. When i plugin the USB-reciever to my computer it recognizes it immedately and says it's ready to be used. The program "Microsoft keyboard" also recognizes the connection and, it too, says it's up and running. The problem is that when i press any
 button on the keyboard it self, nothing happens... at all. I've inserted over 10 different and newly bought AA-batteries, but the nly thing that happes is that the power-light on the keyboard lights up for about 8 secs.</p>
<p>I´ve tried litterary EVERYTHING to get it to work. Guides, forum searches, google searches and all such things, but nothing works.</p>
<p>You are my last hope and i really hope you can help me!</p>

            It now seems that the receiver and keyboard has lost signals "sync."&nbsp; You need to contact TS and find how to "re-sync" the receiver / keyboard signals.

            <p>Yes, the year is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got home and&nbsp;switched the time zone back to Eastern and it looks like it's showing the correct time now. Not sure what happened.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I just had to restart the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I started up I did get a message saying there was a problem during startup and giving me the choice to send an error report&nbsp;to Microsoft. Maybe this is related? Not sure but it looks like it's working now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate everyone's time!</p>

            Hi lovneetsingh, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Are you seeing any error messages show up when trying to use your VPN service? Would you be able to provide a screenshot of what happens when your VPNs don't work?
<br />
<br />Otherwise, I'd suggest contacting Hotspot Shield support, as they would have experience using their specific software. Here's the link to their support webpage:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.hotspotshield.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hotspotshield.com/hc/en-us</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

<br />D.  I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Experience trying to &#38;quot&#59;Unsubscribe&#38;quot&#59;. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Experience trying to &#38;quot&#59;Unsubscribe&#38;quot&#59;.</h2>
                    
<p>Just felt like venting because Microsoft have effectively conned me out of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically, almost a year and a half ago my 360 got the RROD for the 4th time, after sending back 3 and getting replacements over the course of 6 months.</p>
<p>I decided to then cancel my subscription (Yearly) and i turned to PC gaming and since then my 360 has been sat at the foot of my bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, when i chose to unsubscribe i called up like you have to and went through the motions.</p>
<p>I was informed that my yearly subscription was now gone and my account was "Disabled". (Informed that my remaining 9 months was "Forfeit")</p>
<p>I then was informed by email 2 weeks ago that my subscription was due for "Renewal" today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Credit Card i used before for the 1 year has now been gotten rid off.</p>
<p>I called up 3 days ago, quite annoyed and specifically asked why an account i had disabled had been reenabled and subscription replaced back on there after being informed by the woman on the phone that the last "Activity" on my account had been midway through
 2010. Showing that the account in question hadn't been logged back on by me AT ALL in the last 18 months which basically meant for some reason Microsoft had reenabled my account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when i called up 3 days ago, i was quite insistent and informed her, as she could see from my activity that i had not requested any additional game time nor needed it as i did not use the service anymore and asked that once again, my account be disabled
 and taken off the system along with the credit cards which should have already been dealt with.</p>
<p>She informed me there and then, 3 days ago, that my account was now disabled completely and that the credit&nbsp;cards were off the system and i would NOT be getting a renewal subscription.</p>
<p>So, checking my debit card balance today and saw on my statement a payment of £40 to Microsoft?</p>
<p>So i called up once again a few hours ago after i got home from work and was informed that my account had been reenabled at 11.59PM 16/01/2012. REALLY?</p>
<p>Microsoft, Reenabling an account a minute before a subscription for a disabled account is due? And to add insult to injury, i was informed that because the credit card details used prior for the subscription couldnt be found (At least she deleted those)
 a DEBIT card had been substituted in that had bought MS Points almost 2 YEARS ago to pay for it.</p>
<p>Im sorry, why couldnt you just not renew the subscription or better yet, LEAVE THE ACCOUNT Disabled.</p>
<p>How many times do i have to ask for the account to be disabled before it actually is, completely. With no "Reenable" at a later date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, i know the whole unsubscribing from your account on here.</p>
<p>The problem with that, was that i wasnt sure of the Live Account i used so didnt know the email address or password. After an hour tonight i finally figured it out after resetting passwords 6 times on 5 different emails.</p>
<p>I felt that i would just vent my anger on here. The worst part about this, is apparently im not the only case as my best mates account keeps getting resubscribed every month even though he has logged onto the site and removed all credit card details from
 his account. Yet neither me nor him can get any straight answers on the phone from the support as i, twice tonight, got hung up on when questioning the telephone support member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else had problems like this?</p>

<p>NanoTechSoldier - i`m calling B.S on that , i`ve had RROD on 2 consoles before i bought my 250G-HD , and i repaired my 2nd RROD myself , it`s certainly not just cables , i had to take my xbox to peices and use arctic silver thermal paste.</p>
<p>XoX Sunshine - you were probably sniped by automatic renewal , probably.</p>
<p>You`re not the only one getting sick of the new ignorant Microsoft.</p>

<p>Not exactly the problems XoX Sunshine had&nbsp;but I've had loads of problems with renewal services, LIVE and other services. &nbsp;So many I can't think of what they all were exactly. &nbsp;It's not the cables on the Xenons, they weren't properly qualified to be sold
 as a consumer item. &nbsp;I broke three or four before I decided not to buy another, before the slim came out.</p>

<p>That sounds terrible sorry you had to go through that. I went through a similar experience once but I was able to get them to remove my debit card from account. I would advice you to try to disable auto renew from the website now that you know your password
 and also you need to contact support to see if they can refund you the money that was charged on your card.</p>

<p>Accounts can't be "closed", "shut down", "dormant", or "disabled". All you can do is turn off automatic renewal.</p>
<p>ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS turn off automatic renewal (under "my account" here on xbox.com) - EVEN IF YOU INTEND TO STAY GOLD - as there is no reason to pay full price when a promotion from Microsoft WILL (that's WILL, not possibly) be running the day you are
 demoted to silver.</p>

    <title>Assure support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briankeelan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assure support</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Microsoft Assure support package from your salesman in the Toronto Eaton Centre Store. I told him I wanted a package that would give me a phone number I could call and get help on my new Office 2016 and my Windows 10 packages.</p>
<p>He sold me this Assure package for $198. That was in Dec 2017. He said I could activate it any time I wanted. I waited until Feb 2018 and then got started. It took me over an hour to get hold of anyone but then some guy finally helped me with that problem
 and gave em another phone number that he promised Microsoft would answer.</p>
<p>I tried it again today and after an hour, still had not spoken to a human.</p>
<p>When I called the Microsoft Canadian support number, I got some lady named Zooey (not in Canada) who would not give me a refund or her employee number.</p>
<p>I can't believe that I talked to all these people in your help section and nobody helped me. What do these people actually do? If you spent all that money actually having people help your customers you would gain so much more but actually all these people
 are doing is acting as gatekeepers for the people in the ivory tower.</p>
<p>Now then, I want my $200 back. Please have someone call me at <strong>*** Information removed due to privacy ***</strong> and I will give them all the codes and receipt numbers for this product and you can give me back my money and we will never, ever do
 business again. I will get rid of my PC and switch to Apple because at least there if you pay them $200 for AppleCare, they answer the phone and solve their customer's problems... something you do not do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can't you get in touch with the salesman or centre that sold you the Assure package.</p>

<p>I've disabled auto-enhance, and yet every time I open a picture for viewing in Photos, it puts this weird fish-eye type filter on the photos. I refuse to open a photo with the app now, because when it does this, it saves the fish-eyed version over the original,
 ruining the photo. How do I stop this??</p>

<h2>            Fatal error c0190003 after installing Service Pack 1 in Windows 7 computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Fatal error c0190003 for updates and computer will not go past this error... system recovory wont work because of issues deleting a file/directory.</p>
<p>I started doing updates and one of the updates was the windows 7 SP1 and this was happening overnight... today when i come to check my computer it says it has a fatal error c0190003 and my computer does not go past this error... i have restarted and rebooted
 my computer more than enough times to be sure that this problem needs attention and cannot be ignored...(meaning i cant go through it without doing something about it).. so i read that i should restore my computer to a previous point... and i only have one
 system restore point and that is i believe right before i started downloading the updates.... but when i do system restore it gives me an error in the end saying: "System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computers system files and settings were
 not changed. Details: System Restore failed while deleting the following file/directory. Path: D:\Windows\winsxs\FileMaps\$$_ehome_createdisc_filters_5fe1b967f204215a.cdf-m" and the rest is blocked off.... i cant read it... nor can i enlarge the window&nbsp; so
 if anyone can please help i would be gratefull a whole lot</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
How have you performed system restore?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Let’s follow these steps &amp; check if the issue persists:<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Step 1<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a) Try to revert the update installation by running</span><span> </span>
<span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744311%28WS.10%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DISM command</a></span><span>
</span><span>from Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) &amp; check if you are able to boot to the desktop normally.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps from this link to boot into Windows Recovery Environment. For more information, follow the section</span><span>
</span><span>‘<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">To open the System Recovery Options menu on your computer</a>’</span></p>
<p><span>b) You will need to know the date and time that the update was installed for this procedure.</span></p>
<p><span>c) From the command prompt run the following command: "<b>DISM /Image:C:\ /Cleanup-Image /RevertPendingActions</b>"</span></p>
<p><span>d) Then reboot your PC.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
Thereafter, try installing Service Pack 1. However, before you proceed with the installation of the update. Please follow these links:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Steps to follow before you install Windows 7 Service Pack 1 from the Microsoft Download Center</a></span></p>

Hope the information helps.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check these :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Power Options - Require a password on wake-up - Change<br />
settings that are currently unavailable - tick Don't require a password.<br />
<br />
Start button - Settings - Personalization - Lock Screen - Scroll down to
<p>Screen Saver Settings - click it - untick "On resume, display login of screen".<br />
<br />
Start button - Settings - Accounts -Sign-in Options - Require Sign-in - set<br />
to Never.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Start Up Problems with Black Screen and Cursor due to Power Failure</h2>
                    
<p>I am running a Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium OS. Start up problems arose after power failure (accidentally unplugged the charger, battery was not in place) during a Skype&nbsp;video call.&nbsp;Accessories attached to the&nbsp;notebook at the time were a Logitech Webcam,
 a Bluetooth dongle,&nbsp;mic and earphones.</p>
<p>When starting up my Asus N81VP laptop, it will go as far as the "Starting Windows" logo then I encounter a black screen with a movable cursor. I am unable to right click, CTRL+ALT+Delete.</p>
<p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>Start Up Repair = "Cannot repair automatically"</p>
<p>System Restore = No available restore points</p>
<p>Windows Memory Diagnostic = at 100% no problems detected, then Black screen with movable cursor</p>
<p>Safe Mode/Safe Mode with Networking = Black screen with movable cursor</p>
<p>Enable low-resolution video (640x480) = Black screen with movable cursor</p>
<p>List Known Good Configuration = Black screen with movable cursor</p>
<p>Start Windows Normally = Black screen with movable cursor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me. I've only had this laptop for less than a year, and it would break my heart to have to re-format it.</p>

- To log on under a different account.<br />
- To restore your registry files manually. See below for details.</p>
<p>About your heart that might get broken: Have you considered using the image creation facility that is built into Windows 7? You can find it in the Control Panel / Backup and Restore. It is somewhat marginal in functionality and it can be temperamental but
 it has saved my backside on several occasions.</p>
<p>You can restore your registry files manually to an earlier point by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area. Note that
 it may reset your password to an earlier value.<br />
1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu that looks like this one:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode<br />
3. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
4. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
5. Select the Command Prompt from the menu that looks like this one:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7<br />
6. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
7. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32\config<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xcopy *.* Q:\MyRegBack\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd&nbsp; RegBack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir<br />
8. Examine the dates of the Software, System and SAM files. Were the files created before or after your problem became apparent?<br />
9. If they were made before the problem became apparent then you can type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y software&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y System&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y Sam ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the two dots are part of each command)<br />
10. Reboot normally. If things do not work out then you can backtrack by copying the original registry files from Q:\MyRegBack to Q:\Windows\System32\config.<br />

                    I currently have a HP Pavillion with a HP DVD A DS8ASH as my DVD Rom. This drive doesn't play blu-ray. What Drive could i replace it with so it can play Blu-ray.

<p>... A Blu-ray player of the same size/connection type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly, you need to get the exact model of the system:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c00033108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c00033108</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then your SAFEST bet is to look up that model and see what will fit it either direct from HP or use that model of the system on various shopping sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume what you actually have is:</p>
<p>HP/Lite-On DS-8A8SH 8x DVD±RW DL Slim Multi Burner Writer Internal SATA Drive For Notebook/Laptop PC (Black)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be you'd be better off with an external player even (USB.)</p>

<h2>            Skype 8.x unable to download&#47;save file with Proxy internet settings</h2>
                    Recently Skype forces to upgrade from classic version 7.x to version 8.x. I am unable to download or save the received files with proxy internet settings. It is unlike classic version 7.x which I can download the files through proxy settings without problem.
 I would like to know is there any workaround to allow version 8.x to download files with our existing proxy internet settings or any additional download access link/site which we need to configure and allow it from our proxy settings.

            Hello ch.ong.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the new version doesn't have some options, which we had on old one. Currently there are no any ways to change it, it is not available through the settings.
<br />
<br />At this moment it is important to report about the issues and poor settings list to the developers
<br />

            Hi ch.ong.
<br />
<br />I am not sure that something like that is possible.
<br />
<br />Anyway you can double check in Skype support via chat: 
<br />
<br />- follow the link  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/s...</a>
<br />- select the issue
<br />- select chat option
<br />
<br />I hope this helps

 I got two dialogue boxes saying:</p>
<p>"The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2908."</p>
<p>(Which appeared multiple times)</p>
<p>And then another with:</p>

            Hi EndlessGibbon80
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />

<br />
<br />2.  Windows Key+R &gt; Type services.msc and press Enter &gt; Locate Background Intelligence transfer and ensure it is set to Start and Automatic. Also do the same for Windows Update service as well
<br />

<br />Type cmd in Windows Search box &gt; Right click on Command Prompt &gt; Run As Administrator &gt; Type WSreset.exe and click Enter  &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />4. Re-register All Store apps (You will get many Reds, ignore them. This will reinstall all default Store apps, hence if you have uninstalled any default Store app, that will get reinstalled)
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the following from below and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

    <title>Using Windows 7 recovery discs after replacing hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devtrev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Windows 7 recovery discs after replacing hard drive</h2>
                    My son has a Toshiba Satellite T115-S1100 netbook. Somehow he completey erased everything on this thing. When I tried to run the Windows 7 32bit Home Premium recovery discs, I get a "no operating system found" message.&nbsp;I was told by Toshiba support that
 I needed to replace the internal hard drive. I'm kind of a computer novice. After the new drive is in, will these discs work? Is there anything special that needs to be done, or should I just run the discs? Also, since the netbook doesn't have a disc drive,
 I'll be running them through&nbsp;an external dvd drive. Will this work? Any help or pointers would be much appreciated. Thanks.

    <title>Windows 8 desktop wallpaper file path - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike mcentee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 desktop wallpaper file path</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 8:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The registry doesn't display the original desktop image path when the shuffle&nbsp;collection of images for the&nbsp;desktop is activated, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code><span>KEY</span><span>:</span><span> HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control </span><span>Panel</span><span>\Desktop\Wallpaper
</span></code><code><span>VALUE</span><span>:</span><span> C</span><span>:</span><span>\Users\MIchael\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\TranscodedWallpaper</span></code>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>When 1 image is set in the desktop background, the path of the image IS displayed in the above registry location.  As soon as more than 1 image </pre>
<pre>is made available, the above path value is displayed regardless of what image is displayed on the desktop background.</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>This does not happen in Windows 7.  The path value changes with each new image displayed on the desktop.</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>How can I view the original desktop image path of each image displayed on the desktop background?  Can the registry be modified so that it works</pre>
<pre>like it did in Windows 7?</pre>

    <title>Wifi incredibly slow for some reason. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kitosoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi incredibly slow for some reason.</h2>
                    <p>I am wondering if there is any way to fix this onboard wifi. Have tested it out several times, wired i get around 6mbps down and 5 up via speedtest but with the card that came with my mini pc gets .02mbps down I am forced to use my wi-pi USB Wireless LAN
 Card which is only getting me around 2mbps down and like .3mbps up. Funny to me when i bought this thing under the specs it says "the fastest wireless internet."</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB Wi-Pi:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85215bfe-048b-470f-8313-299f72a9c69d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85215bfe-048b-470f-8313-299f72a9c69d" /></a>Then
 here is the onboard Broadcom wifi speed</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30e34b41-708b-432d-a3ff-ddfb1f3b09c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30e34b41-708b-432d-a3ff-ddfb1f3b09c0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So the chip in question is the Broadcom 802.11n Wireless SDIO Adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b9706b0-187c-413b-a1c6-986b3545bf82" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b9706b0-187c-413b-a1c6-986b3545bf82" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>The drivers are updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled drivers, I even ended up clean installing to see if that would help, which i'm pretty sure made the whole situation worse; the audio adapter disappeared after the reinstall and now have to use an external audio card.. and am
 unable to reinstall the audio..stupid, but that's a different topic. Not sure if there is anything I can do? I really want the wifi to work faster than friggin' dial-up.</p>
<p>Oh and there is absolutely zero support from Nexbox company, very unhappy with this purchase so far but trying to make the best of the situation.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The fastest there means the fastest available at that time and not even necessarily the fastest version of that implementation (wireless n).<br />
<br />
Check with the support for the device for new firmware and drivers. There have been many issues with the Windows 10 versions of the Broadcom drivers. Also check with Broadcom Support.<br />
<br />
Uninstall and re-installing the latest driver is the correct method do updating the drivers.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 Help - scroll down to "Connectivity"<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/windows?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/windows?os=windows-10</span></a>&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even it other OS's are working fine. And <br />
I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also be sure you do a Hard&nbsp;Reset - power off modem and router - wait 3+<br />
minutes - power on modem - when it is up and running then power on the<br />
router - when it is up and running restart the computers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            Okay thank you. Device manager is saying both WiFi drivers are updated through the search function, problem didn't change. I will try to reach out to Broadcom support. And I will do the hard reset, I suspect it probably hasn't been reset for ages. I am
 not sure how to check or update the firmware on the router though.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried switching off the bluetooth?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was struggling with extremely slow internet using win10 and broadcom wireless card. I have tried many 'fixes' found on the internet and I have came across this article:</p>
<p>https://woodygems.wordpress.com/2015/12/24/fix-for-very-slow-wifi-in-windows-10/</p>
<p>
</p><p>THe first advise is to switch off the bluetooth - this has fixed the problem in my case (transfer went up from 2-3 Mb to 45 Mb per second).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jan</p>
