<p>Help me to liberate this piece of old junk......how can I get into this ancient Windows XP if I dont have administrative password?...The management did this because it's a community computer and now my own stuff is locked along with
 hidden files I cannot open, only show. It's Windows Home Edition, 2002 (yeah) Service Pack 2 on an old Dell Dimension with very little RAM. I have asked this before, and it remained posted for months with no answer. When googling this, all you find is old
 outdated crap that doesnt work. Trying to boot up and tapping F8 or anything else doesnt work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there must be ONE of you out there that can help me, rather that a lot of these effite, useless answers I so often see on here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Oh, and no, not trying to do anything, uhm "bad" or illegal.</p>

you can burn a copy of Hiren's boot disc and then boot into minixp and reset the password.</div>

<p>A) Where do I find Hirens' boot disc.....is it free</p>
<p>B) Insert it where- this is an ancient desktop, I dont even know if it reads discs and they may have set it to not do so (then what&gt;)..........</p>
<p>C) What do you mean "and then boot into minixp" </p>
<p>Thank you</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</p>
<p>download and it is free</p>
<p>you can burn to a usb (<a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">rufus</a>) or burn to a cd for the cd drive with

<p>if your pc will boot from usb some older ones will not </p>
<p>when you change the bios (restart and click F2) to boot from cd drive first, and hiren's loads you will be given options to boot to, choose minixp.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to check the apps installed on your computer then refer the steps provided below.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Start </strong>icon or press the <strong>Windows key</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>All apps.</strong></li><li>Search for the app which you want and see if you could find it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Other way.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key+ R.</strong></li><li>In the <strong>run </strong>box type <strong>appwiz.cpl </strong>and press enter.</li><li>Search for the application which you want and see if you could see it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to
<strong>perform clean boot,</strong> try to <strong>disable security software </strong>
temporarily, if any installed on your computer and then try to install Picasa and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Perform</strong>
<strong>clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below
 to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable Security Software Temporarily.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disable anti-virus</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:&nbsp;<em>Antivirus
 software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.
 If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post

<p>Hi there Legit,<br />
<br />
The Flaming Retro Lancer was not a part of the Forces of Nature DLC. You can find a full list of the skins from that DLC in the
<a href="http://epicgames.com/community/2012/03/forces-of-nature-weapon-skins-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Forces of Nature sneak peek</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've done some digging on that skin and it looks like the only way to have won the Gold ribbon during the first Gears of War 3 event NOT the beta. The beta unlocked the Gold retro lancer skin. Several people who have had their rank reset, so longer have the
 ribbon and now that skin looks to be permanently locked.<br />

            Hi, Brad,
<br />
<br />In the Content restrictions page, you can configure the account to require adult approval for purchases in the Microsoft Store, set age limit for apps, games, and media, and you can even block those websites you want to restrict access.
<br />
<br />The Ask a parent feature allows you to require your approval for a child to proceed with a Microsoft Store purchase. However, this option excludes purchases made with the funds you added to the child account and gift cards.
<br />To enable this feature, turn on the Needs adult approval to buy things toggle switch. If you also want to know when and what a child has purchased, then turn on the Email me when my child gets stuff toggle switch.
<br />
<br />The Apps, games &amp; media feature option enables you to block apps, games, and media that isn't appropriate for your children.
<br />To restrict content, turn on the Block inappropriate apps, games &amp; media toggle switch, and then use the drop-down menu to specify the rating you want to allow. (For more details, click the View allowed ratings link.)
<br />
<br />Steps to try:
<br />
<br />1. Change accounts in the store to allow others to use your apps since apps were installed per user.
<br />2. Add a user (under "accounts" and "Family &amp; other users".. pick add someone else to this PC, choose "the person I want to add doesn't have an email address" and then pick "Add a user without a Microsoft account" and it will make a local account on the computer. When you log-in to that account and go to the windows app store, log-in there with your "adult" Microsoft account (be sure to choose log-in to this app only) and you have access to all the purchases from the main account under each local user.

<h2>            Windows 7 - Windows update stuck at 0kb 0&#37; then stuck at looking for updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a month I can't install updates on my computer, running windows 7. For the first time it found some updates, but when I tried to download and install them it stuck at downloading 0kb 0%. I retried it several times and let it run for several hours.
 Then I looked for "solutions" on the internet. Somehow the updates disappeared from windows update, so it had to look for updates again. Now this is the current state, it won't find any updates. I tried it manually by clicking the look for updates button and
 let it run for almost a whole day, but nothing happened, still looking for updates. Then I read somewhere to let it automatically look for updates, so I didn't touch the look for updates button for 4 days. In this 4 day it had about 48 hours too find the updates,
 but still nothing, only the svchost process used my cpu at 25% but I notiec earlier (when updates were istalling successfully) that it's normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after no updates were found for a long time I started looking for "solutions" again. The first one was from this site: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded windows update troubleshooter and ran it. It gave me the following results: http://i64.tinypic.com/15d0z7d.jpg</p>
<p>The last two lines mean something like: There were problems installing the latest updates</p>
<p>Still no updates found for a half day after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then I read somewhere that system update readiness tool might help. So I downloaded it and checked CheckSUR.log but no errors were found:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept looking for "solutions" and found microsoft easy fix 50202 tool. Ran it in normal mode, no updates were found for a half day. Then ran it in aggressive mode, but still no updates appeared after a half day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I found a windows update reset tool that looked like this: http://i66.tinypic.com/1t28h2.jpg</p>
<p>I chose to reset windows update components then reset the winsock settings.</p>
<p>Still no updates were found after a half day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the last thing I found and tried before asking for help here was to reset windows updates components manually. So I followed this tutorial to reset windows updates components manually: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</p>
<p>In this tutorial I had some entry point not found in dll errors when registering dlls. I looked this up and found it's normal.</p>
<p>Since I didn't found any other "solution" it keeps looking for updates in the background for at least 3 days (computer runs about 12 hours a day).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that CBS.log might help you so I uploaded it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6fkfgce7af2nrge/CBS.log?dl=0</p>
<p>And CbsPersist_20161116123752.cab: https://www.dropbox.com/s/prlgit52t17tczw/CbsPersist_20161116123752.cab?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all the informations I can give you on my own, so if you need anything else just ask for it and I'll try to provide it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And sorry about my english, I hope you understand it.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>-----------------</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">
I have a number of installations using Visual Studio setup and deployment. These installations create shortcuts on the desktop for the user. I have some users who have decided to move these shortcuts into other folders, any of the /Program Files/ folders for
 example. Besides the fact that they should not be doing this, they discovered that if they then try to move the shortcut back to the desktop, it does not move and they get an "Out of memory" message when they clearly are not out of memory. I can readily reproduce
 the message as well, although not with all shortcuts...but especially the ones created by the installer.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">
So, I think there is something about these shortcuts (perhaps permissions) that Win10 does not understand and is throwing a strange message. I don't do anything fancy with the definition of the shortcuts...in fact, there aren't many properties to define for
 them in setup and deployment.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">
So, is this a problem with the shortcut, the way Windows 10 handles them, or both? It does seem like an incorrect user message. Any suggestions to resolve? At the very least it may help to know why this happens and perhaps pass it on if it is a Win 10 issue.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">
Thanks,</p>

            Hello Perter, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest you follow the instructions down below and visit the URL as well for more information.
<br />
<br />
<br />To correct this problem, increase the size of the desktop heap:
<br />Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).
<br />From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<br />
<br />\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SubSystems
<br />Select the Windows value.
<br />From the Edit menu, choose String.
<br />Increase the SharedSection parameter.
<br />
<br />Refer to:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/126962/out-of-memory-error-message-appears-when-you-have-a-large-number-of-pr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/126962...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Thank you and good luck,
<br />Regards- Irisdiel H.

            This issue happens right after boot up (nothing running) on all Win 10 machines and developers on the other forums could duplicate the issue. It happens moving a shortcut which is very small in size. As described, it doesn't happen for all shortcuts -
 it seems to depend on how they were created. It does appear that Windows 10 does not know how to handle the move and throws the message in error.

<p>Unfortunately Skate 3 is not available on Games on Demand only the DLC. I can highly recommend the game though as it has been nothing but improvements in the series and well worth the purchase especially with price drops as time has went on.</p>

            <p>Hi,
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;
  </p>
<p>Many users are experiencing the same issue and The Coalition has yet to respond to this. After the&nbsp;update in June, users reported being unable to connect to the server for long periods of time. Some have claimed that re-installing the game has helped, but other say that has not fixed the problem. I would suggest trying it and making sure your NAT type is set to OPEN. Also, you can try to adjust your region settings and see if that helps...
  </p>

    <title>&#34;Ring on additional device&#34; not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Ring on additional device&#34; not working</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 (all up to date), Skype also up to date (version 8.32.0.53).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was very happy to see the&nbsp;"Ring on additional device" option, but sadly it does not work.&nbsp; Skype now remembers my USB wireless headset as the Microphone and Speakers options, and the additional device automatically selects my PC's internal audio device,
 which plays through desktop speakers, but incoming calls do not ring through the internal device/speakers.&nbsp; Further, Skype does not appear in the Mixer control for the internal audio device.&nbsp; I tested that to see if somehow Skype had been muted on it, but
 it isn't there.&nbsp; There are two Skype instances in the USB wireless headset Mixer control, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see an option called "Unmute for incoming calls", which I activated, but as it's probably not related to the Additional device option, it had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a new feature, so I hope this helps in testing and troubleshooting the bug.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Pete58Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What MAC OS X are you using? If you are on MAC OS Mojave, just to let you know,
<span>Mojave introduced camera and mic permissions in the operating system. You should check to make sure those are granted for Skype. To if the permissions is granted for Skype, please follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>•&nbsp;Click the apple logo in the top left<br />
•&nbsp;Select System Preferences<br />
•&nbsp;Click on Security &amp; Privacy<br />
•&nbsp;Select the Privacy tab<br />
•&nbsp;Click on the camera and Microphone and check the box for Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is already granted. Check the Audio settings of Skype, to check, click on the 3 dots &gt; settings &gt; Audio and Camera &gt; check if Snowball is being detected as your MIC on Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and I look forward to your reply!</p>

    <title>Upgrade Vista 64 to Windows 7 64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> athref  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade Vista 64 to Windows 7 64</h2>
                    I purchased Windows 7 Ultimate 64 to upgrade my current Windows Vista 64 Home Premium.&nbsp;&nbsp;My hardware is a HP M9400 64 bit quad core with additional internal hard drives, adapters,&nbsp;and memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am able to install Windows 7 64 (using Custom option) in
 a un-formatted partition without error and install all of my hardware drivers.&nbsp; This step was used to confirm hardware compatibility.&nbsp; Windows 7 was then removed, the partition deleted.&nbsp; The Windows 7 64 upgrade has failed each of seven times, all during the
 fifth process of transferring files.&nbsp; I have spent approximately 6 hours on the phone with Microsoft Technical Support India, including 2 hours of their use of Microsoft remote access to check my system of my machine.&nbsp; The Microsoft support staff in India
 did not have any hands on experience with Windows 7 64 upgrade.&nbsp; They were well versed in Windows 7 32 upgrade.&nbsp; At the end of their attempt they presented&nbsp;three options.&nbsp; Option 1 was to install Windows 7 64 custom only.&nbsp; Option 2 was to install Windows 7
 32 in either upgrade or custom.&nbsp; Option 3 was a full refund on my purchase of Windows 7.&nbsp; They made it clear that at the present, there was no work around or patch planned for the Upgrade software failure.&nbsp; Vista 64 is stable but most new hardware (raid adapters,
 video adapters, over 1 TB hard drives) only come with support for Windows 7 64 and not Vista 64.&nbsp; Does Microsoft USA plan to offer any options in the future for Vista 64 customers other then a base install?<br />
<br />
Thank you

            Hi stevecrimble,
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your hard drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Start Disk Cleanup again
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />This time in the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />If you still are short on space after that, do you believe you should have more space and cannot find what is using your space?

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 8/10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-partitions-windows-10-macos-linux/
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            Hi Steve,you can reinstall Windows 8.1 at any time, you will not need a product key and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 8.1 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 8.1 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 8.1 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Windows 8.1 ISO file
<br />
<br />Then click this link to download a tool from Microsoft to create the Windows 8.1 Installation media on a DVD or USB flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 8.1 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Hi Steve, a Windows Reset would be a much quicker route for you, if that is what you want to do . . .
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h3> lizmack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code &#39;0x8007000d&#58; the data is invalid&#39; when editing mp3 file data. Or rather, not being able to edit it at all. ID3 has not touched this issue.</h2>
                    
<p>Since I have switched to 7, I have ONE folder of mp3s which does not register through WMP at all. The data on the tracks (when viewed through Explorer) is entirely blank except for track title and artist, but I may not edit it. I have researched this issue
 to the best of my ability. Changing my tags to 2.3 and rearranging ALL media information for these tracks has not at all changed their appearance or usability through Windows.</p>
<p>I wiped the file information and manually reentered all of it and this has not had an effect. The files play just fine, but neither ITunes or WMP recognize them for more than a single use.</p>
<p>The other thing I've noticed is that the track times do not show up through Explorer or ID3.</p>
<p>I am MADDENED by my inability to even add the album title!</p>

<p>Control panel items won't open despite PC resources NOT being maxed out.</p>
<p>Action Centre has two actions 1) Security - Sign in with most recent password - If I click on sigh in PC Settings App just hangs

===========================================================<br />
[1] Injudicious use of registry cleaners may be playing a role here, too. TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't),

<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions (or copy/paste into Notepad) for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt; DON'T SKIP ANY STEP &amp; perform all Steps in
<em>reboot!</em> None of the steps can possibly harm your computer.] </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<p>
</p><p>1b. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download a copy of&nbsp;the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop, too:
<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>2a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&lt;EDIT&gt;</strong><br />
2b. Restore any/all Registry Mechanic backups you have then reboot.<br />
<strong>&lt;/EDIT&gt;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3a. Right-click on the file you saved in #1a above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the Norton utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3b. Right-click on the file you saved in #1b above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the McAfee utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4a. Right-click on the following link &amp; save the download to your desktop: <a href="http://iefaq.info/attachments/133/ie8-rereg.all.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">ie8-rereg.all.zip</span></strong></a>&nbsp;[1] </p>
<p>
</p><p>4b. Right-click on the file you saved in #4a&nbsp;&amp; select EXTRACT ALL. This will create a new desktop folder also named
<strong>ie8-rereg.all</strong>. The folder will contain both of the scripts below (plus a third one that you will NOT use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note =&gt; The scripts are good for IE10 &amp; IE11, too,</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar), open the folder created in Step #4b above&nbsp;&amp; double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd</strong> to run the script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. Repeat for the file named <strong>ie8-rereg.64on64.cmd</strong> <em>then reboot.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Re-assert Internet Explorer as the default <strong>Browser</strong> in the CUSTOM (<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/set-program-access-computer-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>7a. Right-click on the following link and SAVE the download to your desktop: <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/doit/chromehtml.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>7b. Double-click on the file you saved in #7a above &amp; accept the prompt to MERGE the data with the Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Reset Internet Explorer per the instructions on this page: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note =&gt; For optimal results, check the <strong>Delete personal settings
</strong>option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Run the <strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong> from start to finish per the&nbsp;first paragraph&nbsp;on this page =&gt;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>10. Reboot once more then test by running a manual check for updates; install&nbsp;any/all updates offered (e.g., KB3032359, KB3030377, KB3032323, KB3035131, KB3034344, KB3035126, KB3035132, KB3039066, KB3033889, KB3046049, KB3044132, and/or KB3025417); follow
 all prompts.</p>

</p><p>11. Assuming all went well, test other Windows functionalities (e.g., boot time; Control Panel; Action Center; etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. Reply to this post with a status report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIP =&gt; Re-enable <strong>Automatic Updates</strong> then select the <strong>Check for updates but let me choose...</strong> option such that no updates will be downloaded without your approval&nbsp;(but any downloaded updates will be
<em>installed</em> without any further prompting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that Windows Defender will ONLY auto-update its Definitions when the <strong>
Automatic </strong>option is selected.</p>

 "october 2018" aka 1809,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm having problems with both OBS and game DVR</p>
<p>Game dvr used to work perfectly and i used to record for hours</p>
<p>Now, in 5 minutes, its eats 5+gb of my 8gb ram and the system becomes unusable. At least stop messing up features that worked perfectly fine. This is just ridiculous.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just rolled back to 1803, because now my computer ALSO started to act slowly and this is on a ssd, there is clearly something wrong with this build (1809) as now in 1803 my system acts normally without speed problems. I will redownload OBS to test it back
 to see if everything is ok again.&nbsp; Everything is works perfectly now, just like before,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to delay the feature updates for a year, MS doing such a lazy work on these major updates lately, no offense but this is the truth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may also sounds funny or weird even, but I will buy a second Windows 10 professional license in next weeks, there is no guarantee MS do something wrong again and messes up my whole system and roll back is only there for a month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result: Microsoft purposely destroying the Windows platform for better income sources, such as cloud. Disgusting and unacceptable, this is the only thing I can think right now because there is no other logical explanation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will stay on 1803 for a long time.</p>

            Sounds like a smart decision.  These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release.

<h2>            Getting BSOD on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have collected the minidump file msfinfo etc that could send, is there anyone here that could help me find what's causing it, the BSOD started a couple of days after I installed a new video card (GTX 2070) and I'm very suspicious this is culprit, I installed
 the drivers twice, one as normal just running the nvidia installer and the second time using DDU in safe mode to make sure it wasn't a driver issue. Thermals look ok on all hardware.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Persicus,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Persicus, most likely this is caused by a device driver incompatibility, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>I had a gtx 1080 and I don't recall giving me any BSOD before (had to upgrade due to it giving me artifacts, out of warranty). Crash has happened twice after I bought the new card 10 days ago, and only has happened while playing APEX LEGENDS, I've been working
 since then in Unreal Engine with a huge scene and rendering there without issues so far. I've played a couple other games just to see if i could replicate the BSOD but nothing yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good idea, I haven't tried resiting the card again I do recall it being a little tight to go all the way in due to the mobo having some chips a little too high for the new card (made contact with it. The memory I think it's fine I ran a 4 loop Memtest86
 last night without errors. I'll double check the power connectors etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only software I think I've installed is the EVGA precision X1 (to check temps and clock etc) haven't tried overclocking yet. But I believe I did after the first BSOD.&nbsp; I still have 5 days left from Best Buy return policy so I want to make sure this thing
 is not toasted....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll ask on EVGA and Geforce forums as well. Thank you guys!.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>You wouldn't be running an Insider Build would you ? Apparently EasyAnticheat used by this and Fortnite (Battle Eye used by Fortnite as well)
</p>
<p>has been causing issues with Insider Builds for several months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you are on a public release Win10, if it's only the one game, you can bet the issue is with the game.</p>
<p>TDR are very often caused by conflicts, so if it's not to do with the anti-cheat system it could be from something else,</p>
<p>including EVGA Precession. This and similar software such as MSI Afterburner and ASUS Smart Doctor have been known</p>
<p>to cause issues from time to time.</p>
<p>Check around the Apex Legends forums to see what fixes there may be for EasyAntiCheat if it's also causing problems on public release Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to try running in Clean Boot to verify if any Services or Startup programs are conflicting, but keep in mind anything</p>
<p>you launch manually after booting into Windows as Clean Boot is only helpful with stuff that loads when booting into Windows.</p>
