<h2>            Issue syncing files on OneDrive when using icloud for contacts in Outlook</h2>
                    Hi - I'm using Office 365&nbsp;Home Premium&nbsp;and One Drive across a number of devices, which is all working OK. I'm trying to use icloud to sync contacts. However, when I try to use this on my laptop running windows 7 (the laptop has user profiles for myself
 and my wife), it works but it seems to stop OneDrive files uploading to the laptop when it's installed. When I uninstall icloud, the file upload with no problems. Is there any way around this? I use icloud as I also use an Ipad and have used it previously
 without a problem in Office 2010 - have just upgraded to Office 365 .&nbsp;

    <title>Document Map Incomplete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackosullivan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Document Map Incomplete</h2>
                    
<p>In Word 2003, my document was able to use Document Map without any problems.&nbsp; When I sent the document to folks using Word 2007, they could see only part of the Document Map.</p>
<p>A co-worker finally discovered that the problem arose from my&nbsp;<strong>using a Heading format that included a "Page break before" at the beginning of a new Section Break (Odd&nbsp; Page)</strong>&nbsp;(which was required in order to change headers).</p>
<p>Using Word 2003 to remove&nbsp;the "Page break before" from the Style's&nbsp;Modify&nbsp;/ Format / Paragraph /Line and Page Breaks tab, made the Document Map work correctly in both Word 2007 and the&nbsp;(to me, much more user-friendly)&nbsp;Word 2003.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone with similar problems.</p>

            <p>Interesting. I would have thought that a <strong>manual</strong> page break would cause trouble with formatting in the Document Map, not "Page break before" formatting of the heading style. (For example, with a manual page break, the outline number may disappear
 from the Document Map; this can easily be reproduced.)</p>

            I have no information on the reported issue with the Document Map and "Page break before" formatting&nbsp;in Word 2007 (which I couldn't reproduce myself). In Word 2010, the Document Map has been completely redesigned and is now called the Navigation pane.

<p>I have a generic&nbsp;document that reproduces the problem.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to send it you so you could see for yourself.&nbsp; I can also send screen shots of the problem as it occurs.</p>
<p>Not sure how to get it to you though.</p>
<p>I guess at some point I'm going to just migrate to Office 2010 but haven't had time yet.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>The problem is certainly fixed in Word 2010, but it probably won't be fixed in Word 2007 (which I no longer keep installed).</p>
<p>Maybe someone who is actually using Word 2007 has more information.</p>

            So I turned on my PC today and it installed an hour of updates and it looks like I now have the Genuine Windows 10 (not a preview build) but when I try to activate, it says it can't! Why wouldn't my Windows 8.1 installation cross over, since that is what
 I had on the machine when I upgraded to the Insider Preview Build back in April?

            <p>It has been that way for the last several builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find other ways to log back in, such as the accounts in the Store.&nbsp; Signing into OneDrive may also give you the option.&nbsp; But there other options you can use until the problem is fixed, if Microsoft actually intends to fix it.</p>

<h2>            Signing into OneNote on Mac results in error Message</h2>
                    <p>I am currently trying to set up OneNote on my Macbook Air. I have an active Microsoft account (2 accounts to be exact) and upon opening the app I receive the message and when trying to create a notebook I receive the message "Problem setting up OneNote"
 with a button that says "Close Onenote and Try to Fix." I have tried to just manually open a new folder however it tells me I must first log in to OneNote, which I believe I have already done. I am sure that my account information is up to date and correct.
 If you have a &nbsp;solution please help. Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Earlier this year, a Microsoft tech engineer offered the foloowing 9 steps for repairing the Mac version of OneNote. They worked for me, and I had a problem similar to yours. Perhaps they will help you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>... please try these steps, these steps are not a solution to this problem but a step towards understanding where exactly the issue is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall Onenote</p>
<p>2. Delete&nbsp;~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.onenote</p>
<p>3. Delete ~/Library/Group\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office</p>
<p>4. Run this command in terminal : killall -SIGTERM cfprefsd</p>
<p>5. Empty your trash</p>
<p>6. Reboot Mac</p>
<p>7. Install Onenote for Mac from app store</p>
<p>8. Sign in using a new Live account which is never used before (sorry for the inconvenience that you will have to create a new account)</p>
<p>9. Create a new notebook.</p>

<h2>            Account locked</h2>
                    I no longer have use of my old cell phone, and i went to change my phone number on my hotmail account. it asked me to send a text to this phone to confirm my identity and because i no longer have the phone the account was locked. this is a paradox and

I'd just install the PC suite if I could find a direct download of it, as opposed to the web-installer, which requires windows components not included in Windows 7.

<br />
I recently moved up to Windows 7 and can't get Nokia PC Suite to install. I am using E71-NAM. Have you figured out a way to overcome this?<br />
<br />
I've heard that N85 is recognized by Device Stage internally in Windows 7 build 7000.<br />

I'd appreciate any help guys.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Office Professional Academic 2010</h2>
                    I'm debating whether or not to buy Microsoft Office or Wordperfect Office. I am wondering how the activation process works on Microsoft Office. If I buy it, I'll be getting the Professional Academic 2010 version. (student discount) Will I be able to use
 it on both my main PC and my laptop? When I upgrade my desktops motherboard will I be able to call in for additional activations? Will I be able to take an activation off my old laptop if my laptop gets replaced with a new one?.

<p>When you change the PC simply uninstall, then install on the new, in the worst case scenario you only have to use phone activation.</p>
<p>PS Unless you have a retail version of win7 a motherboard upgrade will cause an oem version of win to fail to install</p>

<h2>            Meeting &#34;Location&#34; field</h2>
                    When sending through a new meeting invite, I used to be able to type in the meeting room as an attendee in the "to" field and it would auto-populate into the "location" field. This is no longer the case. A coworker of mine says that hers still auto-populates.
 Is there a fix for this?

            I'm guessing there's a bug when exporting as mp4 Full HD. I experienced the same with .mp4 and .wma I change the file type to wmv and it worked on me. Try other file types.&nbsp;

A new feature in IE10.</p>
<p>If you click at the "eye", your complete password will appear in the box.</p>
<p>I supposed it is used if you suddenly have a mental lapse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can remove it, if you find that a security issue.</p>
<p>It will require using registry editor.</p>
<p>Post back if you want it removed. Specify your Win 7 version.</p>

    <title>Cannot update table styles from the Table Styles Gallery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwight needels  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot update table styles from the Table Styles Gallery</h2>
                    <p>When a table is selected, the Table Style Gallery appears on the Table Tools&gt;Design ribbon tab (or whatever you are supposed to call these things).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, a right-click on a table style gives the option to "Modify Table Style", which is a very convenient way to access this feature since the table styles don't appear in the ordinary Styles panel. However, more often than not the "Modify Table Style"
 option is grayed out for all table styles, including the one applied to the currently selected table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the "Modify Table Style" option is available for all table styles, and continues to be for quite some time before reverting to the useless disabled state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, the table style can still be edited by going to the Manage Styles modal dialog which you get to by clicking the third button at the bottom of the Styles panel, which you get to by clicking the "square arrow" button on the Style Gallery which
 you get to by clicking on the Home ribbon tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[1] What is the trick to making the "Modify Table Style" option available when you right-click on table style in&nbsp;the Table Style Gallery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, -Dwight</p>

<p>Thanks Marvin, but can you provide a link to the Unified labelling client for MacOS? The screenshot you've posted is found by a simple Google search which is what I first came across when I began this exercise. However there is no further information about
 a MacOS client. The iOS and Android clients are easy enough to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, this is for the Azure Information Protection Unified Labeling Client. Not Azure Information Protection client</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apology for the misunderstanding, the client supports for <strong>the labels</strong> which could be used by MacOS, iOS and Android. As you know, the AIP works with the labels and policies. Currently Azure Information Protection unified labeling client
 is only for Windows devices. In Mac devices, you can download Azure Information Protection viewer app to check the protected files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://portal.azurerms.com/#/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.azurerms.com/#/download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, from my research, recently there's no information about the product updates or roadmap of Azure Information Protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?product=information-protection&amp;status=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?product=information-protection&amp;status=all</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this scenario, if you have further questions of Azure Information Protection products, we suggest you post your concerns in
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Azure Community</a>. While if you'd like to have the AIP unified labeling client in Mac devices, it's recommended to share your expectations in
<a href="https://feedback.azure.com/forums/34192--general-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Azure Feedback website</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, sorry for the misunderstanding and wrong information.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Oh, I see now. Now this is <em>quite</em> different.<br />You don't actually want to delete any signature at all.<br />The Default panel you are talking about lets you select what default signature to use for each of your Outlook accounts. There is no relationship between signatures as you imply.<br />The idea is that you select your account on the left, then use the drop down menu on the same line on the right to select which of your signatures to use (or us None, or a random one in your list of signatures).<br />The signatures presented in the menu are taken from the root of the signature panel where you do have the possibility to create (or delete) signatures for all your accounts.</p><p>You certainly cannot delete anything from there. If there are signatures listed there that you never want to use with any account, you have to select them and delete them from the main Signature preference panel (the one you were on before clicking on Default Signatures).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nb

            Do they send if you press F9 or the send and receive button or if you wait a long time?  The default check every nn min time is 30 min - to lower it, press Ctrl+Alt+S to open the Send/Receive dialog. 
<br />
<br />Do you use iCloud or other addins?  
<br />
<br />Do the messages send ok if you start outlook in Safe mode? To open Outlook in Safe mode: Close Outlook then hold Ctrl as you click on the Outlook icon. You'll get a message asking if you want to start in Safe mode. Click Ok.

<p>Hi Diane</p>
<p>Nothing happens if I press F9( Fn9 brings up Cortana). If I close Outlook &amp; go back in, the emails get sent&nbsp; out of the outbox. I don't use icloud or other add-ins. Something is really a bit funny with Outlook : earlier this week it was always asking if
 I wanted to open in Safe mode , which I did. I would then close it &amp; reopen &amp; it would be alright. It doesn't do that any more. I tried deliberately to open in Safe mode, which you suggested, but no message came up. It went straight in. Thanks for replying.</p>

    <title>Why do my deleted e-mails not go into the Deleted Items folder in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeinbl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do my deleted e-mails not go into the Deleted Items folder in outlook 2010...where is my Sent folder, etc.&#63;</h2>
                    Running new install of Vista and Outlook 2010. Set up e-mail account with G-Mail using IMAP. A number of things:<br />
<br />
(1) When I delete files, the files do not go into the "Deleted Items". While in the past I've configured Outlook to empty the "Deleted Items" folder upon exiting, I like the idea of having the chance of recovering e-mail that may have been deleted by accident.<br />
<br />
(2) Likewise I don't seem to have a "Sent" folder so I can't tell whether e-mail was successfully sent or not. How do I get a "Sent" folder.<br />
<br />
(3) E-mails with attachments take forever to 'send"...sometimes it won't send them at all. What's going on here?<br />
<br />
(4) Is there a way to set up my G-Mail account so it becomes an "Outlook Data File" and eliminate this IMAP business?<br />
<br />
(5) While I have a "Contacts" folder under my IMAP e-mail account, they are not available to me when I click on "To" when I try to send e-mail. What's this all about?<br />
<br />
Any guidance or help on these issues would be most appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

    <title>Suggestions for Microsoft Security Essentials Beta - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Suggestions for Microsoft Security Essentials Beta</h2>
                    <div><b>Tray icon:</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Should match Windows 7 task bar white iconic style;</div>
<div>It should be visible by default, so that the user knows it's up and running, without having to click the up arrow;</div>
<div>Option to Update (both program and definitions) from the tray bar icon;</div>
<div>Scan (Quick scan, Full scan and Custom scan);</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><b>Settings &gt; Real-time protection:</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Bring back the settings "Scan all downloads" and "Monitor file and program activity on your computer";</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><b>Settings &gt; include Update schedule setting:</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A setting to schedule updates would be more than welcome to Microsoft Security Essentials.</div>
<div><u>Updating once a day is not enough</u>, and most users don't know how to tweak the Registry or create scripts to automate the updating process either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Antimalware protection (signatures) on its own is far from being efficient; even less so by only providing definitions updates once a day. You folks are actually breaking the 8th of the 10th Immutable Laws of Security. Quite ironic, wouldn't you say so?</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>New technology/component:</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>
<div>I know that Microsoft aims at providing a simple to use antimalware product. But, we shall not confuse simplicity with lack of proper protection. Simplicity doesn't equal lack of protection technology.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Simplicity means that the user won't have to interact with the security solution 99% of the time. That's what simplicity means. That's the reason why I personally run it, instead of many other security solutions.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Microsoft Security Essentials should provide more protection, such as a malicious behavior blocking.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>It should monitor known malicious patterns and block processes based on that. &nbsp;To reduce false positives, a white list approach should be considered.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div><b>Firewall integration and control:</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>
<div>The current Windows 7 firewall is way too complicated for 99% of Windows users to deal with, so they can have control over what communications are allowed to occur. Microsoft Security Essentials should provide control of the Windows firewall in its GUI,
 such as creating, modifying, importing and exporting rules.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Microsoft should provide a&nbsp;database&nbsp;of preset rules for the operating system processes, main web browsers (ports 80, 443 and 21), main download managers (ports 80, 443 and 21), main 3G usb modems, such as Vodafone (which would only require access to the
 DNS servers and nothing else to fully operate), e-mail clients, live messenger/alternatives...</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>MSE community (not composed only by novice people, make no mistakes!) could share their rules, and these rules should be vetted by Microsoft. Say that a few people share rules for their browsers to allow communication to ports other than the three main
 ones 80, 443 and 21, Microsoft shall not redistribute those rules. This would make rules be safer for everyone. 99% of users will only need 80 and 443; a smaller % will need port 21.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>This way millions of Windows users will have outgoing firewall protection, without sacrificing the use of their operating systems and applications, and without compromising their security. Not having outgoing protection is really concerning, IMHO. Outgoing
 protection would prevent many malware running in user land from connecting to their C&amp;C servers.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Something like this is long due. You <b>cannot</b>&nbsp;expect Windows users to live in the security stone age anymore. Enough is enough.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><b>Having these features won't kill MSE's simplicity.</b> The simplicity resides in protecting the user without putting the burden over their own shoulders. I'm pretty confident MSE team can come up with this, and still make MSE be this simple - take control
 of the system's security without bothering the user 99% of the time.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Password</b>&nbsp;protect Microsoft Security Essentials. It's settings are protected by User Account Control, but many people have it disabled. That's a sad fact. They don't understand its concept, and even take suggestions from many bloggers who also don't
 understand it and advise to disable it. Microsoft Security Essentials should also feature a password protection setting.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The option <i>Submit malicious software sample</i>&nbsp;should have a tab of its own in the GUI. The down arrow doesn't&nbsp;explicitly&nbsp;says what it is for, and this way you're hiding functionality from users. You should then, under this new tab, provide a way for
 users to browse their systems and then upload the file(s) from within MSE GUI, without opening a web browser.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Custom scanning</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>It would be great to have the option to schedule different customized scans.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Compute hashes of files in folders predefined by the user</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>This suggestion came to mind a few days ago, while talking to a relative of mine. I downloaded a software I wanted to test and then I computed the hash value to see if it matched the one provided by the author(s).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My relative asked me what I was doing. What was the thing with all those numbers and letters. I told my relative that a hash value is a value that is given to a file when it's created and that every time someone modifies it, that value changes as well.
 I also said that by computing hashes for later comparison is a great way of knowing whether or not files have been modified, either by humans or by malware.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I mentioned "malware", I promptly was asked by my relative if computing hashes helps protect oneself against malware. I said it depends; it depends on whether or not the hash doesn't match with the one provided by software authors or if it doesn't
 match the hashes of the files we got. If we compute hashes for later comparison, then it's a good way to make sure the files are OK.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That said, and after a bit more conversation, we came to realize such functionality would be welcome in MSE. It would be useful if users (generally speaking) could add predefined folders to MSE. Say the user wants to MSE to compute hashes from files in
 folder A, where he/she saves work documents. By computing the hashes of those files and store them, if they change and the user opens them in a future time, MSE alerts that the hashes mismatch. This a clearly indication that something is, in fact, wrong. Unless
 someone had physical access to the computer, there are no reasons for a hash mismatch.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyway, it's just what it is... a suggestion.</div>

<p>A few comments from me (not Microsoft):</p>
<p>Regarding "<u>Updating once a day is not enough</u>, and most users don't know how to tweak the Registry or create scripts to automate the updating process either."</p>
<p>See: Update FAQ - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_updating/mse-definitionssignatures-update-faq/74e507b8-f6da-4eca-8ce7-d1aca7d3f1ba">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_updating/mse-definitionssignatures-update-faq/74e507b8-f6da-4eca-8ce7-d1aca7d3f1ba</a></p>
<p>Signature based protection is only part of the story. Updating signatures more frequently than once a day is not needed. Signature based protection will not prevent infection from the constantly mutating malware that appears as it will always be "out of
 date" as the signatures catch up with the mutations of the infections.</p>
<p>That brings us to your other point: "It should monitor known malicious patterns and block processes based on that. To reduce false positives, a white list approach should be considered."</p>
<p>I can't speak to the existence of a "white list" or not as I don't know how MSE performs the behavior monitoring, but it has done this since v1. MSE does not simply rely on signatures of known viruses and malware.</p>
<p>As for the firewall, I have never had to configure the Windows firewall beyond the basic settings for Public vs. Private network and enabling sharing and/or ICS when needed. I have no need for the granular control of settings for ports and protocols. Yes,
 I realize that the Windows Firewall defaults to inbound protection only, but that's enough for me as I expect that my virus/spyware protection and computing practices will *prevent* malicious outbound activity before a firewall needs to step in to block/allow
 it. </p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I do appreciate your feedback.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, you do admit not being sure how it all plays. Anyway, I can't possible imagine why people still say that single daily malware definitions updates are enough?</div>
<div><br />
<div>And yes, I totally agree with you, when you say&nbsp;<span><b>Signature based protection will not prevent infection from the constantly mutating malware that appears as it will always be "out
 of date" as the signatures catch up with the mutations of the infections.</b></span></div>
<div><span><b><br />
</b></span></div>
<div>That's exactly what I previously said. But, by not updating more frequently and automatically each day, that fight will be even harder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding the behavioral thing you talk about:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span><i>MSE will report that it is up to date and in good status even if the definitions are a few days old on the PC. Note that MSE uses the local signatures for common protection, but it also employs behavioral
 detection. If suspicious activity is detected, MSE will communicate with the servers to determine if a match has been reported and will immediately download any information needed to deal with the threat if a match is found.</i></span></div>
<div><span><i><br />
</i></span></div>
<div>First, I can't understand how an MSE can report its status as up-to-date and all OK, when definitions are days old? That's quite stupid. So, for all Jane and Joe cares, MSE is OK and all is OK. The system may be infected, and this infection could have
 been stopped had MSE been automatically updated more often. I can't possible condone this behavior. I truly don't understand this logic. It has no logic.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second, if MSE finds something suspicious, then it will communicate with the servers? This means an Internet connection needs to be active. If the user is offline, this so-called behavior blocking mechanism is 100% useless. That's what I'm understanding
 from what you mentioned in that other thread you linked to. What kind of match are we talking about? How does that work?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm talking about a behavior blocking mechanism that monitors patterns/behaviors against a list of known malicious behaviors/patters and also employs heuristics to protect the user,
<b>offline</b>. To prevent false positives, there should be a white list, obviously.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding the <b>firewall integration</b>, I respect yours and any one else's decision not to enable outgoing protection. I personally run Windows 7 Firewall with Advanced Security, tweaked to my liking. I feel comfortable working with it. It causes me
 no confusion.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The suggestion had more to do with conversations with relatives and friends. I have also set up a relative - what many of us power users would call
<i>average Jane/Joe</i> - and she's enjoying it. All the needed applications are set up, and she's being running this way for months now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Other relatives and friends asked me if I could do it for them as well. I had to say no. I simply cannot afford to set up that many systems; I lack the time and to be honest the will to do it. It's a time consuming task. Each system is different and with
 different applications, which require many different rules.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is why I though of bringing the useful (outgoing protection) to the practical (an easy access to the firewall rules in MSE GUI).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Obviously, this is not enough. It's still hard for Jane and Joe to work with. But, by having a predefined set of rules of O.S processes and common applications, and with power users sharing their rules, for other not so common applications, Microsoft can
 bring outgoing protection to millions of users out there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I truly believe this can be done. Totally possible. It simply requires will to do it. It only begs a question - Is Microsoft willing to do what needs to be done? I'm not trying to be arrogant or anything like that; it's a honest question.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No one can deny either that millions of users are victims of infections, that may reflect on loss of credentials, etc. Many infections do happen in user land, mostly because there's UAC (some people do disable it, but many other don't). This makes malware
 authors to infect standard user accounts. In a system without firewall outgoing protection, it doesn't really matter where or not the user is running a standard user account, as the malware will still be able to connect back to its C&amp;C server(s). If you bring
 in outgoing firewall protection, millions of users will have one more "tool" to help them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I mentioned above, was precisely the reason why my relative asked me to set up firewall outgoing protection. She had her system infected, and the malware was running with the permissions of a standard user. But, it's all that's required to accomplish
 stealing credentials. Malware doesn't require administrative privileges to steal bank credentials, for example.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is just my view, based on the experience that I've been having with other few people. But, I'd imagine many other people like that exist, because they don't know better. They do deserve to have a better protection.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nothing is 100% perfect, but it sure would bring the fight to a new level.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nowadays we have safer browsers such as Internet Explorer 9 or Google Chrome, which offer sandboxing. 100% perfect? No, but they sure bring the fight to a new level too, requiring the malware to recur to other tricks, such social engineering.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By using standard user accounts, safer browsers (sandbox, blacklisting, download reputation), proper antimalware protection (signatures, heuristics and behavior monitoring/blocking) and firewall protection (incoming and outgoing), we're raising the fight
 to a new level.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I actually would like to see something else in MSE, which would also help the user spot that something is, in fact, wrong (infection). I'll be editing my first post.</div>

            <p>Unfortunately I believe that explaining how the Behavior Monitoring and now blocking already built into MSE works&nbsp;is going to be difficult , since your thoughts are actually mired in the archaic ways these features work in older antimalware products.&nbsp; In
 MSE they are part of the active protection system and as such require that you completely forget how you 'think' that they operate in order to understand how they really work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key to the protection system within MSE is that it is dynamically coupled into the SpyNet (now MAPS) system via the signature based and behavior systems.&nbsp; This allows MSE to query the vast MAPS database using a signature generated by combining file hashes,
 network and other behavioral&nbsp;activity collected from its various monitoring modules.&nbsp; If this signature matches a local definition then it can act immediately, but if it's unrecognized or even simply not a perfect match it can supplement this by uploading
 the signature to MAPS, which if known to MAPS&nbsp;can quickly return the associated definition to take action.&nbsp; If it's completely unknown the item(s) can be optionally uploaded to MAPS for further investigation.</p>
<p>Though the above may not be as perfect as you'd like, it's really the most effective thing that can be done for a completely unknown item, since it at least makes MAPS and so the MPCC aware of a [potential] new threat.&nbsp; Known malware&nbsp;families with minor
 variations are already covered via family type definitions which again include both&nbsp;file hash&nbsp;as well as various behavioral signature information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another ability of the MAPS system is the reversing of false positive detections, since the query made to MAPS allows an existing local definition to be replaced dynamically, updating it on the fly to remove the invalid portion of the detection once this
 has been identified and corrected in the MAPS database.</p>
<p>Stating that this system isn't effective is forgetting that most 'new'&nbsp;malware is experienced while online, not disconnected from the Internet.&nbsp; Though this is possible, especially in the case that the PC is disconnected for multiple days, this situation
 is really no different than it has ever been&nbsp; Again, the family and also&nbsp;heuristic detections will combine to provide some protection, but as&nbsp;with all such systems these will decay in value as they age offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary reason I've explained the operation of the MAPS system before the updates themselves is to show why constant updating of MSE is unnecessary, since it can update just what it needs on demand whenever a new item is detected.&nbsp; This precludes the
 requirement for constant almost pathological updates and so allows a more reasonable approach of daily differential updates that contain all of the definitions which have been added since the last successful update cycle.</p>
<p>The reality that most don't understand is that very few new&nbsp;definitions updates are actually created and released in less than a few days, with only rare large outbreaks being produced in a day or less.&nbsp; This is because they have been fooled by the apparent
 quick release cycles that appear to exist when updates are requested and sometimes even provided every couple hours.&nbsp; The simple truth is that these systems typically&nbsp;just 'thrash' a similar number of actual definitions updates over a larger number of smaller
 updates, while the actual age of the definitons delivered may still be days.</p>
<p>Though the higher speed of the release cycle (e.g. 1 to a few hours) appears to provide quick response, the&nbsp;on demand&nbsp;ability of MSE and MAPS allows an even faster response with a more targeted type of request.&nbsp; This ability precludes the need for nearly
 constant updates which along with adding no real improvement in true security, actually only serve to cause overhead for both the local PC and the update servers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a different theme, you have missed an important point relating to your understanding of how MSE operates relative to the network and firewalls with Windows Vista and 7&nbsp; Though it does need the Windows firewall to be enabled to provide inbound protection,
 MSE also provides it's own network monitoring abilities in the mpnwmon filter driver.&nbsp; This module allows MSE to monitor and detect network activity via the Windows Filtering Platform, so it performs similarly to the various third-party firewalls that provide
 dynamic protection, but simply uses this activity as another thing it can monitor and/or block if malware is involved.&nbsp; So for this reason there's no need to configure the firewall beyond the normal inbound protection, since MSE itself will do the rest as
 required.</p>
<p>The difference with MSE in the case of network monitoring and many other situations is that it doesn't pop-up useless prompts about network activity, since these just serve to confuse most users and again provide no true additional security.&nbsp; It simply monitors
 and if malware is detected it then provides network blocking, file quarantine/removal and any other actions as required as well as notification of the user.&nbsp; This allows MSE to be normally quiet, but take action including notification when it's actually required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reference to your last item about the file hashes, as I recall this is how MSE avoids constantly re-scanning all existing files, by storing the file hashes in a cache.&nbsp; However, these must be flushed after every reboot or other shutdown of the Real-time
 protection, since there's no way to be certain they haven't been modified by something malicious during the period that MSE was offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won't try to address your other requests since some are covered better already in other threads here or you are asking for things that I really don't care about.</p>

            Very good points and explanations, Rob! *thumbs up*<br />
<br />
I agree especially about the annoying prompts 3rd party inbound/outbound firewalls tend to give. One cannot expect any user, experienced or otherwise, to know how to respond to a prompt that says something to the degree of, "Do you want to allow bits.exe to
 access the Internet?" It is likely an non-specifically named exe that is part of a trusted program you have installed.<br />

<div><span><b><br />
</b></span></div>
<div><span><b>You say</b>&nbsp;</span><span>"The key to the protection system within MSE is that it is dynamically coupled into the SpyNet (now MAPS) system via the signature based and behavior systems."</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>It comes to one thing – Spynet/MAPS. And Spynet/MAPS means another thing – an Internet connection is needed at the moment an infection is about to occur.
<div>
<div>
<p><span>Then, if all the methods that Spynet/MAPS employs aren’t enough, the user will need to upload whatever needs to be uploaded. This brings into the equation the need for an Internet connection all over again.</span></p>
<p><span>And, you call the behavior blocking protection I mentioned archaic? Sorry, but what you describe is what is archaic, IMHO.</span></p>
<p><span>The user must be protected when it matters; and, that moment, is when the user executes something, including when the user is offline. Offline is also a key word in what comes to protection. What? Do you folks live a different reality where there are
 no flash drives or in a reality where people do not open lots of files offline, or that download the e-mails to read them offline? No one shares files through flash drives, etc. anymore?</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe not... Maybe I'm living different reality.</span></p>
<p><b>You say</b> <span>“</span><span>Though the above may not be as perfect as you'd like, it's really the most effective thing that can be done for a completely unknown item, since it at least makes MAPS and so the MPCC aware of a [potential] new threat.&nbsp;
 Known malware&nbsp;families with minor variations are already covered via family type definitions which again include both&nbsp;file hash&nbsp;as well as various behavioral signature information.</span><span>”</span></p>
<p><span>No, it isn’t perfect, at all. It’s flawed. Your thought is also flawed. The user needs to be protected first; then send the info – if allowed by the user - about what the behavior blocker protected the user against.</span></p>
<p><span>And, this clearly reveals that user also needs to allow MAPS - because, MSE does say that personal information may be sent to Microsoft, even if Microsoft says won't use that information for nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span>With what I mentioned, the user will be protected. Even if the user decides not to send the information.</span></p>
<p><span><b>You say</b> "</span><span>at least makes MAPS and so the MPCC aware of a [potential] new threat."</span></p>
<p><span>At least?</span></p>
<p><b>You say</b><span>&nbsp;</span><span>“</span><span>Stating that this system isn't effective is forgetting that most 'new'&nbsp;malware is experienced while online, not disconnected from the Internet.&nbsp; Though this is possible, especially in the case that the PC is
 disconnected for multiple days, this situation is really no different than it has ever been&nbsp; Again, the family and also&nbsp;heuristic detections will combine to provide some protection, but as&nbsp;with all such systems these will decay in value as they age offline.</span><span>”</span></p>
<p><span>It isn’t effective. First, it requires the user to want to send personal information to Microsoft, even if Microsoft promises that info won’t be used for anything. So, this MAPS thing is not even going to be enabled in SMEs, where MSE can be installed
 up to 10 computers. This is the first flaw in MAPS. The second flaw is that it requires an active Internet connection. This doesn’t reflect the reality; most people aren’t always connected to the Internet. They simply aren't. I'm not.</span></p>
<p><span>My computer isn’t disconnected for days, but I do use a 3G USB modem and I have monthly limited traffic. I’m only connected when I need to be. But, I do get to open a few flash drives with different sorts of files, collected from the Internet for studying
 purposes (by other people as well). At the time I downloaded such files Microsoft Security Essentials didn’t alert me for anything. If I happen to open an infected file and Microsoft Security Essentials fails to protect me because it can’t connect to MAPS,
 then I call this a flawed security design. Microsoft Security Essentials must protect me right there – when I execute the file. And, it’s not matter of if, rather a matter of when. When it happens, MSE must protect me.</span></p>
<p><span><b>You say</b> “<span>Though this is possible, especially in the case that the PC is disconnected for multiple days, this situation is really no different than it has ever been.”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Is this even an argument? The situation needs, precisely, to be different that it is/than it has ever been. It can’t remain like this. The user must be protected while offline. Microsoft cannot expect the user to be connected or connect
 to the Internet every time it finds something suspicious. If the user actually happens to be out of the monthly traffic, then the user is simply out of luck? This is surreal. lol</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><b>You say</b>&nbsp;“The primary reason I've explained the operation of the MAPS system before the updates themselves is to show why constant updating of MSE is unnecessary, since it can update just what it needs on demand whenever a new
 item is detected.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>One more flawed security design. Especially for the reasons I mentioned above. Not only MSE must be updated more often, it also needs to employ a proper behavior blocking technology to protect the user while offline.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><b>You say</b>&nbsp;“Though the higher speed of the release cycle (e.g. 1 to a few hours) appears to provide quick response, the&nbsp;on demand&nbsp;ability of MSE and MAPS allows an even faster response with a more targeted type of
 request.</span>”</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Again, one more flawed design. It requires an active Internet connection. If there’s no active connection, then what good is it? If no Internet connection, no protection.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Regarding the firewall integration, I’m also afraid that you totally missed the point.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>First, according to what you mentioned, MSE needs to detect. If no detection, no protection. Are you saying MSE will detect everything?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><b>You did say</b> "<span>so it performs similarly to the various third-party firewalls that provide dynamic protection, but simply uses this activity as another thing it can monitor and/or block if malware is involved."</span></p>
<p><span>Second, I mentioned that Microsoft should provide access to Windows Firewall with Advanced Security in its GUI. It should allow the user to manage WFAS rules from within MSE GUI.</span></p>
<p><span>I mentioned a lot more about it, and I won’t be repeating it, as it can be read in my initial post.</span></p>
<p><span>But, I did mention that <b>Microsoft should provide preset rules</b>, and
<b>allow users to share their rules</b>, and that <b>Microsoft should vet those same rules</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, Agnitum follows this approach. It ends up being a quite silent firewall, unless one enjoys the prompts. The problem with Outpost firewall is that the firewall is buggy and it often failed to load. Agnitum never managed to solve this situation.
 This behavior doesn’t happen with WFAS. Microsoft knows better than any other third-party how Windows works. Not to mention that I/any other person shouldn’t have to get or pay for third-party buggy security applications that will add nothing but more code
 that will increase the attacking surface. Quite ironic, security software become one more attacking surface.</span></p>
<p><span><b>You say</b> “<span>The difference with MSE in the case of network monitoring and many other situations is that it doesn't pop-up useless prompts about network activity,<span>&nbsp;</span>“</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><b>The idea is actually not to have prompts,</b>&nbsp;b<b>y providing a predefined set of rules, constantly updated.</b></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>And, if you folks do believe that this would be complicated, then I got a request to make to Microsoft – Remove all the settings from Internet Explorer.
<b>The settings in Internet Explorer are overwhelming for 99% of Internet Explorer users.</b> Then again,
<b>they are there for a reason, aren’t they?</b></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We got a company with lots of contradictions. Not to mention <b>I’ve recently come across an advertisement by Microsoft for Microsoft Security Essentials saying “Paying for antivirus software is so 2008”</b>. Ironic that Microsoft displays such
 an ad, and <b>then seems to want to take lots of functionality away from MSE</b>, and that has archaic protection models, even if you do think they’re perfect; something they’re not.
<b>The way MSE protects is archaic, and I say archaic because we don’t live in that reality – an always on Internet connection.</b> That’s far from being the truth.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><b>If you truly believe that we can get our systems infected most of the time only when on-line, then the next best thing Microsoft could do is to make of MSE a pure cloud antimalware protection.</b></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>I mean, users would get a more efficient protection without requiring to check if they're always up-to-date.</p>
<p>Yes, damn, there's still an issue, though. It would require an always on Internet connection.</p>
<p><span><b>You say</b> "In reference to your last item about the file hashes, as I recall this is how MSE avoids constantly re-scanning all existing files, by storing the file hashes in a cache.&nbsp; However, these must be flushed after every reboot or other shutdown
 of the Real-time protection, since there's no way to be certain they haven't been modified by something malicious during the period that MSE was offline."</span></p>
<p><span>My suggestion had nothing to do how MSE works. My suggestion had to do with allowing the user to configure predefined folders, and have MSE compute the hashes and store them. If upon execution they mismatch alert the user that the files have been modified,
 and if the user didn't modify them, then the user should consider the fact the system is more than likely infected.</span></p>
<p>I believe what you mentioned and what I mentioned aren't directly related to one another.</p>
<p><b>You say</b> "<span>I won't try to address your other requests since some are covered better already in other threads here or you are asking for things that I really don't care about."</span></p>
<p><span>Well, let's not make of this anything personal. It's not about what we like or dislike, what we want or don't want.</span></p>
<p><span>I merely made suggestions, after being in touch with other people using MSE and who would like MSE to work different. This doesn't reflect what other people want, of course; it simply means a few similar points of view. I simply expressed that view/those
 views. I believe this is what the beta feedback is for. :)</span></p>

            <p>MSE does have behavioral blocking as I stated in my first sentence of my previous post, though that ability is only used if the malware itself is known to avoid false positive detections, which MSE has always tested better at than most other vendors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSE does not depend entirely on MAPS, it contains a similar number of local definitions for malware that is currently known to be moving tthrough the computing ecosystem as other antimalware.&nbsp; MAPS simply extends this database of definitions to a potentially
 huge size, allowing it to receive on the fly updates not only for very new malware before they can be released in a definition&nbsp;update, but also less common older malware that would overwhelm both the Microsoft Update systems and the local PC as well.&nbsp; The
 reason for this is that the current&nbsp;database of known malware fills multiple TeraBytes of disk, so just the definitions required to cover all of these would require GigaBytes of space, while MAPS allows your PC to get these more rare definitions on demand
 if they are ever&nbsp;detected on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue you are concerned about is very simple to resolve, since before disconnecting from the Internet you can simply perform a manual update which will acquire the latest available file.&nbsp; This is what I do with my own laptop since it often sits off on
 my desk until I need to go on site and is very simple to remember, and wouldn't be aided by even constant updates since it's off.&nbsp; The point here is that everyone's usage is different, but you need to find a way to make something work for you or simply choose
 something else.&nbsp; I see no reason for Microsoft to attempt to handle all edge cases, especially when they would undoubtedly require a huge additional investment in infrastructure just to appease a few users with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality is that most users today do have always on Internet and though the number without it isn't yet tiny, it's dwindling as time goes on.&nbsp; MSE was designed to deal with that target rich environment , since that's the direction the malware has been
 taking itself.&nbsp; Some malware actually detects the Internet IP ranges for dial-up or even tests the connection bandwidth and simply aborts if it doesn't find what it wants, since a bot on a low bandwith temporary connection is fairly useless to most of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the specific case of portable devices being plugged into a system, there is a far better way to protect yourself from these malware than any antimalware can provide, since it removes the critical ability for the malware to start on its own.&nbsp; This
 is to disable the Autorun capability in Windows, though as I recall this is already the default for Windows 7.</p>
<p>How to disable the Autorun functionality in Windows</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the age of detections found on the local PC, since these USB delivered malware tend to be days or even weeks old before they get to a new PC it's highly unlikely that you'd ever experience one before you'd updated again anyway, unless you are offline
 for several days at a time, but then that's the real issue isn't it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of the firewall, the issue there is less about additional control than it is about protecting any open ports created by installed software, which MSE already does with it's network monitoring module.&nbsp; I don't see how&nbsp;adding more controls to another
 program would result in an easier interface, since Windows 7 already blocks by default and notifies the user when new&nbsp;software attempts to open connections.</p>
<p>Since attempting to autoconfigure the firewall for every possible application would be nearly impossible, it's simpler for MSE to&nbsp;monitor for known malware activity and simply block once any is found.&nbsp; If the network involved is isolated from Internet access
 then using MAPS won't be available, but that is again an issue of connectivity and not for Microsoft to resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the file/folder hashes, my point was that since the storage location for these would be known they would need to be regenerated each time the PC was restarted, since nothing about the state of the system while MSE was shut down could be guaranteed.&nbsp;
 Thus the added security you were hoping for couldn't be acheived without re-scanning and regenerating the hashes anyway, since they could simply have been modified by malware while MSE wasn't enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this or the above ever stated that MSE is perfect, since that's not true for any antimalware system, it's just the state of the art today.&nbsp; It also isn't telling you what you can and can't have, just why most of it is unnecessary or too costly for
 Microsoft to implement.&nbsp; Understanding your antimalware and how it works helps you to better understand your security as a whole, so take it or leave it, I just thought you might want to understand better what you are using.</p>

    <title>How do you insert an Adobe Captivate project into a Powerpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dalepolley  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you insert an Adobe Captivate project into a Powerpoint presentation&#63;</h2>
                    I imported a Microsoft Powerpoint 2010 presentation into Adobe Captivate 5.5, primarily to take advantage of the Text-to-Voice functionality and have saved the Capitvate project as an SWF file and now want to insert that file into my Powerpoint presentation?
 The Adobe Captivate User guide states that I should refer to the topic on the Microsoft website. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find the topic.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The audio generated by the Text-to-Voice can be exported from the Captivate project and inserted in the original PowerPoint, assumming that's all you did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However if you want to insert a swf file in to PowerPoint then try this</p>
