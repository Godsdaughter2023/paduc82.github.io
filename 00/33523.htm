<h2>            MIDI Keyboard recognized but no Input Signal</h2>
                    <p>I own a Novation Impulse MIDI keyboard that is recognised in my laptop but there is no response from any key pressed or an knobs or faders moved. My machine is the Lenovo Y-50-70 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard does work in my friend's HP laptop operating in windows 10 as well. I followed the same installation procedure in both machines but my laptop does not receive any signal from the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard's LCD does receive the data from the DAW software. Also this was the same case with TouchOSC in my android device. TouchOSC did sync with the DAW but the DAW didn't respond to any knobs or faders in TouchOSC.</p>

"I have a similar problem.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 and now when I turn my computer off at night and start it in the morning, my keyboard does not work.&nbsp; I have gone into "home group" and change things, I restart and then my keyboard works.&nbsp; I am not even
 sure which of the settings is doing this.&nbsp; Why is this happening?&nbsp; I never had this problem before.&nbsp; It is a Logitech keyboard."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rita<br />

</p><p>I would suggest that you try to plug another keyboard onto your system and check&nbsp; if the issue persist. The issue that you are facing can be due to a hardware conflict which led to the keyboard not be4ing able to get detected.</p>

<h2>            Product Keys</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP pc with an HP produced Windows 7 25-digit product key on a label on the desktop. I have used two different pieces of system interrogation software to find a product key. They have each come up with the same 25-digit product key which differs
 totally from the one on the HP label.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know what this second product key is and can it be used to activate a Digital River free download of a full Windows 7 boot disk?</p>

<p>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A) OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the OEM Bios Flag found only on that Manufacturer's computer hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory)
 Windows looks at the motherboard and sees the proper OEM Bios Flag (for that Manufacturer and that version of Windows) and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) COA SLP: This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom) of your computer. It is a valid product key, but should only be used in limited situations (sush as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The
 key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</p>
<p>Your Windows is using an OEM SLP key, but (for whatever reason) cannot see the special instructions in the computer’s motherboard and is unable to Self-Activate.To fix the issue, you will need to change out the OEM SLP key with the COA SLP key. The normal
 way to do this is to click the ‘Start’ button, right-click ‘Computer’, select ‘Properties’ and then click ‘Change Product Key’ (located in the lower right-hand side of the window). Enter the COA SLP key and follow the instructions in the Change Product Key
 Wizard. </p>

<h2>            Giochi in italiano vivendo in USA, come ottenerli&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Salve ragazzi. Ho da poco comprato la mia xbox 360 e vorrei giocare in italiano. Vivendo in California però non è possibile trovare i giochi in italiano, ma solo in inglese e spagnolo. Allora la migliore soluzione credo sia quella di acquistare i giochi
 attraverso xbox live, ma non so come fare. Ho settato tutti i parametri del mio account in regione Italia, ho acquistato con una carta di credito americana un gioco e mi risulta però in inglese. Potete aiutarmi a trovare il modo di comprare un gioco in lingua
 italiana attraverso xbox live? Grazie</p>

<p>Se abiti in California ed hai comprato lì la tua console, sappi che la 360 è Region Lock quindi potrai giocare a giochi della regione di acquisto/provenienza.</p>
<p>Avresti dovuto acquistare la One essendo Region Free (anche se comunque abitando in California avresti potuto acquistare i giochi dal tuo stato o comunque dal market USA).</p>

<p>Se hai acquistato la console in California e hai scaricato un gioco dal marketplace italiano in teoria ti dovrebbe dare errore ( gioco PAL, console NTSC ), a meno che non sia region free.</p>
<p>So che suona stupido ma la console è impostata come lingua e regione su italiano?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 install after hard drive replacement</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to get the Windows 7 Home Premium Recovery cd to load onto my new hard drive in my ASUS CG 5270 desktop.</p>
<p>I booted with the recovery cd that came with the system when I purchased it new.&nbsp; It said it was "loading files", then "starting windows", then an ASUS screen with a choice to "recover to a partition" or "entire cd".&nbsp; I tried both. &nbsp;In both cases, it went
 next to "recovering system AsImageX", then asked for insertion of the ASUS support cd.&nbsp; Once that was done, it says "file&nbsp;copying completed" and to remove the support cd.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then system reboots and says "starting windows", "set up is updating registry", "installing
 services",&nbsp;"installing devices".&nbsp; Screen then goes black and stays black until it reboots and starts over at "starting windows".&nbsp; It never gets to the beginning of the install where you specify the language etc.&nbsp; Am I missing something?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>How old is this PC?</p>
<p>Size of hard drive?</p>
<p>Is the installed hard drive the one that came on it when it was new?</p>
<p>Memory size?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First check should be of the hard drive itself.&nbsp; However, if you can not get to Win7 booted, you will not be able to test it on this computer.&nbsp; Are you able to remove the hard drive and temporarily install it in an external drive enclosure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another route to a factory restore on your Asus that does not use the recovery DVD's.&nbsp; Instead it uses a hidden partition on the hard drive.&nbsp; You access it by pressing the F9 key as soon as you start the computer. Press it repeatedly about once
 per second.&nbsp; It could be that there is defect on one of the DVD's the recovery is stored on.&nbsp;

            <p>I'm not at home at the moment, so don't have details at hand, but&nbsp;I believe I purchased it new in 2009 or so. Not sure of hard drive specs but the old one is removed and the new one is installed;&nbsp;as background,&nbsp;I had an acquaintance install it; I believe
 he said&nbsp;it's a 1TB drive.&nbsp; He installed Win&nbsp;7 Home Premium from his own copy and authenticated it with my original&nbsp;product key.&nbsp; It was up and running but I noticed we didn't have our Office apps.&nbsp; I forgot that they are purchased separately and assumed there
 was something wrong with his Windows install.&nbsp; He was out of town and I needed to get Office going for my wife to get some work done so I figured I'd try the Recovery CD to install Windows and then retrieve all our backed up data off the Seagate external drive
 we had backed up to before changing the hard drive.&nbsp; And here we are, recovery cd didn't work.&nbsp; Thanks for pondering this.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>If the hard drive is not the original OEM, there will be no factory partition.&nbsp; A clean install is likely the only solution.&nbsp; Here are some tips.&nbsp; First how to do the re-install, then solve a problem that you will have, then a tip to save you from this for
 the next time.....&nbsp; 3 things....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>New Hard Drive</em></strong> </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>March 17, 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hard drive&nbsp;has failed.&nbsp; You will have to replace it.&nbsp; Replace with a 500 G or more rotating 7200rpm drive.&nbsp; 500G drives can be found for around $70.&nbsp; Typically quite easy to replace.&nbsp; Now you will need a complete Windows 7 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do this all the time.&nbsp; I have done hundreds.&nbsp; This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</p>
<p>From this point onward, I am providing you with the process to install Windows 7.
<strong>IF YOU WANT WINDOWS 10, stop reading this now.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You <strong>may </strong>be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.&nbsp; You may need a friend to do this part for you, but the rest is not really very
 technical or difficult for most people.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Download and store the following to stand-alone Windows Updates on a USB stick: KB947821 and KB3102810. Download the correct 32 or 64 bit versions to match your product key.</li><li>Install the new hard drive.</li><li>Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>Start your computer on the first of them as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Key.&nbsp; You will need a Windows 7 install disk. The win7 disk must match the edition of your product key, and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>Place the disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>Once the install process gets started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers.</li><li>Once install is complete, if your install disk was SP1, <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 1)">
<em><strong>BEFORE</strong> </em></span>your computer actually restarts, disconnect the Internet connection.&nbsp; If not SP1, proceed with step 11 and follow until SP1 is installed. Then disconnect before rebooting takes place. Then follow the special set of instructions
 you will see following this list.&nbsp; This is to be done to eliminate an extremely slow Windows Updating process that immediately follows the installation of Service Pack 1 (SP1)</li><li><em><strong>Empty to emphasize following the instructions at the end of this set.</strong></em></li><li>After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type device in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose device manager from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; If the Network driver is missing
 (or has a yellow exclamation point, you are going to have to find that driver using a different working computer.&nbsp; You should get drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have
 installed all of them or nearly.</li><li>If you used the recovery disks from when your computer was new, you follow the rest of this now but all drivers should already be in place.</li><li>Do not install anything else at this point – NOTHING</li><li>Start Windows Update and click the link to include updates for other Microsoft software.</li><li>Choose Check for updates. This is going to take a long time, like many hours, so do not get impatient and stop this.&nbsp; If yours is a lap top, shut off hibernation and sleep functions, plug it in and go away.&nbsp; Maybe overnight, but more likely in a few hours.</li><li>Once you have a list of updates, you need to prevent certain specific updates from being installed to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.&nbsp; Here is the list.&nbsp; You will find these among the Windows section and they are NOT labeled security:</li><li>KB3035583 KB2952664 KB2977759 KB3021917 KB3075249 KB3080149 KB3083710 KB3083324 KB3090045 KB3112343 KB3123862 KB3022345 KB3068708</li><li>Whe
<p><strong><em>New install tip:</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<strong><em>before</em></strong> any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<strong><em>+</em></strong>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as
 it was at this point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time, and you will have saved yourself all the time you put in this time.</p>
<p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Windows Update fix (new)</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p><strong><em>The following procedure applies in the case of install (re-install) of Windows 7.&nbsp; It does not apply to usual, normal updating.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid you are going have to do the re-install again.&nbsp; Not a terrible penalty to pay.&nbsp; Usually takes way less than an hour.&nbsp; Then, immediately proceed with the following procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is strange, but it really does work and a lot of people have proven
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>BEFORE you start the re-install, download (32 or 64 bit) KB3083710 and KB3102810 in advance, and store on a USB stick</li><li>Start and complete the re-install of Windows 7 SP1</li><li>BEFORE the newly installed system can go online for the first time, <em><strong>disconnect
</strong></em>the computer from the Internet.&nbsp; This timing is critical.</li><li>Manually install KB3083710 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3102810 and restart.</li><li>Restore the Internet connection and launch Windows Update as normal.</li><li>After a few minutes, you should have&nbsp;plenty of updates to download and install.</li></ol>
<p>Thanks to Ken Morely</p>

    <title>Skype call crashes when called party answers with video - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype call crashes when called party answers with video</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm using Skype 8.18.0.6, calling version 2018.11.01.10 on a Mac platform running OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6. &nbsp;I have been using Skype without issue on this computer for over a year. &nbsp;Suddenly the program slowed down and video was choppy a week
 ago. &nbsp;I installed the latest update, noted above, and now when I call I can only do so with voice, looking at a blue screen. If I try to activate the web camera, the program immediately disconnects the call, and sometimes crashes. &nbsp;I have started a call with
 audio only, and had the other party activate their web cam and my program immediately shuts down. &nbsp;I have tried to connect to multiple other parties with the same result. &nbsp;I have had my IT guy check my internet speed, and I am enjoying 111mpbs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really at a loss as to what to do next and I am looking for direction.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
<p>Cheers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian</p>

<p><span>Please try to uninstall/reinstall the new Skype app on your device and check if the same issue persists.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this will not work, please download the classic Skype app and try to make a video call. You may now download the classic Skype app for Mac.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the "classic"Skype link- it works now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other question- in my quest to solve this problem on my own, I found a Microsoft Skype customer support number, which was not Microsoft at all, but a sketchy "company"that helps with Skype issues. I did video conference with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any experience with this, and is there anything I should do now that I have conferenced with them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Hello, it happened to me also, &nbsp;and I am super mad, I wanted dlc also, but with the new beta program when u enter MSP you get money (not points cause they wanna screw u over like that) so unless it says $ next to what ur buying and not 800 or so Microsoft
 points you can't buy it. But now that u entered 2 1600 point cards you have 40 $ on your account. Hope this helped, it's horrible I know, and there's no way of getting out of the beta

<p>Why? Are they going to fix it? Do you have personal knowledge of this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the&nbsp; Tile Data Layer Service that was removed in windows 1803 although in 1803 it did not show this error. To get rid of the warning of which hundreds can be generated everyday you must change permissions in the registry and delete the TDL keys in
 2 spots,&nbsp; or disable the event using the GUID . Microsoft always leaves the registry in a mess and always creates more error and warnings than is necessary. It is plain old sloppy programing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest to anyone to just ignore it unless it causes problems. Stay away from event viewer unless you have a good reason to hunt down serious errors like BSOD.</p>

            Hi James.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br /> If you want the best on-demand scanner install run Malwarebytes free scanner.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling antivirus in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, restart the PC, then type Security in Start Search, open Windows Defender Settings, there and in Windows Defender Security Center fix anything that's flagged.  
<br />
<br />To turn off Real Time Protection temporarily see here:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello IntenseJames 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />That would be depends of what antivirus do you have installed on your PC.
<br />
<br />If you have windows defender as antivirus these are the steps:
<br />
<br />Select Start  &gt; Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Windows Security &gt; Virus &amp; threat protection &gt; Manage settings (or Virus &amp; threat protection settings in previous versions of Windows 10).
<br />
<br />Switch Real-time protection to Off. Note that scheduled scans will continue to run. However, files that are downloaded or installed will not be scanned.﻿
<br />

            Hi. IntenseJames
<br />My name is Mila

<br />I hope to help.
<br />
<br />	If you have Windows Defender perform these steps:
<br />
<br />• To activate or deactivate the Windows Defender Firewall, select the Start button, and then select Settings&gt; Update and Security&gt; Windows Security&gt; Firewall and network protection. Choose a network profile, and then, in Windows Defender Firewall, change the setting to On or Off.
<br />
<br />	Note: If the device is connected to a network, it is likely that the network policy setting will prevent you from completing these steps.
<br />
<br />	If you have another activated antivirus, search from the control panel, programs, from there deactivate and then active once you install your program.       
        </p>

<p>This is real easy: Just about any antivirus program makes it possible to temporarily stop it. You can always find this in the program's own interface, and sometimes you can find it by right-clicking the program's icon in the notification area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should only have&nbsp;<em>one</em> antivirus program running in the background, so there should only be a need to temporarily disable
<em>one</em> program.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update error 80246002 the same after many fix tries.</h2>
                    <p>(amended Aug 31) It appears from some of the replies from the community I was in error thinking the problem was with a recent MS patch? Feel free to proceed if you like some of the replies may be of help. I'm sorry I can't remove my question so as not to
 waste peoples time. I apologize. Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've viewed a few posts about this issue and these are the things I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Member PA Bear suggested in one post to try the Fix It he gave a link to which I did. No result. Also later in that post I believe another member suggested we should run the Windows Update Diagnostic. It ran and this is a screen shot of the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97c6f98f-8bc1-4386-94bc-c49ab3bc576b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>A ZDNet blog came out saying that MS recommended uninstalling KB2982791 prior to installing KB2993651.</p>
<p>The problem with that was I found that out after KB2993651 was installed by Windows Update yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is occurring on both my Win7 Ultimate 64bit pc's. My Surface Pro Win 8.1 seems fine.</p>
<p>On my laptop pc I did&nbsp;a system restore.</p>
<p>I restored it to Tuesday the 26th which removed KB2993651 and went in to programs and uninstalled KB2982791.</p>
<p>Rebooted and Update for some reason had the KB2993651 update ready to install. It did not check for new updates just had that one in updates.</p>
<p>I looked in programs and saw that KB2982791 was no longer in there so I installed KB2993651. Rebooted and update is back to square one, error 80246002 is present once again and update reports I have never checked for updates&nbsp;and never&nbsp;installed updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope an update becomes available to remedy this issue and is delivered via email since it's obvious Windows update won't function to receive it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess what I'm saying is, HELP!</p>

<p>Well it was OK. Update worked fine on the 30th but when I booted up today (31st) it is doing it again. My Win 8.1 updates fine but&nbsp;my Win 7 pc's don't. All have the same DSN settings and are using the same router and local cable company connection. Oh well!</p>

<h3> rrtt1313  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#40;KB4040724&#41; update - please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>i hope someone can help me, because apparently the support representative from microsoft wasn't able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had trouble with this latest update (KB4040724) from the get-go. it got stuck at 3% forever. i finally worked my way around that. then i kept getting a message saying that a reboot was required to finish the installation. i did this a handful of times
 ~ including reboot, restart, you name it. it seemed i finally got everything working, as i was logging off, turning system off, etc., it asked if i wanted to update and restart or update and shut down (whatever the wording is). i chose the latter, thinking
 that when i signed on this morning, all would be good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>not so much. the same error is still haunting me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to make matters worse, i contacted the support line, and i worked with someone for over 60 minutes ~ i don't think anything ever takes less time than that. he gave me a link to get everything downloaded and installed properly. he also gave me a link and
 case number in case i needed to rejoin the conversation ~ which turned out to be completely useless, because i kept getting an error message there saying "please try again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>the download went according to plan. but when it came to installing, i got an error that said "windows update stand alone installer" "update for windows (kb4040724) is already installed on this computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and yet... i still have the message "requires a restart to finish installing" ... which of course, i have done a number of times (again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm no further ahead than i was last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any and all assistance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, my situation finally resolved itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i ran the troubleshooter; and then i uninstalled the problem update.&nbsp; for whatever reason, the update just prior to that was uninstalled, too (who knows?!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i re-installed (both) updates, everything seemed to iron itself out.&nbsp; it took quite a long time for both things to happen, but it eventually did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck! i hope things resolve themselves for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm not sure if it helps, but someone mentioned that in a situation like this, a re-boot is better than a full shut down and re-start??</p>

    <title>Displaying Album Art work IN EXPLORER is not working with as much - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fork bomb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Displaying Album Art work IN EXPLORER is not working with as much functionality as in XP&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit - I have my music organized into Artist folders with separate album folders contained within. Each album folder contains the proper files and artwork.</p>
<p>In XP I was able to generate thumbnails for each artist's folder which showed up to 4 album covers contained within-I was able to set this type of viewing attribute at once for the main folder (directory) and all sub-directories.</p>
<p>In Win 7 this functionality has so far escaped me (and others judging by the search results I've seen).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn't a question about Media Pplayer or displaying artwork there, and I've never installed iTunes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the problems as I see it is that generic system icons are shown for some folder views including list, details and small icons - but thumbnail/icon hybrids are displayed for the other views such as medium icons, large icons etc.</p>
<p>I wonder if the mixed use of the term icon followed this limited functionality or if it is actually thought that this inconsistency is of no consequence...</p>
<p>In folder options on the View tab, I have deselected "Always show icons, never thumbnails" and I have tried both selecting and deselecting "Display file icon on thumbnails" without a change in the appearance of these icon/thumbnails (yes there are aspects
 of both).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I go into an artist folder and change the view inside to "medium icon" or larger, then some of the album covers may display as pages/leafs on that particular artist folder, only if the view of that artist's folder is is set to medium or larger "icons"
 - but this is not happening consistently.</p>
<p>I can't imagine needing to set the view in each sub-directory separately so how is this accomplished? Again these all displayed and behaved correctly in XPSP3 with both MP versions 10 &amp; 11 (and earlier)</p>
<p>I would really like to be able to view my collection with the same functionality - it took some time setting this up and verifying all of the proper artwork, etc.... So if some one can answer the question specifically, I would very greatly appreciate it
 and will post that it is the answer/solution</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance</p>
<p>Tony</p>
<p>PS: I've been to the MS website and downloaded the tool for checking out system problems specifically related to folder (directory) display and views and the system is has no identified problems. It's a brand new install with all updates and only a few compatible
 utility programs installed so corruption, etc. can be ruled out-</p>
<p>PPS: I've seen the post below and it is not helpful and even though someone wrongfully marked it as solved - it is not -</p>

<p>Hi Meghmala;<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your reply - it seems that you are making a genuine attempt to understand and offer solutions. But&nbsp;what I have found out is that this is a "feature working as designed" and that this particular issue has been a constant topic since the
 early days of Vista! I would think that most moderators would be at least familiar with this ISSUE WHICH HAS BEEN ONGOING&nbsp;FOR YEARS!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The moderator in the second link you provided explains it as it is being explained in many places, in many ways by MS-<br />
<br />
<strong><em>"the feature you mentioned is by design. If the folder has sub-folders, the folder icon will be displayed as the ones in your screen shot 201. Thank you for your understanding."</em></strong><br />
<br />
Yan also&nbsp;recommended to set up each folder's "icon" separately.. This still does not give the full-face view that was once available and is&nbsp;I've&nbsp;asked about,&nbsp;it still can't provide the multi-cover view that was available with XP.&nbsp; Setting up&nbsp;one folder at a
 time for the skewed folder icon style is far too much time for the ensuing results.<strong>This&nbsp;is very impractical for those with large collections of folders which need this treatment- in any event Win 7 can not maintain a particular folder's view and even
 global view settings are overridden in many cases.<br />
<br />
</strong>The simple graphical functionality has been lost in this OS, which is a refinement of the well-documented inadequacies of Vista - quite a disappointment - Further,<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">this is actually part of a larger set of
 problems with the core functionality of Explorer in windows 7 and Vista before that. &nbsp;Below, I provide the reader with links addressing this specific Win 7 "feature", as well the larger issue of the Explorer "Features" causing so many related problems as users
 are finding out...<br />
</span></em><br />
<strong><em>It is absolutely my own fault being here now&nbsp;with this OS- &nbsp;for not doing better research before the purchase of several licenses of Win 7 - I never used Vista very much, and didn't install because all of the peripheral devices I use are USB (mouse,
 keyboard, printer, sound card, drives). Vista has a well documented and unsolved problem with utilization of USB devices- I've seen several people struggle with that so I didn't know enough about this OS- Again MY fault, there is plenty of info out there about
 this issue, I just didn't know&nbsp;to look...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I was lead to believe that there was increased functionality in windows 7 - that MS had listened to people's concerns and acted accordingly.&nbsp; I have not yet activated and I'm still considering reverting or moving to Apple or Linux - MS perhaps underestimated
 the ability of users to break away - there are many alternatives most cost less.&nbsp; Users who have been around since DOS and early Windows have the know how to move away from MS- this appears to be the final push needed by many to do so. As noted at many places
 (WIKI&nbsp;has a nice graph) XP is still the most widely used OS and even though it no longer sold (except MC2005 OEM) it is used more than the two&nbsp;updated&nbsp;MS systems... COMBINED!<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems</a></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br />
</em></strong>Part of the pleasure of a music collection for me and many users has been the ability to display album art (in the correct orientation), browse collections graphically and the functionality to easily manipulate these features - Windows 7 simply
 lacks that functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also&nbsp;do a good amount of photography - I've not transfered those collections yet and I'm not happy regarding the prospects.-&nbsp;This is a huge step backwards&nbsp;- this view is shared by many.&nbsp; The amount of negative feedback regarding this feature is amazing
 - people have continued to use Window dispite the "new explorer" not because of it - The usage staistics don't lie.<br />
<br />
In the link you provided, one moderator is marking the answer as "the feature you mentioned is by design."&nbsp; This is done even as the original moderator (Yan) is still working to ascertain information and make recommendations.<br />
<br />
Below is an example of a moderator marking their own answer (essentially *that is how it is -here is a feedback link*)&nbsp;&nbsp; as "THE answer"-&nbsp;one day after the post...<br />
<br />
I provide the link mainly because there are actually some helpful posts with work-arounds suggested after the "answer"-<br />

<br />
Also, on sevenforums.com there is a solution provided which uses Image magic: www.imagemagick.org<br />
<br />

<br />
I suggest all users and moderators report such posts when it it is clear that the question or issue has not been solved, and&nbsp;there has been no good faith attempt to show any information that might be helpful.&nbsp; Sure, if it is known to be "a feature"&nbsp;provide
 a working feedback link, but please don't mark that as the answer- without providing some information that could be of assistance!</p>
<p>The power user Trekdozer who provided many helpful suggestions - is on top of the issues discussed in this post-<br />
<br />
Here is another thread that is absolutely relevant to to this larger issue of Explorer functionality (PLEASE DON"T REMOVE THESE LINKS!)&nbsp; more suggestions are provided as well as some instructions as to the functionality of the feedback system should the reader
 wish to provide MS with more feedback regarding this <br />
<br />

<br />
My personal recommendation is that before providing feedback regarding this issue, the reader review the thread below-<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/itprovistadesktopui/thread/b2aff758-8a79-4889-9cc5-e33c88fae664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/itprovistadesktopui/thread/b2aff758-8a79-4889-9cc5-e33c88fae664</a><br />
<br />
The feature that prevents individual folder views to be remembered and which also changes global views even when set to a specific style has been&nbsp; "working as designed" since Vista which also does not display appropriate thumbnails/icons appropriately or consistently-
 If one is forced to use the system it would be helpful if the system could remember global file/folder display views if not individually- MS has been ignoring this particular problem and the larger Explorer issue Since the early days of Vista - it is clear
 there will be no MS fix for the single problem of this thread or for the related and larger non-functionality in Explorer<br />
<br />
Annoyances.org provides a "Default Folder Template Patch" to cause Win Vista and 7 to use a default view consistently -<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/choosetemplate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/choosetemplate</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is an awful decision by MS to reduce Graphic display functionality in their modern GUI (Graphic User Interface).&nbsp; MS&nbsp; ignored the multitudes of comments, complaints and suggestions to restore the strength of the XP GUI-<br />
<br />
Classic Shell is a solution mentioned many times in these forums and the multitude of sites where users lament and try to find solutions.&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/</a>&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 ISO 1511 build 10586</h2>
                    <p>hi;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;updated windows 10 version 1204 to version 1511 build 10586&nbsp;via <strong>clean install</strong> on the 15th November 2015 via usb installer made from the media creation tool&nbsp;made from&nbsp;the Microsoft&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now after going through recent articles it appears that there was some problem with that media creation tool (version 1511) and its link being replaced by&nbsp;link of older version (1204).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>my windows is working o.k; do I have to do anything, like reinstalling windows with older version and then updating to new version via windows update?</p>
<p><strong>currently on my pc following updates are installed&nbsp; : kb&nbsp;3103688; kb 3105211; kb 3118754; kb 3120677.
</strong></p>
<p>and the windows 10 pro 64 bit version shown is&nbsp;1511 &amp; build 10586.14</p>
<p>
</p><p>further if in future I have to make clean install again for some reason; then will my installer&nbsp;usb created from media creation tool of version 1511 holds good?</p>
<p>
</p><p>yours kind guidance is sought on the above subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>with regards</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>Go to Settings&gt;System&gt;About to confirm you have Version 1511.&nbsp; If so you're good to go.&nbsp; If not then wait for it to arrive via Windows Update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The media should be good for repairs, but when ready to reinstall I would create new media to be sure you have the changes included or in case a new version is released in the interim.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you cannot do this then you should be fine with the media you have
 as any changes will be patched via Updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to reinstall of course is to save a <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/how-make-full-backup-windows-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>hi;</p>
<p>thanks for your kind reply.</p>
<p>sorry for my poor English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in my query i stated that my existing windows version is&nbsp;1511 &amp; build 10586.14. (done via clean install through media usb).</p>
<p>
</p><p>you also advised rightly that its better to have system image backup; which in fact i have made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but i raised the query that<strong>&nbsp;IF </strong>in worst case i have to make a clean install via&nbsp;my existing usb media( version 1511) created by me on 15th November 2015 then
<strong>will it still be valid </strong>after its withdrawal from the Microsoft website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and you also advised rightly&nbsp;that its always better to create new media;<strong> but
</strong>since i am on metered connection and downloading of 64 bit media (version 1204 as currently existing on Microsoft website) and downloading November major update will be about 4-5 gb.&nbsp;in data terms and that will cost me in indian currency Rs. 1300/-
 app.&nbsp;(&nbsp;$20 in U.S dollars terms).</p>
<p>
</p><p>to save that money i raised my above query that whether for clean install (if ever needed) then my existing usb media( version 1511) created by me on 15th November 2015&nbsp;<strong>will it&nbsp; still
</strong><strong>be valid ? (</strong>after its withdrawal from the Microsoft website.)</p>

            Yes, you can reinstall with that media, they just pulled the link to it, temporarily. You'll end up with 10586.3 or something.&nbsp;Then just do a windows update to patch it to 10586.14. The link is back up now so if you want, just download a new ISO.

<h2>            Sticky Notes</h2>
                    <p>After feature update 1903 on startup when sticky notes start their taskbar icon is orange (like to notify me something is new).</p>
<p>That's really annoying and i have to click all of them to make it go away.</p>
<p>any fix for that?</p>
<p>sticky notes should be nowhere on the taskbar or tray, they should just be on the right click menu to make a new one.</p>

    <title>Headphones won&#39;t enable and won&#39;t show up as a disabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewshirley_93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphones won&#39;t enable and won&#39;t show up as a disabled device.</h2>
                    <p>So I've this problem since I've bought this laptop. When I am playing a game or just chatting with friends my laptop only uses the built in microphone instead of my headset microphone. I want to both disable the built in laptop microphone and enable my headset
 microphone. I've seen a hand full of tutorials on how to fix this but it none work. I've looked through the "Disabled Devices" and "Disconnected Devices" and&nbsp;my headset still doesn't pop up. It is plugged into the jack in the side of my laptop so it isn't
 USB headset unfortunately. In another tutorial it did say to update the driver for the sound but still nothing. There are only 2 devices in the "Recording" tab which are "Microphone" and "Stereo Mix"; I haven't tested the Stereo Mix yet but both devices are
 labeled as "Realtek High Definition Audio" which made me think they are just the same built in laptop mic but just different settings to them. If you could help I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I am using a Apsire E 15 laptop and currently running windows 10 on it.</p>

            <p>The Realtek High Definition Audio is the sound chip on the motherboard. It is important to have&nbsp;Windows 10 drivers for the laptop motherboard chipset&nbsp;and&nbsp;Windows 10 drivers for the &nbsp;Realtek audio.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pointless to use stereo mix if your headset mic doesn't appear in Recording Devices. It's more for the kind of thing where you want to play or record multiple sound sources at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, the jack in the laptop has to be wired with the same connections as the plug(s) on your headset. The jack wiring might be indicated in&nbsp;Acer's documentation for your laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned only using one jack on the laptop. If the headset has a 4&nbsp;connection&nbsp;plug (2x earphone, 1x ground, 1x mic) the jack in the laptop would have to be wired the same way in order for the microphone to be detected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Left- typical stereo plug, center is a 4 connection plug. The connection at the base is the ground on stereo but is microphone on the 4 way.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5551169d-ce95-4678-8b0d-cdf443bdb923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5551169d-ce95-4678-8b0d-cdf443bdb923" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Commonly&nbsp;a stereo headset will&nbsp;have 2 plugs, a stereo plug for the earphones and a separate&nbsp;plug for the microphone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A mono headset with only one earphone could use a plug&nbsp;similar to a stereo headphone but&nbsp;it would be wired for 2 different&nbsp;connections, one being an input for the ear piece and the other an output for&nbsp;the microphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;jack/audio circuitry&nbsp;on the laptop would have to&nbsp;support simultaneous earphone-microphone connections in order to use that sort of headset.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the jack in your laptop&nbsp;only supports output to headphones. Or&nbsp;it&nbsp;might support automatic switching between either headphones or a microphone connection, depending on which is plugged in,&nbsp;but not both at the same time.</p>

            <p>The only way is if your laptop jack is a 4 connector type. Check in the ACER docs or contact them to find out. If it is you can buy adapters that convert separate headphone and mic plugs into a single 4 connector plug.</p>

<h2>            Mortal Kombat DLC - Kombat Pack purchased</h2>
                    
<p>I am sure I am not the only one that has purchased the Kombat Pack and has not been able to have the "early-bird" DLC available before it is released officially to everyone else.&nbsp; Well, the issue is this - we all paid "extra" for the DLC and expect to be
 "rewarded" with early releases of the DLC (whether, Jason, Tanya, Predator, or Tremor).&nbsp; It is very frustrating to know you have spent the extra money and you still have to wait until after the date of the availability of the DLC.&nbsp; There is no contact or description
 as to why it is happening.&nbsp; Maybe we all should have been notified and then be able to access the DLC.&nbsp; Instead we try to play the game, wait for a HUGE update to be downloaded, and then only to be disappointed when the DLC is still not working or "coming
 soon".&nbsp; There should be a refund of the purchase for the DLC or "ooops we made a mistake, here is ________ for your patience and understanding".&nbsp; Maybe extra koins or unlocks in the game to ease the pain of the frustration.&nbsp; I hope people read this and understand
 the frustration, not just me but everyone has&nbsp;too.&nbsp; I wish either WB Games, the developers, Microsoft, etc. read this and understand the&nbsp;fans, sponsors, gamers, and paying customers are waiting for something to be done.</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt consideration and&nbsp;understanding.</p>

<p>They did come out the week early for everyone that bought the Kombat Pack.... &nbsp; &nbsp;one way to make sure you got them was to go into youre games and apps section go to your MKX game and click the start button and click manage game, there you scroll all the
 way to the right and they would of been over in the right hand corner available for you click on to download, &nbsp;it shows coming soon in the game because it was not available to the general public who were not purchasers of the Kombat Pack. &nbsp; &nbsp; I just dont see
 them issuing a refund though when all three characters so far were delivered the week early as promised, along with the retro fatalities and other costumes/skins.</p>

<h2>            File Sharing</h2>
                    
<p>Hey</p>

<p>I'm trying to set up media sharing from my Windows 7 PC to my Xbox 360. I've set files to share on the Home Group but my console only shows files in the C drive. My movies are on a second HDD (D:).</p>
<p>Is it possible to get files to show from my D: on my console? I'm new to Windows 7, so am a little unfamiliar with the features -- I've upgraded from Windows XP, so I'm a little behind.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>~huzi</p>

<p>The best way to share files is through Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center. &nbsp;I personally set up a library on Windows Media Player and then sync it to my network, which my Xbox 360 is connected to. &nbsp;This way it will play only what is in your library
 and not just the C: folder.</p>

<h2>            iPhone 5 Code 43 Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems</h2>
                    So, just in the past few days windows can't seem to recognize my iPhone when I plug it in via USB, and therefore it will not charge or sync with iTunes. When I open the device manager, it says that the iPhone is an "unknown device", and displays error
 code 43 (windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems). According to my computer, the device has somehow malfunctioned, and now will not work in any USB port on any computer in my house. Furthermore, it has gone so far as to stop being
 able to charge via the wall outlet. I doubt that it is the USB cable causing the problem, but I am extremely frustrated and have gone through many hours attempting to troubleshoot the problem, with no success. Please help.

            <p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand that the windows computer is unable to recognize the iPhone 5 and when you are trying to check in device manager it prompts the error</span>
<span>"unknown device" with error code 43.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This must be due to the issue with hardware or device drivers of the system.</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>error code 43</strong> means that the Device Manager stops a hardware device because the hardware reported to Windows that it is having some kind of unspecified problem.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I need few more information from your end to narrow down the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Which security software is installed?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Are other devices recognized in the USB ports?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to troubleshoot on it, let us try these methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1. </span></strong><span>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the
<strong>usb controllers</strong> to check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To remove and reinstall all USB controllers, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, click Run, type <strong>sysdm.cpl</strong> in the Open box, and then click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the <strong>Hardware</strong> tab. </span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the <strong>Device Manager</strong> Button. </span></p>
<p><span>4. Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>5. Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click Uninstall to remove them one at a time.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. Restart the computer, and then reinstall the USB controllers. </span>
</p>
<p><span>7. Plug in the USB device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2. Run the hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></strong><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>This built-in troubleshooter will try to identify the problem and then resolve the issues. It checks in for common issues related to any installed device</span>
<span>or hardware attached to your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Click <strong>Start</strong> then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>3. Under <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, click <strong>Configure a device</strong> and follow the onscreen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also refer to the below Microsoft&nbsp;help article:</span></p>
