<p>
</p><p>It has been brought to our attention that Skype's website and services have been blocked by the Internet service providers in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is very little that Skype can do about the said situation.&nbsp;Best move would be to contact your local provider and ask why they are blocking Skype. You can find additional details on this FAQ.

    <title>Where have all my hotmail emails gone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s2001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where have all my hotmail emails gone&#63;</h2>
                    I have just signed into my hotmail account via outlook (as this is where I was taken when I typed www.hotmail.com into my browser). I did not ask to be transferred to outlook, though as I understand it all hotmail accounts have now been automatically transferred
 to outlook. I have received a welcome message in my inbox from outlook today and that is the only e-mail in my inbox. All my hotmail e-mails have vanished from inbox, sent, drafts etc. All my contacts are also missing. I need access to my hotmail e-mails and
 contacts. I read through some posts and have tried to restore e-mails from deleted messages folder but it cannot find any. I last logged into my hotmail account on or after the 2nd January 2015, this is a maximum of 207 days ago. As I understand it as long
 as you log in before 270 days have expired you should not lose any data. I believe my e-mails and contacts should have been migrated from my hotmail account but they have not been. Please can you assist to resolve this iss

<h2>            Picture Taken while &#34;ADDING A CONTACT&#34; doesnt sink to live accounts nor saves to phone...Am I losing my mind or have a found an oops.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Nokia Lumia 710. I have had the device for a little over a week.&nbsp; I today decided to start using it for some buiness related needs.</p>
<p>I wanted to get the contact information for some new hires as well as capture their pictures so we can creat their id badges.&nbsp; Here are the steps I took to accomplish this on seven different people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Selected the People Tile</li><li>selected the + icon from the bottom of the screen to add a new contact</li><li>Then selected which account i wanted to create it in</li><li>Next I selected add photo</li><li>then I tapped the camera icon at the bottom of the screen</li><li>camera came up and I snapped the photo.</li><li>It then prompted for acceptance or rejection of the photo. I accepted.</li><li>It then wanted to crop and save.&nbsp; This was also done.</li><li>Then entered the rest of the contact info as normal.</li><li>Saved the contact.</li></ol>
<p>Now here is where i start noticing an issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>when I then looked at my "online" outlook they contacts had synced but not photo.</li><li>Opened Outlook 2010 and let it sync...same result..(NOTE - In outlook it showed 2 seperate address books for the same account on which had&nbsp; "(MOBILE)" at the end of it.....</li><li>Went back to phone in the thought process that I would simply go in and share the photos&nbsp;themselves and do it that way.&nbsp;(NOPE)</li><li>Once in the pictures tile the photos taken of the seven people were nowhere to be found. Not in camera roll, albums, date, or people. NOW IM REALLY GETTING CONFUSED AND IRRITATED AT THIS POINT)</li><li>I go back to the contact and sure enough their photos are staring at me....</li><li>I select the contact and goto edit.</li><li>I select the photo</li><li>It then takes me to choose a photo</li><li>The first thing highlethed is ALBUM and in there it shows a TILE called PROFILE PICTURES (NOT PROFILE PICTURES from Facebook) just profile pictures.&nbsp; The picture being previewed is the one I too
 tile it opens and that picture is the only one in it.</li><li>Now taking this one step further into strange... If i select a picture for the contact that is in one of my albums I can see it drops the first picture never to be found again not even in the editing of the contact....&nbsp; Also when using a photo that was
 confirmed saved on the phone it still did not synce that photo to live.</li></ol>
<p>I have spent 3 hours on the phone with T-Mobile, Nokia, and Microsoft just to be told this is the only way to try and get an answer or fix for what is going on....HELP!&nbsp; All i want to do is use this phone in the way these types of devices are intended....I
 have been staunchly microsoft since DOS but if this is the kind of issues I am going to have to deal with on a Windows based phone I am going to have to goto Google based systems.&nbsp; I already have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and I choose the Windows Phone because
 of it supposed easy compatability with other MS based products such as the Office Suite of applications.</p>

            The photos you add to pictures on a windows phone sync to your windows live account, even though you won't see the pictures there.&nbsp; However, if you sync the data to a different windows phone, the contact info along with the picture will sync to the phone.<br />
<br />
The only way to add a picture to a windows live contact (via the website) and the only pictures you see on windows live contacts are contacts that are also Live Messenger contacts, in which case the contact controls the data that is input to the account including
 the picture.<br />

                    <p>original title: logmein123 scam?</p>
I got a call from someone who knew my last name, knew I had vista and called my unlisted number.&nbsp; He (in a thick indian accent) said he would connect me with someone from Microsoft.&nbsp; He had me go to start, right click on computer and go into the viewer and
 see all the errors.&nbsp; He said my anti virus and other software was corrupted.&nbsp; Then he thought I would under the run command enter www.logmein123.com and then he would connect me with a microsoft tech.&nbsp; I told him no and asked him for his number and name.<br />
His was Austin Stone employee badge 10003 phone number&nbsp;*****Edited***** and he said the techs name was David Alex.&nbsp; what is this? is my computer infected or corrupted?

            <p>support.me &amp; logmein123.com is a very valid tool, the scam has nothing to do with the tools they use. &nbsp;Report malicious support people to logmein (that are using
<em>their</em> tools):</p>
<p><a href="https://secure.logmeinrescue.com/Customer/ReportAbuse.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.logmeinrescue.com/Customer/ReportAbuse.aspx</a></p>
<p><strong>Do not let a cold caller into your computer</strong>. &nbsp;If you have a trusted support person, &amp; you can&nbsp;<strong>see</strong>, touch, and trust them; &nbsp;you may find, they use that good tool&nbsp;<span>(at $1300/seat/yr-unlimited connections).</span>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you have let the scammers into your computer,<strong>&nbsp;write down the code they give you to connect, then hang up</strong>&nbsp;and report it, immediately (use the phone number in the above link(hit support option(2)). &nbsp;That will help stop those scammers
 from using that tech tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not do anything, they tell you to do</strong>, give them any answer you want,
<em>plead ignorance</em>- drive THEM through their script--get the code number and hangup...If you can get the code number, and report them they will be out $1300...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other remote tools scammers use, from other vendors. &nbsp;This suggestion only applies to the aforementioned 'logmein' tools. &nbsp;Other Mfg tools, that are respected vendors, may have abuse hotlines, also; &nbsp;but you may want to just hang up, if the caller
 is using them AND/OR get information on how to report them, from a trusted source, so you are prepared, the next time they call.</p>

    <title>&#34;Do you also want to save changes to the document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zyst_  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Do you also want to save changes to the document template&#63;&#34; Pop Up on Every Save</h2>
                    <p>I am getting this in seemingly random documents. This has happened to a custom template I created many months ago called "Notes.dot" (.dotx?) and also in "Normal.dot", the default template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I've been able to find online is that if you have a malicious addin it could be doing something. Problem is, I haven't installed any add-ins. And I've just now tested by disabling all default add-ins (even though the 4 that were active didn't
 look suspicious).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some documents it gives me the prompt, other times it doesn't. It's just really ugly. As a temporary solution I've made this AutoHotKey code:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">#IfWinActive, ahk_class OpusApp<br />
~^s::<br />
WinWait,,Do you also want to save changes to the document template?, 5<br />
If !ErrorLevel<br />
ControlClick, Button2,,Do you also want to save changes to the document template?<br />
return</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's terrible that I had to use a third party application like that. I hope there is a better solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite saying No to saving the template, I keep getting prompted. If I wanted to save the Template, I'd manually save a template. And from other research online it seems this pop-up is impossible to disable. Everyone frets that you'd get accidental changes
 - why is it not an option to deny making changes to templates unless you explicitly wanted to create a template?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what other possibilities there are to add-ins doing this? Is there actually something I thought would not change a template, like selecting a bullet (because using *+Tab and -+Tab together in the same document just leads to problems...)
 that is being registered as a template change? Clearing a style from pasted text maybe?</p>

            <p>These forums are not the place to suggest product changes. They are peer-to-peer support to get assistance solving or working around problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If something has been done that does change the template you will get this message. Period.</p>
<p>The add-ins causing the problem are not malicious; they simply have not been well written.
<em>(I distinguish between malice and ignorance. Either can cause serious problems, though.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that there may be an option to automatically save changes made to styles to the template but do not know this. Recorded macros are saved by default in the normal template as are formatted AutoCorrect entries. There are a number of processes that
 will make changes to a template while in a document. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The way to verify that it is not Add-Ins is to start Word without Add-Ins using the command-line switch of " /a"
</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/word/addins.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add-Ins in Microsoft Word</a> (around the middle of the page) for more on that switch.</p>

            <p>Alright, so let's ignore any suggestions I may have implied or explicitly stated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I, using Word's built-in existing feature make sure to lock a template from being edited? Surely, there is some way? Or must I rely on digging into my templates and putting write locks on them through file properties?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[quote]I believe that there may be an option to automatically save changes made to styles to the template but do not know this. Recorded macros are saved by default in the normal template as are formatted AutoCorrect entries. There are a number of processes
 that will make changes to a template while in a document. [/quote]</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is such an option to automatically save template changes. But I have no intention, ever, to make a change to this template until I explicitly open up the .dotx file and make a change to it. If I'm working in a .docx file, I do not want to save any
 template changes. As I had stated before, I have found that there are options to automatically save changes. But not to automatically reject, deny, or forbid changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not recorded macros. I do not believe I've changed an AutoCorrect entry -- does adding a word to the dictionary count? If so, that
<em>could</em> be the cause then. Odd that it would save to a template and not an actual dictionary though. However I've added dictionary entries into Word for years and never had this prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other things that I as a user might have done to prompt a change in the template?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my add-ins are the problem, why is Microsoft distributing default add-ins that are not well written? Here were the add-ins that might've been enabled (4 were enabled, I can't remember which of these 5 weren't):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Date (XML)</p>
<p>2) Instant Messaging Contacts (English)</p>
<p>3) Measurement Converter (Measurement Converter)</p>
<p>4) Telephone Number</p>
<p>5) Time</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of them were found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Smart Tag</p>
<p>
</p><p>If those are indeed default add-ins, can anyone verify that they are not giving me any problems with template-saving prompts?</p>

Not all Add-ins are distributed by Microsoft. Most are not.

            <p>Beginning with /a is hard to diagnose. Sure, I don't have the problem right now. But I also don't have the problem without using it in my testing today. I opened up one of the .docx files that was prompting me to save the .dotx file on both save and on close,
 made a few text changes, and did not get the pop up asking me to save the template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only had this problem for maybe 4 days so far this year (and I do not recall having this problem at all before 2015, with the only two templates I use - Notes and Normal - having been around in 2014..). There is no particular thing that catches my
 attention as modifying the template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said in the first post, it's unreliable when this problem comes up. It'd be a great inconvenience to try to launch MS Word using the /a command at all times. However, I have already disabled all add-ins. So that should be the same as a /a, right?
 If not, I'll go tweak on the file property for Word.exe or whatever and see about adding in the parameter so I don't have to manually type out in the Run window the .exe's address and the parameter..<br />
</p>
<p>I made this change to the shortcut, can you verify this is what I need to use? I'm rather inexperienced with command-line parameters and can never seem to nail the syntax on the first try...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Target: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\WINWORD.EXE" --/a</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Not all Add-ins are distributed by Microsoft. Most are not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(OK, really, how do I add a quote on here?&nbsp; I see there is a "Reply with quote" setting, but trying to click it I get a "Forbidden Cursor" which tells me it's not an option right now. Which I guess is because I have already opened a reply and they're looking
 to avoid confusion by losing post content by clicking on the Reply buttons a second time..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have only installed MS Word, and never have I gone out of my way to install an add-in for any Office program, why would I ever have an add-in not coming from MS? My current add-ons were bundled with MSO from what I can tell, unless someone can correct
 me otherwise as to why those 4 active add-ons (well, before I inactivated them) could have been added to my copy of MS Office. I will say I got it through MS's education promotion or whatever where students can get free licenses through affiliated schools
 so long as they are a student. If it is known that that education bundle has problematic add-ins, then we have an even more likely diagnosis.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is intended as a diagnostic, not as the way to run Word, although if you are not using any addins, it should work the same. The thing is, actually disabling all Add-Ins manually is not easy. There are at least two different dialogs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need the -- in the command line switch. I have no idea what it will do.</p>

<p>&gt;Not all Add-ins are distributed by Microsoft. Most are not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(OK, really, how do I add a quote on here?&nbsp; I see there is a "Reply with quote" setting, but trying to click it I get a "Forbidden Cursor" which tells me it's not an option right now. Which I guess is because I have already opened a reply and they're looking
 to avoid confusion by losing post content by clicking on the Reply buttons a second time..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have only installed MS Word, and never have I gone out of my way to install an add-in for any Office program, why would I ever have an add-in not coming from MS? My current add-ons were bundled with MSO from what I can tell, unless someone can correct
 me otherwise as to why those 4 active add-ons (well, before I inactivated them) could have been added to my copy of MS Office. I will say I got it through MS's education promotion or whatever where students can get free licenses through affiliated schools
 so long as they are a student. If it is known that that education bundle has problematic add-ins, then we have an even more likely diagnosis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Many non-Microsoft programs install Add-Ins without ever asking or notifying you. Many computers come with them installed by the computer manufacturer. Adobe Acrobat installes Add-Ins. One "Send to bluetooth" has been noted to cause problems. They are often
 intended to give you additional commands in Word to use their program or to let their program better integrate with Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/download.htm#AddIns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
downloads page</a> you will find a number of Add-Ins, none of which is sophisticated enough to cause this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read my page on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/word/addins.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add-Ins in Microsoft Word</a>. It should help. There are two different kinds of Add-Ins and they can be stored in multiple locations. If the /a diagnostic stops the
 problem, the next step is to determine which of the Add-Ins you want to leave active and if one you want to have active is causing the problem, you need to contact the manufacturer and see if you can get them to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a volunteer, your fellow user. I'm sorry, but until you tell me you have this problem with the /a switch I am not willing to spend the time trying to figure out what else might be causing the problem. That is because I feel it would be a waste of my
 time and not help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am not the only volunteer who answers questions here. Nor am I the most knowledgeable. Perhaps someone else will have more to suggest.</p>

            <p>OK, I am likely mistaken about Add-Ins being the cause. I no of no reason that you would use any of these Add-Ins.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The normal template is always running in the background. For any document that does not have a different attached template it is the attached template. It is always available for storage / changes.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The attached template may be yet another template that is directly attached to the document. Your notes template is likely such a template.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your normal template should be normal.dotm, not normal.dot. If there is a normal.dot template it suggests that your installation is an upgrade from Word 2003 or earlier. Try renaming any normal.dot / normal.dotm templates to normalold.dot and normalold.dotm.
 You would do this renaming with Word closed.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://addbalance.com/word/normaltemplate.htm#Find" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Normal Template in Microsoft Word - How to Find or Open the Normal Template</a>
<br />
</p>
<p>Word will automatically create a new normal.dotm template next time you open Word. If, that time, you are asked if you want to save changes to the template, the answer should be "yes."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If there are resources in your normal templates like macros or styles that you want to preserve, write back and I'll help you do that, later. Let's see if this fixes the problem first. If not, you can delete the newly created normal template and restore
 the name of normalold.dotm.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So back to your original questions....<br />
</p>
What can cause changes to the template (document template and/or normal template)?
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am getting this in seemingly random documents. This has happened to a custom template I created many months ago called "Notes.dot" (.dotx?) and also in "Normal.dot", the default template.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only thing I've been able to find online is that if you have a malicious addin it could be doing something. Problem is, I haven't installed any add-ins. And I've just now tested by disabling all default add-ins (even though the 4 that were active didn't
 look suspicious).<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">***<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what other possibilities there are to add-ins doing this? Is there actually something I thought would not change a template, like selecting a bullet (because using *+Tab and -+Tab together in the same document just leads to problems...)
 that is being registered as a template change? Clearing a style from pasted text maybe?<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Bullets are connected to numbering (bullet) lists. A change to such a list can be saved to the attached template. Do you have AutoFormat as you Type turned on for bullets? I generally keep these options turned off (the bottom two sections).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46f9f4f8-bdc7-4916-8bf1-7f9dc9b62e7b" /><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I prefer to use deliberate bullets and numbering.</p>

<h2>            One Note app for iPad shuts down frequently</h2>
                    I have used One Note on my iPad for years. Recently, say the last month or so, it won’t stay open longer than a couple of minutes. This is very frustrating. I wasn’t even able to give “feedback” from the Settings in the One Note app itself, because it
 kept shutting down. No other apps on my iPad have this issue. I use the One Note iPad app mostly as my recipe book, and I cannot use it at this time because it will not stay open. Is this a common problem?

<p>More Information: A couple of minutes after opening One Note on the iPad, it suddenly goes black for a moment, then goes immediately to the home screen. It will still show as open on the apps screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Syncing isn’t normally a problem, although the past couple of days I’ve noticed it hasn’t synced new pages. I tried signing out and back in, and rebooted the iPad. No help.</p>

    <title>unable to install office 2010 in windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            unable to install office 2010 in windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought Toshiba Satelite 2 days ago and the OS is Windows 8. I was able to setup the wireles and I bought a Microsoft Office 2010 CD installation from the school that I work (licence for faculty and student --- so it is legit). After I put the CD on DVD
 place in the laptop, then I click on my folder and try to search My computer and I click on the DVD place.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was weird that it asked to insert the CD and I did, then the laptop started to downloading (the "looked like" address bar started to be green). I was waiting for 10-15 minutes and didn't do anything. So I cancel the disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to install McAfee 8.7 antivirus and it did the same, it did NOT do anything. It was 3 hours well spent trying to figure out this thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please let me know what driver I have to install in order for office 2010 to be installed?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft community and We will be glad to assist you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, I understand that you are trying to install Office 2010 on Windows 8. Let me go ahead and find a way to help you install Office 2010.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, I need more details:</p>
<p>Are you able to view the content of the Office 2010 installation media by accessing the DVD drive from Computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, you may copy the content of the media to a folder on a local drive and then run the setup from the saved location using the product key to install it.</p>
<p>If still unable to install Office 2010, then you may use the product key to download Office 2010 from the following location and then try to install:</p>

            Please describe how you are attempting to bluetooth files from one device to another....What types of files do you wish to send via bluetooth?
<br />
<br />
To send files via bluetooth, you need to create a bluetooth partnership between each device and then go to the file you want to send and BEAM the file to the other device.&nbsp; The BEAM option is sometimes found on a menu and other times, like when using File Explorer,
 is found by tapping &amp; holding the stylus on the file you wish to send (a popup menu appears).<br />

Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
From your description, I understand that you're receiving notification about lapsed Office trial subscription.<br />
<br />
This is due to the email account associated with the trial subscription. Installation of Office 365 University cannot be identified by the email account linked with trial subscription.<br />
<br />
You may ignore it as you've already installed the Office suite.<br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. Reply if you need more help and I'll be happy to further assist you.<br />

<p>I still have a couple of issues in trying to run an Access database developed on a 64bit platform to be deployed on a 32bit platform.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Looks like I will need to downgrade the database and recompile.</p>

<h2>            If I take some time to write an e-mail, when I send the e-mail not all of the final message is sent.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>A couple of times I've constructed some long e-mails.&nbsp; When I've then gone to send these only half of the message has been sent.
</p>
<p>In Hotmail it used to automatically save as a draft and would then be sent fine when I had finished.&nbsp; It doesn't automatically save as a draft&nbsp;in Outlook.com.&nbsp; Do I have to manually do this?&nbsp; This can be quite frustrating and seem quite unusual to the receiver
 of the e-mail!</p>
<p>Many thanks. </p>

            <p>Hi ALaidlaw,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We apologize for not able to reply in a timely manner. We understand that when you are ready to send a draft message, only half of the entire message got sent. In this case, we would like to ask a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried using another browser/PC just to check if the same issue will occur?
</li><li>Does issue occurs only when you become idle then continued to compose and send the message?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the meantime, please try to recreate the issue by generating a long message. First copy/paste the long email message then, without delay,&nbsp;send it to your own email account. Then, send the same email, but this time, do some delay in order&nbsp;for the auto
 save to kick in. Once it kicked in, continue to complete the email then send it to your own email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please update us through this thread as to what the outcome of test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> heartbreakkid182  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 Not Recognized by Windows 10 and Windows 7 PCs</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, a few months ago my PCs (Windows 10) and my work PC (Windows 7) stopped recognizing my Lumia 950.</p>
<p>The phone correctly charges, when connected to PCs.</p>
<p>Using another USB cable and factory-resetting the Lumia didn't help.</p>
<p>The Windows 7 PC is also not able to recognize another phone, a&nbsp;Lumia 650.</p>
<p>I also tried with some tips found on the Community, but didn't manage to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Under "Device Manager" the Lumia seems not to appear, when connected.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Hello Mario,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would like to know the reason why the PCs are unable to recognize your phone. To better look into this, are you using the USB cable that came with the phone? Have you tried connecting it to different USB ports?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you try connecting the phone to the PC using a USB and then perform a
<strong>soft</strong> <strong>reset</strong>. This will refresh the phone and will not remove any files. To do this, press and hold the
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> <strong>
button</strong> at the same time until the phone vibrates and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Michael, thank you for your answer!</p>
<p>Yes, I'm using the cable that came with the phone, which initially worked for some months.</p>
<p>Now I'm not able to connect the phone with any USB port, and I also tried a different cable, which didn't work.</p>
<p>As you suggested, I tried the procedure to soft-reset the phone, but holding Vol. Down and Power leads me to the feedback page, instead of resetting the device.</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again!</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to us. To perform a soft reset correctly, kindly press and hold the
<strong>power </strong>and <strong>volume down</strong> buttons at the same time. Wait to release the buttons until you feel the second vibration 10 to 15 seconds later. By the way, were you able to connect other devices on your PC?

<p>Hi Joe, thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>No, the usual tone is not produced by the PC when I connect the Lumia, but I hear the tone on the Lumia (which correctly starts charging).</p>
<p>Moreover, no USB devices connected according to the taskbar.</p>
<p>Here are the screenshots you requested (sorry for Italian).</p>

</p><p>Please note that "ASUS-ANTONELLA" is another PC, while "MediaAccess…" is my modem.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help!</p>
