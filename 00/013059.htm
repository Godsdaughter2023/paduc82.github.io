    <title>Outlook 2016 search - Not working when searching All Mailboxes or All - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 search - Not working when searching All Mailboxes or All Outlook Items</h2>
                    <p>After switching computers with a local MSFT Store handling the imaging of my old computer and transferring to a new one, I noticed some issues with Search in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; The problem is while it seems to find items immediately when searching in Current
 Folder, Subfolders, or Current Mailbox options, it just hangs when I select all Mailboxes or All Outlook Items.&nbsp; I mean it just says "searching..." and below that "Find more on the server".&nbsp; It used to instantly bring up matches.&nbsp; Even clicking the Find More
 does not do anything. I have 4 Exchange accounts being managed within one prodile so I need to be able to use those options when they search options were selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already deleted and rebuilt the search index and nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on the issue or how I can fix it?</p>

<h2>            unable to print office 2010 documents after upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Window 10 pro from windows 7 pro. After upgrading I am unable to print any of the office 2010 documents such as word and excel on my HP Laserjet 1018. It says unable to connect with a red x mark on the printer name. However, with
 the same setup I am able to print from a pdf file and also from a jpeg or similar files. Hence I tend not to suspect printer driver problem. This problem has started only after upgrading to windows10.

<h3> heidifrye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I sync Outlook for Mac calendar with a google&#47;gmail calendar&#63;</h2>
                    Just converted from a PC to a MAC and installed Outlook for Mac. &nbsp;I use Google Apps for my domain - so email goes through the google/gmail server and reflects business name. &nbsp;After installation I couldn't get email working. &nbsp;Genius nephew changed some
 settings and Voila! emails were no longer getting stuck in Outbox. &nbsp;However...... &nbsp;we cannot get the Outlook calendars or any other Outlook (notes, task, etc) to sync with the google/gmail account. &nbsp;He saw something on a forum that said it was impossible....WHAT???
 &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;It seems improbable that I would buy Outlook for Mac and the big hold-up would be my gmail/google account. &nbsp;Any ideas????

    <title>Radio buttons reversed display in Edge on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swadeworx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Radio buttons reversed display in Edge on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>We are testing our applications in Edge running on Windows 10. We noticed on some of our applications radio buttons, when checked, display reversed. So, instead of the normal display of the black (or color) dot displaying centered on a field of white, the
 radio button displays a white dot centered in a field of black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the code and CSS and found nothing that seems to be causing this behavior. It does not happen in other browsers running on Win10 or in IE11 running on Win7 with Emulation set to Edge.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40f29751-621c-4621-92a7-184749af7192" /></p>

<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">I need help, and hope some one can give me some action steps to take on a very frustrating issue.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">As I examine the titles and the senders' names of new messages in my INBOX, I put a check-mark into the boxes for the messages&nbsp; I want to delete.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, when I have 10 or 15 such check-marked messages, I go to the top of&nbsp; the Hotmail
 Inbox page, and click DELETE, to delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">In about <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">half
</span>of the boxes with check-marks.......the check-marks&nbsp; disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The messages remain in the Inbox&nbsp; and are NOT deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Inbox is growing exponentially......</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">This bizarre situation has been going on now for&nbsp; a couple weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">What action should I take, so that messages selected for deletion ARE deleted ?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Is there some kind of "reset" ?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">When it happens, I always log-out, log back in .....but Hotmail continues to behave&nbsp; in exactly the same way....not deleting messages to-be-deleted.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">I have also tried closing Hotmail and al other apps that are active in my Mozilla Firefox browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; And closing the browser and then opening it again.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">That DOESN'T fix the problem.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Anyone got any ideas ?</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Oh - and many times I'll get a message at the top of the page:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Outlook wasn't able to complete this request"&nbsp;&nbsp; And the CLOSE button is there - which I click and close Hotmail.&nbsp; And then I open Hotmail again.&nbsp;&nbsp; And have the same
 inability to delete messages ....... + I'll get that same: &nbsp; "Outlook wasn't able to ....."&nbsp;&nbsp; message.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm in some kind of a loop and can't bust thru it.</p>

            <p>I have an issue very similar to this. &nbsp;I had to change my password recently due to someone logging into my account, and once I changed my password, it seems like I had a billion e-mails. &nbsp;I have been deleting as many as I can daily, however, this begins
 to be a pain after a while. &nbsp;I still have 80,000+ emails I am attempting to delete from my "deleted" folder, and every time I click the "empty" option to delete all the emails in that folder, a message pops up saying "Microsoft could not connect to the server.
 Please close or refresh your browser" needless to say, it doesn't work. &nbsp;Please help, again there's 80,000 in my deleted folder, and 1,300+ in my inbox. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 crashes in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 crashes in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I can get some help from you regarding this very annoying problem. Ever since I upgraded from windows 7 pro to windows 10, outlook 2013 has been crashing at least 4-5 times per day. I thought it was an issue with windows 10 being upgraded from
 7, so I formatted and installed windows 10 clean. The problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to open Outlook 2013, and work with it but after a while it will hang and stop responding. The account on it is linked by an exchange connection to office 2013 mail. I have looked in the event viewer and get the following error 1002 in the windows
 applications section:</p>
<p>
The program outlook.exe version 15.0.4745.1000 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed. To see if more information about the problem is available, check the problem history in the Security and Maintenance control panel.<br />
&nbsp;Process ID: 20b4<br />
&nbsp;Start Time: 01d0e64e38820482<br />
&nbsp;Termination Time: 98<br />
&nbsp;Application Path: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\outlook.exe<br />
&nbsp;Report Id: 01a88a93-526e-11e5-9bd1-083e8e68bf28<br />
&nbsp;Faulting package full name:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Faulting package-relative application ID:&nbsp;<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried looking in the security and maintenance control panel but could not find anything useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said above, once the program hangs and becomes unresponsive, I restart it and everythign is fine until the next time it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem does happen in safe mode also, so it is not an add-in causing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Also very strange, my outgoing messages will get "stuck" in the outbox for some time before the program hangs. Then once restarted, the emails go out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you have any ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

Think I fixed it.</p>
<p>
I had an archive folder (pst) that was on a network share. It has been 24 hours since I removed it and it has not hung since.</p>
<p>

<p>
Hope this helps anyone having this issue</p>

                    Hi,I have read at one website that when battery power is too low then to make call we can activate reverse battery function.By that battery power increases to 50%.In next charging this reverse battery also get charged.The no is given as *#3370#. In my
 phone N82 its not working.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have checked it on many phones but it does not work.As no must be wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />

            this was claimed to be a hidden menu code that activated reserve batter power or enahnaced call quality on some very old models. such code does not work any more on new phones, and i haven't seen it work in the first place.

            Ok thanks friend.<br />
<br />
But nokia should activate this facility in new phones as it is very much useful in emergency when battery power is too less to call.

            If there isn't enough power in the battery to make a call then changing the audio codec to a lower quality isn't going to make a difference.<br />
<br />
The whole thing was pure nonsense anyway. It didn't make any significant difference to power consumption because the main drain of power when making a call is the RF transmitter.

    <title>How to DISABLE Incorrect Security Certificate warning in Outlook 365 - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellenfountain  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to DISABLE Incorrect Security Certificate warning in Outlook 365 - Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I recently (about a week ago) upgraded my OS from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 8.1, and also upgraded to Outlook 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Every time I open Outlook, I get a pop up warning about an incorrect security certificate</strong> for my webhosting company, through which I get most of my email (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). It asks if I want to continue using this server, and if I
 click YES, I can continue on and send/receive email. If I click NO when this pop up warning appears, I can't connect to the server at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been back and forth for a week with my webhosting company - My website is on a shared server. The certificate is issued to:</p>
<p>*.websitehostserver.net, and they initially told me to change my incoming/outgoing IMAP mail server settings to that name, but when I do, I can receive mail, but not send any. I have put their server in my trusted sites, and that made no difference. They
 have had me run tracerts and telnets and other stuff I don't know anything about and nothing works to get rid of the security certificate warning and still be able to send/receive/sync email with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can both send/receive email using *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and have it sync with my iPhone is to have my incoming/outgoing mail servers set to: mail.fountainstudio.com, but using these settings I get the annoying incorrect security certificate
 warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wits end with this. I am not a techie. I just want to TURN OFF this security certificate warning box. It is VERY ANNOYING and an extra step to click it off every time I check email. Is there no way to disable this warning in Outlook?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would REALLY like a solution to how to disable or eliminate this pop up warning. I have been all over the internet and spent a week with my webhosting company with no luck. I am really hoping someone at Microsoft can tell me how to eliminate this pop up
 warning box.</p>

            <p>The only way to eliminate it is to use the SMTP address that is assigned to the certificate.&nbsp; If your smtp settings are correct, the smtp server provided by your webhost should work just fine. What exactly happens when you try to use their smtp address?
 &nbsp;Do you get any send and receive error messages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to use their smtp, the security dialog should only come up once a session - if it comes up more often, set the automatic send and receive setting to check every&nbsp;8 minutes. This should keep you authenticated to the server as authentication
 is usually good&nbsp;for 10 minutes. </p>

            <p>I can't use the exact SMTP address assigned to the certificate (either *.websitehostserver.net or websitehostserver.net. Trying either of those results in this error: The host......cannot be found. Verify that the server name is typed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My webhosting company provides these directions for settings that should work with outlook:</p>
<p>Outgoing/incoming mail server: server2.websitehostserver.net, with SMTP port of 465, and IMAP port of 993. They say to turn on SMTP Authentication and Enable SSL, but when I use these settings, I am not able to connect to the server. I get a timed out error,
 no matter where I put the slider in the settings. And even if I were able to connect with these settings, the incoming/outgoing mail server name STILL doesn't match what is on their security certificate, so that would not solve my problem of this annoying
 pop up box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't there SOME WAY in windows to tell that box not to appear? Rename or delete that file somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a matter of not "wanting" to use my webhosting company's settings, it's a matter of them not working. I have an iPhone and want to be able to sync/check email whether I'm at home on the computer or out. I like Outlook for this as I have several
 email addresses. I know I'm not the only person with this problem, which started when I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and Outlook 365. So, SOMETHING changed with this upgrade. There just has to be solution, and "living with" an annoying pop up box isn't really the
 solution I was after.</p>

<p>Answering an old post I know but I came across this issue the other day whilst setting up a new IMAP email account with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some details re IMAP email account:- </p>
<ul>
<li>https domain is hosted on a shared server with a web hosting provider<br />
</li><li>Logged into the web host via cPanel and created the new IMAP email account</li><li>Opened Outlook, clicked Add Account and entered email username and password<br />
</li><li>Allowed Outlook to create the account automatically (FWIW I normally manually setup email accounts)<br />
</li><li>Clicked Yes to the certificate warning thinking this would be a once off operation</li></ul>
<p>Afterwards I continually received the certificate warning and so a web search of the issue was made and I found my way here.</p>
<p>I too also looked at editing the Registry as per the link within this thread however thought to myself, why edit the Registry when the alert is an advisory warning?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The warning, to me, was a hint that the email account settings were not quite right. Another hint was that I'd allowed Outlook to auto-configure the settings for this particular account and not used the settings as provided by my web host for email setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in the end the fix was to:-</p>
<ul>
<li>In Account Settings/More settings/Advanced tab, ensured that the IMAP and SMTP ports were correct. IMAP 993 and SMTP 465<br />
</li><li>In Account Settings/More Settings/Advanced tab, ensured that the encryption was correct. In my case set to SSL/TLS</li><li>REMOVED the word "mail" and the "full stop" from the front of the domain name used for incoming and outgoing server settings, i.e. instead of
<strong>mail.example.com</strong> it needed to be just <strong>example.com </strong>
as per my web host settings for IMAP (incoming mail server) and SMTP (outgoing mail server).<br />
</li></ul>
<p>I've not had the warning popup at all since. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Posted here with the express desire to help or assist other users :-)</p>

    <title>COMPUTER STOPPED WORKING - WAS SOLD &#36;150 MICROSOFT ASSURE PLAN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melissamize  say:</h3>
<h2>            COMPUTER STOPPED WORKING - WAS SOLD &#36;150 MICROSOFT ASSURE PLAN &#40;AND &#36;150 TREND MICRO&#41; - - is this a SCAM &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>MICROSOFT ASSURE PLAN - A SCAM??</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I too purchased this plan, and my credit card called me immediately saying it was being billed outside of the United States, saying Microsoft was an American company within American borders. They were calling to ask me to be sure this was the REAL
 Microsoft company. I said I felt like it, but now questioned it, seeing this was the only time my credit card company ever called me, interrupting a sale, being flagged by them as a SCAM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I went ahead of the transaction, over the next year. Then I paid again for a second year. But although I had some doubts, was confused as I called the real Microsoft in America, who only found this online... warning on internet search 'it could be
 a SCAM'. So they said they felt they may be recommending the Microsoft Assure Plan and selling it as a product not theirs. And this company talked me in to purchasing another program called TREND MICRO MAXIMUM SECURITY as an anti virus program. When you call
 the Microsoft program, they even recommend it, but say it is not "theirs" but what they recommend and what they are selling right now. That raised a red flag with me too. Why would they sell a product not theirs?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Late last year, a man called me (all heavy accents) saying I was on a list for this program, and if I did not pay I would immediately get several viruses on my computer, as my subscription ran out. I record all my calls and warned whoever this is,
 he was committing a crime in attempts to threaten me to give him money, or else attack my computer (or lie with that threat). I told him not to call me again. Then several months later, someone again with a heavy accent called my home demanding money, saying
 they were Microsoft for the same thing. I laughed and said I already reported them to the police, and told them it was illegal for them to call me as we are on the NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY, and DO NOT CALL LIST for our state.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The man got mad and said he refused to stop calling me as I said he was a SCAMMER. I said it is true, he is a scammer if he is demanding money "or else he would put my computer email on a list in order to intentionally get viruses." He then called
 me 5 times in the hour. I recorded the calls and called police. The police man laughed at the man, saying HE WAS A SCAMMER, and put it in his report in the event I should get my identity stolen.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Then in Dec. 2015, I was having problems with my computer. I called the same tech support line, but this man demanded $150 from me saying my outlook email was out of date, and they did not support that anymore. I told him that is not why I was calling,
 I paid $150 for the support program, and $150 for Trend Micro which was only causing problems with my computer - and tempted to REMOVE. So he was not going to get a dime more from me. I just needed him to do his job of removing spyware, malware, viruses etc.
 on my computer, which I already paid for a 1 year subscription. He said he refused since my outlook was not updated, and likely causing problems. I hung up on him and called again getting a nice young woman (all heavy non-American accents).
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>She was helpful and&nbsp;said I had over 800 viruses on my computer, and laughed at me. I said she was laughing at&nbsp;their product they sold me, the&nbsp;lousy Trend Micro they sold me that did not help. Of course, the reply was they can not protect from all
 viruses. I said I had been helped 3 weeks earlier, cleaning up my computer with them. So apparently if at that time they removed over 1,800 items off my computer, and 3 weeks later there was 800 more, then what they sold me is not removing anything - not a
 single thing, instead of the line they feed you (can't protect from ALL, should be changed to can't protect from ANY.)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The "Assure Plan" did work and clean up my computer, better than two American big box store computer places I took my computer to (which deleted my photos and everything was lost on my computer). But who do we believe, when people write in saying
 this is a scam, then others write in saying it is a real Microsoft service?? And then I get phone calls demanding money for hostage, in exchange for NOT releasing my email to intentionally receive more viruses, malware, spyware, etc.?
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Coincidence?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don't know if any of these are related to Microsoft, or how the scam man got my name, phone number, and email address (twice). But I really question it all now, when my computer is not working. Could this be some country looking for not only personal
 info, but government secrets, like what Hillary Clinton found out sending her government server to a private company to manage? These people take over your computer from a remote location.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I found out the real Microsoft was recommending this, but did not know anything about it, and when they 'googled it' found the words SCAM related to it. So what do we believe when Microsoft does not know what their employees are recommending?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>AND SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE US THE REAL MICROSOFT CUSTOMER SERVICE TELEPHONE NUMBER? I called a local store who got it from their geek squad. They said they too sold the support, but did not know anything about it. When they googled it, they were the
 ones who were shocked, seeing the words "scam" attached (many times over). This was the real Microsoft, per the local computer sales store. So Microsoft was selling something, that my credit card company "red flagged" as a scam, and I only later found out
 others question is a possible 'scam'. Who do we trust, when the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>thank you for your much needed help!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have Windows 7 that was upgraded to Windows 10 by a tech support rep from this shady company, Microsoft or not.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>P.S. - If this is real Microsoft, why don't you hire Americans who speak clear English? Another 'red flag' as I can not understand half of what these people are saying. I have been given 4 different countries, where they say I am calling at the same
 telephone number. Why outsource to non-Americans? So many of our countries tax paying Americans&nbsp; - and especially American military Veterans would want these jobs... IF this is the real Microsoft (which M.S. told me they 'recommended' and sold this program,
 but did not know anything about, learning online with me on the phone "the Microsoft Assure Plan is listed online as a SCAM, although M.S. sells this service.")<br />

            <p>Hi Melissa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is really unfortunate that you have had such experience. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Cybercriminals often use the names of well-known companies, like ours, in their scams. They think it will convince you to give them money or your personal information. While they usually use email to trick you, they sometimes use the telephone, instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Common scams that use the Microsoft name </strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Someone from "Microsoft Tech Support" calls to fix your computer</p>
</li><li>
<p>"You have won the Microsoft Lottery"</p>
</li><li>
<p>Microsoft "requires credit card information to validate your copy of Windows"</p>
</li><li>
<p>"Microsoft" sends unsolicited email messages with attached security updates</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Avoid these dangerous hoaxes:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not send unsolicited email messages or make unsolicited phone calls to request personal or financial information or fix your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive an unsolicited email message or phone call that purports to be from Microsoft and requests that you send personal information or click links,
<strong>delete the message or hang up the phone</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft does not make unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this scam cybercriminals call you and claim to be from Microsoft Tech Support. They offer to help solve your computer problems. Once the crooks have gained your trust, they attempt to steal from you and damage your computer with malicious software including
 viruses and spyware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although law enforcement can trace phone numbers, perpetrators often use pay phones, disposable cellular phones, or stolen cellular phone numbers. It's better to avoid being conned rather than try to repair the damage afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Treat all unsolicited phone calls with skepticism. Do not provide any personal information.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive an unsolicited call from someone claiming to be from Microsoft Tech Support, hang up. We do not make these kinds of calls.</p>

</p><p><strong>You have not won the "Microsoft Lottery" </strong></p>

</p><p>Microsoft customers are often targets of a scam that uses email messages to falsely promise money. Victims receive messages claiming "You have won the Microsoft Lottery!"

<h2>            Incoming Skype calls rejected virtually immediately</h2>
                    On Windows 10, using Skype.&nbsp; I can call (skype) others just fine, it all connects, no problem.&nbsp; But when someone calls me, it flashes at the top of the screen and then immediately says I've missed a call, like it's rejected it.&nbsp; I have everything turned
 on related to calls (ie from anyone).&nbsp; It feels like it's a setting, but I can't find it and it's driving me insane!&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp;

                    I created a second outlook email account to recover a software program from a storage server account that I couldn't remember any of my login entries &nbsp; or find the info in any of my info logs.I bought another software &nbsp;program that a remote assist tech
 installed lt for me and didn't give me the license key info which has an embedded purchase link to that email account.He suggested not trying &nbsp;to move it to my original outrlook account.The new account is &nbsp;no use except to store details of the software purchase.It
 doesn't receive any messages,but was blocking some of my original account &nbsp;messages by simulating &nbsp;a default email account for a week or so.Is there any way to merge &nbsp;it with my old account or enter it as a new folder.?

 been able to determine.I don't need or want 2 inboxes.I want one that I can click 1 box that puts a check in all the rest, then click on the trash can logo and clear my inbox of everything that's left.I've been having trouble with this version of outlook to
 consistantly perform this function with either inbox list.It sometimes takes several tries for it to work properly.The version I had on 8.1 was designed and worked perfectly.I upgraded from 8.1 to 10 on my Dell laptop but didn't like that early version of
 10's outlook because I had to delete my leftovers 1 at a time which sucked so I went back to 8.1.My T420 came with windows 10 installed.The email it had on it then was fine, then one day after installing some updates this new version app

            Hello Purnima,
<br /> See the following video which describe a possible solution for the problem when installing Mendeley word plugin in Word 2016. The video is in Spanish, I am giving you the link any way for you to have a graphic idea about what to do. In short there is some tips described on the video that you can find below:
<br />
<br />1-Make sure Word is not open as you install Mendeley Plugin.
<br />2-If after installing the plug in you are not able to see it, you need enable it from File\Options\Add-ins
<br />

<h2>            Protected Mode never successfully opens</h2>
                    When office (excel, ppt, word) attempts to open a document in protected view, it never gets past the splash screen.&nbsp; There is no error message, and the application does not crash, it just displays "opening in protected view" forever.&nbsp; The documents can
 be opened normally by disabling protected view.<br />
<br />
What has caused this?&nbsp; How can I fix protected view?<br />

            None of those steps were effective.&nbsp; Also, "Disable Hardware Acceleration" is not located in the "Display" section in the File &gt; Options window, it is found in the "Advanced" section under a heading labeled "Display."<br />
<br />
I repaired the installation and restarted the computer, but protected mode still fails to start, even in safe mode.&nbsp; There is no error, nor does the program become unresponsive, I just see the splash screen forever.<br />

            A lot of people are having problems like this.<br />
<br />
Protected view creates a <b>copy </b>of the presentation and opens it in a sandbox to protect you.<br />
<br />
Seems on some PC's creating the copy is a problem.<br />
<br />
If you download the file from the email onto the desktop and right click &gt;&gt; properties<br />
<br />
You may see a box called "Unblock"<br />
<br />
Click that and then open see if that helps<br />

<h2>            Word Numbered Lists - Continue Numbering Does Nothing</h2>
                    <p>I use Word 2013 for work. &nbsp;We have a macro that inserts form paragraphs and numbers the paragraphs using Word's numbering list function. &nbsp;Paragraphs are automatically numbered, 1, 2, 3, etc. &nbsp;The problem is when I later edit the document and insert new paragraphs
 in the middle. &nbsp;Instead of numbering them as part of the existing list, it creates a new list. &nbsp;This is what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Numbered paragraph list A</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Numbered paragraph list B</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Numbered paragraph list A</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Numbered paragraph list A</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Numbered paragraph list B</p>
<p>
</p><p>How on earth do I merge the two lists??? &nbsp;I select the second paragraph's number "1" and click on "continue from previous list," and it does nothing. &nbsp;I select "continue numbering" and it does nothing. &nbsp;I either manually set the number value (which gets
 tedious going through the document and fixing them all), or I just give up and type the numbers manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems so simple. &nbsp;What am I missing?</p>

<p>OK, I have figured it out.&nbsp; Doug mentioned styles, so I started there.&nbsp; Here is how I solved it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each paragraph was already&nbsp;set to the "list paragraph" style.&nbsp; Even though each paragraph was the same style, the numbering was off (usually due to closing, opening, and inserting a new paragraph in the middle of the document).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the styles pop-out menu (on the home ribbon), I went down to "list paragraph," clicked on its drop-down menu, and chose "select all."&nbsp; Then I scrolled to make sure every numbered paragraph was highlighted.&nbsp; Then I went back to the list paragraph drop-down
 and selected "update list paragraph to match selection."&nbsp; Boom, it "joined" all the errant lists to make one, continuous list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a number that is off due to previously manually setting a number value, I can now just click on the number and select "continue numbering."&nbsp; In one case after updating things got really wonky, and I had to go the first paragraph and set its number
 value as 1 and go to any following non-sequential number paragraphs and select "continue numbering."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will change my life.&nbsp; Forever.&nbsp; I can't wait to tell my coworkers.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already cleared your scan history but the entries still remain, then this might be related to an issue that was previously reported by other community members. To troubleshoot this issue, we suggest that you follow the steps provided by GreginMich
 in the following thread: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start-windows_10/why-windows-defender-cant-clear-its-history-of-the/c3cefb6c-5050-4e6a-8c09-e3b78001993e">
Why Windows Defender can't clear its history of the affected items records?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To clear the Windows Defender cache, we can use the Disk Cleanup tool <em>(see:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026616/windows-10-disk-cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Disk Cleanup in Windows 10</a>)</em>. Make sure to select <em>Windows Defender</em>. This option deletes non-critical files used by Windows Defender and temporary files. You can select this option to free up some space and Windows Defender will continue running
 normally.</p>

                    Hi guys, i am new to&nbsp;WMDC and windows mobile having only just bought a SE Xperia X1.&nbsp; The problem i am having is that nothing seems to be getting synced from PC to phone or vice versa.&nbsp; I have installed WMDC from the supplied CD and have tried uninstalling
 it and using a download from the microsoft site but it still doesn't work.&nbsp; I am using outlook 2003 (having previously been using windows mail)&nbsp;and vista home premium 64-bit.&nbsp; All my contacts on my phone and not backed up anywhere.&nbsp; I have tried getting the
 PIM.vol file off the phone but i can't work out how to import this into outlook.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can anyone help please???

            First of all, make a copy of the PIM.VOL and save it on your memory card as a backup or get PIM Backup from
<a href="http://www.dotfred.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dotfred.com</a> (it is free).<br />
<br />
Now delete your partnership from your device and PC<br />
soft reset the device, reboot the PC<br />
Now connect again and establish a NEW partnership.&nbsp; Pick a couple of things to sync ... calendar and contacts.&nbsp; Give it a try!

            I have tried unchecking the advanced network functionality and that has made n differene.<br />
<br />
I have a partnership, and there are sync options for all the features of the phone.&nbsp; Is there anyway of putting up a screenshot?<br />
<br />
When the device syncs it starts and then says complete straight away.&nbsp; Nothing syncs at all.

Try adding an entry on your PC and a different one on your device.&nbsp; Sync and see if anything transfers.

<div>Make sure you backup the data on the phone using PIM backup.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Let's try this. On your device, go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; DeviceID tab. Change your device name and restart.</div>

    <title>Converting handwriting to text &#40;Windows 7 Starter and OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Converting handwriting to text &#40;Windows 7 Starter and OneNote 2007&#41;</h2>
                    <em><strong>Original title: Converting handwriting to text (Windows 7 SP2 Starter and OneNote 2007)</strong></em><br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
Here some specs:<br />
<br />
Netbook - Sony Vaio W<br />
<br />
OS - Windows Starter with SP2<br />
<br />
Program: OneNote 2007<br />
<br />
Connected Tablet: Wecom Pen tablet<br />
<br />
I am able to write on the tablet in OneNote. Then I lasso the writing and click the convert to text icon and nothing happens. Is there a way to activate this button/feature? I thought I saw it included in the SP2 pack. I really don't want to upgrade to Home
 edition because it would be taxing to the performance on the netbook.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help and real-life solutions/experience.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
S<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Classie,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response. I am not sure I know what you mean by "handwriting option". In OneNote I select the pen icon, write what I need to write, then I lasso the handwritten text. Then when I go to click on the convert button nothing happens.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>

<h2>            File Sharing OneDrive instead of SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to set up OneDrive on less than 10 PCs. I would like to see it operating as DropBox:</p>
<p>1. Have the files and folders visible in the file exlorer for all users that</p>
<p>2. Have a right-click shortcut to send to OneDrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point the local Microsoft partner created a SharePoint Site for us, but it is too complicated for just file sharing. We need something much simpler (such as Dropbox).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our plan is&nbsp;Office 365 Business Premium</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to mention that I have two OneDrive clouds in the notification area: one being OneDrive for Business (only mine files are there) and OneDrive - Company Name Ltd which links to the SharePoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me it seems confusing as we would like to have just one OneDrive icon per user where they can see different files and folders shared by and with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason you have two OneDrive cloud icons in the notification area is because there are two OneDrive for Business application. One is the legacy sync client, the other is the next generation sync client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The legacy sync client supports both SharePoint library and your OneDrive for Business library while the next generation sync client only supports OneDrive for Business for now (S<a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/suggestions/10026033-new-sync-client-must-support-team-sites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">harePoint
 library support is coming</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you keep using the next generation sync client to sync your OneDrive for Business library, as it removes many of the restrictions of the legacy sync client, and use the legacy sync client to sync your SharePoint library for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to know more about the sync client you are using, I have included an article for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Which OneDrive sync client am I using?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering <strong>requirement number 1: Have the files and folders visible in the file exlorer for all users</strong>, we'd suggest you keep using the SharePoint library that the local Microsoft partner has set up to collaborate and share files. Your OneDrive
 for Business library is meant for personal use and is only visible to yourself by default, while files in your SharePoint library will be visible to users who has the permission to the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your OneDrive for Business sync client that is linked to your SharePoint library should work just like any other cloud storage. You share a file by putting it in the synced folder, and this file will be synced to the cloud, and is replicated on any computer
 that is also syncing this SharePoint library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To learn more about when to save documents to either OneDrive for Business or SharePoint, you may refer to the article below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Should-I-save-my-documents-to-OneDrive-for-Business-or-a-team-site-d18d21a0-1f9f-4f6c-ac45-d52afa0a4a2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Should I save my documents to OneDrive for Business or a team site?</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For requirement <strong>number 2: Have a right-click shortcut to send to OneDrive</strong>, please refer to the link below for a guide on how to create a Send To shortcut:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/194150/how-to-add-onedrive-to-the-send-to-context-menu-in-windows-7-or-8.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Add OneDrive to the Send To Context Menu in Windows 7 or 8.1.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The guide is for OneDrive in Windows 7 and 8.1, but it will work with OneDrive for Business and Windows 10 too.</p>
