&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to rotate the screen image is a feature of your video card, to help it work with monitors that rotate to portrait orientation. Almost certainly you accidentally pressed Ctrl-Alt, and some
 arrow key. </p>
<p>Rotate it back using those keys.</p>

<p>This does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When clicking on the connection, the only thing that appears is a "Disconnect" button. There is nothing that says "Find Devices and Content".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I find it strange that you should click the "Ethernet" button, then the "Wi-Fi" button, when both are present the entire time. This is very strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside, isn't this inability to change to a secure network an egregious bug in Windows 10?<br />

            I'm having the same problem. There is "NO" Find Devices and Content. I think Microsoft has changed their versions so many times they don't know which one is valid. This is disgusting.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find two workarounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The powershell method. Type "powershell" into the Search box, then enter the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get-NetConnectionProfile</p>
<p>
</p><p>That returns the name of the WiFi network. Say the network is named "xxxxx". Then enter this:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set-NetConnectionProfile -Name "xxxxxx" -NetworkCategory Private&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That changes the network permanently to private.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Easier method, delete the network by going into Wifi and telling it to forget about the connection entirely. Then, reenter it, and keep your fingers crossed. This also seemed to work, although it was a bit mysterious why it worked :(</p>

<p>You guys MS Support&nbsp;must be fully aware that the above solution doesn't work..&nbsp; It's been a issue since Windows-10 was first released.&nbsp; You post the same solution on all the threads associated with WiFi connections being automatically assigned to a Public
 Network, then don't respond when told your solution doesn't work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My post....</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has farmed out all support to the lowest foreign (must be non-America) bidder. These people are not trained and don't know anything about Windows, but most of them can at least follow a script as long as it uses few words.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The script for most things consists of a few things they can copy and paste into the response dialog; 1) telling people to look for viruses, 2) scan their system for damaged files, and if those fail, 3) make up nonsense answers that don't apply to the problem,
 and in some cases, don't apply to Windows. The post/response above is an example of the latter (#3), with some uninformed person typing nonsense that doesn't apply to my Win 10 installation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one thing missing from the response is - after the opening salutation where they thank you for contacting MS -&nbsp; where they say that they understand the problem. Of course they don't have a clue what you're talking about, so the trick is that when you
 see this opening, treat it as a warning sign that the following "answer" is a complete waste of time, cut your losses and run away. Then you can look for help on the web where there may actually be some helpful individuals that can provide an answer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm leaving now to look for something meaningful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck. </p>

<h2>            How can I stop Action Panel showing my new emails&#63; Win10</h2>
                    <p>I'm in the middle of populating my new Win10 PC (1511 Build 10586.36 ***). I've not used in for two days and I've been swamped with new email notifications in the Messages panel from the right side of the screen in Action Centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need this and certainly don't want these notifications. How do I stop them please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Not sure if this is the correct Forum</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** My older PC was&nbsp;updated to Build 10586.63 a week ago and Settings etc says this PC is up-to-date&nbsp;- I've asked elsewhere in the Forum why this doesn't need to be updated too.</p>

            It is not an important update even though it says it is. Uninstall it reboot. As soon as you have rebooted run a manual check for updates. Then when the update is offered again right click on it and hide it. The update will not be offered again.

            <p>I've done some research. Apparenlty this is an update that has been re-released dozens of times and promoted from optional to recommended. Support posts for this update date back to 2014 with many users having weird issue with it. All three of my Win7 machines
 keep trying to install it and often fail. I've tried several fixes both official and unofficial, but none of them actually solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best thing to do is search for "KB2952664" in your installed updates list, uninstall it, reboot, let Windows Update find&nbsp;KB2952664 again so that the shield icon appears on your Shut Down button in the start menu, and install the update via that shut down
 button. After that it will still come back but as optional, and you can set it to be ignored while still technically having it installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all the trouble&nbsp;KB2952664 seems to have caused you'd think they'd fix it. Oh well. You do need this update if you want to update to Windows 8/10.</p>

            <p>hey</p>
<p>i have the same problem..</p>
<p>from the google searches i have done, this KB is a "nagware" for windows 10 update..</p>
<p>now the issue is, that nagware cannot be installed on certain windows editions/keys (ive got one from my old job, a university [perfectly legal ofc]). those type of keys cannot be offered the upgrade (just like the windows 8.1 free upgrade).</p>
<p>its a bug, you should not be receiving that KB,</p>
<p>i placed it on hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am wondering if you are on the same boat as i am.</p>

            <p>What's going on? I think there is simple detection problem with this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is one of updates (annoyingly) notifying that Windows 10 will be available soon.</p>
<p>Microsoft has re-released this particular update many times - I think that today we are on version 11.</p>
<p>Version 10 has been released in April 2015. When you look at the update it consist of two parts:</p>
<p>1) Windows6.1-KB2952664-v10-x64.cab - cca 5 MB</p>
<p>2) EnableTask.exe - cca 25 KB</p>
<p>First part contains binary files and second one a simple utility which enables scheduled task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you install this update for first time (it is marked currently as optional), it will download full package with cca 5 MB of binary files and install them to system. As first step it will execute EnableTask.exe, which do only two things:</p>
<p>a) checks for registry key Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppcompatFlags\ClientTelemetry\IsCensusDisabled</p>
<p>b) enable scheduled task &nbsp;\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you launch again WU redetection, it will complain that you need to install KB2952664 again.</p>
<p>But now it will show you only 25KB size. WU think that you need to execute again EnableTask.exe</p>
<p>You can simple check is out, clear SoftwareDistribution\Download, disable the mentioned scheduled task, and execute again installation of the update. In download folder you will then spot EnableTask.exe and the scheduled task will be enabled. Afterwards
 the process terminates itself with errorlevel 0, so that WU will show message "Installation successful". But then it will go again over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if it was working correctly in version 10 from April 2015 - whas has changed in the update?</p>
<p>The answer is NOTHING. The EnableTask.exe is binary the same in version 10 and version 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think that this problem lies only in detection signatures, that WU uses today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have few choices to overcome the problem:</p>
<p>1) Uninstall KB2952664, then the system will detect the update as optional and will not try to install it automatically and just wait for new WU detection signatures (if I am right)</p>
<p>2) Just leave it there - it will "install" itself few times, until MS corrects it, but it is only 25KB download and nothing is really installed, just one registry check and schedule task will be enabled. You can see from WU that the installation is instant.</p>
<p>3) If you don't want Windows 10 upgrade, you can (uninstall it and) hide it.</p>

            <p>If we need this to upgrade to Windows 10, what do we do?<br />
<br />
I'm so frustrated because ever since they came out with the Telemetry update and then the "Get Windows 10" app, there has been bugs. How can this be?<br />
<br />
Not asking anyone in particular. Just frustrated.&nbsp;<br />

4) If you want Windows 10 upgrade, you can install the update after 29/July, when Windows 10 will be available, and when you upgrade to Windows 10 the problem will be gone - Windows 10 does not need the update, of course (if Microsoft will not fix the issue)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10- Windows Live Movie Maker Burning a DVD to view on TV</h2>
                    <p>I updated my computer to WIndows 10 and I am able to save a video to a wmv file once I create it with photos and videos combined, but I am not able to burn it to a DVD anymore that I can view on my TV thru my DVD player.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if there is an update that can fix this problem to make it work again? I am reading many people who have updated to Windows 10 OS are having the same issue and not happy at all about it.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First, you are on an older version of Movie Maker, so you might want to install
<a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Movie Maker 2012</a> instead. That won't fix your issue but it will give you some additional features such as outlines on titles/captions, ability to add narration, ability to save in .mp4
 format, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for creating a video DVD; that feature was never actually part of Movie Maker. Instead there is a separate program called "Windows DVD Maker" that was included in Windows Vista and Windows 7. Movie Maker would detect if you had this program and if so,
 would offer to send your movie over there to make a video DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, about the same time that Apple dropped support for their iDVD product in their iLife suite, Microsoft also decided to drop support for Windows DVD Maker. It is not included in Windows 8 or later and can't be installed on these versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your information, the video DVD format comes from the era of analog TVs. It saves in MPEG-2 format and is designed for SD video in a maximum resolution of 480p (NTSC) and can't display HD video. It's not really a good output format for archiving your
 video going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, look to use the MPEG-4/H.264 format that Movie Maker 2012 creates. You can burn that directly onto a DVD disc and play it back in a Blu-ray player or modern game console in full HD. Many TVs will let you read files from a USB stick in a similar
 fashion. Or you can consider streaming via a home network (using DLNA) or perhaps to a Chromecast device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to share this video with friends and family, consider sharing sites like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, yes you are correct. The utility to make a legacy video DVD was dropped back in Windows 7. If you really need this capability, there are still companies that make software for burning video DVDs. Sometimes software comes with your PC if you have
 a DVD drive. Or you might look to shareware options like DVD Flick or DVD Styler. Freemake Video Converter is another option, but just pay attention at install time and always do a custom install of freeware programs so you can control any add-ons.</p>

<p>That comes with time, as you said. &nbsp;You have never played online on the 360. &nbsp;This gamercard on the website is sync'd more to your 360 Gamercard than your Xbox One. &nbsp;I know it may seem confusing, seeing as they get synchronized pretty fast if you get an
 achievement on the 360 or Xbox One and then switch platforms.. &nbsp;But the Xbox 360 and Xbox One servers are not&nbsp;fully sync'd. &nbsp;Make sense?</p>

<p>I hear ya, but that will not be for a few years. &nbsp;Xbox is really trying to defeat the main competition in the 7th Gen console war. &nbsp;They said they will support the 360 as long as needed. &nbsp;I see that as saying we will not stop until they stop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, at some point, the developers will say enough is enough. &nbsp;7th Gen is holding back out 8th Gen aspirations. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Was your account created within the last few months? &nbsp;I just ask as I've noticed that most of the XBL accounts that have no gold stars are relatively new and were likely created after the release of the Xbox One. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just my personal observation and a guess, but I'd say when it comes to the star rep system, it's just a symptom of the "changing of the guard" from old system to new. &nbsp;For most of the 360's tenure, new XBL accounts had 3 gold stars to start with. &nbsp;Most
 brand-new accounts now have none. &nbsp;</p>

<p>See it doesnt matter that cheesy never played online. I never have either and just created this account to prove a point. Thats a glitch in the system. You should have at least 3 stars.

<p>Yep, must be a glitch. &nbsp;It might also be that you get the 3 gold stars or not depending upon how you create the XBL account; e.g., on an Xbox One, on a 360, or on Xbox.com and/or through a Win 8/Win Phone game. &nbsp;The star rep system never worked very well,
 but now it seems more misleading than ever &nbsp;as a measure of a given gamer's rep. &nbsp;</p>

                    When I try to set up a phone number for Skype to Go from Germany, I'm getting a message that the service isn't available in Germany at this time, but Germany appears on the list of countries supported. Which is it? And, if there's no way to use Skype to
 Go, how else can I call from Germany? Thank you!

                    Hi, I'm using 64bit OS in my computer and i have a problem. AdminStudio is giving an error message when this program run.
<br />
<br />
"SQL Server 2005 Setup cannot continue because the installation package could not be opened. The installation package has a missing file, or you are running a 32-bit only Setup program on a 64-bit computer. To continue, verify the SQL Server 2005 package you

<br />
What can i do for about this? <br />
<br />
Thanks!

<h2>            Windows Update No Longer Works After PC Reset. &#40;Wacom Cintiq&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><strong>Product: Cintiq Companion</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After resetting my Tablet (by "Just remove my files"), and installing all the newest Windows updates, windows update will get stuck on "checking for updates". Using the troubleshooter reveals an error code and reports that it has fixed the problem and there
 are no new updates, resetting the date on "Most recent check for updates" to Never.&nbsp;<br />
The problem arrives again the next time I check for updates. ((<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/kb/error_on_launch.html?mv=product&amp;mv2=accc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adobe CC requires your PC to have the newest Visual C++® 2015 runtime.</a>
 .))&nbsp;</p>
<p>No solutions have worked to solve this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>--"Edit: I have tried installing the updates directly from Microsoft before. But it gets stuck on searching for updates on your computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reset my tablet again and wiped it completely, only for this problem to persist. &nbsp;The original error code that was given by the Windows Update Troubleshooter is now replaced by "problems installing recent updates"<br />
<br />
Some forums say its a registry and service problem with the PC, others say it's a problem with Adobe making a connection and proxy problems?&nbsp;<br />
I don't know /where/ the problem lies or if it is a combination of problems!<br />
<br />
I've used System File Checker tool at some point and it came back with "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log"</p>
<p>But the SFCDETAILS file came back with nothing relevant to the problem I'm having (or appears not to)</p>
<p><br />
Should I continue my search for a solution here with Wacom, with Microsoft or with Adobe?</p>
<p />

<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. It is the third link named <strong>Download and run the Windows Update Troubleshooter for Windows 8.1, Windows 8, and Windows 7.</strong></p>

<li>What command did you use in command prompt when you performed the DISM?</li><li>Did you run command prompt as administrator?</li></ul>

            <p>Hi, I have done this and i have the same issue. The updates say they are complete it goes through another cycle of checking for updates and gets stuck on this &nbsp;(little circle going round).. This has made my cintiq companion totally useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a windows key printed on my power supply but do not know how to reload windows as The Companion does not have a cd drive so i cannot reinstall windows that way and i don't have a disc. I am also unsure if this would solve the issue. plus i am concerned
 i will loose all my files and work stuff</p>

<h2>            Multiple desktops with customized icon for each view</h2>
                    <p>It would be nice to have multiple desktops like in Linux</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except to have different icons on each desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can organize your work to different desktops for different things..</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your video editing desktop , you would have icons for creating and editing videos.</p>
<p>On your sys_sdmin desktop , &nbsp;you would have control panel icon and other icons related to admin.</p>
<p>On your Office desktop , you would have icons for ms office and other editors and stuff..</p>
<p>On your gaming desktop , you would have icons for your favorite games.</p>

            <p>Hi Albert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I would like to inform that Windows 10 ha the multiple desktop functionality. To know more about the same click on the link below</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the function does not include customizing each desktop icons as per the&nbsp;requirement. I would recommend that you post your valuable suggestion about the same in our Feedback app so that our developers works towards enhancing its features.</p>
<p>

            I know this might sound dumb, but maybe try redownloading and installing, THEN try to uninstall?
<div><br />
<div>if that fails, I would just delete the source files. I&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;opening Tack Manager and terminating all&nbsp;processes&nbsp;that are associated with Reg Clean Pro first.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then find the file where the application is at (usually&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86) or C:\Program Files, and delete the file and everything in it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once done, you should go to back to Remove Programs, and attempt to uninstall again. You should get something along the lines of "this application seems to already be uninstalled" and click delete.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you need an alternative Reg Cleaner, I suggest CCleaner, a very simple and easy application to use that&nbsp;cleaners&nbsp;registry AND temperary internet and system cache</div>

<h2>            Startup Repair failure</h2>
                    Yes I know there are simmilar questions to this one but for me this is what the problem detals are after the repair finishes:<br />
<br />
Problem Signature:<br />
Problem Event Name: StartupRepairV2<br />
Problem Signature 01: AutoFailover<br />
Problem Signature 02: 6.0.6000.16386.6.0.6001.18000<br />

Problem Signature 10: 0<br />
OS Version: 6.0.6000.2.0.0.256.1<br />
Locale ID: 1033<br />
<br />
I have already tried starting in safemode and returning to the last known good configuration settings via F8 but any time I try to start it automatically goes to Startup Repair, and I have tried to return to a restore point, but for some unknown reason all
 my restor points keep being deleted and I never made a backup because my computer has too much data on it it would never allow me to make one (both my 2 hard drives on my laptop are nearly full as it is) and when I baught my laptop it never came with a Vista
 OS Install Disk so I cannot boot from there either.<br />
<br />
My Operation System is Window's Vista Home Premium Service Pack 2

            You should never tack your question onto another Thread.<br />
<br />
This one is last dated: August 15th.<br />
<br />
You start your own question in these Forums.<br />
<br />
If the Startup repair does not work, and you do not have vista Disks, you are very limited in what you can do..<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Save your Data.<br />
<br />
2. Get Recovery Disks.<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Data Recovery:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, and read/save your Data from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Put your Hard drive in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure, plug into another computer, and read/save from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Or, use Knoppix Live CD to recover your Data:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download/Save the above Knoppix Live CD ISO file.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1 in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.
</span></p>
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<p><span>Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.<br />

<h2>            XBOX unable to read disc</h2>
                    
<p>I just tried to play my xbox 360 and got a error saying unable to read disc and saying to clean the disc, tried this and other 360 games and got the same message. However it will play original xbox games with no problem. Anyone have any idea what this could
 be?</p>

<p>Sounds like your DVD drive is going out. You can try opening and closing the disc tray repeatedly until it reads your disc. I had to do it 20+ times on an older 360 I had. it worked for a while, but then stopped reading games all together. It will most likely
 need to be replaced/ repaired in the long run. Now I just use mine for arcade downloads and the online streaming apps since it's out of warranty. You can also starting getting games on demand, as an alternative for the discs.</p>

<p>It also plays &nbsp;DVD's with no problem. Tried opening and closing but with no luck. I was thinking the same and it being the disk drive but the fact it will play xbox original games and DVD's makes me think otherwise. Could there be any other reason for this
 happening?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the drive is going out. It starts with one type of media (games) then slowly progresses, so you may be okay for a short while, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
</p>
<p>Kinda unrelated, but that makes me think - if Microsoft had made the HD-DVD Drive able to read game discs then that would have been perfect...</p>

<p>I got a game once and it didn't work, &nbsp;tried another game which worked, so I thought the game was dodgy but when the game I thought was dodgy worked on my brothers 360 I knew it was my 360. So I cleaned my lens with my DVD lens cleaner and the game worked
 beautifully.</p>

<p>Try a DVD lens cleaner first before taking your 360 apart.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player keeps losing its library settings</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed a bootable SSD into my desktop PC and moved all my music tracks onto the old hard drive - which is to keep all my data on.&nbsp; As expected, I amended my library definitions to point them to the locations of folders on the remapped hard
 drive.&nbsp; I did the same for the music library in Windows Media Player.&nbsp; After it finished updating, I then spent some considerable time going through and updating the album art for albums that it had missed.&nbsp; I thought that all was well but now, whenever I
 reboot my PC, it seems to have lost the library settings, comes up with a different set of folders in its music library (some of which do not exist) and has lost all the effort that I put into getting the settings corrected.&nbsp; After the first time this happened,
 I assumed that I had done something wrong and repeated the long process, but now it seems to happen every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is something happening in the background to reset my music library settings?</p>
<p>Where is the music library database stored - so that I can take a back up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone stop me from tearing my hair out?</p>
<p>

<p>Andre, many thanks for the prompt response.&nbsp; I followed your instructions.&nbsp; The first one - to run the trouble shooter said that the database was corrupt.&nbsp; The second process removed and reinstalled WMP.&nbsp; I updated the WMP library to point to the correct
 folders and it spent a couple of hours rebuilding it.&nbsp; I rebooted the PC and, unsurprisingly, it was back to square one.&nbsp; Something keeps resetting the folders in the WMP library to two (default?) values - one of which does not even exist! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Before I try that, I've just notice something that&nbsp;<em>might</em> be related.&nbsp; In moving my data to the remapped hard drive, I (eventually) managed to move the location of my Public folders (which is where I store all my music/photos/etc.).&nbsp; I've just noticed
 that something in Windows must have recreated them under the C:\Users folder.&nbsp; (So, despite what I thought earlier, the folder
<em>does</em> exist again).&nbsp; I suspect this is related to whatever process keeps changing my WMP library settings to use that folder rather then the one on my hard drive.</p>
<p>Is that a more likely cause?&nbsp; I would be surprised if it is anything to do with a fast shut down? &nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem appears to have been solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the registry for settings that still had values such as C:\Users\Public\Music.&nbsp; There were a few under WMP, so I amended them to the correct values.&nbsp; Now WMP seems to retain the correct settings and I haven't had to rebuild the WMP database again
 (yet) …</p>

                    I have a Proscan 37 inch sound bar PSB3713-C that I got as a gift. I also have a Panasonic Plasma tv TC-P42X1. I am trying to connect the sound bar but I am unable to because I have no audio out plug ins on the tv. I do have a digital audio out but the
 sound bar cable has no plug in for this outlet. Could someone give me instructions on how to connect the bar to my tv. Please keep in mind I am a little illiterate when it comes to technical work. Thanks in advance if anyone can help. I have tried Proscan

            Hi Thomas,
<br />this is hardware problem not related with Microsoft products. I think it is better to ask the question at audio forums where people are talking about Proscan.

    <title>Display on bottom half of screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smc_55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display on bottom half of screen</h2>
                    While working in Microsoft Maps my display moved from the top of the screen to the middle of the screen.&nbsp; I have to scroll to see the entire screen.&nbsp; App icons that had been displayed on the left vertically are now displayed horizontally on the top.&nbsp; If
 I try to move the screen up, it gets small and pops back down to the middle of the screen.&nbsp; Not very user friendly.&nbsp; I've gone into settings and tried various obvious things and even with restarting after restoring to default it continues to be this way.&nbsp;
 Any help is appreciated.

<h2>            Windows Subsystem for Linux - Installed Distributions Missing</h2>
                    <p>Device type: Laptop</p>
<p>Model: Lenovo ThinkPad W530</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Education</p>
<p>Verison: 1803 Build 17134.48<br />
<br />
After the 1803 Spring Creators Update was applied on my machine, my Ubuntu 16.04 app no longer worked. It produced the error message:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">"Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.<br />
Distributions can be installed by visiting the Microsoft Store:<br />
https://aka.ms/wslstore"</p>
<p>I learned this was because my Ubuntu 16.04 install was no longer the default distribution. Using the wslconfig program, I was able to list all distributions and see my Ubuntu install. I set it back to the default and running 'wsl' would work as expected.<br />
<br />
However starting today, running the 'wsl' command produces the same error as before. Now there are *no* distributions when I list my installed distributions using 'wslconfig /l'. It seems like my Ubuntu install gone completely now.<br />
<br />
1) Are there any other ways of checking if the files within my Ubuntu install are still on my device?<br />
2) Why would a distribution silently be removed, is it an error or the result of some policy(eg. since Ubuntu 18.04 was released)?<br />
<br />

            Well after applying the update, "2018-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4100403" [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4100403/windows-10-update-kb4100403] my Ubuntu distribution is visible and working again.
 The patch notes for this update don't seem to address anything related to my issue. I'm not sure if the update or the system reboot was the fix for the problem.
