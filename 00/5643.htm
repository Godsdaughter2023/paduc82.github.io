<p>In case what you mean is that the top of the page appears at the zero mark on the vertical ruler although the Margins dialog indicates a 1" or other top margin, please read&nbsp;<a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/WhiteSpace.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/WhiteSpace.htm</a>&nbsp;for
 the cause and cure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that isn't the problem, please post a screen shot of a page of text, including the vertical and horizontal rulers, and a screen shot of the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog (to get there, click Page Layout &gt; Margins &gt; Custom Margins). Also check in
 the Paragraphs dialog that the left and right paragraph indents are set to zero.</p>

            In addition to Jay's suggestion, perhaps Word is displaying in Draft view rather than Print Layout. On the View tab, click Print Layout, after which you should see all margins properly.

            <p>What you are describing is probably a "keyboard macro" in WordPerfect. Word substitutes AutoText and AutoCorrect. For your purposes, AutoCorrect is probably more appropriate, but see these articles:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps most likely won't open if phone memory is full and update won't complete. Also, can you tell us if you have updated the phone's OS version? Some apps version may be old and simply are not compatible with the new upgraded OS version.

<p>Most likely the phone is trying to download an update, but you don't have enough space. So it downloads as much as it can, then realizes it can't download the whole thing, deletes what it downloaded and tries again.</p>

Hi. I think It is, but how to update if I haven't space for it? Just 1GB (if "System &amp; reserved" takes 3 with something GB), and how many I need to download and install update for W10M?

            I'm not sure this is the correct forum for your question; however, this sounds like it may be the Security Tool malware application.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-security-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link/download</a> on instructions for decontamination.&nbsp; There is an image of the application so you can determine if this is indeed the same rogue app.<br />

You only get what your system was activated when on the Insiders and your system was activated with digital entitlement, only way to get the "free" upgrade is with an active version of Win7 or 8 home or Pro as you can't go from Home to Pro as you could before
 before 10240 and July 29th 2015 is when it changed. &nbsp;seeing that you were asking about Win7 Home premium back in July did you ever install a Pro edition?&nbsp;

            <p>Firstly, please don't swear. This is a family forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, the people on this forum, even MVPs, are not employed by Microsoft. We are just ordinary users like you who freely come on here to help other users. Demanding we "fix it" won't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thirdly, I quite like outlook.com but, like you, I don't like the current messenger issue. It's one of the few hassles I have with outlook.com. Microsoft are not likely to see much of what is posted on these forums as they are only for supporting users,&nbsp;but
 if you use the link below you can leave feedback.</p>

            <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for any inconveniences this may have caused you on your end. Please be informed though that the option to sign out of Messenger in Outlook.com is not available. Like what the previous moderators have mentioned, the current option that we have
 is to set your status as invisible. Also, if you are signed onto Windows Live Messenger, you have the option to
<strong>Sign out from the web</strong>, this would disable your Web messenger in the meantime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have additional questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

<h2>            MS office attachments will not open in outlook</h2>
                    <p>I have office 2016 with an office 365 subscription on windows 10. All of a sudden I can no longer open office documents in outlook, I get a message to say they are corrupt. I also can not preview the documents either. PDF documents open and preview no problem
 only word, excel and powerpoint are affected. I have done a repair install on office, checked the trust settings in outlook and all is ok.
</p>
<p>I get an error saying the file is corrupt and can not be opened. However if I save the file to my desktop it opens no problem.</p>
<p>I also had a problem all of a sudden with some of my excel and word files would not open with the same message. When I right clicked on them there was a message with a checkbox to say these files were from another PC and were not safe. When I ticked the
 checkbox they then opened. Im not sure if this is related.</p>

            There is no mergefield limit, per se, although there is an overall limit of 2,147,483,647 fields in a document. The more pertinent issue is whether Word can access as many data fields as your source contains. Depending on the data source, the OLE DB driver
 used for mailmerges may not be able to access more than 255 fields (a limitation that applies to Excel data sources, for example).

<p>
</p><p>What was your original Antivirus, Trial or otherwise.</p>
<p>With Windows Defender&nbsp;the other AV&nbsp;has to be completely removed for Windows Defender to be turned back on.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you've previously uninstalled a third-party antivirus product (avast!, AVG, Norton/Symantec, McAfee or some other product), you might see a dialog that states that Windows Defender is turned off. In that case, either click Action Center's white flag icon
 in <a href="https://www.winhelp.us/change-taskbar-in-windows.html#notification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to manage icons displayed in Taskbar Notification Area">
<span>Turn on virus protection (Important)</span> or <span>

    <title>Build 11102 failed to install. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> governortech-ret  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 11102 failed to install.</h2>
                    <p>I couldn't get #11102 to install on my desktop PC. &nbsp;I tried several times and got errors about check for memory problems. &nbsp;I pulled RAM and shuffled it around as online advise suggested. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I decided to reset the PC and it started and stayed at 2% for several hours. &nbsp; I tried starting over and it did the same thing at 1% for several more hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I next shut down and restarted with my Win-7 install/upgrade disk. Tired of trying to get it to repair I clicked custom install, after moving all of my files to my external hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now I have Win-7 &nbsp;w/service pack 1, &nbsp;and IE-8. &nbsp; Have been trying for 2 days now to get updates, or to upgrade to Win-10. &nbsp;Can't get IE-9, IE-10, or IE-11 to install. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I think I may have picked the wrong PC name when I did the custom install and no matter which PC name I change to it is trying to find the files and updates for the wrong PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a install saved for Win-10 and burned a DVD of it 3 copies and it always finds an error and won't install.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I found a original DVD that I downloaded the first build of Win-10 &nbsp;ISO that I used to install Win-10 on this laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tried installing from the ISO disk and it got to the part of downloading updates and ran for a couple of hours before I got the message to turn on Updates. &nbsp; I checked and updates are set to automatic. &nbsp;I click to check for updates and it stops almost
 immediately and shows error that Cryptographic Service is not registered. &nbsp;I have Net Frame Work 3.5 showing to be installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Any way to just start from build #11102 or am I stuck with having to pay for Win-10 now that the free period is over?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have Win-10 on this laptop and it works just fine with build #11102, &nbsp;it has way less memory and small SSD. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook Auto Reply Overrides Teams Availability</h2>
                    Outlook Auto Reply Overrides Teams Availability.&nbsp; I'm in a support role where I need to keep up an Auto Reply, but I'm not out of office, merely reminding users to&nbsp; send tech support questions to our help desk. The problem is that the link between Outlook
 (Office 365) shows me as Out of Office/Do Not Disturb in both Teams &amp; Skype.&nbsp; Why can't we have the granularity of Teams in Outlook?&nbsp; Many corporate offices require an automatic reply, "Thank you for your email we'll get back to you... blah, blah, blah..."
 Surely I'm not the only one who requires the same granularity we get in Teams?&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi TurtleG633,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We know if we can use the “ auto reply “ features in the Teams &amp; Skype for Business, like the feature in the outlook, it will be more convenient for our daily work and life. However this feature is not available in both
 Teams and Skype for Business, so the recommendation for you is that please vote for this feature on
<a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/33925903-auto-reply-based-on-status-similar-to-or-integrat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 be very helpful for us to improve our products.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your understanding will be highly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            never mind. Fixed it myself. I deleted my old email address as an alias and then changed my primary alias back to my old email account. When I logged in next I got instant access.<br />
Shame but I won't be trying that again. It would have been great to be able to change the name of my email which I set up about 13 years ago!<br />

                    It seems to be that you cannot add more than 200 items to a OneDrive Album, but I cannot find information on this. Is this indeed the limit?<br />

<p>Hey there,&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ba35865c-1789-46ee-b4a2-e21f949cb9f5" title="VincentVA">VincentVA</a></p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you tell me if this is a Photo Album that you can access using the Microsoft Photos App? Or is it a folder in Camera Role or Pictures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it may be a bit random and a silly question. However, Microsoft Photos which is built into OneDrive on the website, allows you to create Albums like this. However this is something that is different to OneDrive completely, although it is owned by
 Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For OneDrive folders, it depends on the storage space available on your Account. If you have enough, you can add as many pictures and files as you wish. The only time it will stop you is when your at your storage limit. Then you will need to purchase more
 storage from the OneDrive website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sound issues in Java Windows Technical Preview. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nemisis_0000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound issues in Java Windows Technical Preview.</h2>
                    <p>I have read the other posts that report sound issues and feel my issue is related but separate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sound works, sort of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have desktop sounds and even sound from flash. tested with pandora.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The levels are not persistent though the volume slider claims 80% it fluctuates from about 20% to 120%.</p>
<p>Almost no sound through headphones even with boosted levels.</p>
<p>Not always and not on any repeatable consistency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have noticed is there is no sound with Java (1.8.0.40 64 bit at least)</p>
<p>There is no sound in last hope: zombie sniper 3D&nbsp; (java game ?)</p>
<p>No sound with Minecraft (definitely a java game, and now a MS/Mojang product)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be installing non java based games and media players to check for compatibility.</p>
<p>I have yet to test every aspect of this issue yet but felt it was important enough to mention early.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a built in realtec via sound chip 7.1 with hd audio</p>
<p>nvdia gtx650 ti with hd audio&nbsp; ( I seem to remember win7 had a conflict with this that was not java related back in the day and that was fixed fairly quick by a driver update from nvidia)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So my question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experience the "No sound with Java"&nbsp; issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix or work around?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: My hardware is fine.&nbsp; I tri-boot Win7x64 and ubuntu 14.04 x64&nbsp; and WinTP x64 and have no problems on 7 or linux with java and sound.</p>
<p>

Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
I have downloaded and tested the issue on my computer and we are getting sound for Microsoft Mahjong game. I would suggest you to go into the game settings and check for Sound settings.<br />
<br />
a. Right click on the game.<br />
b. Click on Game options.<br />
c. Make sure Sound settings is set to Maximum.<br />
<br />
As Windows 10 Technical preview is in development stage, the drivers for Windows 10 Might not be available. Your Windows 10 might have loaded with basic drivers. I would suggest you to provide the feedback in the feedback app.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assure you I would never file bug report for no sound if the problem was not having the volume turned up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem persists with java applications and Netflix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MP3 files have no sound either. (missing codec?)</p>
<p>WMV files have no sound tested that with Windows Media Player.<br />
Funny thing about the WMV.&nbsp; Metallica cranked to 100% no sound at all. Except for the desktop sounds that go boing when you make adjustments to the volume using the mixer volume slider.<br />
Really annoying at 100%, just saying.</p>
<p>Flash works and plays sound just fine, verified with youtube and pandora.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am leaning towards the problem not be the game volume settings nor the position of the variable resistor that controls the output strength of the audio signal that my amplifiers process and pound through a 1200watt home theater system that I use to
 test my neighbors hearing.<br />
Nor could it be a random sudden onset of deafness, I check by dropping a pen on tile. Totally heard it.<br />
</p>
<p>I might have that last one checked by a medical profession just to be sure.</p>
<p>However, in the meantime. Could you fine folks at MS ask the guys in the audio lab to take a look at how Directx 12 is handling audio output in relation to to the audio mixer, that would be swell.<br />
Perhaps, if the urge strikes, they could peek in at the speaker cutout feature when headphones are plugged in. A setting that is missing from the mixer settings now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Win10 is in development and not everything is going to work out of the box.</p>
<p>I also understand that there will be some problems that need to be fixed, and that as a community we can strive to overcome these adversities and produce the finest Phablet OS on the market.<br />
<br />
Thanks, have a wonderful day.</p>

As the issue is occurring with some formats and you are getting the error related to Codec. I would suggest you to install the latest codecs and see if that helps.
<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player includes some of the most popular codecs, like MP3, Windows Media Audio, and Windows Media Video, but it doesn't include the codecs required for Blu</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">‑</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ray
 Discs, FLAC files, or FLV files. If something isn’t working with Windows Media Player, you might not have the right codec on your PC. The easiest way to solve the problem is to go online and search for the codec you need.<br />

            <p>Hi, sorry this has taken a little while to get back to you on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been chasing this issue and have found that the problem is indeed in the headphone detection method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had fixed the no sound by simply plugging in a headset. into the rear audio port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This fixed the problem with java, mps and wmv, etc...&nbsp; so no codec issue there.</p>
<p>The problem is that the OS thinks a headphone is plugged in when it is really speakers.</p>
<p>So the solution was just use headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that this is the built in audio ports on the motherboard with updated drivers from VIA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled the on-board audio via bios and installed a SB X-fi Elite Pro card.</p>
<p>Drivers updated from creative using win8.1 drivers.</p>
<p>I was then able to get audio again from the speakers during use of java, movies on netflix etc.</p>
<p>So that points at the drivers as being the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That accomplished I then</p>
<p>Updated to build 10041 and immediately had the same problem as before.</p>
<p>The solution used before stopped working so I tried a different method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a bluetooth adapter and am using a BTpod speaker...</p>
<p>works great, sound for everything.</p>
<p>That means that it is the OS interaction with the drivers, or that the OS is not directing audio properly (I'm leaning towards this.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This entire set up functions correctly on win 7x64 HP, and Ubuntu 14.04 x64</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will continue to address this issue and test other cards.</p>
<p>The legacy PCI cards seem to have the best results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping to get some cards from other vendors to test.</p>
<p>

<p>Sorry, I'm not clear on whether your onboard audio is VIA or Realtek. If it's VIA, we put a fix in build 10049 that might help you out. Can you give it a try? Thanks!</p>

I have contacted the IT team which run the recipient's mail server - they discovered a duplicate mailbox for this recipient which they removed, however they are adamant there is no problem on their side anymore. Furthermore, other staff members including myself
 are able to email this recipient without issue. So the problem seems to be specific to this single staff member. Interestingly, the staff member is able to email the recipient using Outlook webmail but when when using Outlook 2010 on another PC they still
 receive this bounceback error.<br />
<br />
I have run scanpst.exe which detected and repaired an unspecified number of errors, but the problem persists. Can anybody offer further advice?<br />
<br />
We are using Exchange 2010.<br />

            Dear Rick,
<br />I am a independent advisor and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />If you are using Outlook.com and you want to recover all deleted items, then go to deleted items and on the left side from Deleted items click on circle. This will allow you to select all the emails int the folder. After you can choose action to recover all emails, however if you have that huge amount it can take a while.
<br />If you are using email client, then please specify which one.
<br />Looking forward to your reply.       
        </p>

            When I recovered my deleted email I was trying to find a faster way to scroll to the bottom of my deleted emails! I tried to use the down and end key, but it scrolls down about 10 emails at a time and I have 14000 emails to look through! I even tried locking
 the down arrow key overnight, but it must have rebooted overnight!
