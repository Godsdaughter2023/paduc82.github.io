<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused by software conflicts. As an initial troubleshooting, we suggest performing a clean boot to help eliminate software conflicts that occurred when you installed a program or an update. To know how to do so, refer on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. If issue persists, we suggest performing a clean installation of Windows. You can check this<strong>

<h2>            PPSX and PPTX files from my MAC cannot be opened on other computers. What is going on&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am a freelance designer and have a client that is constantly requesting PowerPoints for sales presentations. I have a huge volume of work with this client and am running the risk of loosing the contract if I cannot solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work with MAC and I have the latest version of PowerPoint for Mac installed on my machine (Version 15.30 - 2017).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The designs are very simple, in fact most of the slides are just pre-designed JPGs exported from InDesign and imported into PowerPoint. FYI I do not link the files, they are embedded to document. There are however also some templates that have been designed
 in PowerPoint so they can be edited by client. I share the files with my client through Dropbox. When she downloads the files be it either in PPTX or PPSX format she simply cannot open them. They are not recognized by her PowerPoint which runs on a PC. Initially
 we thought it was because she had an old version of PowerPoint installed so she updated and it still couldn't read the files. She tried opening the files on other machines including another MAC and could not open the files on any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can imagine I am racking my brain trying to figure out what the issue is and am drawing a blank every time. I need help to solve this problem urgently as deadlines are looming. I am even thinking about purchasing a PC just for working with PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before someone mentions it I have also tried creating presentations in Apple Keynote and exporting to PowerPoint and exactly the same problem!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please help and tell me why this is happening and how I can solve it. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Best practice tips:</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER open PPT files from or save files to:&nbsp; Dropbox, OneDrive, AnyOtherbox, AnyOtherDrive, or ANYplace on your computer that's automatically synchronized with anyplace else, or that's auto-backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always copy the file to a local folder, open it from there, edit, save back to a local folder, close the file in PPT and copy it to Dropbox, etc. if need be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same goes for removable drives, thumbdrives, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And a sanity maintenance item:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you plan to do a lot of work for Windows PPT-using clients, it's almost a necessity to have a Windows laptop (or a copy of Windows + Office running under something like Parallels on&nbsp; your Mac).&nbsp; Yep, you don't really HAVE to.&nbsp; And I don't really HAVE
 to put gas in my car, but it's no fun pushing the thing up hills myself.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

    <title>How do I get the Assure team to respond - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I get the Assure team to respond</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I purchased the Assure support program. So far I have to say it was a very big mistake.</p>
<p>The technicians run the basic virus programs, take hours of time to establish that I have no virus indicated, they decide to 'elevate the problem to level 2 technicians' who repeat the same excercise. Hours wasted.</p>
<p>I have given control to them, let them work for hours, same results - no solutions and no call backs.</p>
<p>The technicians also seem to have no way to refer to any history so they repeat each mind-numbing scan ad-infinitum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst of all I have made appointmernt after appointment that they simply do not honour.</p>
<p>Frustrated by this I tried to get a refund. The technicians are well versed in the art of transferring callos in a totally circuitous circuit that ends me up back where I started, at the help desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today - November 6th. I began at 7.30 a.m. to solve a recurring problem. Again no call backs.</p>
<p>Called the help lines:</p>
<p>1-425-882-8080</p>
<p>!-877-696-7786</p>
<p>1-800-642-7676</p>
<p>Spoke to 'Supervisors'&nbsp; in all 3 areas, all promised callo backs - not one call back.</p>
<p>There is no one willing to try to solve the problem or to discuss refunding the fee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - if you are listening - a perfect scam. Take my money, waste my time, solve nothing.</p>

<p>If you think it is legitimate company with bad service, you should contact them and there is nothing which Microsoft could do as it is not under control of Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have posted to a Microsoft consumer forum where consumer users help other consumers using Microsoft products.&nbsp; Though the forum's are named Answers&nbsp;they actually have nothing to do with the similarly named Answer Desk which is a contract support group
 operated through a&nbsp;different arm of the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though most here are aware of the Answer Desk option for support, few would have used it, since most helping here are capable of doing these things themselves.&nbsp; In fact, until you mentioned it above I wasn't even aware that the Assure product existed and
 thought that they only provided short, one time help or training options for a limited set of products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those with the MVP&nbsp;badge&nbsp;are also simply other consumers who've been presented a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional award for their help&nbsp;with Microsoft products&nbsp;either here or in other venues.&nbsp; Only those with "Microsoft" badges actually work for Microsoft,
 but even these are usually just contract support people and still have nothing to do with the completely separate Answer Desk personnel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I'm trying to tell you is that you aren't going to find a pathway to help you resolve your issues with the Answer Desk here.&nbsp; You need to make contact with them some other way and request immediate connection with a supervisor, since the front-line
 support people aren't providing the response you need.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, to contact Kirsten Kliphouse, one needs to be a full subscriber to LinkedIn.&nbsp; I am a "free" subscriber and cannot send "Inmail."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be cancelling my Assure contract in a day or so.&nbsp; I purchased it on 8/13, after several hours of "free" support, I was told that I needed to purchase Assure to continue to the next level of support.&nbsp; After 4 hours of running a cleanup application
 remotely that did nothing, they promised to call me back when it was complete.&nbsp; It was 3:30am my time.&nbsp; I told them to call anytime and that I would re-login to enable them to complete the repair.&nbsp; Ten minutes later they called (hardly could understand the
 "Indian" English) and indicated that they were wrapping up and would call me again when complete.&nbsp; No call.&nbsp; I have tried for several days to get back in touch.&nbsp; The online chat has an average wait time of 350 minutes and I set up a call back with a 325 minute
 time.&nbsp; They did call in about 6 hours.&nbsp; I was put on hold for 18 minutes listening to how wonderful Win 10 is.&nbsp; When they finally put a person on the line, we got disconnected within 30 seconds.&nbsp; I had asked them if they could call back if anything happened
 to the connection and they indicated that they could not and I had to go through the website to set up another call (ie another 6 hour wait).&nbsp; With the online chat, they give you about a minute to notice that they are there, then disconnect - that's after
 a 5-6 hour wait for the chat session to start.&nbsp; Today I am waiting for a callback as well as a chat.&nbsp; I have been waiting about 3 hours so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Win 7 PC will not download any Microsoft updates.&nbsp; This started in mid July.&nbsp; I do not have an install CD (HP does not supply them) and I upgraded my C drive to an SSD about a year ago.&nbsp; Apparently the service partition, while there, no longer has a usable
 copy of Win 7 after cloning the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assure is a scam and a total ripoff.&nbsp; They do nothing (maybe they are OK for a minor issue).&nbsp; While not a computer scientist, I have been involved in high performance computing and am familiar with various Unix/Linux distributions, Windows, and previously
 worked for IBM Consulting.&nbsp; I have tried everything that I can think of to resolve this issue short of pitching the PC and starting over.&nbsp; I have never been an Apple fan, but I am now considering it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to resolve an issue with failure to download Win 7 updates?&nbsp; I have tried this with a "clean boot" to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the error message that started all of this.&nbsp; After one of their cleanup attempts, my "most recent check" was cleared.&nbsp;
 It was sometime in mid to late July.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74cd52dc-a92c-445d-9dbf-4484e277b865" /></p>

1. Call 800-642-7676. Go to Billing. Give them your unresolved case number.&nbsp;Tell them your problem. Have them stay on the line with you until you get a technician. The billing department cannot issue a refund even though they processed the charge. Bogus.
<br />
<br />
Insist that technician establish the process to receive a refund. (Ironically they send you to the place that didn't give you the service to give you a refund.) Have that technician create a case and send you an e-mail with the case number and the scheduled
 call-back from the lame Assure people before you let them go.<br />
<br />
2. Put a Fraud Alert on that charge through your credit card company.<br />
<br />
3. Log in to Microsoft and go here:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/technicalsupport?wa=wsignin1.0#gsproductselector/productid/509. &nbsp;Look for Report a Support Scam near the bottom on the left and fill in the form.<br />
<br />
4. If this does not resolve it, tell your state Attorney General. I have not done this yet. I am waiting on the callback from the 2nd tier to refund. They already told me they were going to do it and they didn't. Now there is a paper trail.<br />

            <p>I finally gave up on Microsoft.&nbsp; I reported the charge to American Express and they credited it to my account pending a response from Microsoft in October.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also just received a survey on the support !!!!&nbsp; I gave the first tech an average rating since he seemed to try and was professional (although he tried to sell me a subscription to Office 365 - at nearly double the cost at Costco), although he was unable
 to resolve the issue after 3 hours on chat with him in the middle of the night (finally quit at 3am).&nbsp; I rated the overall support at 1 out of 10 (too bad there is not a 0).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also sent Amex the email showing that the support was cancelled and a refund would arrive soon.&nbsp; Now I'll wait to see what Microsoft has to say.</p>

<h2>            Paste link an entire row based on the value of a single cell</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, within my workbook (Excel 2007) I have a main summary&nbsp;sheet where data is edited.&nbsp; This has columns that show&nbsp;field names, numbers, areas etc and the crop that will be grown in them.&nbsp; Data is entered here. The&nbsp;other worksheets&nbsp;are for&nbsp;individual crops
 eg barley, wheat, carrots.&nbsp; I would like the workbook to paste link data that is entered in the summary sheet to the relevant crop sheet so, for&nbsp;example, if I&nbsp;click on the&nbsp;barley worksheet it will display only the fields that barley is being grown in.&nbsp;So I
 need to paste link entire rows based on a single cell value.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This solution is a bit complex, so I'll explain in a lot of detail.</p>
<p>Let's say that your main summary sheet is named Sheet1 and that the column with the crop name is in is column E on that sheet.&nbsp; Lets say also that you don't think you'll ever have more than 9,999 rows of entries on that sheet.&nbsp; And finally, lets say you
 want to return information from columns A through F of Sheet1 over to the individual crop sheets.</p>
<p>For the sheet that you want only 'barley' entries in (entries from Sheet1 with Barley [case is not important] in column E), then the first row on the individual crop sheet where you want to return data from column A of Sheet1 barley entries, enter this formula:</p>
<p>=IF(ISERR(INDEX(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999,SMALL(IF(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999="Barley",ROW(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999),10000),ROW()-ROW($E$1)+1)-ROW($E$1)+1)),"",INDEX(Sheet1!A$1:A$9999,SMALL(IF(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999="Barley",ROW(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999),10000),ROW()-ROW($E$1)+1)-ROW($E$1)+1))</p>
<p>Now, this needs to be an array formula, to make it an array formula instead of committing it with the [Enter] key, you commit it using the [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[Enter] keys pressed together.&nbsp; Then the formula should appear like this in the formula bar:</p>
<p>{=IF(ISERR(INDEX(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999,SMALL(IF(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999="Barley",ROW(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999),10000),ROW()-ROW($E$1)+1)-ROW($E$1)+1)),"",INDEX(Sheet1!A$1:A$9999,SMALL(IF(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999="Barley",ROW(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999),10000),ROW()-ROW($E$1)+1)-ROW($E$1)+1))}</p>
<p>Any time you edit the formula, you'll have to commit it again with the 3-key combination.</p>
<p>Once you've got that basic formula into a cell, you can select the cell, move your cursor until it's over the lower left corner of that cell and becomes a bold + symbol instead of the normal fat cross that Excel displays.&nbsp; Left click and drag it to the right
 6 columns.&nbsp; It will automatically adjust to pick up the proper information from columns A, B, C, D, E and F from Sheet1.</p>
<p>Finally, select all the cells with the formulas in them and again move to the lower-left corner of the leftmost cell until you get that bold + symbol again and drag down for some distance on the sheet so you can pick up lots of rows of data from Sheet1.&nbsp;
 Now all of your Barley information will show up on that sheet.</p>
<p>You can then copy the formula from the very first cell you entered it into on the Barley sheet and paste it into another sheet, say the one for Wheat, and simply change "Barley" in the formula to "Wheat" in the two places in the formula where "Barley" was
 at, and then repeat the fill-right and fill-down operations for Wheat.&nbsp; Continue for as many sheets as you need.</p>
<p>A possibly easier way would be to set up one sheet for Barley (or another crop) all filled in and working and copy the entire sheet and then use Edit Find and Replace to replace Barley with the name of the next crop.</p>
<p>You'll notice that the formula is an IF() formula, with the 3 parts of an IF formula in it:<br />
IF( test condition, action if true, action if false)</p>
<p>The first part of the formula [the test condition] is testing for an error condition and if the test does create an error, then an empty string ( "" ) is put into the cell, but if the test found some data, then pretty much the same formula is executed again,
 but it actually returns the data from a column.&nbsp; Here's the basic test condition without the ISERR() portion, followed by the action-if-false part of the formula:</p>
<p>INDEX(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999,SMALL(IF(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999="Barley",ROW(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999),10000),ROW()-ROW($E$1)+1)-ROW($E$1)+1)<br />
INDEX(Sheet1!A$1:A$9999,SMALL(IF(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999="Barley",ROW(Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999),10000),ROW()-ROW($E$1)+1)-ROW($E$1)+1)</p>
<p>Notice that the only difference between these two formula parts is that the very first range that the test condition examines is Sheet1!$E$1:$E$9999 but the range the second half returns changes that part to Sheet!A$1:A$9999 so that the data will come from
 column A.&nbsp; If you examine the other formulas in the&nbsp;first row formulas you created with the right-fill operation, you'll see that only that one piece of the formula changes from column to column, the rest of all the formulas will be exactly the same.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you get something set up that works for you.</p>

    <title>Updating to Build 10049 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianpurdie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updating to Build 10049</h2>
                    <p>I've tried unsuccessfully about three times over as many weeks to update my Win 10 Preview from Build 9986.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After slow download and install on a new Laptop/Notebook it simply then announces each time&nbsp;it is going into Recovery and then rolling back to previous Windows, which of course is Build 9986.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from that - the Windows 10 Preview runs exactly like my Desktop PC with Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly for enquirers? All copies my old software work under Windows 10 Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any pointers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ian</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ADDED:</strong> It previously didn't like 10041 either.</p>

            <p>Please excuse my insistence on precise answers to the questions asked ... I asked apples ... you answered oranges. Please tell us the free space in the
<p>
</p><p>(Even though Microsoft said testers should know what they're doing, we have quite a few rank beginners, who barely know how to push a power button, and they don't usually start by telling us how limited their knowledge is.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that your PC is new, so could you tell us how you dealt with the "free trial" 3rd party security software that came on it? Some say they turned it off, (not good enough), or uninstalled it, but the two most frequently included ones will only
 be cleanly removed by the removal tools provided by their manufacturers, and any remaining parts of them can cause the installation of a build to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, some users have installed their own favorite 3rd party security software, and have not cleanly removed it, because, they say, "oh, I know it's good ... certainly a lot better than that built-in one, and I've used it for a long time, etc, etc". And,
 some of those might have failed to abort the installation of an earlier build, but are aborting the installation of the current build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Furthermore, while the fan may think a 3rd party security program is compatible with the TP build, it may be causing problems that they are blaming on the TP, so Microsoft asks all testers to rely on the Windows Defender, only.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now, if the free space that you mentioned is in the OS partition, and if you're sure that any 3rd party security software has been cleanly removed, it's time to get down to business.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to decide whether your installed programs are important enough to you that you want to save them in an image of the OS partition, to be restored later to be upgraded, or whether you would rather just reinstall all of your programs again, later,
 from scratch. I would encourage the first option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, you need to use the ISO file for build 10041 to do a clean install, wiping out everything on that OS partition. If it should fail, I would try downloading the ISO file again, or trying the existing one for a temporary install on another PC, to verify
 that it's good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the clean install works, we will know that you PC can run build 10041, and I would make a partition image of it and save it on a different hard drive. (Hard drives all fail, we just don't when, until it happens ... and you don't want to lose your partition
 image if the OS hard drive fails.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, either go to the fast ring and install the 10049 build upgrade, followed by reinstalling your programs, or stay in the slow ring while you restore your OS partition from the image of build 9986 that you made earlier, planning to remove suspicious programs
 until you can succeed at installing build 10041 as an upgrade, and then, on to the build 10049 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may seem like a lot of work, but that's what testing is all about, right?</p>

            I would suggest a <strong>Clean Install </strong>of <strong>Build 10041</strong>, wiping out everything that's left after a
<strong>backup</strong> of your necessary data. Use this Microsoft site to get the ISO :<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-download?ocid=tp_site_downloadpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Preview ISO March Update</a>. Then update to
 Build 10049 in <strong>Fast Mode </strong>because it's ISO is still not available for download to my knowledge.

<p>
</p><p>Very important to do this quickly since the earlier versions will expire and cease to function at the end of this month.

</p><p>As soon as 10041 is installed, windows update will install updates including 10049.</p>

<p>I've tried unsuccessfully about three times over as many weeks to update my Win 10 Preview from Build 9986.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After slow download and install on a new Laptop/Notebook it simply then announces each time&nbsp;it is going into Recovery and then rolling back to previous Windows, which of course is Build 9986.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from that - the Windows 10 Preview runs exactly like my Desktop PC with Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>

<p><strong>... All Comes Right In The End</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had several attempts at updating to 10049 which was&nbsp;mainly plagued by lengthy install periods.&nbsp; On the&nbsp;Nth attempt all came right and the download and install completed in a relatively short period.&nbsp; Build 10049 has cleared&nbsp;many of the problems I
 was experiencing with 10041 and is relatively stable. &nbsp;Just stick with it.</p>

            <p>Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I didn't say "dedicated" OS partition, I just said "OS partition", just as you have shown on the bottom line in your illustration. It contains the operating system and the installed programs used with said operating system, so we call it
 the OS partition ... I guess for no better reason than laziness; and when you are planning to upgrade said operating system to a different one, you need to pay attention to the free space available in said OS partition, not the free space in other partitions
 on that hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One might wonder about why we ask such questions, but there are ones who report problems installing the TP in surprisingly small spaces. One, the other day, insisted that his 3 GB free space would be plenty, since had read that the ISO file for the 32 bit
 build was less than that. He later said that he had cleared out a lot of files, and now had 9 GB free, and he knew that would be way more than would be needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, some don't volunteer much information to begin with with, and I'm too old to care to guess at items of info needed to accomplish the task of helping them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hang in there ... in a few years, you'll be my age ... but by then, I'll have moved on ....</p>

 seems to have worked.&nbsp;

<p>Hi thisMPete,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the prompt, your credential of OneDrive are expired. You could try the following steps to see if it helps the issue:</p>
<p>1.Sign out your OneDrive account</p>
<p>2.Open Finder&gt;Applications&gt;Utilities&gt;Keychain Access and remove the following password entries:&nbsp;</p>
<p>--Microsoft Office Identities Cache 2&nbsp;</p>
<p>--Microsoft Office Identities Settings 2 &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.Search for all occurrences of</span><span> </span><span>ADAL</span><span> </span><span>in
 the keychain and remove all those entries if present</span></p>
<p>4.Open OneDrive and resign in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back and let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eli</p>

                    <p>Problem 1:</p>
<p>The tab for the Class Notebook Add-in does not&nbsp; appear. I have solved this by uninstalling and downloading and installing the add-in again today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2:</p>
<p>The tab for the Class Notebook Add-in is empty, it does contain a couple of icons but they do nothing, there are no functions. I have tried numerous times to 'repair' the add-in but this does not change things. I have also uninstalled and re-installed but
 nothing seems to fix the problem.</p>
<p>When I look in the OneNote Options menu and then the customise toolbar, the Class Notebook tab comes up with &lt;&lt;No Label&gt;&gt; everywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this, because I loved using the add-in.</p>

<h3> thegsusfreek2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I buy a season pass&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I must be missing something painfully, painfully obvious, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to purchase a "season pass" of a TV show in Zune, either via PC or Xbox! What's more, I can hardly find any information on the topic.</p>
<p>I browse to a TV show in the Zune marketplace, but the only&nbsp;purchase option I see is to still buy&nbsp;per-episode.</p>
<p>So I figured I'd post on here and ask: where do I click to buy a season pass? What am I missing?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            The "Buy Season Pass" button is located at the top of the "Buy" button column when looking at the episode list. &nbsp;However, I believe this may only be available for&nbsp;<em>certain</em> TV series. &nbsp;For example: &nbsp;South Park and Family Guy seasons all have the
 "Buy Season Pass" option, but another show "Supernatural" does not, only "Buy All". &nbsp;So I believe it's specific to the TV show and what each content provider is allowing.

    <title>Outlook profile fails to load - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook profile fails to load</h2>
                    I have office 365 business account and have installed office 2016 on Microsoft exchange through click and install system. Often,it is experienced that starting outlook is a&nbsp; trouble , exact words notified are"failing to start outlook ,can not open the
 outlook windows. The set of folders can not be opened. The operation failed." This has happened numerous times even after creating new profile, uninstalling, installing office 365 but it may start 1 or 2 times and thereafter the same problem starts.Have tried
 fixing /repair through control panel,tried repair with Recovery Assitant as well but nothing work causing extreme frustration and pain.I have seen this issue raised by hundreds of thousands with no respite. Virtual Agent,overseas located contact centers with
 staff having no skills and depending on community is no solution if only MS wakes up before it is too late.

            Does it work in safe mode? To open Outlook in Safe mode: Close Outlook then hold Ctrl as you click on the Outlook icon. You'll get a message asking if you want to start in Safe mode. Click Ok.

<p>Hi NJ,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, your Outlook cannot open and received the error message. Generally, the issue is probably related with the files of Outlook. There’re some suggestions for you.<br />
<br />
1. Run the /resetnavpane command when you start Outlook. You can right-click&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Run&nbsp;</strong>&gt; type<strong>&nbsp;Outlook.exe /resetnavpane&nbsp;</strong>to remove all customizations to the navigation pane.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b97a6a6d-295a-4330-9438-014fac28c94d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b97a6a6d-295a-4330-9438-014fac28c94d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Try to repair your Outlook data files by using&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Inbox
 Repair Tool (scanpst.exe)</a>.<br />
<br />
Note: please don’t delete the original profile to avoid the data loss.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, for the better understanding, I’d like to collect the following information to make a further investigation. And as a temporary workaround, please use OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook
 Web App</a>).<br />
<br />
1. Since you received the error message, please capture a screenshot and send it to me via&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a>.<br />
2. May I know the detailed version of your Outlook application? You can check it in Control Panel.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc8f4bb1-4703-4175-b4a0-80fae1ad6a85?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc8f4bb1-4703-4175-b4a0-80fae1ad6a85?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
3. Besides, you’ve run the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistance (SaRA), could you please provide the report to me in private message?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marvin</p>

<h2>            How to select&#47;deselect  applications in Office 2010 to install&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am reinstalling Microsoft Office 2010 Home and Student Edition on my new computer.&nbsp; I have already entered the product key, and it seems to have been accepted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then I selected Custom Installation and was taken to this screen where several programs such as Word, Excel, Outlook (trial), Access (trial), etc. are shown.&nbsp; There is a plus sign before each of them which can be expanded.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the main boxes are selected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option to deselect (uncheck) any of the boces.&nbsp; I do not want to install all of them - just a few.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

            The Plus sign expands the option, each feature has 4 options:<br />

<p><span>Run from My Computer</span><span> The feature will be installed and stored on your hard disk when you complete Setup. Subfeatures won't be installed and stored on your hard disk.<br />

<br />
</li><li><span>Installed on First Use</span><span> The feature will be installed on your hard disk when you use the feature for the first time. At that time, you may need access to the CD or network server that you originally
 installed from. This option may not be available for all features.</span><br />
<br />
</li><li><span>Not Available</span><span> The feature won't be installed because it is not available.</span></li></ul>

            <p>Thanks.&nbsp; Unfortunately when I expand the plus sign, there are subfeatures as you said, but there are NO options for any of them to deselect, select, whatever.&nbsp; You said there are 4 options for each.&nbsp; At my end there are none.</p>

            Sorry, it appears I misquoted.&nbsp; Maybe the 4 options are only displayed during install.&nbsp; I just went back into my installation (on Vista). After expanding all the + signs on a specific tree, clicking on the last icon gave me 2 options "Run from My Computer"
 and "Not Available". If you change the option from "run ..." to "not available' it should be unisntall. As described in the link I provided<br />

            <p>Aparently it is different with WIN 7.&nbsp; No matter how may different ways and times I try, it still won't work.&nbsp; I suspect it has to do with their wanting me to install all as trials, hoping I would be dimwitted enough to purchase all when the time comes if
 it is in a trial period although they accepted the product key and did not say any of the features was a trial.&nbsp;

            <p>If you want to uninstall the Trial programs, use these instructions:&nbsp; <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/remove-or-uninstall-office-2010-trial-HA101972584.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, as clumsy as it sounds, you uninstall the entire Office Suite, restart, then reinstall using a Custom Installation which lets you pick and choose.</p>

            <p>Custom Installation is exactly what I had been using and was talking about.&nbsp; There is no option to let me pick and choose.&nbsp; I already uninstalled and reinstalled, to no avail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked Uninstall Programs in Control Panel, and you're right, I cannot pick and uninstall.&nbsp;any of them, one at a time. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am stuck with all of them.&nbsp; I am going to open all of them and see if any of them is really a trial.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I attach a screenshot:</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/a/kD7Aq</p>
<p>
</p><p>They were the first i contacted. They did not know why its not working and reccommended me to get Office support, and Office support also did not know why its not working so they reccomended me to raise the question on the forum where there are experts of
 Microsoft. What could possibly be the reason for it not working? Can i send to someone this ppt file and see if also for them this file produces a nonfunctioning button? Is it a security issue, resolution, mismatch? What causes this kind of issue usually?</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes,</p>

            I can't tell from your screen shot. But it does appear you bought a defective template from a company that can't support it. I would insist on a refund, it's not up to either you or us to fix this for them.

            <p>Sorry, but there's no native method of copying from the Status Bar, although you could use VBA to capture the sum of a selected range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could go one cell beneath&nbsp;the bottom of the sum range, then Alt+= to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-AutoSum-to-sum-numbers-543941E7-E783-44EF-8317-7D1BB85FE706?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AutoSum </a>that range. From there you could copy &gt; paste special &gt; values.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Any solutions for margin problem with Outlook 2013 stationery themes</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm as stumped as everyone else with the issue of Outlook 2013 stationery themes that have graphics on the left hand (ex. Notebook) NOT adjusting the margins of text in the body of the message. I'm not familiar with CSS or padding, but from what I've found
 online that seems to be the issue. Has anyone seen anything from Microsoft on this as far as a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your input is most appreciated.</p>

            <p>You wrote, "i purchased office 2010 pro at Staples..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You wrote, "looking programs and features only one program with office in it office professional plus&nbsp; 2010."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; When you start to install the program, it accepts the product key and you get a green checkmark, but then when installation is complete and you try to activate, that's when you get the notice about an invalid product key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; Your disc and packaging all has "Office Professional 2010" on it. but when you install the program, the installed program calls itself "Office Professional Plus 2010" and in the Start Menu folder for Office Professional Plus 2010 you have a program called
 InfoPath 2010, and maybe have a program called Lync 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If A and B are both true, then unfortunately all indications are that you have inadvertently purchased a high-quality counterfeit of Office Professional 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is exceedingly unlikely that this was purchased at Staples.&nbsp; The only explanation for such is that someone bought a genuine copy at Staples, then returned an unopened high-quality counterfeit to Staples, "pulling a fast one" taking advantage of lightly
 trained store employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, Microsoft has a program that will replace your high-quality counterfeit with genuine.&nbsp; Start the process by filling out a counterfeit software report here:&nbsp;

            <p><strong><u>First, please edit your post ASAP to remove your product key!!!!!</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common reason for this type of error is conflicting software on the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; But,&nbsp;you did state that you used the Office&nbsp;uninstaller fix it to remove the software.&nbsp; Did you look in Control Panel&gt;Program&gt;Uninstall a Program and check to see if
 there are any other Office installations, say a leftover Office 2007 or 2010 Trial or Office 2007 or 2010 Activation Assistant?&nbsp; Any and all of those would need to be uninstalled to preclude an activation conflict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you did post your product key originally, I saw that it has the numeral "8" in it.&nbsp; I can't tell you how many times I have mixed up the letter "B" and the numeral "8" when reading product keys---in the font they use on the labels the eights and bees
 look so much alike it's too easy to get them mixed up!&nbsp; Maybe you're having the same trouble?&nbsp;

            <span>It sounds to me like the dash does not support SDHC cards.&nbsp; There is a hack that may allow the device to work with SDHC cards....you can read about it here:<br />
