    <title>Downloads folder hidden and cannot be changed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Downloads folder hidden and cannot be changed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got an issue with my Downloads folder, it is pinned to the quick access menu but otherwise there is no other way of accessing it because apparently it is ''hidden''. I clicked on the property of the folder from the quick access menu but cannot uncheck
 this ''hidden'' option because it is greyed out. I tried everything including system restore to an earlier point before this issue occur but that doesn't work as I encounter a separate problem with that, which I posted in another thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some background to this problem: Basically usually Downloads folder is located in c:\Users\Name but I have 2 different drives, my SSD and HDD so I moved it to the HDD drive a while back. However, I messed up something today and had to format the HDD drive
 and in the process deleting everything on there including the folder. I tried to move the Downloads folder from c drive to the newly formatted d drive again but stupidly did not create another folder for it first so basically it merged with the d drive. After
 a while of changing stuff in the registry I managed to get it back to the c:\Users\Name directory now but the problem is that it is permanently hidden for some reason and I cannot change this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please helpe me sovle this issue?</p>

            JUST AN UPDATED: Finally found a solution to this problem. Basically used CMD typing ATTRIB -s -h "c:\Users\Name\Downloads" and this unchecked the hidden option. Hope this help anyone who faces similar problem in the future.

<h2>            After Windows 10 update&#58; Slow boot. Black screen after log-in. File Explorer Crashes</h2>
                    I've been having issues with my PC for a few months now. I thought it was a virus at first but I've done a few Norton scans that found nothing and saw that my problems were common after the windows 10 update. Unfortunately I didnt realize this until after
 the time I could go back to windows 7. When I cut my PC on the Log-in screen is lagging. After logging-in the screen goes black with only the mouse visible for about a minute. Then the computer is painfully slow to boot up to a usuable speed. Even after waiting
 a full hour after logging-in the computer doesnt get up to speeds like pre-update. Trying to open the control panel takes a minute or it crashes. Opening the file explorer just results in a blank window opening and the address bar never fully loading and a
 spinning blue wheel. The only way to access folders is by opening desktop shortcuts or workaround through the web browsers. I've tried updating graphics drivers and that didn't help. I'm trying to avoid losing my files. Is the

<h2>            Suggestion on OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; How about integrating OneDrive as default folder on Windows 10 Environment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It would greatly help people working in an organization with user domains .<br />
&nbsp; Anyways user's within a domain have to login with Microsoft credentials , if windows 10 can auto login to both outlook and one drive people can directly start working with in the drive [saves work automatically] and email at one click.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

            Hi Mihailo, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s), please try this:
<br />
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            Recore game breaking glitch</h2>
                    <p>I entered Brimstone Cut with Seth, without realizing that I&nbsp;had swapped his core to the fly bot. So&nbsp;I was stuck in the first room&nbsp;with the large lava pit because I had made it across the pit, but there is no way to get out and Seth couldn't carry me up the track. For some reason I&nbsp;couldn't use fast travel to exit, so I had to exit to the main menu, then restarted the game.

            Hi Christelle.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try this new guided walk-through to repair Windows Update:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

below are the web address it had in its email, with no message, which seemed a bit strange.<br />
<br />

theirs no text inside the message at all, just microsofts logo with these two web link I copy and pasted them here, it looks official but I don't think Microsoft sent these emails correct? I am guessing the web links are not safe at all, it seems a bit strange,

            Hello  Robert,
<br />
<br />Nice you suspected about this email
<br />Legitimate emails have a green lock in the address bar and if you stay over any links they must clearly point to a Microsoft site.
<br />Use the 2 fa authentication to be sure
<br />Scam Email it can guide you to malware

<p>you talking about the&nbsp; <span>Two-step verification for outlooks or bing login accounts, feature, that uses its Microsoft android app to control the log in both password like two step logins from that software.<br />
<br />
I think the only reason I don't like that feature is because I think then I have to setup a password for my older Xbox 360 console if I am correct, unless they changed that. anyway I might turn that two step verification back on if it helps stop these strange
 emails from getting to my outlook account, I am not sure if that will stop these types of emails, also I forgot about that feature&nbsp;</span><span>Legitimate emails have a green lock in the address bar, thanks for reminding me about that.</span>&nbsp;<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>that &nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Two-step verification&nbsp; for the Xbox One X works ok,
<br />
<br />
anyway is that what you were talking about when you posted<br />
</span><span>Use the 2 fa authentication to be sure <br />
<br />
from under the webpage&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
Additional security options web page where this feature is at are you recommending that to be used?
<p><span><br />
my androids are ok, but not that great I could use them for software that works with that feature, but again I would also have to setup a password for my xbox 360 console that I still play on once and a while.</span>

                    <p>I've had this PC maybe a year. It is the touch version. Anyway, it has always run pretty fast, but lately it is running slower. The loading circle shows longer now regardless of site I am on. It is really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and emptied the recycle bin,&nbsp;and I have a ton of memory left. I'm only using 74 GB out of 465 GB.&nbsp; I think maybe the latest update may have caused this issue, but I am not sure. As of now I am updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice? I just want it back to its original faster speed where it stops taking forever to load all the time.</p>

<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM Windows 7 licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on a Windows 7 Retail Licence?

            Hi,<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.<br /><br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. <br /><br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. <br /><br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: <br /><br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.<br /><br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.<br /><br /><br />Please let us know if you

    <title>Can&#39;t reliably access my router setup screen since W10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fiendishtb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t reliably access my router setup screen since W10</h2>
                    <p>I have three computers wired to my D-Link DSL-504T modem/router.<br />
<br />
Since upgrading two of my PCs to Widows 10 Pro (activated, clean install) I can no longer get reliable access to my router configuration screen (192.168.1.1) through these two PCs, although my third computer that is still running WinXP has no problem at all.
 Internet access on all three computers is unaffected and works perfectly.<br />
<br />
The two W10 computers get to the router login screen, accept my username and password and then try and display the next status page whereupon the following happens:<br />
<br />
<strong>Firefox</strong>: Stops with 'The connection was reset' error<br />
<strong>Edge </strong>and <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>: Sit waiting forever (or as long as I'm prepared to wait!)<br />
<strong>Chrome</strong>: Occasionally displays part of the status page, but mostly just sits there waiting.<br />
<br />
The WinXP PC just sails along, displaying every page instantly and putting two fingers up to it's modern bretheren!<br />
<br />
I've reset the router and that makes no difference. I've turned off the Windows firewall and that makes no difference. It can't be my AV software (NOD32) as that is only running on one of the W10 PCs. I've flushed the DNS and tried just about everything I can
 think of and <em>still </em>the two W10 machines fail.<br />
<br />
A google search reveals that other people have experienced this problem with other OS's, but no-one has come up with a definitive solution and all the many suggestions that I've tried have made not the slightest difference.<br />
<br />
Any of you wise people have any ideas?<br />

<p>An automated reply?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the second paragraph in the OP '<strong>Internet access on all three computers is unaffected and works perfectly</strong>', and the troubleshooter reports no errors (unsurprisingly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is weird is that the router login screen loads instantly and correctly, the fields accept my username/password (which are 100% correct) but clicking 'login' or pressing &lt;return&gt; takes me no further. It's as if something is stopping the script from running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anybody still working this issue ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently exoperienced this problem as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 2wire router became unstable so I swapped it out for an old AR7 chipset router I've had since about 2005.&nbsp; It isnt branded (ebay special !) but it appears to do exactly the same as a d-link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though my Win 10 pc would happlily access the 2wire config pages, it now does exactly as the original post on this thread says it does when I try the AR7 one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2wire is only a year younger than the AR7 one, so what on earth is the difference ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the standards for how web access in Windows 10 change in such a way as to cause this ?&nbsp; My 10 year xp computer and my 4 year old windows 7 both happily access the AR7.&nbsp; All three computers have the latest version of Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated drivers, changed settings, etc untill I'm blue in the face, but it just refuses to work properly !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help !!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>I got the same problem: I was not able to logon (using Win 10) my router D-Link DIR-618, even though access to the internet was not affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a lot of options, including trouble shooting in Win 10 which said that some file was missing. Finally I reset my router and it then worked for a while. but after one / two days, I could not login again. This time I turned off the router (without
 resetting it), It worked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though this solved the problem temporarily, I would kike to know what happened to Win 10.</p>

<h2>            WLID account blocked</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I know this is not the right forum to be posting, but I seriously need help with my account. My account was blocked by the Windows Live team due to spam mails being sent from my account. I'm sure some of you may know about this 'virus' going about.
 Well, I was desperate to try to recover my account and attempted password resets and stuff. When I contacted the Windows Live team on the forums, they told me to go through this verification process, which I did several times and ended up failing to verify.
 After giving up on recovering my WLID, I went to this forum and found that you could change the Windows Live ID on my Gamertag. However, due to my impulse in attempting to recover my account, I resetted my original password by accident and now I've lost complete
 access to my original account. Hence, I would like to ask for help here hoping someone might be able to help me.</p>
<p>P.S. here's the forum where I contacted the Windows Live Team.</p>

<p>Xbox support can only guide you through the normal password resets such as sending a password reset to your e-mail address, answering your security question, or the verification process again. Xbox support can't reset your e-mail or password for you, believe
 me, i've tried. You can try WLID support again but it sounds like you've lost your account.</p>

<h2>            IObit Malware Fighter is blocking my internet connectivity</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
after installing "IObit IMF 3" I could not connect to the internet, although I can see availiable connections, I can connect to them BUT there is an exclamation mark on the signal strenth bars. I think it did something to the DNS or after a click on the X for
 internet trying to fix it, windows came up with the message:&nbsp; "the services auxiliary IP application is not running" or something like that... the message was on greek. I tried unistalling it but I think it caused the problem... it's not the problem by it's
 self. Then I found this: <br />

but it was already too late!<br />

            <p>Hi Ioannis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Which type of internet connection are you using?</li><li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue in connecting to internet after installing IObit IMF 3. The link which you have mentioned in your post clearly states that this particular application causes connection issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it's a&nbsp;good decision to uninstall it. If I understand you correctly,&nbsp;you have already tried to uninstall it and issue is still persisting even after uninstalling it. Please correct me if I misunderstood you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after uninstalling the application issue persist then you may try the below mentioned methods to troubleshoot network connection issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>First, I would suggest you to run Windows in-built network troubleshooter to get the problem automatically detected and fixed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article below to run network troubleshooter. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Using the network troubleshooter in Windows 7.</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>This issue can also be related to network adaptor, resetting, updating driver, disabling, re-enabling, uninstalling and reinstalling network adaptor may help.</span></p>

</p><p>need a little help here, i just installed a free update from windows7 to windows 10 and i love it so much.</p>
<p>first though that after installed the windows10, it would be a fresh and new windows without old and junk files, but its not. its completely new windows10 and its working, just the files and junk are still there. Then im trying to clean install using "reset
 windows" features, but it always failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a problem resetting your PC</p>
<p>No changes were made</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to solve this, i want to clean install so everything clean and new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ps: i dont have my product key anymore, the activation stated that : product key - windows 10 on this device is activated with a digital entitlement.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer the below link and follow the methods provided in the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Recovery options in </strong><span><strong>Windows&nbsp;10</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</a></p>
<p><strong>Activation in <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span></strong></p>
<p>Activation helps verify that your copy of Windows is genuine and hasn’t been used on more devices than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. Depending on how you got your copy of
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, activation will use either a digital entitlement or a 25-character product key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Digital entitlement is a new method of activation in <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> that doesn't require you to enter a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the below link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/activation-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/activation-in-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>

            I had the same problem, so I talked to a representative. They downloaded a media tool from&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 and selected the upgrade option. It isn't exactly a reset, but they said it would replace missing files
 and reset the settings.

            <p>Yes it worked. It took quite a while to download the media to a usb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you have to do is select the option that says create media for another device and then plug it in to the PC that you want to reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got confused during the setup, when it asks you to do a clean install, choose that one, then it will do another download and when it's finished, it'll ask you again. Just choose the other option (not the clean install for the second time). This way, it'll
 move everything you had into a folder called Windows.old and it won't do anything unless you decide to restore something you had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this'll help.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Center &#40;not Player&#41;, removing old folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> archalias  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center &#40;not Player&#41;, removing old folders</h2>
                    I have seen this question asked a thousand times, but have not been able to find a valid answer.&nbsp; First.&nbsp; Windows Media Player is all set up and correct, I do not need to make any adjustments to windows media player.&nbsp; Simply.&nbsp; The computer files were reorganized.&nbsp;
 The folders and files that WMC originally linked with were moved.&nbsp; It has since been linked to the new folder locations.&nbsp; WMC has been set to stop watching the old folders.&nbsp; However, WMC still holds the old information for the old links and folders.&nbsp; This
 confuses WMC.&nbsp; I need to find a way to remove the old folders and links in WMC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried solution from removing image.db files, adjusting registry keys, all sorts of things regarding removing, reinstalling or moving files in WMP, to some really dumb
 things.&nbsp; I did not wipe the system, or restore to purchase settings.&nbsp; I would hate to think that evey time you move a fold you will have to wipe your computer and reinstall everything so that WMC can adjust to the move.<br />
<br />
DOES ANYONE HAVE AN ACTUAL SOLUTION THAT WORKS? &nbsp; <br />

            Hi BJB2757,<br />
<br />
I don't know if you still having the same problem or not because it have been quite sometime since your last post but I recently ran into an article might help solve your problem.&nbsp; I would suggest to make backup of your data and all data you will delete prior
 in attempt these steps.<br />
<br />
<p><span><span>Since Windows Media Center and Media Player share the same database (or library), these instructions will resolve problems for both applications
 at same time.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The instructions are:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Exit Windows Media Player.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For Windows XP:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click Start, click Run, type: %userprofile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Media Player, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For Windows Vista:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Click Start, click Run, type: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Select all the files (not folders), and then click Delete on the File menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Restart Windows Media Player.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</span></span></p>
<span>After deleting all the files, Windows Media Center’s library was completely reset. This procedure removed all of the unwanted (or invalid) folders that I could not remove before
 and I re-added the folders I wanted. Everything has worked fine since.<br />
<br />
Hope this help,</span>

 install Windows with. I'm not sure what to do because I can't even do a fresh install of windows.

<p>First off, thank you for the response.<br />
<br />
If the problem is a failing HDD, than what would be causing this issue when trying to boot the win-10 installation media from the USB, which seems to work on my laptop when I try to boot it, but not on my desktop PC facing these issues? I feel like if I tried
 to install another HDD, I would still be unable to install the OS onto it as I get the BSOD with the same error when I boot from that device (the USB).</p>

            Hi HSheaffe
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, when you boot from a USB or DVD installation media, Windows setup attempts to write files to hard disk to facilitate the installation. The fact that its not even able to do that from boot media is a sign there is potential issue with the local disk.
<br />
<br />The instructions I provided in the link will help isolate whether its potential disk failure or the disk is just corrupted.

<h2>            windows 10 creators update no internet access</h2>
                    Installed windows 10 creators update on Asus Crosshair V Formula-z &nbsp;Now no internet access wireless or Ethernet. Trouble shooting can't find any problems. Computer shows I am connected but cannot access anything just spins and does nothing. Tried to reinstall
 drivers for Ethernet, won't install says that I don't even have that Intel Gigibite Ethernet on my motherboard and the drivers come from Asus. Tried to reinstall wireless everything went fine but it still won't work. Wireless usb not lit not working.

This was such a drag - eventually fixed by updating &nbsp;Wi-Fi adapter driver - Intel Dual Band AC 7260. &nbsp;Search automatically did not find it - had to download from Intel Support site.
