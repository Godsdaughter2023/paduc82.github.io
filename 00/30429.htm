<h2>            &#34;People&#34; view doesn&#39;t show phone-number-only contacts in Skype for Android 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a skype number and use skype mainly for voice call to/from landlines and mobiles. As such I have many Skype contact entries with just phone number and name (i.e. they are not Skype user name).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype for Android 8, "People" view doesn't show any of these phone-only contacts any more except the ones in "favorites". I can still search by name but it's very inconvenient.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for iOS (current version), for Android 7.XX and for osx desktop don't have this problem. Is there a hidden setting somewhere to bring back the phone-number-only contacts into "People" view?<br />

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker takes a long time to publish to Disc or PC</h2>
                    
<p>Windows Movie Maker is Taking Hundreds, even Thousands of Minutes to Publish to Disc or HD.__Video is Pictures and Video Mixed. less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>I have created many WMV movies with the same video and pictures.&nbsp; however, i am trying to make a short movie, and when i get to publishing, i choose CD.&nbsp; best quality, or even some times, less than 700mb.</p>
<p>and when i try and publish, it starts off fine, like 8-12 minutes, then, it just keeps adding time.</p>
<p>to the point that it was over 1200 minutes left last time before i cancelled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have a quad core intel 2.55ghz&nbsp;, 4 g ram, and have never had a problem, until, i tried ONE time last week to change settings and save as AVI, which didnt work either, now it just takes way too long, even going back to best quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!</p>

<h2>            Missing Files In Folder &#47; Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently received the upgrade to Windows 10. I am a wedding photographer in Las Vegas and regularly transfer files from SD card to named folders on my desktop corresponding to weddings I have shot photos for, ie, "081915Smith". I transferred photo files
 from an SD card this morning to a named file as per above. I always triple check that the files have been correctly transferred to the folder before ever formatting my SD card. Subsequently, after opening file explorer to look at photos from a past photo shoot,
 I got the "green bar of slowness" which lasted over 5 minutes without showing any&nbsp;folders whatsoever. After that time I closed out file explorer. The desktop then&nbsp;appeared with my icons&nbsp;having been moved in&nbsp; a different order on the desktop. The folder for
 which I had triple checked the files had been transferred to appeared on the desktop without the normal picture preview attribute&nbsp;that was there earlier. Subsequently, after opening the folder it read

            Thanks, but couldn't find anything relevant in that thread. I tried restore options on the folder or a restore point but neither is available in that particular&nbsp;folders properties. This is a disaster for me as I'm going to have to refund $1500 as I'm unable
 to provide photos for a wedding! I triple checked that the files had been successfully transferred to that particular folder&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;formatting my SD card so I'm in big trouble if unable to recover. Still in desparate need of help/ideas.

            I never received a follow up on this issue from this forum. Unfortunately, I was never able to recover those files. I had to refund my client's in full ($1500) and still feel terrible I was unable to provide their once in a lifetime wedding photo memories.
 I certainly hope you are able to recover your newborn son's photos.

            Not looking good. The only thing saving us is that we have them on an external hard drive as well. The fact that random files are just coming up missing during the upgrade is horrible and is a problem that needs addressed and corrected. I would imagine
 that since Microsoft does not want to reply to this, that they are aware of the problem and just don't want or care to fix it. It would be nice if this were a more public problem, so they would be motivated to find out why this is happening.

            This is exactly what happened to me. I have a few folders that have been on my desktop for years as I've moved from win7, to win8, and finally when all **** broke loose was upgrading to win10. At first, when the folders appeared, I could also view them
 in the window.old folder. But now, after win10 did an update, now, even after 'restore to the only available restore which was win10' no desktop icons, folders, and even my documents is empty, my downloads empty, and nothing. Before the win10 update, I was
 actually arranging my desktop icons into their places and everything was fine actually, then, bam, all this mess. I have VERY important information on my old desktop, money is on the line, and there isn't a single piece of info on the web to help. I really
 hate I upgraded, everything was perfect until this. Thanks Microsoft.

            <p>The Window 10 remains a disaster of immense magnitude. The usual folders found in earlier windows such as Documents, Pictures, Computer, Control Panel, Connect, Music, Recent Documents - etcetera and etcetera have all disappeared in Window 10.</p>
<p>I am not a computer expert or Internet Technologist but I am not&nbsp;a novice to the computer. What is the essence of upgrading to Window 10 when this new platform is only there to slow your work? All I see are adverts for Microsoft Products. I am done with
 Window 10. I will look for a second hand Apple Computer to&nbsp;continue with&nbsp;my usual work. The upgrade is a failure.</p>

To access your images:<br />
<br />
*Attach your camera directly to the computer using the USB cable that was packaged with the Fine Pix digital camera.<br />
<br />
*Power the camera ON. The LCD will display a DSC or USB symbol.<br />
<br />
*Double Click on My Computer.<br />
<br />
*Locate the FinePix icon under Scanners and Cameras and double-click. For older Finepix models, locate "removable disk" in My Computer.<br />
<br />
*Follow the instructions in the Wizard to start saving your images. For removable disk, click and drag the images to a folder or you can copy and paste all the images to a folder.<br />
<br />
Once the images have been saved, you can use the provided Finepix Viewer software to view them by browsing to the location in which they were saved.

            I think my battery was low. &nbsp;When I try to download the camera, a screen comes up written in German! &nbsp;I guess what it means but it is very frustrating. &nbsp;I &nbsp;took my camera in to Bet Buy and they said it was set for English. &nbsp;The camera is 10 years old.
 &nbsp;I have Windows 10 on my desktop. &nbsp;I have not tried to download photos from the picture card directly to the PC yet. &nbsp;I hope you understand all this.

    <title>Xbox ONE Elite controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox ONE Elite controller</h2>
                    Why did the Xbox ONE ELITE gamepad not be improved yet? I have two ELITE gamepads, and I've got more than four times rubbed the rubber grips and it's an unfinished problem. I do not even have one in the warranty, but I'm really hurt. So expensive gamepad
 and every year of use, the rubber grips are removed.<br />
<br />
Enhance this gamepad please!<br />
<br />
I do not add this to the Xbox Idea because there's no idea that an admin is never approved.

            They could at least do some sort of action that the one who has the original ELITE gamepad damaged, sends them to them, and they would send him a straight V2. Even if he had no guarantee.

            I just hope this will not last long and the improved ELITE gamepad will soon be in the world. And maybe they'll do some sort of customization. Or select from several sets and colors and styles of removable buttons.

            I saw a video of the what I believe to be the v2 one. &nbsp;Still appears to have those same grips. I won't buy another. &nbsp;Want to try the Scuff controller. Best controller hands down was the airflow controllers on regular xbox. Bring those back. I second your

            I've had mine pretty much since launch and have not had a problem with it. However I know plenty of people who have had the grip problem. It'**** and miss but I think they'll take that into account on the next one.&nbsp;

<p>I can say that as of today, the only issue I've ever had with the Elite controller is the fact that my Right Bumper (RB) button has worn out completely on my Gears of War Elite controller and now the replacement standard Elite controller I received a mere
 3 or 4 months ago or less.. I would attribute it to being overused because of the button configuration for the recent Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey games; but I won't do that, because it highlights a flaw in the bumper buttons that<strong> must
</strong>be addressed in a future redesign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every other aspect of the controller is excellent but for that single issue. That same button on the standard build of the Xbox One controller seems to be more solidly built. It may be a simple reworking those two buttons to put molded rubber padding under
 the button for better durability. The game's configuration could be changed so that the RB button is not the primary attack button that should be an exception, not the rule. I just changed my configuration to remap the faulty RB button to one of the paddles,
 while I'm playing Odyssey and it's working for the time being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always loved the concept of the controller, but I can't wait for a redesign of those bumper buttons. I really hope it's soon.</p>

            I definitely empathize with your plight, and given how many others have reported a similar complaint, an upgrade or radical change to the second iteration of the elite is warranted. I must say that the elite I've had for 16 months has had no issues. Maybe
 it's related to realllllly sweaty palms? ;)

            I know right! I would almost say that the AC game developers knew that particular configuration spoke to that flaw in the bumper design, so they chose to default it for the game, but I digress. I guess any kind of redesign will be Christmas or next year...
 or they just might sneak it into the next shipment of controllers that come down the line as a surprise. I don't have the new white Elite controller, so I'm not sure how its build quality is. The shoulder button durability on the PS4 controller is nearly what
 I'm expecting from anything that comes out on the Elite controller going forward.

<p>I agree this should be fixed. If anything it might as well be a cause for product recall due to manufacture defect. A controller should last a lot longer than a year!!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Rumors surrounding a V2 Elite controller, say its been scrapped and won't be coming this generation at all.</p>

            Hi Pam
<br />
<br />According to their website:
<br />
<br />Where does Sketchable save my files?
<br />
<br />    All journal file information is stored inside the application’s folders, managed by the operating system. Uninstalling Sketchable or resetting your PC will erase all data inside the application’s folders.
<br />
<br />How can I Export my work? 
<br />
<br />    Journals files (.sja) will save all layers, color pallet information, and canvas textures for each page. (These files (.sja) can only be read back into Sketchable)
<br />    .psd preserves layer information. (Sketchable does not read in .psd files)
<br />    .png, .jpg, .tif, and .dmp (exports flat images)
<br />

                    <p>I installed Windows 10 back in early Oct. and everything worked well. On Dec 9th, I received a message in the Action Center that&nbsp; Windows 10 did not install properly and that I needed to reinstalled W 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the update and the re-install started (I did this directly from the message in the Action Center). A terrible 4 1/2 hours later, the re-installed finished and I was up and running. Everything seemed to be fine until I went to save a Quickbooks
 2012 invoice as a pdf file. The program locked up and I had to use Task Manager to unfreeze the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to fix that by following the instructions for removing the XPS printer and re-installing it (info that I found on this site).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next problem showed up when I went to browse for a document in the Amazon message site to send a file to a customer and the program froze up again. This time it was Firefox and I do have the latest version of 40+ something. This problem has not been
 corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My shipping manager program generates pdf files for shipping labels and I am able to print them, but I can't save them. I had a customer request to return an item and I could not save the pdf file under save or save as so that I could send it to him. I was
 using Acrobat Reader DC (latest version). I have not been able to fix that problem. I did find a work-around by mailing it directly from Adobe Reader, but I can't save the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next problem showed up when I went to enter a password that uses he tilde character... the tilde does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next issue showed up when I could not start the calculator by using my key board key. I then went to the start menu, programs and tried to start it there. It flashes on the screen and just disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I can not attach any files using Thunderbird email. The program freezes just as Firefox and Adobe Reader freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the chat line to MS help and they took control of my computer and restored it to the prior set-up. That did not work either as all of the problems mention above still exist. Please remember that I had no problems whatsoever before the Windows 10 automatic
 install took place and I received the notice in the Action Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went in to the recovery program only to find out that there are no earlier recover points available as they were all in Windows 7 Prof version (this was after the MS technician restored the computer to the previous version of W 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a mess. I don't want to do a Reset this PC as I will lose the programs some of which I will have to purchase all over again. QuickBooks PRO 2012 is no longer supported and I will have to buy that program if I do a Reset. Also, I am running MS Office
 2010 and I have used both installs, so I don't think that I will be able to re-install that either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to get my issues resolved other than biting the bullet and doing the Reset this PC and having to purchase new software?</p>

            <p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to presence of unused files or programs in Windows. This may also happen due to software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run system maintenance troubleshooter </strong>
and check. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in search box on taskbar and click on it in search results.<br />
b. Click "<strong>View all</strong>" and click "<strong>System Maintenance</strong>".<br />
c. Click "<strong>Next</strong>" and follow on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks for unused files and shortcuts that you can clean up or remove so that your computer can run faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check the issue.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a><br />
(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I was able to go in to System Maintenance and run the trouble shooter and nothing was found to be wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then attempted to do a clean boot but could not do it. I used msconfig to go into System Configuration, clicked on services, checked hide all MS services and then clicked on disable all. The screen froze and would not respond. I could not even use the
 Task Manager to stop the process. I had to do a hard reboot by holding down the on/off computer button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back in a second time, clicked on Hide all MS services and only 5 services were present. Two were from PCMatic, two from Malware-bytes and one from Adobe Active file mgr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unclicked Hide all MS services and then clicked on Adobe Active file mgr., then clicked on Disable. The screen froze again requiring a hard reboot. I was attempting to disable the 5 non-MS services one at a time, but that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After rebooting, I then went to Startup, task manager, and was able to turn off all items there were listed one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a normal reboot by shutting down the computer. Unfortunately, all of the identified problems still exist after rebooting..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I attempted to disable the non-MS services and the computer still froze up. After rebooting one last time, I went in and reset the computer to do a normal start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the problems identified are still not working.</p>

            Thank you with all of the help.<br />
<br />
I ran the SFC command and it did find corrupted files and fixed them. As suggested, I ran it a second time and the second time it came back that everything was good.<br />
<br />
I then rebooted my system and found that I still had all of the same issues (after starting msconfig, I can't even disable programs in the services tab as the program locks up requiring a reboot).<br />
<br />
I rebooted again and ran the Cleanup/Restore command. At the end it provided the message that everything was successful.<br />
<br />
I then ran the SFC command again as suggested after running DISM and no files were found to be corrupted.<br />
<br />
I removed my internet connection to protect from getting viruses. I disabled PCMatic and Malware-bytes.<br />
I uninstalled 6 older programs that are no longer used.<br />
<br />
I then rebooted with no virus protection or malware protection enabled. <br />
All of the identified problems are still present: Can't save a pdf file, can't browse to select a file when on the Amazon messaging system, can't start the calculator (it just flashes on the screen and disappears), can't attach files to emails, in msconfig
 I can't disable any of the services.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I can figure is that an update to some program was done in the background and is causing issues. I have not added any programs or apps since before this started happening. Remember that this all started with getting a notice in the Action
 Center that a Windows 10 (automatic install) did not install correctly and to do a reinstall.<br />
<br />
Do you have any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your time.<br />
<br />
Jim

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run Microsoft safety scanner </strong>to check and remove any virus or malware which may be causing the issue.<br />

            <p>I have been trying to log in too the URL in&nbsp; the message for Microsoft safety scanner, but it will not&nbsp; connect. I keep getting the message "waiting for Microsoft.com". I have tried to log on at all hours of the day for the past to days. I can not connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even went directly to the MS site, downloads and typed in safety scanner. I&nbsp; get the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does MS have a server problem or is the demand to use the tool so high that you just can't log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen several non-Microsoft sites offering the download of the safety scanner, but I have not done that as I fear getting a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I did run the tool for remove malicious software from MS. It scanned 6,150,000+ files in 3 hours and 10 minutes. The virus files detected showed 0 up until the last file was being scanned. It was powershell.exe. The 0 files detected went
 from 0 to 2. The program stayed on powershell for at least 10 minutes and then finished with a box that asked if I wanted to see the results and I did click on that. Every file listed showed no virus. So I don't know why I got the notice about 2 infected files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I than ran sfc /scannow and the result came back everything was good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to how I get access to the safety scan tool? I still have all of the problems previously mentioned. I tried t use the calendar today and it does the same thing as the calculator. It just flash on the screen and is off.</p>

            <p>I followed the above instructions one more time and got the same results. I booted in safe mode for networking and attempted to download/run security scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Browser shows up with a tab for Microsoft Security Scanner with a blue circle that just keeps going around and around. This is the same result that I have gotten for the last 38 times that I have attempted to run the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom left of the screen (which is totally blank) I get a box that keeps flashing "waiting for Microsoft.com" It flashes 20 or 30 times and then a quick flash of transferring data but nothing else happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left the computer like this for 7 hours and nothing changed. I never got the screen where you are supposed to select Quick Scan or Full Scan.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Today I had to develop a spreadsheet in MS Office 2010. I could not add columns of numbers. I finally tried to save the file.... The program hangs and must be terminated. Then I decided to try MSWord 2010. Same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is an absolute mess. All of the problems that I have reported are due to programming issues within Windows 10. I even tried changing permissions on files. That did not work for me either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my Windows 7 Premium back without losing my programs??Very dissatisfied with Windows 10 update and tech support has been useless. I tried every item they have suggested and nothing works to fix the issues. I do not have a virus.

<p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade&#58; REFERENCE_BY_POINTER BSOD error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> temptriannae.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade&#58; REFERENCE_BY_POINTER BSOD error</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from windows 7 64 bit to windows 10. Before the update of the OS i had no errors or problems on my laptop. Now every time&nbsp;I shut my computer off at night then boot it in the morning I get a BSOD error. This error states that something
 has gone wrong and that information is being sent to Microsoft about the error and that the computer will be automatically restarted once the information is sent. Below that it says to search for REFERENCE_BY_POINTER to find out more information about the
 error HOWEVER it gives no other reference code or error number to go&nbsp;by to pin point what is causing the problem. I did noticed that upon booting my computer from a cold start like this that it's loading fast (showing me the lock screen in under a minute)
 then once I log in and I see my desktop then the error happens. My computer has never loaded this fast before so&nbsp;I wonder if that may be some of the problem but&nbsp;I am not sure. I have windows 10 set to recommended settings which includes this fast boot setting
 so I naturally assume I should leave it. I don't really want to mess with too much before knowing more of what&nbsp;I am dealing with as no other specific code is given (which to me is odd for Microsoft). After it restarts the second time which takes longer to
 boot fully, I have no more problems or errors until&nbsp;I shut it down for the night and start it up the next morning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this problem or has anyone else fixed this problem or know more about it?</p>

            Thank you for the suggestions however none of that was the case nor the answer. After watching it a few days I finally went into settings and disabled the fast start option and I have not had any problems since.

    <title>Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Thumbnails in Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathan sokalski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Thumbnails in Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit</h2>
                    I have Adobe Photoshop 7.0 installed on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit. I would<br />
like to be able to see the thumbnail icons for *.psd and other Photoshop<br />
files like I was with Windows XP. Is there something extra that I need to do<br />
that didn't get done automatically when I installed it? I know that Adobe<br />
Photoshop is a little bit old in comparison to Windows 7, but it didn't give<br />
me any complaints when I installed it, and it hasn't given me any problems<br />
since I installed it, so I would think that if it could show me the<br />
thumbnails in previous versions of Windows, it would be able to in Windows 7<br />
as well. Any ideas? Thanks.<br />

            <p>I believe that there is a way of doing this from within windows.&nbsp; For I have some thumbnails that show, and others that are icons, even within the same folder.&nbsp; (Unfortunatley, I cannot recreate how I discovered the solution).&nbsp; Interestingly enough, this
 is not a problem for Macs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably the easiest Windows solution is to simply use Adobe Bridge for viewing photos.</p>

<h2>            Compatability funtion issues &#40;win 8.1, 64 bit&#41; with &#40;Corel Draw 2017 64 bit&#41; installed</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to a Dell (AMD A8-7410 APU with AMD Radeon R5 graphics 2.2GHz) 64-bit. I upgraded to CorelDraw 2017 with install option of 32 or 64 bit installation. I installed the 64-bit and Corel seems sluggish, slow and hangs up from time to time. I
 also noticed it didn't install Corel in "program files" as all of my past design programs where located. Not sure why?
</p>
<p>Any thoughts or ideas? Thanks in advance, Mike</p>

I haven't tried it yet. I actually installed an older version (CorelX13) that had problems, then installed (CorelX6) I had which didn't have full options I wanted so then bought the new Corel 2017, removed others and installed it. I'm not sure if I should remove
 it and try 32bit or remove and tell it to install in program files area as all the previous?

            Programs designed for either 32 or 64 bit Windows will go to their respective Program files directories. 
<br />
<br />You can at least try it to see how behaves to isolate the problem.

    <title>Different versions of Powershell - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Different versions of Powershell</h2>
                    <p>I want to know the upgrade options available for Windows PowerShell.&nbsp; I wish to script various processes to automate my repetitive keystrokes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier this year I thought I saw a post telling how to identify the current version installed.&nbsp; I seem to find version 1.0 in system32.&nbsp; I tried to run some scripts, but received an error message "..need higher version" ( to that effect ) so I want to upgrade
 the latest possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet search shows versions 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and even 4.5 are out there.&nbsp; I've downloaded them and tried to install but each install says "not compatible".&nbsp; They all appear to be part of Windows Management Console ( with dot.net fx.. features),&nbsp; Now here's
 one curiosity I've found.&nbsp; A TechNet article seems to say WPS is version 3 on WIN8.1 so I'm confused<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d378b8d-c34a-4247-aaaf-9a9ce9488dc7" /></p>

<p>DO NOT reply or use the links in the post from&nbsp;sandymartin10.&nbsp; It's a scam and might lead to trouble.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't know what you mean by "distribution copy," but Microsoft no longer sells Windows 7.&nbsp; You might be able to find a legititmate copy on the web,
 but there are lots of cracked ones as well.&nbsp; Don't buy a stand-alone product key.&nbsp; Avoid eBay.&nbsp; Look to legitimate sources such as Amazon (although care must be taken there as well), and it the price seems too good to be true, it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice.&nbsp; I guess what I call a Distribution Copy is what most call a copy of the program purchased from an authorized retailer on disk.&nbsp; These were new programs on disk which could then be installed on the machine as necessary.&nbsp; It came with
 its own unique activation key that was used to activate and register it once it was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the machine I use most came with Windows 7 installed, but it is starting to have problems with sticking keys a such so I'm thinking I need to replace it.&nbsp; I actually purchased it shortly after the one that came with 8.1 pre-loaded.&nbsp; However,
 there are some business programs that I use that absolutely will not run on any system later than Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I have my old desk top which I've taken out of service that had Win 7.&nbsp; Since it is has been decommissioned I wonder if I could use that copy of Win 7 since I still have the recovery disk and activation key although the machine itself has been
 disassembled and the hard drives wiped.&nbsp; I wonder if that would work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid my only other alternative is to purchase a new machine that comes with Windows 10 and spend way more than I want to replace those business programs.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I bought a laptop for my son that came with Windows 10 and had so much trouble with that
 it to my service tech two days to download and re-install the drives that Win 10 messed up.&nbsp; Bummer!</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice, Bill.&nbsp; Both of the laptops are Toshiba Satellite models purchased about four months apart.&nbsp; I bought the one running 8.1 first then bought the one with Win 7 because I hated the Win 8.1.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my reply to Jim, I've had
 an extremely bad experience with Windows 10 and frankly, a lot of my friends aren't happy with that program either.&nbsp; I suppose that there is always Apple products but I don't care for them either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have a computer that came with Windows pre-installed by the manufacturer, that copy of Windows has an "OEM license."&nbsp; For Windows 7, the evidence of your license is a COA sticker fastened to the computer.&nbsp; The 25-character Product Key shown on that
 COA is used to "activate" Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft sold OEM-licensed copies of Windows to computer manufacturers at a reduced cost (to keep the final cost of the computer lower).&nbsp; In return, the computer manufacturer must provide support (rather than Microsoft) and -- most importantly -- the license
 is valid ONLY for the computer on which it was first installed.&nbsp; That means when the computer dies, the license dies with it.&nbsp; An OEM license is NOT transferable, regardless of the fate of the original computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchased a copy of Windows 7 from a retail vendor (i.e., what you called a "distribution copy"), the Product Key was on the DVD's packaging.&nbsp; The main advantage of a retail-licensed copy of Windows 7 is that it can be used on any computer that meets
 the system requirements, as long as it is only used on one computer at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the "machine that you use most came with Windows 7 installed," it has an OEM license and you can not use the Product Key on the COA affixed to that computer to install Windows 7 on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought what you're calling a "distribution copy" of Windows 7 and installed it on your old decommissioned desktop computer, then you CAN use the Product Key from that copy to install Windows 7 on the new laptop that came with Windows 8.1 -- if Toshiba
 has Windows 7 drivers for that laptop, which it may not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not use the "recovery disk" from that old computer.&nbsp; Rather, download an ISO file and create either a bootable USB flash drive or a bootable DVD.&nbsp; You can use the retail Product Key to download the ISO file here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to create a bootable USB flash drive, you may find it easier to use (free) Rufus with the ISO file:&nbsp;
<a href="https://rufus.ie/en_IE.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rufus.ie/en_IE.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to create a bootable DVD from the ISO file, I suggest (free) ImgBurn:&nbsp;

<p>You can't transfer OEM licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the basic rules in my words:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>

<p>Alas!&nbsp; It appears that by Microsoft no longer selling Windows 7 I'm pretty much stuck with buying a new computer with Windows 10, going with the I have operating on Windows 8.1 or search for one that uses an operating system by a different provider other
 than Microsoft.&nbsp; Unfortunately, regardless of the choice I make, I'm still going to have to replace the programs that won't run on newer than Win 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wouldn't be so bad if&nbsp; Microsoft would have developed a better operating system than Windows 10 or at least fixed the issues with it before they quit selling Windows 7.&nbsp; But I suppose they were in too big of a hurry to push 10 on everyone to worry about
 making sure it worked.&nbsp; Of course, they released 8.0 &amp; 8.1 in between so that shows how great test things before releasing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for all your help.&nbsp; I originally was just looking for a way to purchase a new Windows 7 operating system from Microsoft.&nbsp; It's a shame they don't sell it anymore.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 How to disable the Backspace KEY from functioning as the Back BUTTON</h2>
                    <p>This is completely unacceptable and a very wrong decision. If focus is not in a text box it hitting backspace can throw away a lot work that you have spent time on. This doesn't even help people with low computer use knowledge. Please give a very clear and
 easy way to stop the nonsense of backspace taking you to a previous page!</p>
<p>Put in the settings. I type in Cortana search "backspace", there is not a single setting that relates to setup on my computer. This is awful, STAT!</p>

            Hi Jake
<br />
<br />The simple answer is they can't. What they are selling is volume licence keys, those keys are meant to be used in a company environment where the licence will be re-armed on a regular basis by the companies Key Management Server.
<br />
<br />Those keys will initially activate and will later de-activate, so please, don't waste your money, you would need to purchase legit Windows at a later stage . . .

<h2>            Xbox One Achievements Not Unlocking</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I spoke with someone at Microsoft today and have been having issues on any achievements popping. I have completed multiple achievements and none of them are popping. They all still say locked. Even ones that have been sitting at 99% for a while, I went back
 and completed them only to find out they are still stuck at 99%. I have followed all steps I have found on the internet related to fixing the issue, such as:<br />
<br />
Hard Reset on console<br />
Soft Reset in settings<br />
Clearing Mac Address<br />
Deleting account from xbox one console and reinstalling<br />
Rebooted internet and even disconnected console from internet and reset it<br />
Everything I could find to resolve this and still nothing<br />
<br />
I even talked to a representative at Microsoft and ran through these steps again, and still no luck. He suggested I come here and get some solutions as he had no more ideas on how to fix it. I am half tempted to do a factory reset but I can't imagine this resolving
 it and I'll be stuck with nothing left. He left the service ticket open until I get this resolved and am supposed to contact him with details after it gets resolved.</p>

<p>Also, all of my data under the achievements tab is all 0% under new games that I start, stating enemies killed and progress made etc. The only thing that updates is the time I've spent playing the games.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. I am&nbsp;hoping to get this fixed soon.</p>

<p>Thanks guys. I am glad I am not the only one having these issues. Although, I do hate it at the same time. I am going to call again tonight and see what I can find out. Medguy29, that's a good idea, maybe they can do that? I am honestly out of options at
 this point and feel like if it's been happening for 56 days now that they should have at least issued a statement about it, but maybe it isn't wide spread enough.. &nbsp;Here's to hoping this gets fixed soon.</p>
