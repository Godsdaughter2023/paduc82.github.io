<h2>            Screen flickering in 30 sec time to time</h2>
                    Hi! I updated my pc to windows then for i while ago. For a few days ago updated my windows to a newer patch. After i updated my screen will start flickering for about 30 sec when i turn the pc on and get to the desktop. It will do this from time to time
 later also but not in any pathern. Most of the time is when i open a new program. I Have a dual monitor setup, but i dont think that should matter. Anyone know of a fix for this?

<h2>            Weird cursor movement in Office products after installing build 14257.</h2>
                    <p>So I have build 14257 installed. I opened a spreadsheet I have to make a few changes. This is&nbsp;using Excel 2013. When I clicked a cell to select it,&nbsp;a different&nbsp;cell&nbsp;to the upper left was&nbsp;selected instead.&nbsp;I had to end up using the arrow keys to get to the
 cell I&nbsp;needed to change. After making the changes, I clicked&nbsp;on the X in the upper right corner to close Excel. The box popped up asking if I want to save changes. I clicked on the Save button, but nothing happened. I thought maybe something froze up.&nbsp;I click
 on the title bar of the box&nbsp;to see if I could drag it around and the box jumped down and to the right about an inch. So I'm dragging the box around with the mouse cursor being to the upper&nbsp;left away from the box. I had to tab to the Save&nbsp;button and hit&nbsp;Enter&nbsp;in
 order to save the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started doing the same thing in Word 2013. I typed a few sentences, then tried to click on a word and the mouse cursor&nbsp;showed up&nbsp;to the upper left of where I clicked. This made it almost impossible to select anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does the same thing whether I'm &nbsp;using&nbsp;the mouse or the touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only seems to happen when I'm using an Office products. I've only tried Excel and Word. I rebooted my PC, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.</p>

<p>As soon as Microsoft signs off on a build declaring it the RTM (Release to Manufacturing) build.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insiders in the Fast Ring will probably have already gotten the build a few days earlier.&nbsp; In the past, the Insider Team hasn't said at the time the final build flights that it is the final because they don't know for sure themselves that it will be final
 until they study telemetry and feedback from the field and made sure there are no deal-breaker issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Slow and Release Preview rings usually get the final a few days after Fast Ring for the above reasons.&nbsp; If your Release Preview device gets a new build it
<em>has </em>to be the final because that is the only time RP ring ever gets a build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSFT has some obligations to partners and enterprise customers that involve end-of-quarter triggers so RTM will probably be before the end of this month.&nbsp; That puts us at about a week from RTM if I have that right.&nbsp; That would also leave two-and-a-half weeks
 until the rollout on Oct. 17th.&nbsp; That is cutting it close for all the stakeholders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After RTM is determined there will be no more RS3 builds.&nbsp; Further bug fixes, etc. for the Fall Creators Update will be delivered in a series of cumulative updates.&nbsp; The RTM declaration is a commitment to OEMs and developers that the RTM build number is
 the Fall Creators Update forevermore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you.&nbsp; We are all anxiously watching the build numbers tick by and playing the guessing game.</p>

    <title>automatic time zone adjustment in countries with multiple time zones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denakil  say:</h3>
<h2>            automatic time zone adjustment in countries with multiple time zones</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I went to the Portugeuse Azores islands last month (normally I live in London), and the local time is UTC -1 in the Azores. I noticed that the time on my Lumia 520 didn't automatically adjust to the local time, and stayed on UTC (I restarted many times and
 made sure it was set to automatically adjust; when I travel elsewhere it always adjusts correctly). I'm guessing the reason is that the phone detected I was in Portugal, so it set the time for mainland Portugal which is also on UTC +0? If that is the case:
 does that mean the phone may not be able to adjust to the correct time if I'm in a country with many time zones such as the US, or is it able to work better in larger countries? Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seb</p>

            <p>Carriers in small countries like Portugal may not have time zone info being sent over cellular networks, which is the time source Windows Phone uses first, so the auto time zone may not work.</p>
<p><br />
Speaking as a Canadian whose country spans 6 time zones, and who has travelled in the United States and Australia, two other large countries that span multiple time zones, the feature works their because those towers HAVE to be programmed to send time zone
 info otherwise it would be a really poor experience for the end user. My phone is usually pretty good about changing time when getting off the plane in a new time zone for example.</p>

            Thanks people, I guess as you say it must be the case with timezones with low population that the carrier networks overlook sending time information. I will keep in mind next time I travel.

</p><p>Greg -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the v lucid explanations.&nbsp; I'm new to Windows Defender.&nbsp; Have just set up a task to run a quick scan daily, but hope MS addresses this problem with an urgent fix.&nbsp; Have also set myself a reminder in Outlook to run a full scan once in a while.</p>
<p>Could you clarify one practical point for me?&nbsp; Scans only run when the PC is "idle": does that mean switched on with no apps open, or can you have apps open but just not be using the keyboard or mouse (or downloading stuff)?&nbsp; How long does it take for the
 PC to decide it's in an "idle state" - 10 seconds, 10 minutes or longer?&nbsp; </p>
<p>It's a pain if scans are cancelled and results lost if they're interrupted - would be much better if they could just pause and resume.&nbsp; Don't mind wait the two minutes or so wait while a quick scan runs, but a two-hour delay while a full scan runs would
 be a real hassle.</p>

            <p><span>Only scans that are run by the </span><strong><span>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan
</span></strong><span>task will be interrupted by user activity (mouse or keyboard activity). That includes the daily
</span><strong><span>Automatic Maintenance</span></strong><span> scan and (presumably) any scan that’s created by adding a trigger to the
</span><strong><span>Windows Defender Scheduled Scan </span></strong><span>task </span>
<span>– like </span><span>the one suggested in the Microsoft article. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The </span><em><span>only-on-idle</span></em><span> priority that’s used by
</span><strong><span>Automatic Maintenance </span></strong><span>is designed to prevent the scheduled scan from using system resources while you’re using the PC, and it serves this purpose very well&nbsp;for many users; but it doesn’t really run on a schedule in
 the same way that a classical scheduled task does. So in order to avoid the issue of scans that don’t start at the scheduled time, and that tend to get interrupted by user activity, you need to create an independent task with the
</span><strong><span>Create Basic Task Wizard</span></strong><span>, as described here
</span><span>–</span><span>&nbsp;but without changing the default user account (the local administrator):</span></p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/how-do-i-set-windows-defender-to-a-custom-auto/ec19aab4-10ce-4f41-9990-343056fd104f?page=1"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/how-do-i-set-windows-defender-to-a-custom-auto/ec19aab4-10ce-4f41-9990-343056fd104f?page=1</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That’s because we have an additional reliability issue with any Defender scheduled scan that runs under the
</span><strong><span>System account </span></strong><span>in </span><strong><span>Version 1607</span></strong><span>. Here’s a typical example of an
</span><strong><span>Automatic Maintenance scan</span></strong><span> failure:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>And here’s a typical failure for a scan that’s run with an </span><span>added trigger</span><span>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccbed63f-9da5-4fa1-913f-535fc47df932" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccbed63f-9da5-4fa1-913f-535fc47df932" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also work around both of the issues that I've described&nbsp;here by using a “scheduling” method that doesn’t actually require a scheduled task. I’ve personally repurposed my old
</span><strong><span>Startup Shortcut method </span></strong><span>for</span><span>&nbsp;keeping everything nicely up-to-date.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

                    I am trying to print coupons but it looks like MSE is not allowing me to do so.&nbsp; What can I do?&nbsp; I want to allow the coupon exe file to run or I want to uninstall MSE.&nbsp; How can I do anyone of them?

            <p>Hi GKhaled,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're certain MSE is the cause, then we can exclude the file and/or process from scans.&nbsp; If that works, then it was MSE and the exclusion will solve the problem (but open a tiny hole in your security regarding the exclusion, so please don't get into
 a habit of excluding things).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do it, open MSE and go to the Settings tab and click on excluded files/folder and exclude that file by it's full path.&nbsp; Then click on excluded processes and exclude the file there as well.&nbsp; That should do the trick.&nbsp; If not, either some other file or
 process is being blocked by MSE or MSE is not to blame.&nbsp; Go to the History tab and try to see what it detected.&nbsp; If it shows nothing, then the chances it may not be MSE but something else (the web site, the coupon program, or the browser settings for example)
 stopping the process.&nbsp; How do you know it is MSE doing this?&nbsp; Do you get a message identified as coming from MSE saying the action was blocked or some other way?&nbsp; What exactly happens when you press the button to print the coupons - everything that happens
 or doesn't happen in the order it occurs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check this, close anything using the internet (email and anything else) except the one browser window with the one tab where you request printing of the coupons to minimize risks while you are unprotected.&nbsp; Then go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time
 protection and uncheck the box at the top to turn it off, save the changes and MSE should go from a green border to a red border and the Home Tab should indicate you are not protected and there should be a big Start button.&nbsp; Now with MSE disabled, print your
 coupons.&nbsp; If they work, then MSE is likely the cause and we need to find something else or something different to exclude.&nbsp; If they still don't work, then MSE is not the cause.&nbsp; In either case, check the box for real-time protection and save the changes and
 if necessary hit the start button on the home page of MSE to get protection up and running again and everything back to green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If MSE is proven not to be the cause, then remove the exclusions you added earlier and we may need to refer you elsewhere to seek out the problem.&nbsp; If MSE is the problem, then open Task Manager and go to processes and see if you can spot the process being
 used when you try to print the coupons in case it is a different file than the program file.&nbsp; Also, try printing something else using the browser to make sure it is only an issue printing those coupons and not with printing anything else&nbsp;(to rule out the printer).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't help, then please post back with results of what you tried and answers to any questions asked, the version of Windows you are using, the name and version of the browser you are using, the name and version of the program that installed or
 uses coupon.exe, and a link to the website where you are trying to print the coupons so I can see if I can reproduce the problem or find the cause or a workaround.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>

    <title>Calculate number of working days in a given year - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Calculate number of working days in a given year</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm trying to find a way to calculate the number of working days in a year. I know about the NETWORKDAYS function. To use it though, I believe I have to enter (either in the formular or in 2 separate cells), for example January 1st, 2016 and December 31st,
 2016. For waht I'm doing that would be a workaround. For my purpose, it would be simpler and more elegant if I can find a way to do the calculation based simply on the year. i.e., my sheet has the yeaer 2016 in a cell and my formula calculates, on the basis
 of the year alone, how many working days there are in 2016.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<br />
<br />Hello Alex
<br />
<br />Answer: Absolutely.
<br />
<br />How can you tell? Hover over the link in the message to see where the link actually points to. In this case you'll see that it points to link that has nothing to do with Microsoft. Another way to verify a link is to right-click on it, select &lt;Copy&gt; and paste it in any text editor (i.e. Notepad). (applies equally to any message that appears to come from other major companies such as PayPal, Amazon etc)
<br />
<br />The link 
<br /><a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Reactivate</a>
<br />
<br />actually points to the following domain - (am not going to include the full link since it would serve no purpose in this response)
<br />
<br />login.outlook-mail-microsoftonlnecom.help-office-pejsg.dynv6.net
<br />
<br />Note: if your account was really suspended, you wouldn't be able to log into it normally (normally = using your browser without clicking on the link in the message)

Microsoft won't use such an attitude if you don't do this or that the account will be suspended. <br />You can check the link if you copy the link and paste it into notepad for example you will see that the link will be different.<br /><br />I hope this helps! <br /><br />Regards,<br />Kristina

http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change all the objects from "floating" to "In Line with Text", use this macro:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Sub AllShapesInline()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim shpNum As Long<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With ActiveDocument.Shapes<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For shpNum = .Count To 1 Step -1<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next shpNum<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To remove them instead of making them In Line with Text, use this macro. It will remove both graphic objects and text boxes.</p>

    <title>How to populate a table which populates the dropdown list it is based - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supertechnician  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to populate a table which populates the dropdown list it is based on...</h2>
                    Hello all,<br />
I have a database that manages the data from insect data labels from a museum collection.&nbsp; I have a data entry form (see attached picture) that I use to enter the data from each insect label.&nbsp; For keeping track of host information, I have a table of valid host
 names which populates a drop down list in the data entry form.&nbsp; However, occassionally I come across a host that is not in my host table.&nbsp; I would like to be able to type the name of the 'new' host in the data form , and have the data form both populate the
 tbl_Host_Species table so that name is now available on the dropdown list, as well as populate the collection records table using the 'Host_ID' generated as the autonumber in the Host_Species table.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to do this in a relatively simple way.&nbsp;
 I think there are several ways to do this such as adding a button to the form which allows an update to the Host species table, or embedding a subform into the main form which allows for new data to be enetered, but to be honest I'm not sure the best way to
 program this.&nbsp; I hope this makes sense and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
JimH<br />

            Inserting a new row into tbl_Host_Species is very simple as Access provides a mechanism expressly for this in the form of the combo box's NotInList event procedure, for which the code would be:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />

I'm assuming that Host_Species_ID is the primary key of tbl_Host_Species and is an autonumber.<br />
<br />
However, I note that your form also has a Host Category combo box control, but I don't see this as a column anywhere in the model.&nbsp; In which table is this attribute represented?&nbsp; If it is a column in tbl_Host_Species then the above code would not be suitable,
 and would need to be replaced by code which opens a form bound to tbl_Host_Species in dialogue mode and passes the NewData value to it, ready for the Host Category value to be entered, or more likely selected from a combo box's list drawn from a HostCategories
 table.&nbsp; You'll find an example of this in NotInList.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
Also I do not understand what you mean by <i>'as well as populate the collection records table using the 'Host_ID' generated as the autonumber in the Host_Species table'&nbsp;</i> Firstly the Host_Species table does not appear to have a Host_ID column - did you
 mean Host_Species_ID?&nbsp; More fundamentally, however, the tbl_Collection_Records table does not reference the tbl_Host_Species table.&nbsp; It references the tbl_Host_Synonym table, which itself references tbl_Host_Species.<br />
<br />
Your model suggests that there can be multiple rows in tbl_Host_Synonym referencing each row in tbl_Host_Species; unless the relationship type between them is one-to-one, in which case tbl_Host_Synonym would be redundant as the two tables can be merged into
 one.&nbsp; If this is not the case, however, there is no way in which the foreign key column in tbl_Collection_Records (Host_Synonym_ID) can be assigned a value following the insertion of a new row into tbl_Host_Species until at least one row referencing the new
 row in tbl_Host_Species has been inserted into tbl_Host_Synonym.<br />

            Hi Ken and Tim, thanks for getting back to me, I greatly appreciate it.<br />
Ken: You are probably right that some of my tables can be merged and condensed.&nbsp; This database has been a long learning curve, and I have been updating parts of the database as I have been going along.&nbsp; The reason I originally had the synonym table was because
 there would be the 'verbatim' host species written on the insect label, however, that original name could potentially be out of use and a new one in its place. So what I did was have the original name in the collection records, linked through a synonym table,
 and the current host latin name linked to it in the Host Table.&nbsp; However, there is some redundancy because you need multiple records in the synonym table to capture the 'old' name and the current name.&nbsp; For example:<br />
<br />
Collection Record&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synonym Table&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Host Table<br />
Picea excelsa &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picea excelsa &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picea abies<br />
Picea abies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picea abies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picea abies<br />
<br />
It even gets more difficult when there are multiple synonyms for the same host species.<br />
Regarding the Host category column, I only have 3 categories at the moment (unknown, host, flower), so I have these listed as 'Row Source' elements, and use the Value List as the Row source Type.<br />
I'll try and see if I can merge the synonym table with the host table.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Arising from your last post there are a number of points:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; As you say there can be multiple synonyms per host species you cannot merge the synonyms and hosts tables.&nbsp; There is a one-to-many relationship type from the latter to the former as your model correctly reflects.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Data should never be stored as a value&nbsp; list.&nbsp; A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle (Codd's Rule #1).&nbsp; This requires that all data be stored as values at column positions in rows in tables, and in no other
 way.&nbsp; Where the data represents a set of values which are immutably fixed in the external works, e.g. days of the week or months of the year, then the use of a value list is permissible, but that is not the case here, so you should have a HostCategories table.&nbsp;
 This would be referenced by the HostSpecies table.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; So, one possible model would be like this:<br />
<br />
CollectionRecords&gt;----HostSynonyms&gt;----HostSpecies&gt;----HostCategories<br />
<br />
In this model the CollectionRecords table consequently needs only a foreign key referencing a row of the HostSynonyms.&nbsp; It then maps via the relationships to a single row in each of HostSynonyms, HostSpecies and HostCategories.&nbsp; For data entry into CollectionRecords
 you would then need only a combo box for the foreign key HostSynonymID column as you show in your diagrammatic model.&nbsp; The host name and category would then be shown in read-only text box controls in the form.&nbsp; The frmContacts form in my NotInList demo is
 a direct analogy as this contains a city combo box, but the referenced region in which the city is located is shown automatically in a text box bound to the City column in the Cities table, to which the Contacts table is joined in the form's RecordSource query.&nbsp;
 This could be extended to show a country for instance, if the database also contained a Countries table.<br />
<br />
With this model inserting a new host species requires that a new row must be inserted into HostSynonyms first.&nbsp; This can be done via the HostSynonymID&nbsp; combo box's NotInList event procedure, which would open a form based on HostSynonyms, which would contain
 a combo box for selecting a host species value, the NotInList event procedure of this would similarly open a form based on HostSpecies, which would contain a combo box for selecting a category, whose NotInList event procedure would directly insert a row in
 to the HostCategories table in the way I described in my first reply.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; There is however another possible model, which is one where the CollectionRecords table would reference the HostSpecies table directly, i.e. the species would be identified by its formal taxonomic Latin name, so a row in CollectionRecords would map to all
 possible synonyms for the selected host species.<br />
<br />
CollectionRecords&gt;----HostSpecies&gt;----HostCategory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-----------&lt;HostSynonyms<br />
<br />
In this model the combo box in the CollectionRecords&nbsp; data entry form would be bound to a HostSpeciesID foreign key column, and the HostSpecies form opened from its NotInList event procedure to insert a previously unrecorded host species would have, in addition
 to a combo box bound to HostCategoryID, a subform, in continuous forms view, listing all the synonyms for the species in question.&nbsp; The subform would be linked to the parent form on HostSpeciesID.<br />
<br />
It's perhaps worth my mentioning in passing that, while my working life has largely been in environmental planning, I did undertake post-graduate training in museum studies, and worked as a museum curator for the first part of my career.&nbsp; So, I'm not unfamiliar
 with these sort of models, though my area of study differed from yours.&nbsp; Your post does have a special interest to me therefore.<br />

            Hi Ken, thanks again for all of your advice, I greatly appreciate it.<br />
I am going to take some time and examine the different model scenarios you have proposed and see what I can do streamline my database, and see if I can apply these models to other parts of the database.&nbsp;
<br />
I have found the most difficult part of putting together the database is the large number of 'many to one' relationships, which occurs in both my insect taxa and host tables, as well as the locality data.&nbsp; The problem I have encountered repeatedly is whether
 the database should capture the 'actual' data, or simply 'interpreted data'.&nbsp; This is the reason I have a&nbsp; larger number of tables than would be normally seen in a more 'static' type of data structure. Our data in the short term is going to be used to create
 a print publication on the beetles of Canada and Alaska.&nbsp; Within the publication we would like to create range maps for the distribution of all the species.&nbsp; Seems easy, however, for example we have locality information such as:<br />
Alberta, Edmonton<br />
Alberta, Edmonton, Millwoods<br />
Alberta, Edmonton, University of Alberta<br />
Alberta, Edmonton, 3714 - 118 Avenue....etc.&nbsp; For each of these localities for mapping purposes I have created a single latitude-longitude point called 'Edmonton' as at the scale of map we are using the differences between each specific location is negligible.&nbsp;
 However, we also need to keep the actual coordinate as written on the label (these data could be used in the future if we ever decide to link this data to the internet).&nbsp; When it comes to taxonomy its worse, because species names can change repeatedly, however,
 you need to track the progression of the name changes.&nbsp; <br />
I'm curious, what kind of museum curation have you had experience with?<br />

            Firstly do not be surprised at the number of tables you have.&nbsp; The more common mistake is to have too few and introduce redundancy.<br />
<br />
The traditional Linnaean classification, being a tree in the mathematical sense, in that there is only one path between each node, is very straightforward to model as it is simply represented by a set of tables in one-to-many relationship types from Kingdom
 down to Species.&nbsp; The one thing which does not fit into the tree is the Authority, as the relationship type for this is in the other direction, being many-to-one from Species to Authorities.&nbsp; So having established the set of tables from Kingdom down to Genus
 for the types of species with which you are concerned, along with a table of Authorities in which each authority is represented by one row, a Species table would then have foreign keys GenusID and AuthorityID referencing the keys of the Genus and Authorities
 tables.&nbsp; As genus determines Family, and Family determines Order and so on up the tree, each row in Species maps to a single row at every level of the hierarchy right up to Kingdom.<br />
<br />
Modelling locations can similarly be done as a simple tree-structured hierarchy, provided that each level of the location is discretely contained within the next level up.&nbsp; For this reason we use administrative geographical units, with civil parish as the smallest,
 ranging upwards through districts and counties to countries, the UK being composed of 3 countries, England, Scotland and Wales (which make up Great Britain) plus the province of Northern Ireland.&nbsp; So only the civil parish need be recorded in any table of locations.&nbsp;
 There is a fly in the ointment, however, in that urban districts have no parish structure, and districts which are unitary authorities are not administratively within any county, so it is necessary to have rows with N/A values at these levels to maintain the
 'chain'.&nbsp; You'll find an example of how to handle these sort of models by means of correlated combo boxes as ComboDemo.zip in my SkyDrive folder.<br />
<br />
As regards the latitude/longitude references for locations, if you have a single intersection for a group of locations then I'd simply include two additional columns for the actual values, so you might have four columns, NominalLongitude, NominaLatitude, ActualLongitude,
 ActualLatitude.&nbsp; Here we don't normally use longitude and latitude for location, but the Ordnance Survey National Grid Reference (NGR).&nbsp; This, as its name suggests is based on a grid covering the whole of the UK, with its origin somewhere to the south-west
 of the Scilly Isles, these being the most south-westerly land in the UK.&nbsp; Normally we recorded locations to a precision of 10 metres, though we had to pad this with two zeros as our GIS required values to a precision of 0.1 metres.&nbsp; but being a decimal system
 it is very easy to compute to a lower precision then this by simple integer division of the eastings and northings.&nbsp; It's one of the advantages of being a small country that a grid like this can be used as for most purposes we can, without undue distortion,
 project land surface over a flat plain, rather than having to use spherical trigonometry to allow for the curvature of the surface.<br />
<br />
I'm an archaeologist BTW, or rather a retired archaeologist working in environmental planning rather than an academic context.&nbsp; Archaeology unfortunately has no formal classification system like biology, and attempts to devise classifications for archaeological

<h2>            Excel looks too large</h2>
                    <p>Hi team,<br />
<br />
I am having an issue with Excel and the way it looks in Windows 10. Everything looks really large, when compared to other Windows programs. And I am not talking about the zoom settings. The entire program is very large including the scroll bars, the ribbons,
 everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>See image below to see what I mean. notice how much larger everything in Excel looks? I'm not sure how to fix this. I notice that when I open excel, it's fine, but then when I open other excel files, everything changes and all of the documents I have open
 are large like this. Is there something I maybe have changed but did not realize it? Any help would be appreciated. It might have something to do with the fact that I am using dual monitors.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Joseph,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suppose you are mentioning that the Video tile doesn’t appear in Office 365 portal(
<a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com</a> ). If it is the scenario, could you please clarify what Office 365 subscription you are using, as some subscriptions don’t contain the Office 365 video service? For details, refer to:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office-365-platform-service-description.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office-365-platform-service-description.aspx</a>.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your subscription includes this service, please also check if you can find the Video app from this URL:
<a href="https://portal.office.com/myapps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/myapps</a> . If yes, you can pin it to the app launcher.

<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            The capacity of&nbsp;rechargeable&nbsp;batteries can diminish with time. It sounds like your battery may have reached the end of it's life and you may need to get a new one.&nbsp;

            <p>Kristopher,</p>
<p>That's the way Project works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project is a dynamic scheduling program. When you create a plan, and just before you are ready to start execution, you need to save a baseline (Project &gt; schedule group &gt; Set baseline). There are several baselines fields (e.g. Baseline Start, Baseline Finish,
 Baseline Duration, etc.) that store your original plan so that the data can be used for variance analysis after the program starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you enter an actual start date in the Actual Start field, Project adjusts the plan to agree with reality. There is no point in having a active plan that still carries outdated information as part of the on-going activities. Right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> deadpoolnoni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 for Mac Keeps Freezing &#91;SOLVED&#93;</h2>
                    <p>I bought Office for Mac 2016 &nbsp;a year or so ago (upgrade from 2011 Office) and always got the spinning ball of death for a good minute or two upon opening Outlook. &nbsp;I put up with it for a while, but eventually lost my mind and sought out a solution. &nbsp;Here's
 the solution to what my problem was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to my calendar and did an advanced search.</p>
<p>Leave the fields blank, but select recurring events</p>
<p>The search should show multiple recurring event (some you want and some you don't)<br />
For me, there were many duplicates of recurring events which made my system hang.</p>
<p>I went back to the earliest events (2012 in my case) and deleted them.</p>
<p>After getting rid of all the duplicates and rebooting the program, problem was solved.</p>
<p>I have not seen the spinning ball of death in about a month and I use my MS Office very frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>

    <title>The setup routines for the Microsoft Excel ODBC driver could not be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyler lagrange  say:</h3>
<h2>            The setup routines for the Microsoft Excel ODBC driver could not be found. Please re-install the driver.</h2>
                    
<p>I'll start with a little background on the issue.</p>
<p>We have an excel sheet that runs a report and get it's data from a database. The database that it gets the data from was recently moved to a different shared instance. I am now having issues setting up a new connection to the shared instance that the database
 now resides on. When I try to go in to try to add an ODBC I only have an option to setup a SQL server connection (No option to setup an Excel Files ODBC). If I try to configure the existing Excel Files ODBC I get the error "The setup routines for the Microsoft
 Excel Driver ODBC driver could not be found. Please re-install the driver." Once I click "OK" on that error another one pops up saying "Errors found: The specified DSN contains an architecture mismatch between the driver an application." I have tried re-installing
 the drivers. I have also tried re-registering the ODBCConf.dll. The system is running Windows 7 Enterprise (x64), has 6GB of RAM, an Intel Xeon E5620 (2.4GHz) and the version of office is Office 2010 Pro. It is connected to 4 wall mounted LCD monitors that
 display different information - one of the screens happened to be the excel report. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

    <title>How do you turn off subtotals in an Excel 2010 pivot table&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gch330  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you turn off subtotals in an Excel 2010 pivot table&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I work in pivot tables a lot.&nbsp; Everytime I add a field to the pivot table, I am having to go into 'Field Settings', on the 'Subtotals &amp; Filters' tab I have to select 'None' under Subtotals (always defaults to 'Automatic').&nbsp; I would love to find a way to
 default this field setting to 'None' so that I don't have to repeat this same task for every field I put into the pivot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Greg</p>

    <title>Not able to sign in into One Note using microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dinilmohan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to sign in into One Note using microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I used to login and sync my notes from onenote, with the cloud using my Microsoft account. Recently after my machine was formatted, I reinstalled oneNote. On trying to start the application, I am asked to sign in which is expected. However when providing
 my Microsoft account user name which is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, it says " This doesn't look like a work or school email. You can't sign in here with a personal account. Use your work or school account instead."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was searching for this error and came across this article where I could change the sign in behavior using the registry key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj715259.aspx#section2</p>
<p>
</p><p>However providing a value of 0 or 1 does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can some one help?</p>

<p>Try this detour:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com</a>&nbsp;,login with your MS account, navigate to your notebook, open it in
<strong>OneNote Online</strong>, then click on <strong>Open in OneNote</strong>.</p>

<p>I tried that. Trying to open in One Note again asks me to sign in.</p>
<p>However one interesting development. The version of OneNote now available is 2016 which has the problem. I was using 2013 before my machine was formatted.</p>
<p>So I installed OneNote 2013 and I was able to login using my MS acount without any issues and sync my notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Conclusion: Either a bug in 2016 onenote or MS is moving in the direction of making OneNote a paid application again.</p>
