<p><span>Hello leemex,</span></p>
<p><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Since
 when is this happening?</span></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Is
 it limited to any particular application?</span></p>
<p><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Is
 it a laptop or a desktop?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you are using a laptop, try</span><strong><span>decreasing
 the sensitivity</span></strong><span> of the touchpad and check:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Go
 to the 'control panel'.</span></p>
<p><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Then
 select 'mouse'.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Choose
 the &gt; 'device settings' tab, then click 'settings'.</span></p>
<p><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>You
 need to change either &gt; the 'tapping' (to disable tapping - meaning you can no longer use the &gt; touchpad itself as a button for the mouse) or 'sensitivity' to decrease &gt; the sensitivity of the touchpad.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If not, Uninstall and reinstall the driver:</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
Uninstall the driver from Device Manager, and then scan for new hardware to install the driver again.<br />
<br />
You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last time that you set up the device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware Wizard which may ask for
 the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the device Properties
 dialog box, click the<strong><span>Driver</span></strong> tab, and then click<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>. Follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open Device Manager,
 click<strong><span>Action</span></strong>, and then click<strong><span>Scan for hardware changes</span></strong>. Follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

    <title>Wacom Tablet Pen Behavior is really weird after Fall Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leopoldott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wacom Tablet Pen Behavior is really weird after Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Before the Fall Update, the Pen behavior was like a mouse(Click and drag to select text) but now it behaves like FingerInput (Click and drag is now scrolling) which really disrupts productivity (as my pen is a replacement for the mouse and not an enhancement).
 Also, it completely breaks Onenote, especially if you write handwritten Notes. There is a small delay before Windows ink realizes it has to draw instead of scrolling. Another annoying fact is that the cursor is always a pointer and not a point as usual.
</p>
<p>Please comment too if you experience the same issues, as the newest Insider builds dont really have any fixes or "revert to old behavior" options and the devs dont really seem to care all that much</p>

<p>Hey man I'm experiencing the same thing. I wasn't sure what was going on at first but now it seems that some things have changed (once again) with MS's treatment of Wacom input. After years of having to deal with annoying cursor rings everything seemed to
 be ok for a while and now this. </p>
<p>When using a webbrowser, my pen now functions as if I'm touching my finger on a touchscreen? I don't have a tablet PC, my PC is just a desktop and I use my Wacom almost exclusively to operate it (like 80% Wacom pen, 20% mouse).<br />
I can't use the Wacom pen anymore in a webbrowser to select text, because it starts scrolling the page instead (and then on release it starts selecting stuff all over the page). This is not behaviour we want from a Wacom pen Microsoft! The pen should behave
 just like a mouse, not like touching your finger!<br />
I also had to jump through hoops to get the press and hold for right click to disable, because I could only disable it for pen but apparently it was still enabled (somewhere?) for touch. And apparently Wacom pen=touch now in the deranged minds of MS devs so
 I had to go into the registry to disable it for touch as well, because I don't have any touch-related options in my Windows settings (but apparently, the options are still active regardless).
</p>
<p>Please</p>
<p>Stop</p>
<p>Messing</p>
<p>With</p>

<p>It has been very frustrating but I'm making progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now having to set up different profiles for each application under tablet properties. For me, Chrome works best with Windows Ink unchecked in Grip Pen Mapping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Premiere Pro I've suddenly started having problems picking up the edges of clips on the timeline, forcing me to zoom in sometimes. Didn't happen before the Creators update.</p>

            It just disabled the "press and hold for right click" behaviour for my Wacom pen. (I have the side switch of the pen already set up for right click) The other issues still remain.

<p>I, too, am frustrated that my Wacom pen doesn't behave the way it did in Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft, we artists and other Wacom pen users do NOT use the pen as a replacement for our fingers, but as a much more agile mouse that uses pressure detection. Changing the pen from a mouse-like input tool to a fingertip replacement is actually EXTREMELY
 counterproductive. When we've been used to using a tool in a certain way, and suddenly find ourselves unable to use it because of a change in OS, it causes a lot of wasted time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've found out how to set the pen as a selector in most of the Office suite, and this isn't an issue in my usual art programs, but it IS a problem in my browsers and in Adobe Acrobat - basically anything that has text, which I can't select; Gmail, on
 which I assign labels but no longer can't by clicking the label and drag it onto the email; and the supposed workaround of NOT using Windows Ink in the Wacom properties panel is actually disabling pressure sensitivity in my art programs without fixing the
 issues in the browsers. Not to mention that using the side button will cause regular clicking to not function properly in the programs that treat the pen like touch, until I click it enough times or do the press and hold technique to activate the right click
 so the sub-menu pop up, which resets the pen tapping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All we are asking for is for an option to tell the computer to either read the pen as a mouse with pressure sensitivity, or as a finger replacement. Make it a simple radio button in the Pen and Ink section of Windows 10. "Treat pen input as touch / as traditional
 pen input". Some people might like to keep the pen like a touch replacement and that's fine, but if you just gave us back the option to have our pen input the way it used to be, we would all be so much happier. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kanthara</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now 'down-dated' to the 1703 build of Windows 10 and life is sweet again. It was a huge pain in the backside to do, but worth it. I can help you with image files if you want to do the same but you need to wipe your OS disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At a recent creative expo I spoke to a Wacom ambassador who advised me never to update to the very latest version of Windows. He always uses a version two iterations old because the bugs that come with the new one are never worth the tiny developments you
 will get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good advice, I think. So I'll keep 1703 for another six to twelve months at least.</p>

<p>Hi Martyn,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got this laptop in December and I've never experienced the previous version of Windows 10. I'm not exactly sure how I'd go about getting to an older build of Windows 10 without bringing it back to factory settings, then preventing it from updating, or
 if this laptop even came with a previous version of Windows that doesn't include the Fall Creators Update since it's pretty new. As I'm currently on a storyboard contract, I can't really afford the time to do a wipe and reinstall of my laptop and all its software
 right now, but I'd be happy to get some information on how to do this soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>- Karine</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those lines suggest either Graphics Driver corruption or failing Graphics Hardware.</p>
<p>Monitor &gt; Cable &gt; Port on Computer &gt; which is either connected&nbsp;to a&nbsp;Graphics Card in a slot on the Motherboard&nbsp;or to&nbsp;Onboard Graphics Hardware which is part of the&nbsp;Motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to either your Computer or Graphics Card&nbsp;Manufacturer's website &gt; look for a Drivers and Download Section &gt;&nbsp;look for your Computer or Graphics Card Model Number&nbsp;&gt; your Operating System &gt;&nbsp;Drivers for it: either Video / Graphics / Chipset (depending on
 wording there)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;download and install the Drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not fix it, it would then appear to be a&nbsp;Graphics Hardware problem.</p>
<p>If a Desktop, either swap your Graphics Card with a good one.</p>
<p>Or if Onboard Graphics , you will have to install a Graphics Card in a slot in the Motherboard to see if that fixes the problem.</p>
<p>

<h2>            ESENT Event ID&#58; 623 I need a permanent fix for this persistent problem.</h2>
                    


I'm using Windows 7 Pro x64 on a standalone computer and I access data files on a Windows Server 2003 R2 computer. All files are up to date on both machines. I'm getting an ESENT error Event ID 623 with the following message: 



The wuaueng.dll (444) SUS20ClientDataStore: The version store for this instance (0) has reached its maximum size of 32Mb. It is likely that a long-running transaction is preventing cleanup of the version store and causing it to build up in size. Updates will be rejected until the long-running transaction has been completely committed or rolled back. 



It was suggested that I register the dll which I did and that eliminated the error message for about one day. Now it's back. Does anybody have a way for me to find out what the **** is causing this problem so that I can actually fix it?

 was assigned to&nbsp;<strong>F:</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>E:</strong> was assigned to my pen drive). When I right-clicked the deleted folder in the Recycle Bin and clicked Restore, the folder was being restored to the USB pen drive (E:), so I hit cancel because the USB
 drive could not hold 4GB more. When I canceled the Restore operation, the folder being restored disappeared from the Recycle Bin! I have been trying desperately to recover the lost folder from the Recycle Bin. I've been using Recuva software to deep scan the
 external hard drive for recoverable files but to no avail. Any help would be appreciated!

    <title>TV channels suddenly disappeared from WMC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            TV channels suddenly disappeared from WMC</h2>
                    I have been using Windows Media Center&nbsp;(Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit) to watch TV (local digital broadcast for zip 29414) for almost a year. It has been functioning great. A couple weeks ago, however, I have lost some channels which&nbsp;show on regular TV sets. I
 have rescanned the channels from scratch a couple times now.&nbsp;The channels are shown after the TV Setup, they are indicated as having good signal strength, however the screen is blank, no picture, no sound&nbsp;then I get a no signal error. I feel this is a funky
 setup problem with the frequencies, but do not know how to access them manually. Can you help me with this?

<p>Thanks to Tyborg from&nbsp; the other forum (<a href="http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/p/93362/483999.aspx#483999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/p/93362/483999.aspx#483999</a>) the problem is now solved. He was in contact with&nbsp;Jasonl at silicondust, who found
 out that&nbsp;WITV was broadcasting with the wrong TSID. They were supposed to be using 2557, but they re instead using 2569. PBS engineers rock for listening to&nbsp;Tyborg and fixing their broadcast unlike many other stations.</p>
<p>There is a greater lesson here, however. Now we know that WMC identifies the presence of signal&nbsp;via checking the TSID, and if it does not match with the guide then it sends a no signal error.&nbsp;Microsoft engineers! Could it be fixed? Maybe some notification
 to the user that there is a broadcast on the channel but the TSID does not match the guide?&nbsp;Maybe an automatic system to notify the the broadcast station engineers? Maybe no check at all? This is a major loophole, and a bigtime trouble for all of us. This
 might be a good lesson to everybody who gets the channel line-up in the guide but the actual channel&nbsp;reports no signal.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below steps to uninstall Maps app in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Press <strong>Windows Key + Q</strong>, and in the search box, type PowerShell.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> From results, right click on <strong>Windows PowerShell</strong> and select
<strong>Run as administrator </strong>option.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage </strong>and press Enter.</p>
<p>(This command will output a long list of all installed apps containing lots of information about each app).</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage | Select Name, PackageFullName
</strong>and press Enter.</p>
<p>(This command will show only the name of the app and its PackageFullName information).</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. Select the PackageFullName information of the desired app and copy it.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage
</strong>and press Enter.</p>
<p>(This command is to remove the app from the system, replace <strong>PackageFullName</strong> with the copied information with
<strong>Step 5</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you want to remove <strong>Maps app</strong>, the command to remove it will be as following:</p>
<strong>
<p>Get-AppxPackage *Maps* | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7.</strong> Wait till completion of the command, and check if the app is uninstalled, if not
<strong>restart</strong> the system and </p>
<p>check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:</p>
<p>If you want to uninstall the app from all user accounts, use the following command format:</p>
<strong>
<p>Get-AppxPackage -allusers PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to remove the app from any particular user account, use following command:</p>
<p><strong>Get-AppxPackage -user username PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage</strong></p>
<p>(Replace username in the above command with the correct user account name).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information helps, do reply if you need further assistance.</span>
</p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

 me reinstall it. </p>

            I couldn't uninstall it either, but you can make it work. go to the store, and where it says it is installed, there should be a button to launch it. when it is open on your desktop, there will be an an icon in the taskbar (windows 10). right click the
 icon and pin it to your start menu. now you can get into the program and use it.<br />

            <p>I'm sorry, but the version that is currently installed doesn't work.&nbsp; Clicking on "launch it" in the store app will not launch the version that's in the store, it will launch your currently installed version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that following the instructions from the previous post but using....<br />
<br />
get-appxpackage "*Maps*" </p>
<p>
</p><p>will find the Microsoft.WindowsMaps program and</p>
<p>
</p><p>get-appxpackage "*Maps"|remove-appxpackage</p>
<p>
</p><p>will remove it.&nbsp; at which point you can reinstall it from the store.&nbsp; bad news is if you problem is in your maps settings they will be restored when maps is reinstalled.&nbsp; If the store version of maps is newer than the version you had installed it may have
 fixed the issue, if not you'll still see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I need to know now is How can I remove ALL of the Microsoft.WindowsMaps application and settings so that a new install of Maps from the store results in a default setup.<br />
<br />
My desktop version of windows 10 has something set somewhere that makes Maps think it had a highly accurate location value at one point in time 40 miles north of my house.&nbsp; So if location services is turned on Maps lists my current location there no matter
 what else I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my Surface 3 4g Lte sometimes the GNSS driver goes nuts and has seriously detrimental effects on Maps.&nbsp; doing a hardware reset (shutdown the surface, press and hold volume up and the power button&nbsp; or some such voodoo) seems to take care of it.&nbsp; (you
 may have to delete the GNSS device from device manager and then do the hardware reset and let it discover it again if the hardware reset doesn't work on it's own)</p>

<p>I know! Modern Microsoft seems to be nothing but a 'baffle with ****' company. I literally cannot remember the last time that a Microsoft site or one of these Microsoft morons was able to actually help me with a ****-up in THEIR system! I'm not a violent
 man, but Windows 10 has frustrated me so much over the last couple of horrible years, that I have vowed to punch any person whom I meet who claims to work for this excuse for a company. I am yet to understand how lumbering me with a half-finished, feature
 down-graded (have you tried using WIndows Mail - it literally is missing half of the functionality that most email apps have - including some of Microsoft's own previous versions - had for the last 10 years!!&nbsp; Maybe that's why they called it Windows 10 - because
 that's how far back in time in terms of functionality I feel like my computer has gone. If this was a car - it would have been recalled, and the president of the company would be seriously considering offering their resignation - instead we have to watch a
 bunch of smug bastards showing off even more new half-finished features, YET still not repairing or finishing the ones that most of us use in our day to day lives (I mean surely even using the word 'browser' around MS Edge is fraudulent - half-finished piece
 of crap that 95% of the world's Windows 10 users wish would just **** off and die). Add the heavily monopolistic practices of this company and you have to wonder why they haven't had some extremely heavy fines thrown at them. Given modern-day Microsoft practices
 though, it wouldn't surprise me if they just bribed the right people to ensure that doesn't happen (again!). Meantime Microsoft employees continue to 'support' by giving meaningless advice (though I was actually surprised to even see a Microsoft employee attempting
 to offer a way to remove Maps - considering that Microsoft themselves don't want you removing it from your device, for some reason they believe it is their right to ensure that they always know exactly where you are!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't wait for the first UWP virus to wipe the smug look of these bastard's faces... I reckon about another 3 months and they won't be smiling quite so much... bit like Windows 10 users really! Ironic.</p>

<p>The reason is that Microsoft are a bunch of monopilistic turds who seem to think that as you use their OS on YOUR computer, that for some reason that they now own your computer and can do whatever they like with it. Imagine if engine manufacturers acted
 that way. Or even petrol companies! Or the electric company, or the water company...or basically any company that isn't Microsoft or one of the other evil 4 (Google, Facebook, Apple and Samsung).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to remove Maps is to download either Linux Mint or Linux Deepin, backup all your personal files, format whatever drive you've got Win 10 on, then install a Linux distro on it instead. Then breathe a sigh of relief as you realise that yesterday
 was the last day on which you will ever have to put up with insecure, half-baked piles of cr.app again, and that you now own your computer again, and that ALL of your key-strokes, your app usage, your music usage, the time of day you use your PC, what web-sites
 you visit, won't be packaged up and sent to Microsoft any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VLC, OpenOffice all run on Linux the same as they do on Win 10 (actually better to be honest), Chrome (or Vivaldi) run on Linux, Firefox runs on Linux... in fact unless you use very specific software, you will find that most apps you would need to use also
 run on Linux...but they work for you, instead of being little spies designed to suck your soul&nbsp;dry of all the data they need to use to brainwash you with later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incompetence and disdainful support should not be rewarded, as it only encourages fu.ckwits&nbsp;to believe that they can act that way all of the time.</p>

<h2>            SOLVED&#58; Windows 10 ISO Install fails</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install Windows 10 Home on my Lenovo Y410P laptop. &nbsp;I am currently running Windows 8.1. I tried the upgrade via Windows Update and had no success and got a variety of errors. &nbsp;I have since moved to the install from ISO image that I downloaded.
 &nbsp;Here is what I am doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the folder with the Win 10 ISO.</li><li>Mount the ISO</li><li>Click setup.exe to start the upgrade</li><li>I accept the license agreement</li><li>I choose Install Windows 10 Home and Keep windows settings, personal files and apps</li><li>Installation starts and it gets to 24%</li><li>Installation ends and I get a small window that said install failed.</li></ul>
<p>Where do I start? &nbsp;This has been a long day of many failed upgrade attempts...<br />

            <p>After 2 days and about 20 hours of trying just about everything, I solved the problem and have Windows 10 running. &nbsp;Not sure yet if it was worth the effort. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what my situation was: &nbsp;The error message I got was error code 0x80070003 and I followed all the posts to delete files, etc. &nbsp;None of that worked. &nbsp;Something was corrupted somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make things work I had to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Reload windows 8.1 (I used a DVD from my MSDN subscription) using the option that saves your files, settings and apps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. After that was done (too a couple hours to install) I had to run windows update to load all the missing updates. &nbsp;NOTE: Windows 10 was listed as one of those updates. &nbsp;I deselected it and only applied the required and optional updates for windows 8.1.</p>
<p>3. After the final reboot, windows update ran again and started the Windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;This time it ran fine and installed without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice is that if you hit the 80070003 error you need to delete the files as suggested in a number of posts and if that doesn't work, jump right to the reload of the OS, apply updates and then do the Win 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I didn't need to use Office, I'd probably be 100% Ubuntu...</p>

<h2>            My Windows 10 gets full disk usage every time the screen is turned off</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a Windows 10 Pro, up-to-date now, full drivers, but it has an annoying problem. Each time I don't touch the computer (dont move mouse or type) after
 2 minutes, the screen is turned off (yes, I set 2 minutes for automatically turning off the screen), but when the screen is turned off, the disk is loading a lot (I know by seeing the HDD LED on my laptop).</span><br />
</p>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Through Task manager opened, I see the disk gets 100% disk usage (I open Task manager first, then wait for the screen turning off, then when it happened, I move the mouse and see). After about 10-20 seconds for the screen to turn on again, the disk backs to
 normal.<br />
<br />
It doesn't happen when I turn off display by pressing Fn+F7 (my hotkey function to do that), but after about 2 minutes, it appears.<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I hope to hear your advice to solve this problem. Thank you!</span>

            Hi Duong:
My name is Ron.

It would help to know WHAT is filling your drive. 

How do you identify it to clean it up?

How do you clean it up.

One guess is that MS is using your machine to share Windows updates with others.  Settings dialog &gt; Update and Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Choose how Updates are delivered.  In there I am guessing that you have "When this is turned on your PC may also send part of  ..." turned on.   

And just below that, you have the "PC's on my local network and PCs on the Internet" also turned on.

Turn both of those settings off.       
        </p>

<p>I already set Update from more than one place off.</p>
<p>My disk of Windows 10 just has Google Chrome, VirtualBox. Some media data are stored on C partition. I'm pretty sure that my PC is clean from virus or malware because I use AV software (Windows defender) and my Windows 7 dual boot has Avast. I'm careful
 when using softwares.&nbsp;</p>

            13 GB free in a 50GB OS partition is adequate for Windows. 

Why do you think your C: drive is full? What do you to free up this 13 GB after waking up the computer with the "full" drive.

            OK, that is different. 

That means that something, some program, is busy reading or writing the HD.  It sounds like you are "hibernating" the computer at 2 minutes.  When it wakes up from hibernation it has to read a file to restore the computer state. This should only take a short time and then the drive should be idle after that. 

Take a look at this article and then check the setting on your computer

            Well, the Maintenance in Windows 10 has just finished&nbsp; recently and after that, I don't see it again. I have no idea why the problem happened to me for several weeks while Maintenance is scheduled everyday, but it seems the problem doesn't appear now.
 I will accept it as an answer or solution.

    <title>Restore factory settings fail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Restore factory settings fail</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I recently bought a new laptop, so I'm trying to restore my old one back to its factory settings for any potential new owner, but it's just not happening. The laptop came with Win 7, but has been running smoothly on Win 10 for the past few months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Trying to restore it through the normal means (PC settings &gt; Backup and restore etc.) means it goes through the motions of a reset, but restarts as normal and then I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e24b5e41-91d4-48bd-ba62-785443e81a16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e24b5e41-91d4-48bd-ba62-785443e81a16" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; So after doing that twice, I downloaded Windows Refresh, only for the (almost) same thing to happen. Upon restarting, I get this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51718b32-13dd-4270-9154-3b22f60f46f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51718b32-13dd-4270-9154-3b22f60f46f9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas what the problem might be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Edit: Had a go at the ol' <strong><span><em>Sfc /scannow </em></span></strong><span>but with no luck.</span><strong>
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thank you,</p>
<p>- Asha</p>

            <p>Hello A.Stark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading here a bit I believe I do get what you want to do. You want to setup your old laptop for sale with a fresh clean install of an OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this with either the Win 10 or the Win 7 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you truly prefer to install the Win 7 OS you will need the original Product Key, if the tag on the laptop is no longer legible you may be able to recover it using this tool:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html</a></p>
<p>If you have the Product Key then&nbsp;go to this link to download the Win 7 OS installation media:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 the Win 7 key was used to create a Digital entitlement key for Win 10 and is tied to the hardware configuration of the device and or the OEM imbedded bios recorded key. It&nbsp;does remain good for a clean install
 of Win 10 then as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer to do a clean install of Win 10 go to this link and follow the directions shown below:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Media Creation Tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not choose the upgrade option on the download&nbsp;page, choose the create for another PC option and then choose the correct architecture for your system (32bit or 64bit) then use the media creation tool to create an ISO file to either burn to a DVD disk or
 a USB flash drive, depending on the boot order sequence setup&nbsp;in the machines bios settings as you will be booting from disc or USB. If your not sure of the existing settings you may have to enter the bios first and make the appropriate change or just create
 one of each, disc and&nbsp;USB and see which one of the 2&nbsp;boots, one of them should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to be extra safe to protect yourself from a potentially nefarious purchaser and wipe-out the HDD completely during the clean install process follow these instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>&nbsp;When asked, choose [Custom install].</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;At the drive selection screen, press [Shift]+[F10] to open a command window.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Type the following command and press [Enter]: diskpart</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Type the following command and press [Enter]: list disk</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Verify that the main drive is listed as Disk 0.&nbsp; It will probably be shown as slightly less than it's&nbsp; true size since&nbsp; Windows is unable to calculate file/disk sizes correctly.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Type the following command and press [Enter]: select disk 0</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Type the following command and press [Enter]: clean</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Close the command window and click Refresh on the drive selection window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;You should now see Disk 0: Unallocated space.&nbsp; Click to select it, and click [Next] to install
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then continue on normally from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck A.Stark, let me know how this works out for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this solves your problem please mark this reply as the&nbsp;answer.</p>

    <title>Skype asks for a perent&#39;s permission - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sergeyzhidkov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype asks for a perent&#39;s permission</h2>
                    <p>Today Skype asked me to login, I did it and after it asked me to enter my birthday. I've entered random values and now I see only this message - "Based on your age, we need your parent's permission before you can use this account. Using a web browser, sign
 in to account.microsoft.com to get your parent's permission and come back to try again." and "Cancel" gray button. I've changed my birthday profile info on account.microsoft.com and on https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile pages. I was trying to give a parent's
 permission, but it's not possible for the same account. Still can't use skype after all that changes.</p>
<p>What I can do about this?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

 possible solution is written as follows by microsoft:</span></p>
<p>
This error occurs when there is a problem connecting to Windows Update. Here are some things that you can try to resolve this problem.</p>
Check your Internet connectivity
<p>
Before you try anything else, you should make sure that your computer is connected to the Internet. You can try using the Network troubleshooter that automatically fixes some common problems with going online. For more information, see “<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/cant-connect-internet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why
 can't I connect to the Internet?</a>”</p>
Wait a few minutes and try again
<p>
Many connection errors are caused by temporary problems with the Internet. Wait a few minutes, and then try running Windows Update again. You can also wait and let Windows Update run on schedule if you've turned on automatic updating.</p>
Enable the "Automatically detect settings" option in Internet Properties
<p>
If your computer is connected directly to the Internet or to a home network (and never connected to a network at work), you might want to configure your browser to automatically detect local area network (LAN) settings so that your computer can go online to
 obtain updates from Windows Update or Microsoft Update. To do this, follow these steps：</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Internet Properties.<br />
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap&nbsp;<span>Search&nbsp;</span>(or if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then clicking&nbsp;<span>Search</span>), type&nbsp;<span>inetcpl.cpl</span>&nbsp;in
 the search box and then tap or click&nbsp;<span>inetcpl.cpl</span>.</li><li>In the&nbsp;<span>Internet Properties</span>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<span>Connections&nbsp;</span>tab, and then click&nbsp;<span>LAN Settings</span>.</li><li>Under&nbsp;<span>Automatic configuration</span>, select the&nbsp;<span>Automatically detect settings</span>&nbsp;check box, and then click OK.</li></ol>
Reset proxy settings to Direct
<p>
If your computer is connected directly to the Internet or to a home network (and never connected to a network at work), you might want to configure your WinHTTP proxy setting to direct. To do this, follow these steps：</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated Command Prompt.<br />
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap&nbsp;<span>Search&nbsp;</span>(or if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click&nbsp;<span>Search</span>). Type Command Prompt
 in the<span>Search&nbsp;</span>box, right-click&nbsp;<span>Command Prompt</span>, and then click&nbsp;<span>Run as administrator</span>.<br />
<span>Note</span>: If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;<span>Allow</span>.</li><li>Type the following command in the Command Prompt window:<br />
<span>netsh winhttp show proxy</span><br />
<span>Note</span>: If the result is&nbsp;<span>Direct access (no proxy server)</span>, you already have direct WinHttp access, please try other methods.</li><li>Type the following commands in the Console Prompt, press ENTER after each command.<br />
<span>netsh winhttp reset proxy<br />
net stop wuauserv<br />
net start wuauserv</span></li></ol>
Opt-in Microsoft Update and try different update service
<p>
If your computer can connect to the Internet but cannot obtain the updates from Windows Update, try to opt-in Microsoft Update so that your computer can obtain updates from Microsoft Update. To do this, follow these steps：</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Update.<br />
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap&nbsp;<span>Search&nbsp;</span>(or if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click&nbsp;<span>Search</span>), type&nbsp;<span>Windows
 Update</span>&nbsp;in the search box. In the search results list, click&nbsp;<span>Windows Update</span>.</li><li>Opt-in Microsoft Update.<br />
Click the&nbsp;<span>Find out more</span>&nbsp;option shown beside the message “Get updates for other Microsoft products”. This will take you to the Microsoft Update site for some quick installation steps.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fen-US%2f3779_image12.png" /><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fen-US%2f3779_image13.png" /><br />
</li><li>Obtain updates from Microsoft Update.<br />
Click&nbsp;<span>Check online for updates from Microsoft Update</span>&nbsp;to obtain updates from the Microsoft Update.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fen-US%2f3779_image14.png" width="653" /><br />
</li></ol>
Configure the firewall for software updates
<p>
When there is a firewall between the Windows Update agent and the Internet, the firewall might need to be configured to allow communication for the HTTP and HTTPS ports used for Windows Update. Windows Update agent uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS
 to obtain updates.</p>
<p>
If your organization does not allow the ports and protocols to be open to all addresses, you can restrict access to the following sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</li><li>http://*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</li><li>https://*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</li><li>http://*.update.microsoft.com</li><li>https://*.update.microsoft.com</li><li>http://*.windowsupdate.com</li><li>http://download.windowsupdate.com</li><li>http://download.microsoft.com</li><li>http://*.download.windowsupdate.com</li><li>http://wustat.windows.com</li><li>http://ntservicepack.microsoft.com</li><li>https://*.ws.microsoft.com</li><li>http://*.ws.microsoft.com</li></ul>
Run the easy fix: use Windows Update
<p>
This fix will fix the error that you get when you run Windows Update<br />
Just download the fix, then click Run.<br />

Repair Windows corruptions
<p>
Sometimes Windows Update agent cannot connect to the Windows Update service because of corrupted Windows components. To fix such corruptions, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker tool</a>&nbsp;to repair corrupted Windows files, and
 then run Windows Update again.</li><li>If the problem continues, use the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DISM tool</a>&nbsp;to repair Windows servicing
 corruptions.</li></ul>

                    <p>I’m having a problrm with some of the scenarios. The problem accurs when one of the losing conditions is a population under 1. The games starts with 0, so this is ALWAYS ticked as you start the game. So as soon as you get to 15 weeks the scenario fails.
 Is this a flaw or am I missing something? &nbsp;</p>
