    <title>No Progress Bar When Loading Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clover27  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Progress Bar When Loading Files</h2>
                    When I load files, there is no progress bar. For example, when I copy and paste files onto a USB stick, there is no window showing the progress, so I have to guess when it's done loading. It loads fine, but I&nbsp;just don't know if or when it's done, and how
 long it will be until it is.&nbsp;How do I get the progress bar back?

<h2>            Windows update&#58; W10, C&#58;&#92;Program files&#92;rempl&#92;remsh.exe</h2>
                    <p>I have a very serious concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has officially responded that this is part of a bundled update to improve updates, and therefore should be accepted. I've seen replies from Microsoft staff speaking for Microsoft, so its official.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If from any other source," the advise says, "it's malicious malware and should be very carefully dealt with or it can allow hackers access to data, your PC, and systems. But if it comes from Microsoft that's okay."</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the precursor to my question. This is my question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is <strong>ADWARE</strong> from any other supplier <strong>NOT ADWARE</strong> from Microsoft when it performs the same invasive function, has the same access to your PC, your data, your systems, and is not required for update functions but little more
 than invasive data mining from Microsoft to see what their customers are up to? It isn't your business any more than a guy who sells a car should be concerned where it's driven and who drives it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this basis Microsoft is asking users to <strong>accept</strong> the same invasive control as a hacker and suggesting its okay because it's Microsoft. This is effectively asking me, a user, to accept Microsoft's right (which you don't have) to invade my
 PC (which you don't have) to access it for your own purposes (which I am not granting). ADWARE is ADWARE. Your program is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>BLOCKED</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the first time Microsoft has pulled this stunt. Pack it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other people would like to throw their hat into the ring on this next invasive policy bundled in a Windows 10 update file, feel free.</p>

<p><span>Here's my hat;<br />
<br />
First, I agree with pretty much everything that you said in your original post. <br />
<br />
Ever since the Windows operating system went from being a "program" to being a "service," stuff like this has become a daily occurrence. "Customer Experience Improvement Program," "Telemetry," "Compatibility Checker," and now this mysterious "remsh.exe," that
 wakes my sleeping computers every day at 10:00am and then performs a series of unknown processes, some of which apparently send mountains of data to some Microsoft server somewhere, are just recent examples.<br />
<br />
To add insult, the process doesn't even graciously return the PC to sleep, but rather when I walked into my home office yesterday around noon, I found two of my computers, fans churning, running full on.<br />
<br />
Idiotically, when this program was fist reported on various MICROSOFT SPONSORED AND SUPPORTED technical assistance forums, some "official" Microsoft respondents labeled it "Malware" and a "Virus." It seems that wherever in the bowels of MS this bit of Devil
 spawn originated, even the people charged with trying to help the poor users of their product weren't told about it.<br />
<br />
Aside form the egregious behavior of just blatantly waking your computer whenever it wants to and then mining and sending your data off to PartsUnknown, it more broadly speaks to the disregard in which we, the customers, are held by "them," the Corporation.
 Changing the operating state of YOUR computer at will, mining and storing your data at will, and modifying the operating system&nbsp; without notice and certainly without your permission is the new normal.<br />
<br />
Once Windows became a "service" ostensibly so it would be more flexible, usable, and repairable, you basically signed away every last shred of privacy and control of your machine and your data. Any one of my computers "phones home" dozens of times a session
 and with gigabit internet speeds, can send anything anywhere in microseconds.<br />
<br />
Long gone are the days when everything that ran on your machine was something YOU purposefully and with forethought chose to install, and allowed to run. Now, obscure commands, buried in the Registry, hidden in the Task Manager, or linked to sign-in, boot,
 or start of another program, gleefully chew up CPU cycles, clog your network, and whisk your privacy off to the cloud. Not occasionally, but rather, constantly; all the time your computer is on, and now, even when you thought you put it into sleep or hibernate
 until you got back.<br />
<br />
I don't suggest you run a packet sniffer like Wireshark during your typical computer sessions, as the results will cause your paranoia alarms to overload. The amount of spurious traffic on the WAN that is constantly buzzing in the background, targeting servers
 world-wide is staggering. You could develop a full time hobby trying to resolve the I.P. addresses of just one-day's traffic.<br />
<br />
You just have to face the fact that all illusions of data privacy that you may wish you had are completely gone. MS is but one small player in the wholesale erasure of your rights to your own data. In Europe, where they have much stricter computer privacy laws,
 corporations just bury permission to access, store, and sell your data deeper in the verbiage of the "User Agreement," and violate you anyway. Here, in the good ole' USA, Equifax, Home Depot, Target, etc. dump all your critical "personally identifying data"
 all over the street, and my State government sees fit to make a .pdf of the deed to my house, complete with my signature, available in just a few clicks of the mouse.
</span></p>
<p><span>Wi-Fi's WPA2 standard had been hacked to death by "Krack," iOS and Android are a Swiss cheese of security, ( I particularly like the whole concept of them asking for "Permissions" when you install
 or update an App as to give you the illusion that you have SOME control over what your phone or tablet spews out to the ether about you) and one of the biggest Anti-Virus makers in the world is basically a branch of the Russian Intelligence Service.<br />
<br />
So, that's my hat. Remsh.exe is a minuscule grain of pepper in a mountain of fly turds. I'm just pissed that it turns my computer on unexpectedly. It should at least have the decency to sell me down the river on MY schedule, not theirs.</span></p>

            Hi davidylin04 ... This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Unfortunately, nothing was found using either sfc or dism. The inexplicable loss of the windows security module/service/whatever appears to occur around certain Windows updates.<br />
<br />
This is a definite product flaw. Windows should never not be able to lock or log out a user.

<h2>            yahoo mail&#39;s letter size has shrunk and can&#39;t get it back to a normal font size</h2>
                    I am having a problem with my yahoo email using windows 7 on my Aspire laptop &nbsp;&nbsp; This is what happens: &nbsp; I am composing an email when all of a sudden, either a key is hit or a shortcut or something but what results is the font turns miniscule.&nbsp; I have
 tried using the&nbsp; magnifier as a default option so I can at least read the emails until I figure it out but it does not help,&nbsp; it magnifies but is distorted.&nbsp; What I want to know is how do I get my email back to its normal font.&nbsp; This has not occurred on my
 other laptop nor has it affected&nbsp; other windows I may have opened during same session. It is only my email. &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I just tried to copy and paste some words from the email to show how tiny it is and when I copied it here - it returned to normal size as all letters appear here.<br />
<br />
thank you for your itme<br />

<p>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x8007007A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The error code indicates that the Microsoft Account you're signed in with (or at least the OneDrive bit of it) has been migrated to the new platform, which means that the photo email feature you've been using no longer works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll either have to send the pictures as attachments in the traditional way, in which case they will be at full size, or embed them in the message body where you can resize them and apply other&nbsp;effects. You'll find instructions - and a solution for cases
 where you want to send a lot of pictures - in this article: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/wiki/livemail-email/avoid-photo-email-and-send-photos-by-email/29fbf782-0df4-4598-8f37-3be5151267f9">
<p>
</p><p>You must remove unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane) before trying to send again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>NB: The error in this case is caused by a change at OneDrive, which means that it no longer carries out the photo email function it used to. It has nothing to do with the mail account being used to send messages, so removing and re-configuring a mail
 account will have no effect. Nor does it have anything to do with the Windows Essentials program files, so repairing the installation won't help, either (but luckily it won't hurt anything). It won't help to try a different&nbsp;Windows user account.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Remove unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane) before trying to send again. You might have to disconnect from the Internet to be able to clear the outbox. When it's empty, compose a simple test message with a unique
 subject and send it to yourself. Post&nbsp;any new error message in your reply. </p>

<p><strong>Apparently I can't post in that thread and the MVP's again insisted the issue doesn't exist despite the numerous users reporting this issue. I also am suffering from this issue. I bought a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 in June. 3 weeks in
 the USB transceiver overheated to the point the glue bonding that metal case and the plastic insert melted and the plastic around the micro chip melted some as well. That was after 3 weeks of use. Sam's Club had a 90 day warranty so I just took it in and swapped
 it out. I thought my issue was just a glitch and didn't do any research. Now low and behold five months later the exact same thing happened when I plugged the transceiver in at work. The thing is hot enough to burn me (and it did). I let it cool off and blowed
 it out to make sure there wasn't any dust or dirt in it and tried a different USB slot. Same issue--fried mouse. Now I can't take it back to Sam's Club. When is Microsoft going to fix or at least admit to this issue?</strong></p>

<p>@Palcouk I just went to the same thread the referenced post was in and I wanted to know if this was fixed yet, not how to have Microsoft give me another piece of junk transceiver I will have to replace in another few months. Also that phone number was for
 Microsoft's Canadian Tech Support line not Microsoft's Product Replacement line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@Mike I was just referencing where I was when it died; it was not a different computer or plugged into a hub--same computer and exact same onboard USB slot I use every time for several hours a day, every day, for the last five months. And same exact issue
 I had when it fried the first time.</p>

            help!!! Same problem with the same mouse(Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000) . I used it for months in my laptop with absolutely no issues. Now the transceiver is heating up to the point of burning me when i take it out so it doesn't destroy my laptop.
 It also doesn't work anymore. Is there a recall for this mouse?

            <p>Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard <strong>5000</strong> - problem when USB transceiver overheated and stopped working</p>
<p>I am having the same problem with a Series 5000 keyboard/mouse.&nbsp; I purchased it several months ago. I understand that this is not a 6000-series transceiver, but the products are close releatives and my symptoms are the same.
</p>
<p>In my case, I moved the&nbsp;USB transceiver&nbsp;( dongle,&nbsp;transmitter, receiver )&nbsp;from a&nbsp;USB port connected directly to the motherboard to a powered DLink DUB-H4 four-port USB 2.0 hub. After a few minutes, the keyboard and mouse quit working and the transceiver
 was hot to the touch. Now,&nbsp;the transceiver&nbsp;will not work in any USB port on any computer. It&nbsp;gets warm almost immediately after plugging it in to any port. This leads me to believe that something inside shorted out after being attached to the powered USB hub,
 though the USB port I was using before that is connected to the motherboard is&nbsp;also powered by the motherboard. Once shorted out, the transceiver is useless. Other items plugged into the powered USB port work normally, including keyboards, mice and my iPhone.
</p>
<p>It has been difficult to find any information about this problem online.&nbsp; Today, I found the telephone number&nbsp;for Microsoft Parts:
800-360-7561.&nbsp; I will call them when they are open on Monday (5a-7p PST). Wish me luck. I own two of these keyboard / mouse sets, one for home and one for work.&nbsp;I like using them very much.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Update: I called the number above and reported the problem. They will ship me a replacement keyboard and mouse when I ship the old one back. An "order number" is needed from them before returning the hardware.&nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp;Me too, &nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;I smelled something funny and saw my Microsoft 6000 wireless USB&nbsp;receiver&nbsp;melt-down!</div>
<div>Dang thing was so hot I burned my fingers pulling it out! At least, it did not ruin my 12 port powered 2.0 USB strip. But, I have been surfing and all I can find is similar complaints, but no source for another&nbsp;receiver. I really like my mouse but not
 enough to buy another one just to get a&nbsp;receiver&nbsp;@ almost 30$ a pop! Does anybody know if there's any other cheap ones that would work ?</div>
<div>I tried Microsoft, who of course had me run through hoops testing every freaking thing cuz they would rather die than admit they're selling defective&nbsp;receivers...They finally told me I had to buy a brand new mouse cause mine had expired its warranty. Man,
 these guys own us through their monopoly already, why cant they just simply send my a replacement? It's not going to make a ding in&nbsp;their&nbsp;multi-billion annual revenue. As much I love my MS6000, I would rather switch to Logitech than line&nbsp;their&nbsp;pockets one
 more time, but I would like to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;receiver.</div>
<div>Does anybody know where you can just one ( maybe safer to buy a dozen in this case!!)</div>
<div>Why dont we all got together and threaten to sue for damages? They may send us all compete units!!!&nbsp;</div>

            I just had the same issue.<br />
<br />
MS wireless keyboard with the USB mini transceiver plugged into my computer's front USB port. Tried to use my computer and the keyboard would not work. Checked the batteries and then tried to unplug the transceiver. It was cooking.<br />
<br />
I let it cool off and tried to plug it back in but it is shot.<br />
<br />
My computer will not recognize it&nbsp; and it just starts heating up again.<br />
<br />
Good thing it didn't damage anything else or start a fire....<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 DVDRAM CD Drive Not Working Correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I am having such a seriously annoying issue with my ASUS R503U Laptop not wanting to detect any CD's or DVD's in my computer. So far what I have done is replaced the stock DVD Drive with 2 other drives for this issue (currently I have an HL-DT-ST
 DVDRAM GSA-T50L that I pulled from another computer that worked fine in my ASUS right now), it currently refuses to not be recognized as a DVD drive as it's in the Other Devices tab on my Device Manager, I've installed the only two stock drivers that Windows
 offers to no avail, tried the suggestion to edit the registry at the "<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}"
 by removing the UpperFilters and LowerFilters entries/creating the DWORD value in the "</span><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi"
 area in the registry and still got nothing.&nbsp;</span><span>The drive itself opens, closes,
 is recognized in the BIOS and makes the sounds as if it wants to Autoplay whatever is in the drive but I've really just exhausted any other ideas of what to do at this point. Any help would be appreciated because I also had the same issue with the drive with
 Windows 8 so rolling back will not help at all also.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>However two users in that topic with the same laptop (&nbsp;R503U ) reported issues with the latest&nbsp;AMD driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try the AMD Chipset Drivers for Windows 10 however I might suggest to try&nbsp;the

<h2>            Better Way To Help Achievement Hunters</h2>
                    
<p>I have a great idea to help achievement hunters, and to deal with unobtainable achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about every time you complete a retail game you get a gold point and every time you complete an arcade game you get a silver point. A Gold Point can be used to get 1 achievement in any Retail or Arcade game. And a silver point can only be used to get
 an achievement in any arcade game. But you don't get in game rewards. Like if there is an achievement unlock all costumes you get the achievement but not the costumes. But if there is an achievement for getting an Avatar item you should be able to get the
 avatar item.</p>

<p>its great to see ideas like this but IMO this one wouldnt work out too well. in my eyes unobtainable achievements are a good thing especially when telling the cheaters from the legit players. take Cars race o rama for example, if you see someone with 1000/1000
 in the game, they cheated, simple as that. not to mention some of the online achievements for sports games where the servers were shut down, its a great way to say "yeah i was playing this game at this time". I think the unobtainable achievements add character
 to someones gamerscore <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-4.gif" /></p>

<p>IMO that's a bad idea since the point of the achievement is to achieve something difficult. You shouldn't be able to press a button and get any difficult achievement you want.
</p>
<p>Personally I think that MS should do something with the gamerscore idea. Maybe have milestone achievements as you gain gamerscore where you get awards.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Reached 5000 gamerscore - Free Golden Hat (Avatar award)</p>
<p>Reached 10000 gamerscore- 100 MS points </p>

<p>^</p>
<p>Ive pretty much always agreed with that. with the exception of MS points of course, being realistic that would have MS loose money just from achievements. although ive always thought milestone rewards such as gamerpics or avatar rewards would be a great
 way to have incentive for earning achievements such as for every 1K up to 10, you get a gamerpic, then every 10k to 100k, then every 50-100k after that.</p>

<p>Ive always liked whay Sony did with trophies..The level of trophy was usually indication of the difficulty getting it.. We are really at the point where gamerscore is just a number...Well it was always just a number, but theres nothing that sets each one
 apart now.</p>
<p>You could get 20 gamerscore playing for 14 hours straight on dead rising , or the same 20 gamerscore for passing a tutorial in just about any other game...Or beat a game like Ninja Gaiden on Master Ninja difficulty, which is worth the same as completing
 one of the Hero quests in Fable 2..</p>
<p>But back to the original post, no, I dont think there should be an instant way to get achievements, as it would cheapen the expierience even more than it already has.</p>

<p>the point of an achievement is to indicate that you've achieved something. If you can get hat achievement without achieving it, what's the point? You gotta earn things, kids!</p>

<p>I agree it does make it easier to see who the real cheaters are but man would it be nice to finally get some of those unobtainable achievements that we've been screwed out of.

<h2>            Trying to install Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I went into safe mode with networking to install windows 10. I downloaded media creation tool and tried both Upgrade this PC and Create media for another PC (8GB USB Drive) and I got this error : &nbsp;0x8007042C - 0x90016</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Can anyone tell me how to install windows 10 or what the code means? (I cannot install it without safe mode because my PC keeps crashing when it gets to '' Creating media'' giving me the '' KERNEL_INPAGE_DATA_ERROR '' even after multiple clean installs
 of windows 8.1)</p>

<h2>            My Start Menu WON&#39;T Open&#33;&#33;&#33; </h2>
                    Hi!<br />
My Start Menu Icon in the bottom left corner of the scree WON'T open AT ALL. I can right-click on it and get the typical "right-click menu" but that's it. The only way that I can switch users or shut down/restart the computer is to use the Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
 The only way to open MS Word/Excel/PPT (or <em>anything</em> for that matter; not just MS programs) is to open an already existing document that happens to have a shortcut on the desktop, and then open a NEW document or whatever from there.
<br />
<br />
I heard from an IT person that a couple weeks ago, MS had released an update and that it was pretty bad. Could this be the problem? I'm running Windows Vista, it's a 64-bit computer (if that helps at all), and I'm not sure
<em>exactly</em> when this started, but I know it's recent. Maybe w/i past 2 weeks to give a good time span with some flexibility. August 31 for sure, because I remember my husband tried to do a system restore, and there were no restore points prior to that
 date. We also tried Sept 1 &amp; 2, but each time, there were no prior restore points for that specific date.
<br />
<br />
I understand that this could be caused a just about anything under the sun, but if someone knows how to fix this, GREAT!!!
<em><strong>Right NOW</strong></em> though, I'd be <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">completely happy</span></em></strong> with just knowing
<strong><em>how</em> to put the shortcuts for Word &amp; Excel</strong> or even MS Office all together (it that's possible) onto my desktop so that i can do a few things before we just do a whole system recovery. Since I can't open the start menu, I can't just
 "click &amp; drag" them onto the desktop, or access the control panel, or anything else&nbsp;through that option.
<br />
<br />
Someone PLEASE help me with this! Atleast with the shortcuts!!<br />
Thank You!!!

<p>
<span>Hi Lotus Everlearning,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>I have few steps here that might fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>The taskbar might be hidden, try pressing
<strong>CTRL+ESC</strong>. If your taskbar then reappears you may have “Auto-hide the taskbar” checked which will cause it to shrink down out of view until you put your mouse cursor towards the bottom of the screen. If this is the case, then you can either
 put your mouse cursor toward the bottom of the screen to pull of your taskbar, or press CTRL+ESC to pull it up, and from there do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-Click an empty section on the taskbar and click
<strong>Properties</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first section that appears under the tab “<strong>Taskbar</strong>” uncheck “<strong>Auto-hide the taskbar</strong>”
 if you don’t want that feature enabled.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>OK</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If CTRL+ESC doesn’t bring your taskbar up, then the program that displays the taskbar could very well not be running. To
 fix this do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press
<strong>CTRL+ALT+DEL</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should be turned over to a window with options one of which is “Start Task Manager” as the last listing. Click
 “<strong>Start Task Manager</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you should have a window called “Windows Task Manager”.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From there click “<strong>File</strong>” in the menu bar, and then click “<strong>New Task (Run…)</strong>”</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next window that appears type “<strong>explorer</strong>”<strong>
</strong>where is says “<strong>Open:</strong>”, then press <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You taskbar should be back now.</span></p>
<p><span>Additional information:</span><strong><span><span>
</span></span></strong><strong><span>Find the taskbar:</span></strong><span>
<strong><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/47f5888e-6333-414c-8a49-d5568af6e4bd1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/47f5888e-6333-414c-8a49-d5568af6e4bd1033.mspx</span></a></strong></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is not resolved, go to step 2 to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you boot the computer in safe mode with networking and check if you are able to connect to the internet without
 any issues, safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode with networking:</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Restart your computer if it is powered on.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.</span></p>
<p><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should then be at the Welcome Screen.</span></p>
<p><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and
 startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to perform clean boot and check if you have the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>User Account Control permission</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and<span>
</span>then click Disable All.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>
</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Ensure to put the computer to normal state by following Step 7 in the above link</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acer machines with&nbsp;Vista do have a D: Partition which is called Data by Acer.</p>
<p>You normally had C: and D: and the Recovery partition was hidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were normally the same size partitions&nbsp;from memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read Step 2 in this link for how to&nbsp;format and use&nbsp;that unallocated space</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/95398-disk-management-shrink-partition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/95398-disk-management-shrink-partition.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing you could do is extend C: so that you have one large partition.</p>
<p>Read Step 2 here, too.</p>

<h3> telliott  say:</h3>
<h2>            nvraid.sys BSOD on W7Pro x64 when second drive&#40;s&#41; added</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a home built computer that was working wonderfully with Windows XP, however Windows 7 Professional 64 bit has been giving me some headaches. Here is my system info...<br />
<br />
OS Windows 7 Professional 64 bit<br />
CPU AMD Athlon 64 x2 3800+<br />
Motherboard MSI K8N Neo4 Platinum Motherboard<br />
Memory 2 GB<br />
Graphics Card Quadro FX 4500<br />
Sound Card NA<br />
Monitor(s) Displays Dell 3007WFP<br />
PSU Seasonic S12<br />
Hard Drives 2x 250 GB Sata Raid (Mirrored) 2x 1 TB Sata Raid (Mirrored) <br />
<br />
I did a clean install a few days ago. I can get Windows 7 to install perfectly on a single pair of mirrored Sata hard drives. I set up my machine with the system and all of my programs on this drive C: Everything works great. I keep all of my files on a second
 set of drives F:.<br />
<br />
When I shut down the machine and add in another mirrored raid of two Sata hard drives F:, the machine boots up and I can see the F drive and read and write from it for about 2-3 minutes and then consistently BSOD's.<br />
<br />
The blue screen points to a driver failure. Nvraid.sys DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL.&nbsp; I have a .dmp file with the crash but I'm not sure how to share it here.<br />
<br />
I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do at this point. I've tried Microsoft tech support and they just threw the problem to nVidia, which I doubt will support this 4+ year old motherboard, but who knows. I may have to go back to XP until this gets ironed out
 or I upgrade my motherboard. Any help I can get would be greatly appreciated.

<h2>            &#34;Google Chrome has stopped working.&#34;</h2>
                    I've had windows 10 for around 1-2 months now and chrome worked just fine. Suddenly it has simply come up with the error message, "Google Chrome has stopped working", it does a check for a solution, says there was a problem that caused chrome to stop working
 correctly, and tells me I need to close the program. I have tried updating to the newest version of chrome, reinstalling, running the troubleshooter through chrome in file explorer, and nothing has worked. Any ideas?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is a default message that doesn't mean what it says most of the time. For 99% of the time, this happens because the lobby is full. Since FSX will drop you in the Free Flight lobby by default, you might have trouble logging in at busy times of the day.
 But there is a way to overcome this issue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you're logged in, select another lobby than the Free Flight lobby and then disconnect. Next time you login, FSX will drop you in that lobby and not in the Free Flight lobby. Since there aren't that many players in the other lobbies, it is unlikely that
 GameSpy will disconnect you. Make sure you logout in a non-Free Flight lobby. Remember that this is another way and is only valid if you don't care about the Free Flight lobby, because when you select the Free Flight lobby after you logged in via another lobby,
 you will be disconnected anyway if the Free Flight lobby is full.</p>
<p>You may follow this below forum link which talks about the same issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi deanoharriso,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you try to burn or rip CDs using Windows Media Player (WMP)? Do you get any error message/code?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any third-party burning program installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you try and save music to memory stick?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any third-party burning software installed on your computer, I’d recommend you to&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>uninstall</span></a>
 the same and try burning and ripping CDs and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>

            <p>This seems to have effected me as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current unsuccessfull fixes (in no particular order)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) reboot</p>
<p>2) wsreset.exe</p>
<p>3) run "regsvr32 Initpki.dll /s" from command prompt. It failed to find the dll. ran "sfc /scannow", and it said that everything was fine. reboot.</p>
<p>4) Set registry value "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 2.0\Client\DisabledByDefault" to 0. Reset.</p>
<p>5) Ran the various&nbsp;"Network Repair Wizards" and "App Repair Wizards" that are now available. They claim that they find things and fix them, but no changes. Even after reboot.</p>
<p>6) Update date and time. It was correct the whole time. When it first happened, it was having trouble pulling the date from time.windows.com, but not from other sources. Somewhere during the above that error corrected itself, and it updates just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem appears to be effecting windows store, windows update, and other miscellaneous apps, but not everything (news is effected. Mail is not. For example)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, the update failed. I tried again, and&nbsp;it worked the second time.&nbsp;</p>

            I had not installed Windows 8.1 preview.&nbsp; But I can't get to the store or get updates after installing this update (I've had to remove it but of course it just wants to put it back).&nbsp; Would really like to find out how I'm need to get past this as I really,
 really don't want to have to reinstall windows.
