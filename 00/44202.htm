<h2>            Why are the audio systems not working in my Windows 10 PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original Title: Audio is not working&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>out of a sudden my audio is not working. It has been working before. I had to disconnect all cables and then re-connected them. I am not sure if the audio stopped working thereafter or before disconnecting the cables. However, I have checked everything,
 cables are correct, I have also tried other plugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my config:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop PC Intel i5-750 with 4 GB RAM</p>
<p>with onboard audio (Realtek HD audio)</p>
<p>Windows 10 (10.0.10586)</p>
<p>
</p><p>all drivers are updated, I can see the lights when playing audio in the audio settings of realtek.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have NVIDIA Audio and an USB audio (I guess it's the microsoft webcam).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but realtek is set as default and it should play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing any codec?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what it could be. I can provide you with all data from the system information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks, max</p>
<p>

    <title>Taskhostex &#58; Turn off notification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaiger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskhostex &#58; Turn off notification</h2>
                    <p>I just got a Surface Pro 3 running Windows 8.1. It's been playing a notification tone with no other apparent notification. It's annoying. Using Process Monitor I was able to find that taskhostex.exe was the program playing Windows Foreground.wav, but I can't
 find why it's running or how to stop the sound. From the Process Monitor output it looks like it creates a file, runs two queries, then closes it. Since I just set the computer up, I installed several programs back to back, so it's hard to narrow it down based
 on recent changes. Nothing is immediately apparent under task scheduler.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Service Pack 1 download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gravitydead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Service Pack 1 download</h2>
                    just wondering why the heck&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;doesn't allow torrents for its updates
<div>I mean, they can upload their major updates on torrents too</div>
<div><br />
Actually, I have three systems</div>
<div>Two VAIO and one Dell, and since I love tweaking them</div>
<div>I often ends up breaking the windows system...&nbsp;</div>
<div>and then I restore them to their factory settings</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and since my internet bandwidth is very limited, I do not wanna waste my bandwidth downloading those tons of stupid updates again n again<br />
especially service pack 1<br />
<br />
Last night, I looked everywhere, and I mean it but could not find a official torrent</div>
<div>So at last (may be at 2 am in the morning) I ended up downloading the direct 900 MB update...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Started the download &lt; used the internet for next half an hour (still searching for some torrent) &lt; then I slept and left my laptop on, well nothing new</div>
<div>and then I saw this error next morning 'your download was cancelled by the network because it was taking a lot of time'<br />
gawd knows, how pissed I was when I saw it...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please suggest this to Microsoft, to give torrent support for downloads... O:)</div>

            <p>Thanks for hijacking my request! </p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that the child account that I have set up and can see on my screen has logged some activity (25th and 26th October) but since then nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think at some point in trying to sort out this issue I attached my daughters account to another of my Microsoft accounts so maybe this is at the heart of the problem. I have since reattached the correct account but still no data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could do with some guidance on how to sort this out and I cannot see anything wrong.</p>

    <title>Halo&#58; CE Anniversary Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> space goonie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo&#58; CE Anniversary Edition</h2>
                    
<p>I didn't see a forum for the upcoming remake of Halo: Combat Evolved. That said, I had a question about the online. First let me explain where i'm coming from. I am one of those guys that absolutely loved the first Halo,&nbsp;I stood in line at midnight to get
 Halo 2 and then quickly fell out of love with the franchise. </p>
<p>I'm very excited to see my favorite Halo game getting updated with HD graphics and 16x9 widescreen display with online coop. But it sounds like the online MP will be different than the system link maps that Halo: CE sported...</p>
<p>Can someone help me understand what the MP in Reach was all about and how the new game will compare? Also, it sounded like the maps will be "inspired" by the originals, but not the same... is that true?</p>
<p>Sorry if this post is confusing i'm just trying to get a feel for what to expect. Any information you have would be appreciated.</p>

<p>There will be more than system linking shipping with this game, it's 2011! There will be 7 multiplayer maps from the game which will be integrated into the Halo: Reach matchmaking ecosystem as to not break up the current player base. We don't know the details
 of it, but from what I've heard/seen, they are pretty much the same maps with better graphics and minor alterations to help balance the maps out with Armor Abilities and such. They are not different maps, just slightly altered.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>But, I wonder, how did Halo 2 turn you off to the franchise? It was a very good game.</p>

<p>I knew it would be more than system link... I just wanted to know where the similarities and differences of both the maps and gameplay ended. For example, why add armor abilities? I never played Reach so I don't even know what they are about, but why change
 the gameplay at all? They are remaking a classic that was loved by millions, and IMO it should not be changed, except where necessary. (I do remember the covershield and camoflauge, so if that is what we are talking about then fine.) I just would rather focus
 on shooting than racing to the best armor spawn points. I also fel the maps were very balanced in Halo. Someone could be sitting on a perch with the sniper rifle or rocket launcher and I could still usually find a way to take them down.&nbsp;I think only some very
 modest tweaking would be necessary.</p>
<p>I played Halo 2 for a couple months. The reason it turned me off in the end is simple. I totally hated dual wielding and how that one thing changed the game. I was a decent but not great player, but a pet peeve of mine was respawing with an assault rifle
 while a guy sporting 2 guns was standing right there. The campaign was not as fun and I never felt the urge to play it again, unlike Halo: CE where I played that campaign (both single and coop) dozens of times.
</p>
<p>I don't mean to start any flame wars or sound like a whiner... I just hope they do H:CE justice in the end.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, if you've never played Reach, you simply won't understand. They're not changing anything. Halo: CE didn't have online matchmaking, so rather than changing, they're adding. As I said, they did
 Rather than have half the people migrate to the Anniversary for a while, they can play with everyone else too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You felt the maps of CE were balanced. Well that's exactly why they're altering them a bit. We're talking miniscule alterations, not full fledged "based on a previous map" changes. Armor Abilities changed the style of the game. What once was a completely
 inaccessible area in an old game is now accessible by using a Jet Pack. Weapon spawns can now be reached faster by people using Sprint. There are so many things that probably need to be rebalanced to account for the Armor Abilities. You should do a little
 more research on the game to see how they're making things play out and what changes they're making. Your own research will explain much more than anyone here can explain to you.</p>

<p>[quote user="Space Goonie"] </p>
<p>I didn't see a forum for the upcoming remake of Halo: Combat Evolved. That said, I had a question about the online. First let me explain where i'm coming from. I am one of those guys that absolutely loved the first Halo,&nbsp;I stood in line at midnight to get
 Halo 2 and then quickly fell out of love with the franchise. </p>
<p>I'm very excited to see my favorite Halo game getting updated with HD graphics and 16x9 widescreen display with online coop. But it sounds like the online MP will be different than the system link maps that Halo: CE sported...</p>
<p>Can someone help me understand what the MP in Reach was all about and how the new game will compare? Also, it sounded like the maps will be "inspired" by the originals, but not the same... is that true?</p>
<p>Sorry if this post is confusing i'm just trying to get a feel for what to expect. Any information you have would be appreciated.</p>
[/quote]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mp will be nothing like the original CE. It will be a Reach map pack (343 said it)</p>

<h2>            Xbox Elite Controller Buttons&#47;Paddles Mapped to Keyboard Keys&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to map buttons or triggers to keyboard keys on the xbox accessories app for my xbox elite controller. is there a way that this con be done?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That means any game that doesn't already support controllers or buttons programmed to the standard buttons you cant add to the paddles on the back. this seems like a really bad design choice and something that can be easily added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p />

<h2>            Windows 10 People App doesn&#39;t show Skype details for one contact</h2>
                    <p>I have a contact in my Windows 10 People app which does not contain a link to their Skype account. However, if I go into Skype on Windows 10, I see them in my Skype Contacts list ... along with another contact that appears to be coming from the People app.
 I do not see a way to combine the information from these two contacts in the People app. Thus, I can't pin them to the Windows 10 taskbar so that I can do Skype IM from that pin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of my other Skype contacts have this problem; their Skype info is listed in their Contact in the Windows 10 People App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this problem? Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, there's a possibility that People app is not integrating with Skype, the reason why it does not load your Skype contact's information properly. To further check on this, I highly suggest to contact Microsoft support and confirm
 with them if there's an ongoing issue with the People app.</p>
<p>

            Hi Ritvik.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to the HP Support Downloads webpage for your Serial Number (on the sticker on PC) to Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If they cannot be installed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If Windows Updates won't install There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can also   manually install Windows Updates by searching for them to download and install from here:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />If any interfere you can block them like this:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />HP makes great hardware but the factory install is the worst in the industry, larded with bloatware like utilities that duplicate and cause issues with better versions built into Windows.  Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Encryption in windows 10 home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tlr3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Encryption in windows 10 home</h2>
                    <p>Various pieces online indicated that windows 10 home would offer device encryption. We now have a computer upgraded, and i cannot find any information about device encryption. Is this feature missing for now? Were the early reports incorrect? Any information
 much appreciated. I already know that we could upgrade to get full bitlocker; my question is how to get device encryption to work.</p>

            <p>It does state "<em>Device encryption requires a PC with InstantGo and TPM 2.0"</em>. I would like to know if Device encryption can be used without TPM. I reckon that Device encryption is to Windows Home what Bitlocker is to Windows Pro. Bitlocker can be
 used without a TPM but it requires some changes in the local computer policy (gpedit.msc). Gpedit.msc is not available in Windows Home. I figure, we'd need to find out what kind of changes would be required and apply them directly to the registry.</p>

            <p>If your device isn't a tablet or a phone, given the specifications for InstantGo you can probably figure you have no chance of this being available.</p>
<p>Here is a description of InstantGo: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InstantGo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InstantGo</a></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Devices must be able to turn on in less than 500 milliseconds</li><li>Must not drain more than 5% of battery capacity while idle over a 16-hour period</li><li>The boot volume must not use a rotational disk</li><li>There are additional security-specific requirements, for example for memory to be soldered to the motherboard</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>Don't you hate it when the Forum Moderator, Anish A Kumar, doesn't answer the question?&nbsp; I wonder if he is a Microsoft employee?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not making encryption available on Win10 Home says a lot about Microsoft and their lack of committment to cyber security.&nbsp; Encryption needs to be available on all editions of the OS and turned on by default.</p>

            <p>So what viable alternatives are we left with? It seems that just because most of us can not use bitlocker there isn't something else we can use in its place. Truecrypt used to be the goto. What options are there?</p>

            Definitely VeraCrypt.&nbsp; I'm unaware of stronger system encryption for Windows.&nbsp; It's a very versatile and powerful piece of software loaded with options and seriously strong encryption. &nbsp;

    <title>Settings app crashes whenever o chose Devices category - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Settings app crashes whenever o chose Devices category</h2>
                    <p>My settings app crashes whenever I go into the devices category.&nbsp; After some&nbsp;oubleshooting I have determined that it is actually on the Bluetooth &amp; other devices category that crashes.&nbsp; It just so happens that that is what opens when I chose devices.&nbsp; If
 I open windows ink workspaces and chose pen and windows ink settings that opens fine, as well as every other setting menu under devices.&nbsp; Only the Bluetooth section crashes the settings app.</p>
<p>I am up to date.</p>
<p>Run sfc sca,n chkdsk, DISM repair.</p>
<p>There are no usb devices attached, and the only Bluetooth device I have is a headset which is currently turned off right now, and the issue still happens.&nbsp; I don't have any printers installed.&nbsp; My thinking is that the computer is seeing some device in that
 list, and something with the driver, or that device is&nbsp;not working right.&nbsp; Problem is I cannot get in to see what it might be, and to remove everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on windows 10 home insider preview build 15031.rs2 running on a surface 3.
</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

</p><p>There are a few possible cause for your Bluetooth device to not work on your laptop or PC. To narrow it down, kindly provide us with all the information listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes on the settings of your PC/laptop prior to this?</li><li>Which version of Windows operating system are you currently on?</li><li>What error message are you getting when trying to pair your device to your PC/laptop? If possible please post a screenshot of the error message on your next reply.</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>

            When are people on these forums ever going to bother reading the actual issue instead of writing a generic response so a keyword found in the original post. &nbsp;The issue is not with pairing Bluetooth devices. It is with the settings app crashing which then
 doesn't let us even attempt to pair the device. &nbsp;Two very different things.

<h2>            Replace DWM to get aero glass back in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have Windows 8 and I see that aero glass is very much excluded from it. The taskbar is still transparent as expected, but not the windows, and there is no blur.</p>
<p>The Release Preview had aero glass, however, which may be very good. Since I imagine that the glass was hard coded into DWM.exe (which always runs on Windows 8), would it work if I replace the dwm.exe in my Windows 8 RTM with the dwm.exe from the Release
 Preview? What would happen if I broke the DWM (or if it wasn't there)?</p>

            How else did you Troubleshoot?

1) Type Troubleshoot in Start Search, open the Troubleshooters.

2) Run Network adapter, Internet Connection, Incoming Connections and Hardware Troubleshooters.  

3) Try flushing DNS:  https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/227988627-How-to-clear-the-DNS-Cache-on-a-computer-and-web-browsers-

I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Have you checked your router and Modem functionality?

Will it connect to another network, e.g. Starbucks, school, work, etc.

1) If you have no access to these then ask the owner to restart. If this fails contact the help desk who manages the network.

If you own the router and modem:

2) First power off both router and modem, or gateway if both. Wait five minutes.

3) At the same time restart your PC.

4) Now power up the modem, plug the PC directly into the modem to see if it connects to the internet.

5) If so, restart the modem, plug in router to modem, power up router, plug PC into router, restart PC. See if it has a connection to internet.

6) If no connection, right click Network icon in PC SYstem tray, run Troubleshooter. Contact your Internet Service Provider for support included in your internet plan.

7) If it connects via ethernet, unplug cable, restart PC, try connecting via wireless network.

8) If this fails reset your router per the model's Manual found on it's Support Downloads w

<h2>            Windows 7 Media Player wont go into sleep mode like it used to.</h2>
                    
<p>When I first got Windows 7 last October until now, my Media Player would play through its movies as I went to sleep, and then go into sleep mode when they were over. Now, it just stays on, and wont even go to screensaver, even when the movie is done playing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried messing with the screensaver and sleep settings, but it didnt help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>

    <title>Can not unset &#39;run as administrator&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> docedbrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not unset &#39;run as administrator&#39;</h2>
                    I have an application that is supposed to be launched at startup via a registry entry in HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\run. The application will not start when I log on to a standard user account. The app will launch when I log on to an
 administrator account. Troubleshooting tips from the application help states to unset the 'run as administrator' option for the *.exe file.<br />
<br />
But it appears that I can not unset the 'run as administrator' option for a standard user. When logged in as the standard user, and I open the Properties dialog on the exe file and look at the Compatibility tab the 'Run as an adminstrator' box is checked and
 greyed out. When I click on the 'Change Settings for all users', the 'Run as an administrator' option is unchecked. When logged in as an administrator, the 'Run as an administrator' box is unchecked and not greyed out.<br />
<br />
As stated, the user is a standard user.<br />
My OS is Win 7 Pro x64. The program files are in C:\Program Files (x86)\.<br />
<br />
What am I missing here?<br />
Thanks,<br />
John<br />

            Hello Ganesh,<br />
<br />
Thank you for replying to my question.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure you understood my question. The program does not need to run with elevated privileges. But I was unable to deselect the 'Run this program as an administrator' for the standard user.<br />
<br />
But after seeing your reply and working on it again I did manage to solve it. In the Control Panel &gt; User accounts, I temporarily set the account to an administrator. Then I could deselect the 'Run as an administrator.<br />
<br />
Good day,<br />

    <title>Low upload speeds on XBOX 1 console. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> born in 1952  say:</h3>
<h2>            Low upload speeds on XBOX 1 console.</h2>
                    
<p>I receive 4.00 mbps from my ISP and when I test my speeds around the world I never get less than 3.00 mbps. When I test on my XBOX 1 console I never receive higher than .43 mbps and it's normally a .22 or ,21 mbps which is below the requirements Xbox has
 for connection speeds to XBOX live. I spoke to my ISP and they have done all they can and have explained to me this is an XBOX issue but none of my searching has led to a solution to this problem.The support from XBOX 1 is virtually nonexistent and all the
 links do is send me into a never ending loop back to where I started. Help please if this is an issue you have or know how to fix.</p>

 what xbox requires for online gaming. My ISP told me today it's a XBOX issue and support can help me fix it. Support here is useless there are no agents or chat reps that will or can answer or even respond to the questions. There are no solutions offered on
 any support page. I've been researching this issue for over a month and as yet nodda nothing squat from XBOX. I wish I'd never bought this new console it's been a pain in the butt ever since that fateful day.

<p>I asked a similar question about speeds only getting half the speed on an xbox speedtest as I get on a laptop. I get 88mbs &nbsp;down on a laptop but only about 40 down on the xbox. Even selecting a server in Seattle on laptop, get the same latency on both xbox
 and laptop. Talking to someone in support also doesn't help cause they don't have the knowledge to help</p>

<p>Now from this &nbsp;x%$#*#x console I'm getting 100% packet loss. Is there any end to these #%*!%# ongoing connection problems? I've done everything suggested from replacing cables to changing ports , port forwarding to DMZ, UPnP enabled and disabled. I've talked
 to my ISP and they assure me it's an XBOX issue. Anyone wanna buy a cheap #%$@!*^# XBOX 1 console? I used to love my old XBOX consoles and I've been with them from the start now this cheap crap has me desperately wanting a PS4 even an old Atari would be better
 than this piece of #%^*&amp;#.</p>

    <title>Which camcorder is compatible with Windows Movie Maker on Vista Home - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Which camcorder is compatible with Windows Movie Maker on Vista Home Premium&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am in a bit of a bind.&nbsp; I have to make and edit a film that will mostly be of clips stored in Windows Movie Maker on my old computer which has VISTA Home Premium/64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to the old clips (which are compatible), I have to shoot some new footage.&nbsp; My recent purchase of a Sony Camcorder is not working at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone recommend a camcorder that will have files that are compatible with Windows Movie Maker?&nbsp; My Sony clips seem impossible to move outside of the Sony software so I can't convert them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am willing to buy a new camera.&nbsp; I just need something compatible.&nbsp; Would even buy a used one on E-Bay as long as it will work with the old Windows Movie Maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

            <p>If its on a memory card buy a card reader, if you dont have one. Or if you connect the cable it should let you see whats on it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most camcorders these days support MP4. If it's HD. The new Panasonic cam I have here I think it saves in MP4. Since it's 1080p</p>
<p>
</p><p>The older one which is also Panasonic may have been old, (it wasn't HD), but it had a firewire port.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I think it saved videos as WMV (well I know it loaded in Movie maker when I had it)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left">You'll either have to buy a program that supports MP4, or use a video converter program and convert&nbsp; it to WMV</p>

<h2>            Xbox games keep freezing</h2>
                    
<p>I booted up my Xbox 360 Slim this morning and everything was working fine. I popped in my copy of Modern Warfare 3 and it booted up, the screen was black and after a minute I realized the game froze. I turned off my console and turned it back on. I just
 ignored it and put in Skate 3 instead, i played it fine for a couple of minutes but then the game froze! Everything was normal last night and I don't know what to do now.</p>

<p>Before we can determine what your issue is, I have some questions for you to answer. Does the dashboard take longer than usual to load? In Skate 3, what is displayed when it freezes? Do you see any error messages? What color is the light on the power button
 and power supply? If you can answer these, we can give you steps to get this issue resolved.</p>

<p>The dashboard loaded normally. In Skate 3 I was in the middle of playing and the picture just froze the screen didn't go black, I got no error messages, no nothing. The power button was green and so was the power supply. It was weird because everything was
 running perfectly last night.</p>

<p>I would check out the screen freeze solution at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/console-freeze/xbox-360-screen-freeze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-360-screen-freeze</a>. Just answer the questions and it will give you troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue. The first question it asks is if you can return to the dashboard. Just post with the results and I'll determine if your
 console needs to be repaired.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-live-status</a>, there are 2 service alerts, one regarding some people not being able to sign in and one for the difficulties of accessing any type of content from BO2 to IE and everything in between. All I can say is stay tuned to
 that page for updates on the status of Xbox Live.</p>
