Thanks for taking the time to respond.&nbsp; Still not quite there with a </p>
<p>resolution.&nbsp; Update:&nbsp; Was able to burn the Bootable ISO Image File:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso to a CD.&nbsp; When I run this file, do I put the CD in the</p>
<p>CD tray before or after I Boot the computer.&nbsp; Does this file automatically</p>
<p>launch, because I don't see the XP Recovery Console on the screen.</p>
<p>It seems the computer was attempting to boot from the CD.&nbsp; Unsuccessful</p>
<p>so I removed the CD from the tray and attempted to reboot the computer.</p>
<p>I don't see the error message at the top of the blank screen anymore,</p>
<p>but I do see the following message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checking File System On C:</p>
<p>The type of file system is FAT32</p>
<p>One of your disks needs to be checked</p>
<p>for consistency.&nbsp; You may cancel the</p>
<p>Disk Checks, but it is strongly recommended</p>
<p>that you continue.</p>
<p>Windows will now check the Disk.</p>
<p>Volume Serial Number is 0366-1ED8</p>
<p>Windows is verifying files &amp; folders</p>
<p>Windows replaced bad clusters in file\Boot.INI of name (nu77)</p>
<p>folder\found.002 is entirely unreadable</p>
<p>folder entry removed</p>
<p>0 Percent completed...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question:&nbsp; What is the time frame to complete a Checking File System on C:</p>
<p>Have been running the computer for a few hours now with 0 Percent Complete.</p>
<p>There seems to be some activity going on with the drive, also see a red light</p>
<p>on the front of the tower flickering during this System Check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I should shut the computer down and reboot, The System Check Message</p>
<p>shows up on the screen again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help to resolve this would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>you should put the cd in the tray and reboot.</p>
<p>you may have to run checkdisk two or three times until no errors are found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to do some searching as to why it is saying system is Fat32, it should be ntfs.</p>
<p>a few hours with zero percent complete is not correct.</p>
<p>let me check something first will be right back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT:&nbsp; these are the steps you should take</p>
<p>1. go into the BIOS and change the boot sequence to cd drive first, hdd second.</p>
<p>2. save changes and exit</p>
<p>3. place cd in tray </p>
<p>4. reboot</p>
<p>5. you should see a black screen with "press any key to boot from cd"</p>
<p>6. windows set up screen will show</p>
<p>7. when asked if you want to setup windows or repair, do not press enter, press R, this will bring up the recovery console.</p>
<p>8. when asked which windows you want to use, type a 1, as there will most likely be only one choice, then press enter.</p>
<p>9. if it asked for password just hit enter</p>
<p>10. then type in&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk c: /r</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>after all of this you should convert your system to NTFS:</p>

            Just to add to the above answers,&nbsp; when booting from the Recovery Console disc you should see a prompt to "Press any key to boot from a cd". At that point immediately press any key. It is a good idea to have your finger on the Enter key waiting for the
 prompt as waiting too long will automatically attempt to boot from the hard drive.
<br />
<br />
Also, the fact you are now getting the option to run check disk upon start up is an indication the file system is attempting to repair itself. You may be able to repair it using check disk whether from the system prompts or from Recovery Console. However, I
 think a more likely resolution will end up being to re-write the boot.ini file. Nevertheless, you should try to run check disk first two or three times as noted by Liz.
<br />
<br />
The time check disk takes depends on the several factors including, but not limited to, the size of your hard drive, the amount of data on the drive and the extent of file corruption should such exist.
<br />
<br />
@ Liz.. Since the OP has Home it is very likely the OS was installed using the Fat32 file system. :-)

            Thanks,&nbsp; I had tried to find where I had read that it is not good to have FAT32, but I could not find it. However, if it has run okay so far until this point, guess there is no reason to change it. :)

THIS</a> is what you are looking for? Actually, if it were me I would convert it also. My post was not intended to rebut your suggestion, but rather to reply to your following statement. Of course the first goal is getting the computer to boot again. :-)<br />

    <title>Every single way I try to renew my Live account results in failure. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saya-15a0b43f-a4fb-47ff-b5d1-a36113dc141b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Every single way I try to renew my Live account results in failure.</h2>
                    
<p>A little backstory:</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, my credit card was lost and had to be replaced. All went well with my subscriptions on most other sites (every single one let me update my payment details without any hiccup whatsoever). This site, on the other hand, let me change my card
 yet refused to actually let me use it to renew my subscription (one that I've had for six straight years and expires in two weeks). The website itself gives me a message that says the following:</p>
<p>Try updating your subscription</p>
<p>If you want to change the way you pay for your subscription, you can change the payment option for your current one rather than buying a new subscription.</p>
<p>__</p>
<p><br />
I went to the forums after multiple days of getting that message and saw someone mention going to commerce.microsoft.com, adding a new payment method, and then making that the primary payment method. Again, nothing.</p>
<p>I finally got so fed up with being unable to use my credit card to renew my membership (again, the one I haven't broken a single time in the six years I've had it) and bought a twelve month card from my local Walmart. I was hopeful that I would at least
 be able to use <em>that</em> to renew my membership and all seemed to be going well at first (was able to enter the code and get a validation of what the code was for), but when I actually clicked the "confirm"&nbsp; button I was met with an error message. My Xbox
 One results in the same thing.<br />
<br />
After a little more browsing, it turns out that the possible solution (and I use "possible" loosely since no other "solution" had worked, even when provided by staff members) is letting my membership run out completely, then trying to enter the card again.<br />
<br />
I am fuming with anger about this. In case I haven't made this clear enough, I've had a subscription non-stop (as in not broken for even a single second) for the past six years. Being forced to break that and start my subscription over from scratch may seem
 trivial to some, but anyone who's dealt with some of the more pushy members of Microsoft's customer support knows that there's a huge difference between the deals and service offered to accounts who have had Gold for a long period of time and accounts that
 have only just recently gone Gold. It's to the point where part of me is honestly considering dropping the Xbox brand altogether and never even remotely considering picking it up again.</p>
<p><br />
If a staff member (as in, an ACTUAL STAFF MEMBER) can help me get this sorted before September 19th, I would appreciate it. If my subscription goes, my business with Microsoft goes with it.</p>

<p>One other thing to mention (wasn't able to fit it in via an edit): Trying to turn auto renewal back on also doesn't seem to be an option. Every single time I attempt to go to the page to do that, I'm met with an error page on this site that says this:</p>
<p>Uh oh... that shouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>It appears you've found a glitch in the system. Please try again later.</p>
<p>__</p>
<p><br />
It is completely nonsensical for the website to make it this hard for me to renew my membership. I've been a member for a long while now and I assume Microsoft wants it to stay that way (that's definitely the impression some of the customer support staff have
 given off on the phone), but it's almost as if every aspect of the site has gone out of its way to force me into cancelling. I'm at my wit's end.</p>

<p>Ryujinvf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sorry to hear you've been having so many difficulties trying to get the card swapped over. However, a simple call to
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Phone Support</a> should result in your being able to make this change since the website is not exactly cooperating for you. Just select&nbsp;<strong>Billing</strong>, then
<strong>Management&nbsp;Payment Options</strong>, then <strong>Request a Call from Support</strong>. Let us know if this works out for you.</p>

<p>I just had what sounds like the same issue and found a workaround a mere few minutes ago. I hope this is what you're trying to get around and that this works for you, too. Otherwise, I guess I'm wasting your time. If your new card has a different number
 (as it should if it was reported lost), then I imagine you have both the new card and the old one listed in your payment options as I did.</p>
<p>I had an old card, also lost, that I had last used to auto-renew in 2013, as my 2014 renewal was paid for by a special with a pre-order or something. Fast forward to today, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get it off the old card and onto
 the new one, which I'd been using to pay for various purchases for some time. When I'd try to add a new card under Payments and Billing, as the newer one wasn't visible in the subscription payment option window, it would say that it was already on the account.
 I tried deleting it and adding it again in P&amp;B, but the window still only showed the "current" option of the old one when I clicked Paid With for the subscription again.</p>
<p>Finally I tried another deletion, but this time I added it from the Manage Payment Options page under the subscription, itself. This time it worked, setting it to the newer card. From there I was able to click Get More Gold, select the year renewal, and
 successfully use the new method to extend my subscription into 2016. After everything was set and the billing email received to confirm, I promptly deleted the old card, needless to say.</p>
<p>So, I hope this helps. Sorry if it doesn't solve your issue, but yours does sound remarkably similar, so I'm hopeful.</p>

<p>Hmm, I suppose I should list what I did in steps just to be sure.</p>
<p>1. Delete new card number from account under My Account&gt;Payment and Billing&gt;Manage Payment Options.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to My Account&gt;Subscriptions.</p>
<p>3. Under Xbox Live, click the existing card under "Paid With:"</p>
<p>4. Select "Add Credit Card" and fill in new card info.</p>
<p>5. If successful, return to Subscriptions page and click "Get More Gold."</p>
<p>6. Select desired term and process transaction. The "Redeem Code" function might work here again for that card you purchased.</p>
<p>As a side note, the site is being a little screwy for me right now while I navigate through again to make sure I get the link names right. Hopefully that's just temporary and doesn't happen to you, but when I click on the card info under Subscriptions, it's
 sometimes giving errors but sometimes working. That could also be my slow connection, though. Good luck!</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;You should be able to fix the issue by heading to commerce.microsoft.com and setting the new card as your primary payment option.</p>
<p>Also, if your renewal came due before today and an attempt to take payment was on the old card then you probably still owe that amount and will not be able to add or purchase anything on your account until that payment is made. &nbsp;Your best bet here would be to contact phone support and explain the issue to them. &nbsp;Not only will they be able to remove the old card and make the new one your primary but they'll be able to help process the renewal amount for you.</p>

<p>@Moon: Sadly, the old card was removed at the suggestion of someone a few days ago, so I'm not sure that what you suggested is an option now. I'll be sure to keep it in mind if something like this occurs again in the future, though, so thank you for sharing
 it.</p>
<p>@eG and Onyx: I always pay by year, so a missed payment isn't the problem. I did call phone support last night and when I finally managed to get a hold of someone I was basically just given a guess based on what she saw when she looked up the error messages
 on the site (she said that I should be able to use my twelve month card and new credit card when my existing subscription runs out on the 20th and that if I renew that same day my six year prestige /should/ remain, but she's honestly not sure and I should
 call back again on the 20th if the issue persists).</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info. &nbsp;It's alright to wait until the 20th if you like. &nbsp;However, if you go to purchase something before then and it will not go through you'll need to call phone support again and ask to speak with Billing.</p>
<p>As for the tenure, even if you missed some time it would not reset. &nbsp;It would disappear for about a week or so but would come back with what your current tenure is.</p>
<p>They have long since done away with resetting the tenure of an account if you didn't renew your Gold membership for a while.</p>

 I'm attempting to install on a new Intel SSD, but I can't even get to the screen where you chose partition,drive,etc.<br />
<br />
About 20 seconds into the installation it comes up with an error 0xc0000098 &nbsp;ql2300.sys critical system driver is missing or corrupt. Tried running with 1 stick of ram, AHCI mode and IDE mode, unplugged every SATA device except the new SSD and boot DVD, unplugged
 every usb device and tried a PS/2 keyboard. Also tried turning off digital driver signing, as well as safe mode and did the built in memory test (passed). Tried installing on a regular SATA hd as well with the SSD unplugged, same issue. DVD doesnt have a scratch
 or fleck of dust on it. I tried searching for similar problems on these forums as well as general google searches, but none of the ideas have worked thus far. Don't have another 64 bit computer to test the DVD in.<br />

    <title>Stationary second cursor with gray circle after last Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanrz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stationary second cursor with gray circle after last Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I've been running windows 10 for several months with no issues. After the most recent auto update, I now have a vibrating stationary cursor center right of screen with a gray vibrating circle around it. The actual cursor works erratically, fades and returns,
 and disappears frequently. Read that it could be related to HP Simple Pass issues, so I uninstalled Simple Pass completely, and still have the issue. All drivers are up to date, defragged cpu, and no improvement. Please help. I am a novice, my home PC is my
 only source of income, and I am struggling to make it work. Thank You!</p>

<h2>            Why don&#39;t I have Microsoft Works in my Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I just recently downloaded Windows 7 into my laptop and its great! But there's a problem. It doesn't have Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office, or Excel. I tried downloading some software from the www.microsoft.com but nothing works, I also tried updating
 things in the laptop, and I also tried reinstalling it from my Windows Vista. But nothing works. Do I have to buy it from the store or online?

<p>Assuming nothing has actually been installed in the downloads folder <em>( I'm not actually even sure if it will let you install into it, Ive never tried? )</em> then anything in downloads should be just that, files you have downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want copies of them, then copy them to somewhere else first. If not then you should be able to delete anything that is in it. Do not delete the folder itself.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This malware has just started to show up - either a new&nbsp;program or a morph of previous versions.<br />
<br />
Windows Command Processor&nbsp;is a rogue program, a fake antivirus/antispyware (fakes use a lot of names<br />
for the same&nbsp;base&nbsp;malware&nbsp;program). <br />
<br />
Watch out for fake virus alerts<br />

<p>Hi Vanessa,</p>

<p>If the issue occurs when signing in to Skype for Business, click <strong>Advanced options</strong>, turn off
<strong>Auto-Detect Server</strong>, and type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 Startup automatic repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aleksapuzovic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Startup automatic repair</h2>
                    <p>So I got this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup repair</p>
<p>Startup repair couldn't repair your PC</p>
<p>Press "Advanced options" to try other options to repair your PC or "Shut down" to turn off your PC/</p>
<p>Log file: (There's nothing at log file, not even "Srt.txt")</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b9c823-da5e-477c-8e2a-0b71ac81b93f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b9c823-da5e-477c-8e2a-0b71ac81b93f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press "Advanced options" I get the following options;</p>
<p>Troubleshoot</p>
<p>- System restore - Can't restore.</p>
<p>- System image recovery - Did not try it, I think.</p>
<p>- Startup repair - Endless loop, restarting my PC to select keyboard input to restarting again my PC with text "Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC" and getting then the message that's on top.</p>
<p>- Command prompt - I tried some methods with repairing but with no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Go back to previous version - Not working.<br />
</p>
<p>Turn off your PC - It just turns off my PC, with success!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a clue how I got this, just one morning I started up my PC and got all this.</p>
<p>I had once the same problem but with "Srt.txt" and I fixed it, but now without anything at the end of Log File I don't know what to do. I can't even start my PC in "Safe Mode".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone knows how to deal with this type of problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,
</p>
<p>Thanks for asking! As I understand, you want to know if you can disable the Single Sign On feature in Windows 8!</p>
<p>This feature cannot be done.</p>
<p>If you are using Windows 8 Microsoft account and you sign in to any app using your Live ID, it will sync you to all apps with the same Live ID sign in.</p>
<p>For more information refer:

            <p>This is a major issue for me in using Windows 8.</p>
<p>There should be a way to disable it. Allow the user if we want the SSO feature enabled or not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want to mess with the login now. Have multiple ids for different purpose and do not want to disturb it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biggest drawback of Win 8 this SSO</p>

            <p>I have to agree with Ajay. Right now I am forced to use my Microsoft login for any number of applications and it makes me want to tear my eyeballs out. I created separate logins for a reason - so that all of my data would be partitioned behind different
 credentials. Now this feature has made it so a hacker (or worse, Microsoft) has full access to my accounts with one set of credentials.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT want you having easy access to my data. Which apps I use, how many times I use them, and the data therein is NOT something that I want to share with your company. (I apologize if you don't work for Microsoft - this product is designed so terribly
 that I cannot tell whether or not you are working as an agent on their behalf.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there really no way to turn SSO off? If not, is there a forum where I can offer feedback to your product managers?<br />

            That's not true. &nbsp;We use two-factor authentication at work, using Windows 8. &nbsp;However, I cannot figure out how some of the machines that are the same make/model and have the same Windows 8 version have and some don't. &nbsp;I came here trying to determine why
 this is setup this way.

<p>I have to agree with Ajay. Right now I am forced to use my Microsoft login for any number of applications and it makes me want to tear my eyeballs out. I created separate logins for a reason - so that all of my data would be partitioned behind different

<h2>            Audio Driver is missing and there is no default sound for my Laptop</h2>
                    I have gone to my device manager, and the intel audio drive is missing, which means my default sound that is built into my laptop does not show up on the list of devices I can have sound playback on.&nbsp; I can only get sound through the HDMI cord through
 a monitor.&nbsp; The jack does not work either, and when I go to device manager and windows searches the web and my files for the driver, it can't find it.&nbsp; My sound was working fine just two days ago, and suddenly plugging in headphones, or even laptop sound doesn't
 work.&nbsp; I would very much appreciate it if someone could help me on this.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi BC.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if necessary work through the following steps: 
<br />
<br />1) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />2) Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />3) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />4) Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br /> 
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />5) If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />6) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />7) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />8) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> 9) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />10) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Print driver issue in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chad bedford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print driver issue in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Chadman</p>
<p>Windows 10 tries every so often to install an HP Printer update that is incessantly failing. &nbsp;I get this error code: (0x80246007). Aswin Anand posted a response to a similar problem (the error code was different, though), and I have tried both methods 1
 and 2, with no luck. &nbsp;Another post regarding this issue suggested using the Device Manager to check the printer and update the driver from there:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to update the drivers from&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager&nbsp;</strong>and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>&nbsp;by pressing&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click on&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>; select&nbsp;<strong>System and Maintenance</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>, locate&nbsp;<strong>Printer</strong>&nbsp;and double-click to check if it’s working properly.</span></li><li><span>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Driver</strong>&nbsp;tab, then click on&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>. And follow the instructions &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>Now I am very familiar with control panel and the device manager, and I always remember there being a "Driver Tab" and the option to "Update Driver" from there. &nbsp;HOWEVER...I don't know if I am recalling Windows 7 or what, but when I go to the printer in
 Device Manager, THERE IS NO "DRIVER" TAB!!! &nbsp;And so it follows that there is no way to update the driver from there, either! &nbsp;There is a "General" tab, a "Settings" tab, a "Details" tab, and an "Events" tab....no DRIVER tab. &nbsp;Where did it go???</p>
<p>So at this point, I know the printer seems to work fine, and while this idea goes against my better judgement, I am wondering if there is any way to simply DELETE the constant attempt to Update the drivers, thereby ending the ongoing "Trouble updating printer
 driver" messages all together.</p>

            <p>I'm not a complete noob...(I recall writing QBASIC code on MS-DOS when the maximum memory aloud in DOS (Disk Operating System) was 640k!!!!!! &nbsp;SO...Yes, I have tried reinstalling the printer drivers, making sure I have the latest driver, etc...to no avail.
 &nbsp;Which is why at this point, since my driver works fine, I was hoping there was a way to simply STOP windows from even trying to install the "Updated" drivers, thereby ending the incessant error &nbsp;messages that I get when the update fails (which is currently
 my biggest annoyance!!!!) &nbsp;In Win 7, there was a way to shut down failing, yet repeating processes of specific upates that always failed....I don't recall how it was done, but it was in Win 7, not Win 10, so I doubt the same technique would work. &nbsp; SO.....thats
 where I am...I am well past the point of wanting the update, as my printer works fine, but I would REALLY like WIN 10 to stop TRYING to &nbsp;update that driver every other day when I know it is going to fail.</p>

<p>I just got off a chat session were the MS Chat employee asked for a remote connection as well... instead of giving me what I have gotten before....&nbsp; code that is run in powershell to determine which updates are chosen &amp; processed!</p>
<p>Once "Shaista" took remote control of my computer he quit responding to questions and took a very long time during which my "IP software" starting logging a large uptick in data communication (file transfer?)!!!</p>
<p>Now, since this seems to be an ongoing problem... lets get others to respond to this &amp; DON'T CLOSE SO QUICKLY~!!!</p>

<h3> ntekniklaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD - NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it would appear Windows 10 is wanting to destroy itself for the 6th time of me ever using it. Running Windows 10 pro on a Dell Inspiron 5566, I boot it up, just get a bluescreen saying NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM. I used this computer 6 hours ago and it booted
 up just like it would. Now it would appear Windows 10 wants to screw around with me for the 500th time this year. (windows 10 is most certainly a secure &amp; safe OS!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I just need information on what this error code means, what could have caused it, and what can I do/</p>

            It means the file system is corrupted. Is this the 6th time on this computer your getting issues like that? The default configuration for that laptop comes with a mechanical hard drive. I would have the hard drive checked for bad sectors. Meaning the hard drive might be failing. Just a suggestion.

            How long has this been happening?
Have you installed any new software or hardware drivers since you started experience this problem? If so, what are they and are they designed for Windows 10?
Have you checked the manufacturers website or contact support find out about compatibility, updates or support for Windows 10?


Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703?
Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?

BSODs are normally triggered by hardware drivers. This particular error could suggest an issue with your memory modules. You might want to run a scan to see if there any defects:

https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory-diagnostics-tool-to-check-for-errors-in-windows-10/

also check the hard disk health:

https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/

You can also try performing a repair upgrade to see if it helps:

    <title>Windows Update failing consistently on Win 7 64 machine, .NET - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vivi_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update failing consistently on Win 7 64 machine, .NET framework 3.5.1 is failing to update as well</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. &nbsp;I have been experiencing consistent failures to update on my Win 7 64 bit machine for some time now. &nbsp;These are the updates which fail repeatedly on an attempt to install: &nbsp;Security Updates for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems &nbsp;(KB2871997), (KB2922229),
 (KB2957189), (KB2957503), (KB2957509); Updates for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2908783), (KB2928562); and finally Security Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1 on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 for x64-based Systems (KB2931356).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool, ran it, it caught nothing. &nbsp;I ran FixIt, which also caught nothing. &nbsp;At this point I am very reluctant to reboot my computer because of the fact that after a reboot to try and install the consistently
 failing updates, I was met with the dreaded blue screen that told me I was running a pirated copy of Windows 7--this is a Dell machine, and my Win 7 is genuine. &nbsp;I took a chance, rebooted, and my desktop came back up but I'm not sure how long this is going
 to last.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have shut off Windows Update since it seems to be making the problem worse--computer had slowed down considerably, and am relying on Avast! freeware to try and prevent any malware or trojans from getting in. &nbsp;I use AdBlock and don't click on anything I
 shouldn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last successful update occurred on 4/21/14--after that, all the failed updates were the above as mentioned and .NET framework but due to family issues I was unable to handle them at the time. &nbsp;Frankly, I am not much good with computers and am hoping that
 someone here can help me. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas? &nbsp;I'm not much looking forward to reinstalling the OS. I'm also a noob and will need to be handheld through most of this, sorry about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Customizing a folder by placing a picture on its cover---</h2>
                    <span>I open a file folder containing pictures—I click ‘view’, then ‘customize this folder’, then ‘choose file’, then I click a picture, then ‘apply’, then ‘ok’.<span>&nbsp;

</p><p>Being able to put the Lock screen clock into your desktop is a wonderful idea. We recommend that you share issue/idea using the Feedback Hub. Here, you can either vote on an existing submission or submit a new one. Feedback items regularly receive Microsoft

</p><p>Please follow these steps to submit a new feedback:</p>
<p>1. On a Windows 10 device, search for <strong>Feedback Hub</strong> in <strong>
Cortana search</strong>, then launch the app<br />
2. Navigate to <strong>Feedback </strong>in the left menu, then press <strong>+ Add new feedback</strong>.<br />
3. Select the <strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory<br />
4. Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking <strong>Begin monitoring
</strong>(or <strong>Start capture</strong>) near the end of the form; <strong>Stop monitoring</strong> when you’re done<br />
5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click <strong>Submit</strong><strong>.</strong><br />
6. Click <strong>Continue using Feedback Hub</strong>.<br />
7. Click <strong>My feedback</strong> at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear)<br />
8. Open the item you submitted, then click <strong>Share</strong>.<br />
9. Click <strong>Copy link</strong>, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like https://aka.ms/&lt;unique link&gt;)</p>

<p>I have windows xp 32bit. &nbsp;I have a LifeCam VX-1000. &nbsp;I do not have the CD, but when I plugged it in the first time, Microsoft Wizard found the driver and installed it no problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran fine for 2 months, then I plugged it in today, I got the "new hardware found." &nbsp;First off...what happened to the driver? &nbsp;I have not installed anything new. &nbsp;And then it won't re-intsall the driver. &nbsp;It prompts me for a CD when I try to update the driver
 through device manager and when I try to run LifeCam 3.22 that I downloaded from<strong>MICROSOFT</strong>&nbsp;it tells me "<strong>Setup cannot continue because the downloaded file was not digitally signed by Microsoft. Please try again later.</strong>" &nbsp;WTF?
 &nbsp;I downloaded it from microsoft. How could it not be digitally signed by microsoft?</p>
<p>How do I get the "life" back into my LifeCam?</p>
