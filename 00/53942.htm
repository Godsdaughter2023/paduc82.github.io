    <title>Win 10 Child Account Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tdg2594  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Child Account Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Windows 10 to create a child's local log-on account&nbsp;and desktop. I am organising this desktop to remove icons for programs which I do not wish&nbsp;children to access. I am also setting up icons for programs which I am happy for&nbsp;them to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted icons I did not wish them to use, only to find that those icons, along with the actual programs, were deleted from my hard drive. Apart from not understanding why a simple Icon Delete&nbsp;function which is performed elsewhere on my PC is not available
 in the child's desktop, I&nbsp;certainly do not understand why the program was also&nbsp;deleted without advice that the program was about to be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, your Windows 10, whilst showing much promise, is proving to be inefficient, ineffective and intolerably infuriating in so many small ways that I wonder how so few could write so little for so many. Is it beyond consideration to ask that someone
 with a clear head and some logic attend to such a small matter as reverting to the Win 8.1 'additional log-on local account function' that worked quite well without error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Microsoft should remember that not all that is new and glittering is progress or indeed desirable.</p>
<p>Hoping for some remedial action,</p>
<p>

    <title>Transparent Background for Windows Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whiwo65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transparent Background for Windows Profile</h2>
                    <p>I realize this question has been asked time and again, but now that we are on Windows 10, it's time to bring what likely is the simplest request back to the developers of the operating system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide support for .png and/or .gif files for users profile images.&nbsp; The entire operating system is based on transparent imagery and floating icons...why?&nbsp; Because it looks cool and today's processors can handle it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why no support for a transparent profile icon?&nbsp; What you're doing is using the same system that converts thumbnails for folders (i.e. degrades the quality and resizes the images ala Instagram) as you are for a single profile picture.&nbsp; Write a few lines
 of code that deal specifically with the profile picture so that it supports transparent formats and be done with it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not like you have to spend countless man-hours to resolve such a simple request and from what I can tell, people have been asking for this since Windows 7.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a no-brainer, aesthetically pleasing carries across all of your platforms from email, computers, phones and yes even this forum.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, I matched as closely as possible the background to the new Windows logo, which looks great on my computer but like **** everywhere else (see the logo associated with my name).&nbsp; However, I dual boot to Windows 8.1 as well (for work) and that
 one looks like ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Windows, it's the 21st century this is such a simple request.&nbsp; You have a lot of good faith from folks like me that have lived through every iteration of your operating&nbsp; systems starting with 95.&nbsp; Me, Vista and 8 were pretty much **** but I stuck
 in there with you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now that you have your shiny new Windows 10, which is beautiful and really smartly constructed why not throw the faithful a tiny little bone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take&nbsp;some of it back, the icon showing up in this profile is still pulling from the original .png I uploaded on Windows 8 so it looks great.&nbsp; However, to achieve a semi-transparent appearance the .jpeg version with darker background is appearing everywhere
 else.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Unable to download files due to Security Settings</h2>
                    
<p>A few weeks back an issue started on my pc which I can't get resolved:</p>
<p>1: Unable to open links in email messages in Outlook</p>
<p>2: When I download a file from a website I get Cancelled : if I right click on the file in my download window &amp; select retry it looks as if the file has downloaded but the options to open, open containing folder &amp; Go to Download page are all blanked so I
 cannot click them. If I search on the pc for the file I cannot find it. This is happening in Internet Explorer, Opera and Firefox.</p>
<p>I can see that this is apparently an issue with my Security Settings but I have reset all to allow everything and makes no difference. I have also deactivated AVG - again no different.</p>
<p>Can anyone please throw some suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>When your computer is in safe mode with networking, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. Now in safe mode with networking,
 check if you are able to connect to the internet and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.</span></p>

<h2>            0xc0000005 error</h2>
                    <p>About a month ago some programs and games I attempt to launch on my computer would not launch at all, after trying to launch them from the file location it gave me an error with the code of 0xc0000005. The problem used to be only one one or two programs
 that I use frequently, but now they are showing up on new programs, and some older ones that didn't get the problem before. I have tried quite a large amount of different ways to fix the issue to no result, including de-fragmentation of the hard drives, checking
 if the RAM is working and being registered, reinstalling the latest drivers and fixing any corrupt ones (there weren't any) ect...</p>
<p>Please tell me some ways I could possibly fix the error, and I would prefer not to wipe the hard-drive and do a fresh install of windows because I did lose the windows 7 disk.</p>

 Is there a way to disable to the Action Center hotkey (WIN + A) on Windows 10?</p>

    <title>Why is my external hard drive now saying I need to format the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amc1217  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my external hard drive now saying I need to format the disk&#63;</h2>
                    I've been using this hard drive for quite some time, on multiple computers, and I could plug it in to any USB port and the computer would just recognize it and off we go. Just recently, I plugged it in and it said I need to format the drive to use it.
 I've searched alot, on here and elsewhere, and read what others have tried and I tried the few things I understood (trying different ports and Scan for hardware changes), but they didn't help and all of those posts were rather old, so I thought I'd seek more
 current help. Anyone know what I need to do? Has the drive failed or might I be able to get it working again? I'm using Windows 7 on a Toshiba Satellite laptop (the computer I use most) and the drive is also a Toshiba, if that matters. I have another, newer,
 drive that I've plugged in and no issues with that one. I am not very technical so please reply in layman's terms. Thank you so much!

            Thank you! Ugh, no luck. Ok, more information:<br />
It says Local Disk (G:) instead of the name of the drive like it always used to.<br />
Anytime I click on it, it churns and says Computer (Not Responding) at the top for quite awhile.<br />
In trying Method 3, it showed me the menu and let me choose Properties and it churned a bit and then nothing, it wouldn't show me Properties, it was like I hadn't done anything.<br />
<br />
I had already tried Method 1 and that didn't work. In fact, I think it maybe said it was G: no matter which slot I had it in. I can't verify that right now, because the only way to stop the drive (safely) is to shut down the laptop. It says it can't be stopped
 because it's still in use by some program, even when it's not that I can see. It started doing that, refusing to be safely removed/ejected, a few months ago.<br />

<h2>            Windows Backup was interrupted by a Windows Update.</h2>
                    
<p>Windows Backup was interrupted by a Windows Update. The computer shut down and restarted, the backup was reported as Failed. &nbsp;It was on DVD #42 (i'm a photographer with lots of GBs,&nbsp; this was the first time running the weekly automatic backup, so it's backing
 up everything).</p>
<p>I've started another backup and was instructed to label the backup disc as #1. My two questions are: Is there a way to tell how many discs i'm going to need before i run a backup. and 2. Is this picking up where the failed backup left off or am i going to
 need another 42 DVDs?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help! Lisa</p>

<p>Vista doesn't tell you how many disks will be required - that isn't one of its features (but it's a good idea).&nbsp; You just have to check out what you've selected to backup, total it, divide it by the size each disk can hold, and come up with your best guess.</p>
<p>I believe it will start over from the beginning - not pick up where it left off (I don't think that is possible with any version of Vista or any type of backup you choose).&nbsp; Vista doesn't keep a record of what has and hasn't been backed up that can be used
 to pickup where it left off (well, it has&nbsp;a record but it can't be accessed for this purpose) - this is especially true if you've already started another backup (though I don't think it would have been possible to pick up where you left off in any case).&nbsp;
 You may need more than another 42 disks because it hadn't finished and we don't know how many it will ultimately required - we can say you will need AT LEAST another 42.</p>
<p>If you're using that many disks, may I suggest you get an external USB hard drive and use that instead for your backups - it will be a lot easier and you won't need to keep changing disks.&nbsp; They aren't that expensive these days - just make sure it is large
 enough to save everything you want to backup and give yourself a lot of extra space because you will use it up quickly.</p>
<p>Sorry if that isn't what you wanted to hear, but Vista's Backup program is not the best available and has many limitations and problems (but it's free and it basically works so we use it).</p>
<p>BTW, next time, turn off Automatic Updates AND deactivate your security software before you do the next backup.&nbsp; Turn them back on when the backup is done.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Win 8 - Have to unplug and replug Razer Megadon headset to get sound working every boot.</h2>
                    I have a Razer Megadolon headset and have just upgraded to Win 8 Pro. &nbsp; Every time I boot, I don't get any sound through the headphones until I unplug and replug the usb connection. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They doesn't have any manufacturer supplied drivers (doesn't for any version of windows) and I've gone into device manager and done a driver update check there - it says all fine. &nbsp;I've also double checked the hibernation/sleep settings of the usb hubs
 as per a suggestion on the razer support site and that didn't change anything. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm all out of ideas and I've only seen one other person with the exact same issue on other forums and no solution there - does anyone have any suggestions?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
As I understand you have to unplug / re plug the USB connection for Razor Megaton headset to get it working. Is this correct?</p>
<p><br />
As the device dose not have specified drivers, and might not be compatible with Windows 8, the software has to be detected and drivers will be installed each time.</p>
<p><br />
Run this troubleshooter and check,</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Run the Hardware Devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Press the Windows key on the key board or click on the right hand bottom corner of the screen to open the Windows 8 start screen.</p>
<p><br />
b. Type in troubleshooting (settings)</p>
<p><br />
c. Look under Troubleshoot computer problemâ and click on View all.</p>
<p><br />
d. Choose the hardware and devices troubleshooter.</p>
<p><br />
Let the troubleshooter run and detect audio issues and apply fixes as recommended.</p>
<p><br />
If you still face any issues then try,</p>
<p><br />
Try <strong>restoring the health (PC settings)</strong></p>
<p><br />
You may also try,</p>
<p><br />
a. Press Windows key + X on the key board</p>
<p><br />
b. Click on Cmd (Admin)</p>
<p><br />
c. <strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth </strong></p>
<p><br />
Press enter</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            <p>Hi,&nbsp; Thanks for this, but I think my original question was unclear - sorry.&nbsp; I am trying to say two things - 1. I am running with XP SP3, and 2. Where does the Backup function (as provided in Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Sytem Restore)
 store its backup files?&nbsp; I have looked closely at the $NtServicePackUninstall$ directories and contents that you mention and think these relate to SP3 install actions and related backup files.</p>
<p>Hope you can help, Thanks, Geoff65.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Geoff65,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have installed
Service Pack 3, then thatâs what you would see. Your computer would no longer be considered running Service Pack 2.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As for the question about where those files are stored, you may take a look at
<b>C:\System Volume Information\_restore{xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}</b>. You need to unhide hidden files to view this.</span></p>

            <p>Syed,</p>
<p>I believe I am already using this functionality viz:-</p>
<p>Explorer &gt; Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View &gt; Hidden Files and Folders &gt; Show Hidden Files and Folders (is checked)</p>
<p>But I do not see C:\System Volume Information\_restore{xxxx} as suggested when I browse to my C:\ drive.&nbsp; I have saved my settings so as to apply to all folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am logged on as a named user and believe I have administrator rights, but perhaps I do not and this may stop me seeing the directory and files you indicate.&nbsp; I have always been reluctant to delete my Account in order to revert to Administrator as I think
 this could "delete" all my documents and settings, which I would then need to recover.</p>
<p>I suspect / believe that there is a hidden partition on the C:\ drive which contains system information and possibly some backup files.&nbsp; Is this correct?</p>
<p>I wish Microsoft offered (free after OS purchase) some form of tutorial(s) where I could educate myself on system aspects at possibly a choice of 3 levels such as "beginner", "intermediate" or "advanced".&nbsp; This would be really helpful and&nbsp; might remove a
 high proportion of Q&amp;As from the various Microsoft forae.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Issues with Resident Evil 6 Freezing at a certain point - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with Resident Evil 6 Freezing at a certain point</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! First time poster here, I got Resident evil 6 for christmas, and I'm a big old fan of the series, well, I rage quit it a few days after christmas when I hit a "disk is unreadable" error and it crashed, losing a boss battle.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Well, I loaded it up a few hours ago, and redid it, and the error happened again, Its happened 4 times now, at the same place, after cleaning the disk, cleaning the reader, everything. And I'm convinced it's not a disk issue!<br />
<br />
What do? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
(if you're wondering, the door/loading screen that it happens at, is right after beating the Ustanak boss, I don't remember the chapter, but the immediate door after the boss after the airplane scene in Leons story)&nbsp;</p>

<p>If it happens at the same point consistently and it's the only game causing this problem, it is most likely a disk issue and not a console problem. &nbsp;If there are any visible scratches you can try to have the disk machine buffed to fix the issue. &nbsp;Since you
 said it was received at Christmas, I'm assuming you are well outside the warranty period for wherever it was purchased. &nbsp;Have you tried installing the game to your hard drive to help with any disk specific reading issues? &nbsp;The only other suggestion would be
 to try it in another Xbox to see if it happens at the same point. &nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<p>Buffer disk machine?</p>
<p>I tried to install it to the hard drive, and it keeps just saying "disk must be dirty" at 47% or so, done it twice now.
</p>
<p>There's literally nothing wrong with the disk physically, it's flawless. One of my better condition games even.

<p>Hi, if you can't install the game then that would indicate a problem with the disc itself, you may well just have a disc that has a blemish on the surface, try holding it in a good light and see if you can spot anything that looks like a watermark or bubble
 under the surface of the disc. A way around it may be to to borrow the game disc from a friend who has the game, install it and then use your disc merely to pass the disc verification on the console.</p>

<p>My daughter has an offline account that has all her achievements.&nbsp; Recently we created a Zune account for her and I would like to now associate this with her existing offline account on my XBox to give her an XBL account with all her existing achievements.&nbsp;
 Is this possible and if so how?</p>

<p>Nope, combining accounts is a no go. It's all the same system though so you can promote the offline account to have XBL features (doesn't need a gold membership) and you can use that to log into Zune.</p>

I've got the Acer Aspire TC380 desktop purchased earlier this year. It's not used everyday but recently it's been crashing to black where the monitor is in sleep mode but the computer is running fine requiring hard resets. I noticed it was getting worse with
 the more Windows updates I installed. I'm going to return it in the next few days if I can't resolve this because it's not very usable.</div>

None of the restore or repair options worked, I had to use my win10 recover USB to delete the windows partition then reinstall. The PC kept freezing during the clean installs but on the 7th try while chatting with Acer support it worked. The computer is much
 faster now but the crashes have continued. I've updated the drivers, tweaked the power options but nothing is working. The computer crashes either while booting before I get to windows, just past logging in to windows, or goes fine for 30min then crashes unexpectedly.
 When it doesn't crash, it freezes like in the photo either in post or during the clean installs but usually it just crashes.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/447e42da-32bc-41ed-bb3a-6e87a57747e9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/447e42da-32bc-41ed-bb3a-6e87a57747e9?upload=true" /></a></div>

    <title>Windows Mixed Reality Desktop Application is not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Mixed Reality Desktop Application is not Working</h2>
                    <p>As the subject says, the desktop application in wmr is not working. I am running a razer blade 2015, with a lenovo explorer headset. It can run anything you throw at it, and I've been enjoying superhot vr and arizona sunshine for the past few days. I found
 out there was a desktop application in the windows home, and tried to use it, but it just appeared black. I read up on troubleshooting for it, and followed microsoft's "fix", but it didn't work. Is there any other way I can fix it, view my desktop, or just
 play normal games through my wmr headset? Thanks for the help and support!</p>

<h2>            I think i have a local and microsoft account linking into each other&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I think I&nbsp;have a local and Microsoft account linking into each other? I signed into my new windows 10 originally with a local user account and somehow my computer got wiped so because my computer said I no longer had a operating system I re-installed
 windows 10.</p>
<p>After installing windows 10 I decided to use my Microsoft account instead of the old local account because I presumed it had been wiped.</p>
<p>When I was looking in the file explorer I noticed under the user folders area that I infact had my new user folder with my Microsoft account and another folder with my old local user account.</p>
<p>I now seem to be having two different website links for my one email address.. for example when I got to look at my device information on my Microsoft account I have the following two different website links coming up for the one email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>account.microsoft.com/?ref=settings&amp;platform=windows10 and the other is</p>
<p><span>account.microsoft.com/?ref=settings&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;username="(my email address here)"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So does this mean somehow they have both linked together?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You can't link Local and Microsoft Accounts, you can switch between the two though. Its possible the machine name was changed with the new install, so they are showing as two distinct machines. You can remove the one no longer in use.

Download the latest version of the Media Feature Pack for Windows 10 N or KN</a> and see my post of 23 October 2016 in which I describe the awkward search you need to do to make sure you download the latest version of this addin.&nbsp; [do not try to install the

<p>
</p><p>You can run WMP from the Start menu.&nbsp; The application is in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe" on 64 bit computers &amp; "C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe" for 32 bit ones.&nbsp;

search for rip music</a>&nbsp;or similar to find some advice about it.&nbsp; In short, insert the CD, open WMP, look on the left for the CD to be shown in the Navigation pane, select the CD, click on the rip tab then proceed.&nbsp; {I cannot be more precise because I no longer
 have a CD drive on my computer}</p>

    <title>voicemail and call forwarding can no longer both be enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> douglasshelfoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            voicemail and call forwarding can no longer both be enabled</h2>
                    <p>For years I have had both voicemail and forwarding on at the same time. &nbsp;In this way I could forward calls if unanswered, &nbsp; but also enjoy the features of going to voicemail if I was already in a call and reject calls to voicemail. &nbsp;These were very important
 features. &nbsp;Now when I reject a call it gives a fast busy which confuses callers, &nbsp;and I always have to reject calls to stop the alert when I am in a call. &nbsp;This is critical to my operation of Skype. &nbsp;As a 10 Year paid subscriber I am very disappointed in this
 apparent change in the latest versions. &nbsp;I may have to switch services along with my team to resolve the issue if Skype no longer functions in the way it used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help,</p>
<p>
