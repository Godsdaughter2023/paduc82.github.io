<h2>            Surface RT Bitlocker Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a 32GB Surface RT&nbsp;with Windows 8.1 and recently it is showing the BitLocker Recovery Key prompt during start up. BitLocker has never been activated on this device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have the Key and upon entering it the BitLocker prompt screen changes to Unlocking, then the screen goes blank.&nbsp; Next it shows the Surface splash screen with "Diagnosing your PC" at the bottom. Then I get the "Automatic Repair" screen with "Restart" or
 "Advanced Options", "Restart" takes me back to the Surface splash screen with the progress wheel going around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This then switches to the "Something went wrong with your PC, we're collecting some data and then will restart".&nbsp; It restarts and I get the BitLocker Prompt again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the BitLocker prompt, if I select skip this drive I get the Splash screen again, with "Diagnosing your PC" and then the Automatic Repair screen. I can get into Advanced Options so I could do a Reset and lose all the data but I'd rather avoid this if at
 all possible.&nbsp; I've tried a Refresh but there isn't enough HDD space to allow for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know there was an update released for a problem similar to this some time ago, but I cannot get to the desktop to check if there are updates available to install (This isn't my surface, so I don't know how up to date it is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this without doing a full Reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Mudplugger</p>

<h2>            Extra router showing up in &#34;Network Infrastructure&#34;</h2>
                    Hi folks,<br />
&nbsp; When I open up Windows Explorer in Windows 7, and navigate to "Network", I have a list of<br />
computers, media devices, and network infrastructure in front of me. In particular, an extra router<br />
is listed (not mine). I've never connected to any other wireless network besides mine. In fact, I<br />
1) renamed my SSID<br />
2) made my SSID hidden<br />
3) changed my WPA2 password<br />
4) changed my router's password<br />
It is still there. I have no idea why. It lists a Belkin router (not mine) and a Linksys router (which
<br />
is mine).

    <title>Free Trial codes not working&#47;disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> starbuckunited  say:</h3>
<h2>            Free Trial codes not working&#47;disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new xbox one x from here at Microsoft store, the PUBG one. Its advertised as having a free trial of xbox live gold, month of Game Pass, and the preview or whatever of that pubg game. Both the gold and game pass are expired. I spent a good
 amount of time trying to redeem all my new goodies and even saw that EA Access had some sort of free trial in the drop-down box in the Microsoft store. And NONE of them worked. I especially wanted the EA trial but its disappeared everywhere. I admit I had
 laptop or internet issues that night but I find it abit ridiculous that a console directly purchased thru a company's store has years outdated coupons in their products. why put an expiration date on an unopened item.....but that's just me I guess. Anyway...does
 anyone know how I can find a free trial of EA Access online or do I have to go thru customer support here or at EA.com?? And also to compound the problems, on the console it advertised two months of Game Pass for $2, I enrolled and still got charged full price....just
 to throw that onto this pile of garbage. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help anyone can offer.</p>

<h2>            certutil.exe slowing my hp down</h2>
                    <p>hi I recently updated my hp desktop to windows 10 and my computer is very slow. When I go into the task manager my CPU usage is at 98% and there's one task that is running at anywhere from 48%-60%. The name of the task running is certutil.exe. My question
 is what is it for and is it needed to run on my computer? If it is not needed then how do I go about removing it so my computer works properly&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup
 Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span><span>&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would first suggest you to check if the Volume Shadow Copy service is running.</span></p>

<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click on <b>Start</b>, type <b>Services</b> in Start Search and press enter. When the Services page is open, check for
<b>Volume Shadow Copy service</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Right click on <b>Volume Shadow Copy service</b> (VSS) and Check if it is
<b>started</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it is stopped select <b>Start</b> or <b>Restart</b>. 
</span></p>
<p><span>Check whether you can try creating the restore points after starting the service
</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>: If you have installed any third party security software, then
 try to disable the Security Software temporarily and check what happens.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>So I don't have the best performance on CSGO, I get around 40-110 fps normally with all the settings on low, any resolution, high priority, the windows 10 xbox game dvr disabled, and basically any other performance boost you could think of. I've looked at
 like 50 performance guides to boost fps, but it just doesn't work.</p>

<p>I wouldn't think I would get this low fps with that, but I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what I've decided to try is to reboot my computer to factory settings. Back when I had the computer rebooted to factory settings the first time, we made a system image (at least thats what I think it is), but that was back in windows 7. I've upgraded
 to windows 10. So I have this folder with a bunch of other folders in it, containing drivers to CPU, Audio, USB, and so on. But I don't know how to actually reboot the computer to this "system image". So I would very much appreciate it if anyone could help!</p>

            Your system image has altered by the factory or builder to create an X/boot partition which is hidden.&nbsp; using your system partition an WIN_RE&nbsp; partition.&nbsp; I would suggest you download win 10&nbsp;&nbsp;ISO&nbsp; and do a setup install and choose keep all my files and
 folders. Don't do a boot install as this will clean of everything unless you want to and reinstall all your programs.( a clean install would be a better but could be time consuming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>It would be in the root (top) directory of an external drive, &amp; it would be named "WindowsImageBackup" -
<strong>if </strong>it was made by "Backup &amp; Restore (Windows 7)". That's a Win 10 app, ask Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible you used something that just made a backup of your drivers. Where is the folder, what is its name &amp; the names of some stuff in it?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Microsoft Account Not Syncing&#47;Roaming &#40;Profile Image, Lock Screen Image, Desktop Background, Start Menu Customization, etc&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows since 3.1 and so know my way around really well.&nbsp; I have a family all with logons into my PC.&nbsp; Recently I got a new PC and loaded my own personal Microsoft Account (MSA) onto the PC.&nbsp; Then I was able to allow the rest of my family
 to log on.&nbsp; We now have all 6 accounts active and 5 of them are working great--the 5 are syncing the Profile Image, Lock Screen Image, Desktop Background, Start Menu Customization, browser favorites, etc.&nbsp; On my own account none of these are syncing, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried to far:</p>
<p>1) I have verified that the MSA is properly activated/verified.&nbsp; For instance when I open Store, or Groove, or Photos, or anything else it shows my MSA Profile Image properly, etc.&nbsp; But Windows 10 itself doesn't seem to have sync'd any of this.</p>
<p>2) I tried detaching the MSA by switching to a local account, and then reattaching the MSA.&nbsp; Didn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p>3) I tried running the Microsoft Account Troubleshooter.&nbsp; I think this is old and is not useful on Windows 10, but I tried it anyway.&nbsp; Didn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other things I could try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business for Mac - Status Reverts to Away</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing an issue with the latest version of SfB for Mac 16.6.332 where the status reverts to away but will not change unless I sign out and sign back in. If I manually change it to Busy or Available, the color continues to be yellow and change is
 not reflected elsewhere (i.e. Outlook).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing similar behavior?</p>
<p>

<h2>            vista aero LOST after install of updates on 4-15-09</h2>
                    hello there. I had my vista premium machine install the numerous security updates that MS put out on 4-15-09.<br />
Upon reboot, my machine has lost its AERO theme and capabilities and found no&nbsp;way to get it back.
<br />
Display driver has not changed, all else is correct.<br />
I followed the Trouble Shooting guide on how to get it on my pc, yet no luck.<br />
Please help...its been over 2yrs with no issues with WVHP (believe it)....now i lost what i enjoy the most.<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />
i tired the apperance, themes, video driver update (same as original installed)...i even went as far as uninstalling all the updates for that day and still no luck.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rich k.

            <span>HELLO racenrich<br />
<br />
You will want to ensure that the <strong><span>Desktop Window Manager Session Manager</span></strong> service (and)
<strong><span>Themes</span></strong> service are both started. If they were stopped or disabled via an application that limits startup items Aero will not be an option. Please try manually starting both of these services
 to see if you are then presented with the options to enable Aero from the Personalize menu.<br />
<br />
<strong>Starting Windows Services</strong></span>
<p><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>services.msc</span></strong> in the
<em><span>Start Search</span></em> bar, and press
<strong><span>ENTER</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If prompted by

<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Now locate the (2) previously mentioned services.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If they are not currently enabled right-click them, and select
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>.</span>

Please let us know how it works for you</p>

            hello Justin...thanks for the reply. i verified that both services are up and running...even disabled, reneabled and restarted....check the apperacne setting and no AERO option&nbsp;displayed. Only&nbsp;available to me are "windows standard"; windows classic; HC
 white, black, #2 and #1.....<br />
Under theme setting, i do have Vista theme going....no Aero though. the entire theme/settings has disappeared for aero altogether.<br />
I do&nbsp;find this weird, as i have never had an issues with displays or anything of that sort......not till the 7 or so updates that installed yesterday, 04-15-09.<br />
FYI....no other software has been installed in quite sometime.<br />
Please do help....the display has lost its luster and looks like winXP now. blah...again thanks.<br />

            exact same thing happened to me on 4-15-09 after installing 9 windows updates. i tried looking around for solutions as well with no success. one person commented it might be a java issue and i do remember a java prompt coming up today and telling me to
 install updates for it but i put "remind me later" so i'm trying to see if i can try install those updates. if it works i'll reply back!<br />
<br />
UPDATE: i went to the java.com website and downloaded the updated version of java and i restarted my computer, went to Personalize, then the Windows Vista theme was back! When I went to Appearance Settings, Windows Aero was back also! so maybe that worked?
 I guess couldn't hurt if nothing else works. good luck and I hope you get it back!

HI racenrich,<br />
<br />
System Restore routinely creates <em>restore points</em> that contain information about the state of Windows&nbsp;Vista at a given time. System Restore is set up to create a restore point every day, and it also creates them when you are doing other system-related
 tasks that System Restore looks for, such as installing new programs. <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/0e3a6bed-e3fa-4d5e-8635-39d5b5ccfdaf1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/0e3a6bed-e3fa-4d5e-8635-39d5b5ccfdaf1033.mspx</a><br />
<br />
This sometimes helps to change back unwant account changes <br />

<h2>            Windows 8 Desktop Screen Not Showing. Please Help.</h2>
                    Alright, so I updated my computer to 8.1 quite a while back, and I just recently updated it again but it was because it was a windows "needed" update. Now there was two programs that showed, "Advanced Security Something" and "Regclean". And now that I
 got them to stop popping up, now my desktop screen does not show unless I use ALT+TAB to switch programs. Also, when I am done using it for the day I put it to sleep, and I guess over night it turns itself off. So, now when I start it up it beeps like 2-4
 times. And recently I took my microsoft email and password off this computer, so I have no idea if it was that or if it was just that so called "Trusted Program". And I also used to have bookmarks on my google chrome internet browser (why chrome because when
 I couldn't use it one time my antivirus program popped up like 20 time just by starting up IE,) and now when I try to put some on there it stays, for about as long as I'm on it. So if anyone could help me that would be greatly appreci

    <title>After a windows 10 update my audio drivers are not recognized. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shymarie98  say:</h3>
<h2>            After a windows 10 update my audio drivers are not recognized.</h2>
                    <p>Hello! </p>
<p>Last night, my computer said it had been scheduled for updates and prompted me to restart my computer, so I did. The update took quite awhile, almost like I was reinstalling windows 10 altogether. Everything was working fine until I did a restart because
 things began to run very slow, then I tried to plug in my earbuds(the ones you get with apple products) and the usual message box asking me what kind of device it was, didn't show up but sound was still coming out of my speakers. I went into the playback devices
 and disabled the device to see if a restart would help, and the device disappeared from the list. I assumed that because of the update, my drivers weren't installed correctly. I went into device manager and tried to update the drivers. My AMD High Definition
 Audio device updated fine, but when I tried to update the Realtek HD audio device, an error occurred while installing that read "data error (cyclic redundancy check)" I visited the Realtek website to get the drivers manually from there and the installation
 again FAILED with a 0x00000017 error. I checked my Windows Update and the driver is listed there, but when it begins "preparing to install updates", ANOTHER error comes up: "Error 0x80070017" I have tried everything from doing a chkdsk and finding no issues
 to looking up forums online that provide NO HELP relating to my issue.. I'm just hoping that someone can help me with this. I've been looking for a solution since last night and have found nothing. It's becoming very frustrated. Please help!!!!</p>

I am in a computer technology class and my teacher recommended I do the same, but it's currently 7:30am and I started the chkdsk /r around 11:30am YESTERDAY. It has been stuck at 10% with no hope of moving. I left it running all night and now I can't stop it
 without the risk of losing data

            I did infact have bad sectors. 8 of them to be exact! I force stopped the chkdsk and my computer automatically ran a diagnostic and told me that my hard drive was definitely going bad. I called Dell and luckily I have a warranty so they sent me a new hard
 drive!&nbsp;

    <title>Get rid of a RAID Configuration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denmarfl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Get rid of a RAID Configuration</h2>
                    <p><span>I was trying to do a good deed and help an older couple upgrade their Desktop running Windows7 Pro 64 Bit by installing a SSD drive.&nbsp; When I went to Clone the SSD drive….what I found was that when they purchased their Dell
 XPS8300….they had it sent to a PC Tech to start it and tweak it and one of the things he did was to set up a RAID configuration using the Original drive and added a new drive.&nbsp; The RAID is a redundancy configuration (RAID 0 or RAID 1????) &nbsp;which I found out
 when I spoke to the Tech who made these changes….but, the tech was not willing to assist us to dump this RAID configuration and put the PC back to Drive in the O Port being the OS and Bootable drive, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Drive a standalone….to save Data
 to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before the couple ordered the SSD drive I did look at My Computer which showed a C:\ drive and no other HDD drives….showed it as a 640GB Drive . &nbsp;But when I opened the PC to install the SSD drive to Clone it off the c:\ drive…I
 saw it had 2x650GB Drives.&nbsp; The tech said both drives were a mirror of one another…that is how he configured the RAID configuration...and it was backup configured/ he used the word redundancy. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I went into BOIS, changed the Drive setting from RAID to ATA….discontented the 2</span><sup>nd</sup><span> drive (connected to Port 1)…thinking since both drives were the same image….the
 PC would Boot to Windows off the Drive connected to Port 0…..&nbsp;&nbsp; That </span><span>didn't I realize</span><span>happen, the PC would not boot to Windows…..it went to the screen asking you to run diagnostics
 or Continue normally.&nbsp; I ran diagnostics….it didn’t provide any information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I could Clone the SSD from the HDD connected to Port 0……but it still would Boot to Windows when it was the only drive connected, and the BOIS setting was ATA.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know if there is any benefit to installing the SSD in the RAID configuration…if it would even improve the speed of the PC…over that when the Port 0 device was the HDD…..</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I would really like is to remove RAID……and end up with Port 0 as a HDD; the Bootable drive and Port 1 HDD as a standalone drive to save data…..and somehow…..clone the SSD drive to Boot the PC to Windows and have all the
 Owners software installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I realize I could just set BOIS to ATA, install the SSD drive, load a fresh copy of Windows on it……(obviously disconnecting both RAID HDD’s)….but than I must re-load all Owner installed software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do not understand if both RAID HDD are mirrors of one another why when I set BOIS to ATA, disconnected HDD connected to Port 1….the PC wouldn’t boot to Windows….there is a Bootable sector somewhere in this 2 Drive RAID configuration…..</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I Have cloned several SSD drives for myself and other buddies….. none of those PC’s had a RAID configuration…so it was simple, Install the SSD to Motherboard, did some housecleaning, used Cloning software,….PC Booted to windows
 and the PC’s were running, like they did when the HDD was the Bootable device except, the PC’s ran faster…….&nbsp;&nbsp; This Upgrade….has really thrown me some hurdles.&nbsp; You want to do something good for a friend…..and you really feel badly when you have failed and
 so far I have….</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any help will be appreciated&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Appreciate all replies....Sorry if anyone who replied here is offended....I just broke all the rules....and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made no changes in BOIS, it was set to RAID AND i LEFT IT THAT WAY. &nbsp;I disconnected one of the 2 RAID Drives. &nbsp;I ReBooted the PC and although it was slow it Booted from the One RAID Drive still connected to windows. &nbsp;I then decided to clone the SSD. &nbsp;Plugged
 the SSD into Port 3. &nbsp;The clone ran fine. &nbsp;On completion, I disconnected the Remaining RAID drive I cloned from, plugged the Newly Cloned SSD to the Communication SATA cable plugged to Port O (where the previous RAID drive was connected)....Started the PC
 with just the SSD Drive connected.....it Booted to Windows in under 20 seconds. &nbsp;It works great.</p>

<h2>            Mortal Kombat X Premium Edition - Kombat Pack Query</h2>
                    
<p><span>Just purchased Mortal Kombat X Premium Edition but the Kombat Pack DLC that is supposed to come with it has not appeared in my download queue. Currently only the Goro &amp; Samurai Pack DLCs, along with the game itself are installing. I note that the file
 size for the Kombat Pack on the Marketplace is zero but I thought you usually get some sort of place holder in your game library with a season pass or at least you used to you. Could somebody please confirm whether&nbsp;an entry for the Kombat Pack is supposed
 to appear in your game library when purchasing this bundle. Thanks in advance.</span></p>
