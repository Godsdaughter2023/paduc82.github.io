    <title>Up&#47;Down Arrow in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bubba12ascp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Up&#47;Down Arrow in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook Home and Business 2010, 14.0.7135.5000.&nbsp; I also have all the updates that it told me to do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was working I used&nbsp;the business/US government style of Outlook. I don't believe it was called Outlook at that time, 3 years ago. It was probably called "Exchange". When I would go through&nbsp;my messages I could use an up/down arrow with my mouse to navigate
 the&nbsp;list of messages. I cannot do this with Outlook&nbsp;2010. Am I missing the arrows&nbsp; or do I have to add them? I know I can use the Up/Down arrows on the keyboard, but&nbsp;using the mouse &nbsp;made reading messages so much easier. Also, is it available in any newer
 forms of Outlook? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help and if&nbsp;you need any more info I can try and provide it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When scrolling with the wheel does not work for you in Outlook, it is most likely a driver issue with the mouse.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before proceeding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-&gt;Whether the issue occurs on other Office/Non-Office applications?<br />
<br />
If the issue occurs on other apps as well, then proceed with the mouse/driver troubleshooting steps.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue is with scrolling the wheel follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Open <strong>Device Manager </strong>from <strong>Control Panel </strong>
and expand “<strong>Mice and other Pointing devices”. </strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Right click&nbsp;the mouse and choose <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>…
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Select:</strong> Browse my computer for driver software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Select: </strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3.From the list shown, choose <strong>“PS/2 Compatible Mouse” or “Microsoft PS/2 Mouse”.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4.Click <strong>Next</strong> to complete the driver installation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>For more information</strong>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Move Mouse</strong>: To activate this command, say the words "<strong>Move mouse"
</strong>and the direction to start to move the mouse pointer. Once you have moved the mouse pointer over the specific object, say "Click" to select the object.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Mouse Grid: </strong>To activate this command, say "<strong>Mouse grid</strong>" or "<strong>Mouse grid window</strong>".
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A grid will then appear on your screen over the area upon which you are currently working. To select a specific area, say the number corresponding to the box in the grid. A new and smaller grid will appear separating this area into smaller boxes. Once
 you have moved the mouse pointer over the specific object, say "<strong>Click"</strong> to select the object.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the status of the issue, feel free to contact us and we'll be happy to help you.</span></p>

            <p>I am sorry for the confusion. The mouse works perfectly. The problem is in the "ribbon" on Outlook. The arrow was included in the ribbon. When you left-clicked the mouse on the arrow, it would go to the next message header. It is like hitting the down arrow
 on the keyboard to go to the next message header. It's not a big deal, as I am retired, but it was a nice feature when you had hundreds of messages to go through.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also wondering if it is on any of the newer outlook programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 IMAP Push stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roger wolfson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 IMAP Push stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been using IMAP in Outlook for a year, and the O365/Outlook 2016 version for months, and a new problem just started in mid-December: New messages only show up in my Inbox when I switch into the folder, not automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted and recreated my IMAP mail account in Outlook, and in fact I've tried with two different providers, Earthlink and Fastmail. I have subscribed to the Inbox folder, I've set "Inbox" as the IMAP root, but the mail still doesn't appear automatically.
 However, right after I sent myself a test message (including from non-Outlook web clients), my desktop Outlook app does immediately show a status bar message that it's synchronizing Inbox. So I think that it receives the push notification from the server,
 but just doesn't display anything until I leave the Inbox folder and then return to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the netstat command shows an active connection to the server:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;TCP &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.2:63712 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;imap:imaps &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ESTABLISHED&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips? This seems to have stopped working on its own, though Outlook has updated itself recently and maybe at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

Hello Roger,<br />
<br />
What is your Outlook 2016 version?<br />
<br />
Do the following to check:<br />
<br />
1] Start Outlook in safe mode to check this&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Choose Start &gt; Run.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Type Outlook /safe, and choose OK.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the Choose Profiles dialog box, accept the default setting of Outlook and choose OK.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2] Create a new Windows profile and then fresh reinstall Outlook 2016 client to check this issue.<br />
<br />
3] Check with another PC to replicate this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks,
</p><p />

            Hi Roger,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update. Based on the description issue may lie with the client side. To resolve any client or computer issue, first make sure that the computer should have the latest operating system updates, and use latest application software.<br />
<br />
May I know whether you have tried to repair Office application program to check this issue? For your reference:

<br />
If the repairing Office application steps don’t help, then <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
completely uninstall Office</a> and reinstall the latest Office application program to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<h2>            Inbox not syncing in Outlook 16</h2>
                    <p>I got a new PC in January and installed office 16. I set up my email as IMAP to use my talktalk email account. All was OK except when I open outlook my inbox does not receive any new emails. If I click the send/receive it does nothing, no error message,
 just nothing. I have to click on another folder (eg. personal or sent etc) then go back to my inbox before it will receive emails. It is then normally OK for the duration of I have outlook open. Sometimes I do have to "refresh" it by going to another folder
 again, sometimes not??</p>
<p>I'm not technical at all so don't know what to do but I'm sure I shouldn't have to do this. I have another PC and laptop on windows XP, an android tablet and phone and they all work fine.</p>
<p>Help??</p>

<p><span><span>To resolve the issue let us check the following in Outlook 2016.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In Outlook click on <strong>File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Send and Receive</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Make sure that the option <strong>Send immediately when connected</strong> is checked.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Save the changes made by clicking on OK twice.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once the above is set make sure to close and reopen Outlook 2016 and check if the issue resolves.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If not, try removing your IMAP account and re-adding the account once again in Outlook 2016. Check if re-adding the account works.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above steps still do not work then configure your IMAP account in a new Outlook Profile and check if the issue resolves.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Create a new Outlook Profile following the steps from the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Configure your IMAP account in the new Outlook Profile and allow it to download/sync all information.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once done close and reopen Outlook 2016 in the new Outlook Profile and check if the issue resolves.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            If you added a new Profile then added a mail account via the first auto setup screen, it would have set up an IMAP mail account, to have set up a pop mail account you would have had to use the option at the bottom of that window to select "Manual setup..........."
 then next, then you would have had to enter the pop/smtp settings<br />

<p>Search for mail server settings this time said unable to connect to server. I am connected to internet as I am using it at the moment??</p>
<p>It also does not show mail accounts under control panel.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I am not a tech person and don't really understand all this. I do not know what is meant by a profile anyway??</p>

            I'm having EXACTLY the same problem. I too don't know (or want to know) what a new Profile is or what adding one achieves, so I'm not going to, it should NOT be necessary. I'm on a new PC, purchased OFFICE 2016 and I expect this stuff to work out of the
 box. Clearly, lots of others are having the same issue so this needs fixing. &nbsp;Interestingly, I set up a second user on the PC (for my wife), her email is with the same internet service provider, &nbsp;and her account works perfectly. I need a solution to this and
 I've seen nothing that helps yet, poor.&nbsp;

            Since you just joined this forum 46 minutes ago and you are on the public version of Windows (14393.693) and not yet on the Creator's Update build 15014, I can only assume since you really have not given us very much info to work with, that you have just
 joined Insiders which means that it might take 24 hours to get build 15014 if you are on the fast ring. If you are on release preview&nbsp;ring (14393.726) and just joined it still may take awhile to get the update. If you are on the slow ring, it still may take
 awhile, but I am unsure of the build number. More info equals better answers.

<h3> piaid-artist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Axisearch &#47; fbDownloader virus</h2>
                    <p>I was searching online for a school project and noticed that Google has changed to axisearch.com without my permission. I found a website telling me how to get rid of it. I followed the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click Tools and select Manage add-ons.<br />
2. On the Toolbars and Extensions tab search for FBDownloader and additional third party add-ons and remove them.</p>
<p><br />
I searched for axisearch and fbdownloader and my computer said it found nothing related. So I tried a different website and found these instructions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Control Panel<br />
2. Click "Uninstall a program"</p>
<p>3. Find axisearch/fbdownloader and uninstall</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched and went through my control panel and found no axisearch. I know axisearch is there, because when I search "how to get rid of axisearch" ,&nbsp; the name axisearch is in the link: axisearch.com/search.php?channel=en&amp;q=how+to+get+rid+of+axisearch&nbsp;(Do
 NOT click on that link! You might get the virus!!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it's on there, but my computer reads and says it isn't. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I properly remove axisearch when my computer can't find it? D: Please help!</p>

<p>I have my email set up through Office 365 that i purchased with my GoDaddy account. &nbsp;(My email address is through GoDaddy.) I have it set up to forward my emails to my yahoo account. &nbsp;I receive the emails forwarded from outlook to my yahoo account, but along
 with each email I also get two more emails attached to the thread that say "Your message wasn't delivered because the recipient's mailbox is quarantined. If the problem continues, please contact your email admin." I checked my outlook inbox and I am receiving
 a message like this every time it forwards a message to my yahoo account. &nbsp;How do I fix this so that my email address is no longer "quarantined" and I can stop receiving these annoying messages?!</p>

<p>To look into the issue, can you please confirm the following information?</p>
<p>1. Can you please send us the complete NDR (non-delivery report) or error message for analysis?</p>
<p>2. If you send emails directly from your Office 365 account to the Yahoo account, does the error persist?</p>
<p>3. If you use other email account such as Gmail account to forward to the Yahoo account, does the issue still exist?</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message for the information. Click the link below to access the private message:</p>

<p>Hi Kasey,</p>
<p>According to the NDR (non-delivery report) and the link included, the message was blocked by Yahoo.</p>
<p>I also checked the DNS records of your domain and found that the SPF record which helps prevent emails sent from the domain being regarded as spam has been added properly.</p>
<p>In this situation, I suggest you contact Yahoo support to fix the issue. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Excel Number Format to eliminate or change the decimal symbol - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george thalassinos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Number Format to eliminate or change the decimal symbol</h2>
                    <p>Is there a custom format that will display a value with an integer part and a decimal part in a cell without the decimal symbol? i.e. 1234,5 to show as 1234 5 or even better as 1234-5 or 1234/5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar format is the one used for fractions but it only displays correctly when adding the fraction base : 1234,5 using ###0 ?/??. would show as 1234 5/10 and I would rather not show the "/10" ending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? I will be able to avoid changing many procedures due to the fact that a 4-digit part field (i.e. 1234), somewhere along the way, acquired a "sub part". So it is either a new column with the sub part (and code changes...) or a decimal value to incorporate
 the sub part with the main part id as a decimal. And I would like to "show" the sub part in the cell as a separate number either with a space between them or with some other separator ("-" , "/" , "[ ]", whatever).</p>

A number can be displayed in oodles of custom formats,<br />

Here is an example where a number is displayed<br />
in engineering format with superscripts<br />
and reduced to 4 significant digits.<br />

If you get *.zip, don't unzip, just rename *.xlsm<br />
I would tweak the macro to your specs if I was convinced it had utility to the community at large.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 -- IMAP &#40;specifically GMail&#41; Operation Issue</h2>
                    <p><span>This may be a little long, but I am not really sure how to state the issue more succinctly, so please bear with me...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I</span><span>n Gmail, all e-mail is shown in the "All Mail" folder.&nbsp; The other folders, including the "Inbox" are "Labels" and act as filters to see e-mail in groups
 that are designated by the account owner.&nbsp; Deleting an e-mail message in one folder does not delete the item from "All Mail", it acts as a method of removing the "label" from it and so, in effect, shifts<br />
it out of the filtered folder but keeps it archived in the "All Mail" folder. </span>
<span>Previous versions of Outlook appear to have treated this process the same.&nbsp; An IMAP folder or sub-folder could have a message in it deleted, but the message would still remain in the "All Mail" folder.&nbsp; To delete
<span>Previous versions of Outlook appear to have treated this process the same.&nbsp; An IMAP folder or sub-folder could have a message in it deleted, but the message would still remain in the "All Mail" folder.&nbsp; To delete
 it permanently from the server in previous versions of&nbsp; Outlook, selecting the message in the "All Mail" folder, you would have to move or drag-and-drop the message to the Gmail "Trash" folder.&nbsp; Once in the "Trash" folder, deleting the message "Marked" it
 (message went grey with a line though it).&nbsp; Once marked, you selected "Purge" and the message was deleted permanently.
</span><span>This process was necessary to be compatible with the process that the Gmail web based application follows.&nbsp; When permanently deleting a message through the Gmail web site, deleting the message from "All
 Mail" would move the message to the Trash", and deleting the message in the "Trash" is what would delete the message permanently.&nbsp; The "Spam" folder was treated similarly to the "Trash" and was able to permanently delete from the server also.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This has all changed in Outlook 2013.&nbsp; I cannot get messages to delete properly between Outlook 2013 and Gmail.&nbsp; I have selected the option to "Mark items for deletion but do not move them automatically."&nbsp;
 The line below this states how it should work if it is selected:&nbsp; "Items marked for deletion will be permanently deleted when the items in the mailbox are purged."&nbsp; If I understand this correctly, this should make Outlook 2013 function like previous versions.&nbsp;
 But it does not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have changed the setting in Gmail under "IMAP Access" regarding "When I mark a message in IMAP as deleted:"&nbsp; to " Auto-Expunge off - wait for the client to update the server" and set the "When the message
 is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder:" with "Move the message to the Trash".
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have even tried several variations and combinations of this between Outlook 2013 and my Gmail accounts without success.&nbsp; All folders are showing fine -- have no problems with that -- it is merely how the
 deleting of messages is functioning and it is VERY concerning.&nbsp; When deleting messages from folders other than "All Mail", the effect should be the same as&nbsp; merely removing the label from the message.&nbsp; It should be gone from the folder, but remain in "All
 Mail".&nbsp; To remove the message from the server entirely, deleting the message from "All Mail" should move the message to the Gmail "Trash" and deleting it from the "Trash" should remove the message permanently from the server -- just like it does with the Gmail
 website.&nbsp; It worked like this -- ok, closely by making me have to move the message to the trash rather than deleting it in All Mail, but I was fine with that minor step -- in all previous versions of Outlook.&nbsp; Why can't this functionality be brought back?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What I am seeing in Outlook 2013 is messages being deleted in Outlook folders but not on the Gmail server.&nbsp; In some combinations of the above options between Outlook 2013 and Gmail settings I have been able
 to get the IMAP folders to sync the deletion properly but not the deletion from the server through the "All Mail" folder.&nbsp; At best I can either try to move the message from the "All Mail" in Outlook to the trash.&nbsp; This "Marks" the message in the "All Mail"
 folder in Outlook, and has&nbsp;SOMETIMES -- not always&nbsp;-- &nbsp;made the message show up in the "Trash" in Outlook, but has had NO impact on the Gmail server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Why is this functionality important?&nbsp; Well, for one, it helps to keep the "Inbox" clean.&nbsp; I can delete messages from the folder and keep them on the server for later reference rather than keeping them in the
 "Inbox" or otherwise filing them if I did not want to.&nbsp; Further, if I have spam, fishing, or other "junk mail", I can permanently delete them from the server and eliminate risks from viruses or other annoyances.&nbsp; Unfortunately I no longer have this ability
 with Outlook 2013.&nbsp; I would never bother with the e-mail functionality of Outlook if Gmail had a way to set "Rules" in order to auto sort mail for me like Outlook does, but that is not -- yet -- a feature of it or any other web based mail client.</span></p>
<br />
<span>How can we get this fixed?</span>

            <p>Some further details of importance to solving this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the error message that I receive when I try to move items from my "All Mail" folder in the Outlook 2013 environment to the trash -- emulating what is done when in the web based Gmail environment:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3073c15f-09d7-4a5e-8206-2f3606d59111" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The statement in the above error message is incorrect.&nbsp; The items were not already moved or deleted.&nbsp; However, some setting is denying me access to this command (move file from "All Mail" to "Trash") and therefore the server is unavailable for this command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked fine in all other versions of Outlook, so I know it is a coding error or a settings error.&nbsp; If it is a settings error, I just need someone to help me figure out the proper settings to make it function as I desire to.&nbsp; If it is a coding error, someone
 at Microsoft needs to compare the code for Outlook 2013 with Outlook 2010 and 2007 and make the coding match in order for the function to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help here would be GREATLY appreciated.</p>

 they are still in the 'All Mail' Inbox on Gmail. What MSeurat did not mention, assuming he/she had the same problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every single other email client I use (OSX Mail, Spark for Mac/iOS, Thunderbird) deletes the Gmail messages with no problem.</li><li>The messages that are 'deleted' by Outlook still show up as Inbox messages in all other clients.</li></ul>
<p>Has there been a new workaround that I missed since late 2014? If not, can this problem be reviewed, please? The integrity of my Inbox is certainly important enough to eliminate Outlook if that is the proper plan of attack.</p>

            <p>An oldie but a goodie,&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ae545095-60dc-426e-a87a-edcc1ab906ea" title="MSeurat">MSeurat</a>. My issue is/was with Outlook 2010 which is very similar to Outlook 2013 in terms of setup and behaviour. I'll be
 upgrading to the latest Office suite so I wanted to get my email organised well before this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that I could not delete email in All Mail has been bugging me since 2014, hence there were over 40,000 emails in All Mail. Outlook 2010 was struggling with volumes of this size, particularly when I moved emails around. To complicate matters this
 was not reflected in Gmail reality, so when Outlook resynced the All Mail folders, the moved emails were back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I think we all understand that Gmail tags "conversations" and that Outllook IMAP replicates entire tagged-folder contents, so we end up with replicated emails between All Mail and the IMAP Gmail folders Inbox, Bin, Important, Sent Mail, Spam, Starred
 and Deleted Messages. The Outlook folders Sent Items, Deleted Items and Outbox are also involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I implemented the settings provided by "A.B." and this stopped the All Mail automatic restore of moved emails, so I could finally archive All Mail resulting in an email number decrease. I also went into Gmail to remove tags such as Important and to empty
 the Bin. Fortunately, Outlook does not replicated entire Gmail sub-folder settings such as &nbsp;Primary, Social and Promotions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem I'm finding with Outlook 2010 IMAP, is that a lot of bulk email processing eventually slows Outlook down to a snail's pace so that it fails to respond or even allows you to exit elegantly. Therefore, I am limited to archiving around 10,000
 emails before I perform a deliberate Outlook exit and restart. Otherwise, the PST files I am archiving to can become corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully the final but most frustrating problem is that Outlook 2010 operating on Windows 10 Professional, blocks on I/O. While it is stuck moving emails from the Gmail IMAP folders (in particular "All Mail") to archive PST folders, it slows to a grinding
 pace and blocks all file-system I/O in the process. So I can't copy files from an ftp site to a local folder by drag and drop in Explorer! This is one major motivation for moving from 32-bit Outlook 2010 to the 64-bit versions of Office 2016.</p>

                    I can view the shared notebook from the web portal by clicking on the link in the email. However, if I click on the "Open in OneNote" button, OneNote asks me to sign in, after I sign in, the app tells me that I don't have permission to view the document.
 If I reset the OneNote app and remove the credentials from Keychain Access, I can open the document, but only for a while. The next day I open the notebook, OneNote gives me an error and tell me to sign in again, then I get the permission error again.&nbsp;

<h2>            Visio 2003 installation issues on W10</h2>
                    <p>OS is Win 10 and try to install Visio Professional 2003, but I get this error:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f5b7c12-bf82-4fa7-8c0e-5b89a3f308df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f5b7c12-bf82-4fa7-8c0e-5b89a3f308df" /></a></p>
<p>I believe it is "That Visio is not supported by WIN 10" since I am currently running it on an "older" computers with Win XP/7 and less of everything compared to my new computer.
</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Hoping for a quick non expensive solution on this challenge.</p>

    <title>Auto-marking for indexes causes docx files to become unreadable. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iotola  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto-marking for indexes causes docx files to become unreadable.</h2>
                    
<p>While using Word 2007 when I mark an index from a concordance file it corrupts the entire docx file.</p>
<p>The file remains editable but after closing and saving the file it is totally unreadable in word 2007. OpenOffice can actual open the file but the formatting is corrupt.</p>
<p>This is a major problem in that I am unable to build an index for 2 out of 3 of my 200 page manuals.</p>
<p>It is a repeatable problem.</p>
<p>Anyone know a fix for this?</p>

<p>This used to be a bug in the first versions of Office 2007. If I'm not mistaken this was fixed later on. Are you sure you have all patches and updates installed?</p>
<p>One workaround that was used in the past was to avoid index entries inside (nested) tables. I'm not sure if that was the only place where they appeared, but that was the most common problem iirc.</p>

<p>Do you know which patches fixed this so I can request that the patch be pushed out?</p>
<p>I have a number of tables so these maybe automarked - I will try removing the automarks, but this is going to be very time consuming and is thus not really a solution.</p>

<p>I have Office 2007 Service Pack 2 already installed.</p>
<p>I have performed some further checks and the problem is not present in Office 2010, however documents that work in Office 2010 still appear corrupt to Office 2007. So this is without doubt a bug with Office 2007 that is fixed within Office 2010.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community. I will provide you the information on read receipt option in Outlook 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 2&nbsp;options to enable the read receipt in Outlook 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Enable the read receipt request from Outlook options. This will apply to all the outgoing e-mails by default.</p>
<p>2. Enable the read receipt request to specific e-mail message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on How to request read receipts and delivery receipts, refer the following article:<br />

    <title>Sorting old e-mails by date in Microsoft Outlook for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sorting old e-mails by date in Microsoft Outlook for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Microsoft Outlook for Mac, version 16.16.2.</p>
<p>When searching for e-mails, I start by sorting them by "Date" at the top. The e-mails are sorted in roughly the correct order. The systems seems to get the year right, and also day of month. But sometimes it mixes up months. For example, all e-mails from
 August could end up being regarded as "newer" than the ones from October. Or whatever - it seems to be quite random.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone knows how to fix this?</p>

            Hello Daniel,
<br />
<br />I understand that you are having an issue with Microsoft Outlook for Mac as some of your emails are not sorted correctly by date. I know how annoying this can be, rest assured, I will try my best to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />Whenever you encounter that issue again, please
<br />
<br />1. Try to click sort by date again
<br />2. Ensure that you are not confused by multiple dates being displayed on the screen (see screenshot)
<br />3. If the sort emails feature not work correctly for you, turn off reading pane then sort by "Received Date" table filter (Generally: View &gt; Layout &gt; Reading Pane &gt; Off)
<br />
<br />If none of the above resolve your issue, you may like to raise this to Microsoft Outlook support, refer to this thread: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a>

<h2>            Lumia 800 Camera Sensor Line Noise&#63; And other problems.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in need of a second opinion about a problem with my Lumia 800. When taking low-light pictures, they would have quite prominent noise lines. Is this a common problem with this model or do I have a faulty phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>View the pics attached to see the problem I'm describing. In the second picture, look at the sky part and in the third one look at the clouds on the right side of the picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Second problem</li></ul>
<p>Sometimes when my calls are terminated the phone would go dark and in some cases shuts down altogether. Is this normal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Viber and WhatsApp installed but I seem to remember having this problem ever since I got the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

            I remember I have my N9, which has the exactly same camera module as Lumia 800's. Pictures shot in low light with these two phones are noisy due to its aperture of f2.2. So yeah, it's totally normal, at least for me.<br />
<br />
It's not normal for your phone to reboot itself after a call. Have you updated your phone software to the latest one? If you do, have you tried resetting your phone?

<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@Reboot</p>
<p>I've reset this phone once when I had to change the main account, and it's updated to the latest firmware. I haven't had any instance of this problem for the past week or so though. Looks like it's intermittent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm beginning to think that the proximity sensor might be faulty, since sometimes buttons (most commonly 'Hold' and 'End call') would be mistakenly pressed in the middle of a call and some other times it would stay dark after calls. Diagnostics came out
 fine so I'm rather baffled now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will probably take it to Nokia Care and have them check it soon. Thanks again.</p>

    <title>Formulas with External Workbook reference to Workbook on OneDrive in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom-con  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formulas with External Workbook reference to Workbook on OneDrive in Office365 get stale results&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am finding that formulas that reference an external workbook on OneDrive, in Office365, are not recalculating consistently.
 This, if confirmed, would seem to be a serious issue. I have never seen this before the installation of Office 365. Sorry the explanation is a bit long but i wanted to be very detailed. Since this is a calculation problem it is potentially very serious.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have two cells in a workbook, that both reference the same cell in an external workbook that is on OneDrive. Side by side, i
 can see that they have different values. One of the values appears to be a "chached" (stale) previous value, not the current value. So, i do not understand why it is not being updated as one normally expects with Excel. The workbook that these formulas reference
 is also open. The two values remain different despite "Calculate Now", despite entering things in cells that would cause recalc, and despite saving either or both workbooks. The only thing that corrects the "wrong" value, is to edit its formula text, and then,
 when I hit return, it then returns the correct value (but now that new currently correct value becomes the value that is 'stuck' as that result).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I notice that the two cells refer to the cell differently, in the following two ways:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(1) =[D4p_enter.xlsx]daily!$I$17</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(2) ='C:\Users\tomcx\onedrive\[D4p_enter.xlsx]daily'!$I$17</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As i understand it, since the workbook D4P_enter is open, then the formulas should be in the first form and not show the entire
 path (which is what you expect when the externally referenced workbook is not currently open). And indeed the first one is the one that returns the "correct" value. So, I do not understand why Excel does not change expression (2) to (1) when the workbook is
 opened. (any ideas?).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When i close the workbook D4p_enter, the formula (1) is updated and now reads:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(1a) ='https://d.docs.live.net/da6e7d8e7901482d/[D4p_enter.xlsx]daily'!$I$17</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">But formula (2) remains unchanged (and still with a stale value).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Re-opening D4p_enter, formula (1a) now returns to its original form as formula (1), but formula (2) remains unchanged both in how
 its formula is expressed and in the value that is returned.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If I edit the formula text in (2), erase the "7" at the end say, then re-type it, when i hit return it updates with the current
 correct value. But, the form of the formula still does not change, and now this value is "stuck" in that formula, and it will continue to not update as the value in the referenced workbook dynamically changes, unless i repeat the process of editing it.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">All i can ask is, can anybody interpret what is going on, and what i can do to make sure that Excel is recalculating 'normally' every time the value in the referenced workbook changes? I simplified this example to see it, but of
 course other cells reference these values and they too are wrong, and so this is a killer type problem.<br />
<br />
Much thanks for any observations or help you can offer.<br />
<br />
Tom</span>

            Are you sure you are looking at the correct pst file?  What is the file size &amp; last modified date?  Are the new items in the pst? 
<br />
<br />If you  add/emove messages from the folder, there can be sufficient 'white space' for the new content to use to replace deleted items, which means the file size won't change... but I would expect some change, so its odd that its not changing even a little bit.

<p>Yes is quite strange and i am searching what is wrong. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The pst files are correct, with few months difference. The last date was 12-04-18 and the previous one 17-08-17. New emails have added to the folder, and i don't delete anything from there. Actually these emails are receipts and invoices from online buys.
 I keep them as a record and it's actually small size (around 16mb).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on properties on both pst files i see exactly the same size&nbsp;17,643,420 bytes..</p>

<p>If you have changed the code from the standard 12345 then there isn't a way to recover the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try the hard reset (hold down the *, 3 and green keys whilst the phone is switched on until at least the handshake logo), or have the phone flashed at a Nokia service point. Either way, the phone will be completely wiped so you need to back up
 important data like contacts and messages first.</p>

<p>The Hard Reset may reset the code but if it doesn't then your only other option is to get it reset at your nearest Nokia Care Point. You will need to bring proof of ownership with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to backup your phone before hard resetting.</p>
