            USB ports can provide some power to the device plugged in, and can accept power to charge the battery:
<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB</a>
<br />
<br />Sounds like you have a hardware problem with that specific USB port. It can no longer provide as much power as it was rated for.

            <p>Hi Cheryl 01,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you using Internet explorer to access internet?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If yes, what is the version of the same?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> If you are working on internet explorer then you may refer follow the steps from the link mentioned below and check.</p>

    <title>Audio Problems After Most Recent Windows 10 Update..... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshuahuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Problems After Most Recent Windows 10 Update.....</h2>
                    <p>My laptop and speakers were working perfectly fine until the Windows 10 update that went through yesterday (I believe is when it was). At first the audio wouldn't play through my laptop speakers at all but would play through my external speakers. Frustrating,
 yes, but I figure out the problem and set the laptop audio back to default. The problem was solved..... Or so I thought. I went to plug my speakers in a few hours later to watch a YouTube video on my laptop and the audio continued to come through the laptop's
 speakers. Once again, I was extremely annoyed. Curious and wanting to test my theory, I went and set the speakers as my default audio device again. BAM! The audio was coming through my speakers like a charm. It was perfect. Until I unplugged my speakers again
 just to find out that the audio would no longer come through my laptop speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what the deal is but I keep having problems with Windows 10 EVERY SINGLE TIME IT UPDATES. This time it's that my audio will only play through my laptop speakers OR it will only play through my external speakers — whichever is set to default.
 It won't allow plug-n-play where it will switch to the speakers right when I plug them into the audio port and switch back to the laptop speakers when I unplug the external ones. I'm just extremely irritated right now... Please help! Thank you so much in advance!</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for the response. I'm afraid, however, that I've already tried fixing the issue with the troubleshooter. All it did was switch my default audio device to either the laptop audio or to the external speakers, whichever I selected for it to
 fix the problem for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also already made sure my drivers are up-to-date. That was actually the first thing I did after realizing this issue was more of a problem than I had originally suspected it to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your time and your attempt to help though!</p>

            <p>Can you check the audio controller driver? Just give me a photo of the device manager and show me the sound,video and game controllers you have there....</p>
<p>That issue must be caused by your Audio Controller, something called Stereo mix switching automatically between Audio outputs (it might do the same for audio inputs)</p>

            <p>I believe the image below is the screenshot you were asking for. I don't have any extra audio devices installed. I'm not sure if RealTek or something might have been in there before or not because I never looked because an issue like this has never came
 up for me. Thanks for taking the time to try and help!</p>

            I'm afraid this is no help. I switched from Windows 7 to Windows 10 (I never got Windows 8/8.1). And even when I attempt running programs made for previous versions of Windows it doesn't show any audio options whatsoever, just all of the software that's
 installed on my laptop. Thanks for trying though.

<div>Okay, the driver there came from Microsoft, which should work fine....Re-installing may help, double-click on it, click on driver, then click on uninstall, click on OK. After that, click on "Scan for Hardware Changes" button (The one under Help). Windows
 Should re-install the driver for you. If the issue persists, right-click on the speakers icon on the taskbar, click playback devices,double click on your speakers, Click on enhancements then click disable all enhancements.</div>
<div>I always recommend you to install the audio drivers, not only it provides stability for the sound...But it improves it as well...Can you tell me your laptop maker+ your laptop model? so i can get the audio drivers for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your laptop model should be always written on bottom (if not on top)

</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The fault you're seeing arises because of changes to OneDrive, where the photo album you tried to share would have been stored. The function doesn't work any more, so the message you tried to send is now stuck in your outbox and is preventing other messages
 from being sent. First, remove any unsent messages from the outbox. You may have to disconnect from the Internet to be able to empty the outbox. You don't have to delete these messages; you could just drag them to a drafts folder to save having to compose
 them again.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
When the outbox is empty,&nbsp;compose a new test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself (i.e. from the account that's misbehaving to the same account). Post&nbsp;any error messages in your reply. At the same time,&nbsp;please give your build of the program.
 To find your program version and build, in Windows Live Mail press Alt-F B.</p>

</p><p>I am finding this subject frustrating and anger producing. &nbsp;I am not a brilliant technician, &nbsp;and have put up with horrible service regarding WLM, &nbsp;which Microsoft appears to be unwilling or incapable of fixing problems not of the clients making! &nbsp;I followed
 all the suggestions, &nbsp;still get the inane messages that "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Your server has unexpectedly terminated the connection. Possible causes for this include server problems, network problems, or a long period of inactivity.</span>&nbsp;(at
 least over a year!), &nbsp;and am slowly figuring out how to move everything over to MAIL, &nbsp;including all the precious Storage Folders (I mail these to myself, &nbsp;pick them up in MAIL, &nbsp;and have created a folder named SAVED FOLDERS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I deleted my mail containing photos, (This included all the emails of my dear husband's death stuck in OUTBOX so no one learned in time for the service to celebrate his life!) the outbox remains empty. &nbsp;Of course the photos are in my computer, &nbsp;so I
 was able to eventually send them through other browsers. &nbsp;Thank you , &nbsp;Microsoft, &nbsp;for giving no help to a long standing problem! &nbsp;I hope when I eventually get used to using MAIL, &nbsp;the floor is not cut out from under me by no support again, &nbsp;as with WLM!</p>
<p>I think it's time to recognize that the reason so many elderly people give up on using the internet is because there is virtually no help for the non-geek who runs into technical trouble. &nbsp;This is actually the period in life when computers should be a very
 important part of communication, &nbsp;yet I hear complaints constantly about how confusing simple actions become....,like email getting stuck in the OUTBOX, &nbsp;or the server no longer serving! My computer has literally become my lifeline, &nbsp;but I am unusually patient,
 &nbsp;or I would also have given up years ago!</p>

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t the security of my administrator profile supercede - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> papa danno  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t the security of my administrator profile supercede that of standard user profiles&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am an administrator on my computer (now using Windows 10, although this problem has existed for a very long time). I have folders and files for which I want administrators to have full control and standard users to have restricted read/write access. However,
 it seems that the security for a typical folder or file is set up as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read/Write access</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full control access</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrators&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full control access</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read/Write access</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to work fine for standard users, but if I am interpreting what's going on here correctly, since I am a member of the Administrator group, but also a member of the Users group and a member of the Everyone group, my full control access is overridden
 by my User and Everyone limited access, preventing me from making edits that are needed. In other words, the group with least access takes precedence over the group that should have complete access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a former chief security officer using corporate computer systems, I expect that being an Administrator should override being a standard User. But in Windows, it seems to operate backwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the User Account Control treats an administrator profile as a standard profile until special access is needed. At that point, it usually grants sufficient permissions to accomplish the task, usually by displaying a message. But that is
 not happening when I use&nbsp;a file or folder with&nbsp;the typical configuration mentioned above, or when I try to move or delete a file, or in a number of other situations in which the Administrator should have complete access, as the security settings indicate.
 (I have been able to remove the Everyone and Users groups, but that restricts access to Administrators, and I need standard users to be able to access the file in read-only or&nbsp;read/write conditions.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation gets even worse when you are trying to work across a home Wi-Fi network and trying to make changes on another computer on that network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an answer? If I am a member of multiple groups in a folder's security settings, which one wins? Why doesn't an Administrator always have the access needed to administrate a computer? How can he get it? Changing the UAC seems too risky. I'm
 just not understanding this feature of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>Hello Danno,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the user access rights for Administrator Account in your computer is over ridden</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> T<span><span>ype </span><strong>user accounts</strong> in the Search Bar and click on the result.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Navigate to the following path:&nbsp;<strong>User Account</strong> &gt;
<strong>Manage another account &gt;</strong> <strong>Add a user account option</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;Add an account,&nbsp;and choose&nbsp;<strong>Sign in without a Microsoft account (Not recommended)</strong>, then click<strong> Local account</strong>. Fill the details on the screen so appeared for adding local account. Click
<strong>Finish</strong> when done.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Type <strong><span>cmd </span></strong>in the search bar&nbsp;and open&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Type following command and hit Enter key:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>shutdown /r /o</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The previous step will result your system to boot into Safe Mode. After getting into Safe Mode, T<span><span>ype
</span><strong>user accounts</strong> in the Search Bar and click on the result</span>. You would have now two accounts on your system; first your issued admin account and second the local account which you’ve created in previous step. Select local account.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Now click <strong>Change the account type</strong> link. Moving on, change the account status from
<strong>Standard</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>Administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Reset permissions.</p>
<p><span>Press Shift key and the Power button to restart your Windows PC. You will boot Advanced Menu options. Here click &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Command prompt. In the CMD
<span>window</span><span> type the following command to reset permissions.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d c:\ icacls * /T /Q /C /RESET</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above recommendation does not help, I would suggest you to </span>
enable the hidden administrator account to check for results</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Type in the following Run Command to enable the hidden Administrator Account:
</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user administrator /active:yes
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further information, feel free to write to us and we would be happy to&nbsp;help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help with this problem, Sayan_Ghosh, but I think you may have misunderstood the issue I am having (and have had for several years through several versions of Windows - 7, 8.1, 10). My problem is that any user account that is designated
 as an Administrator ─ and is, therefore, a member of the Administrators group ─ is often blocked from performing some kind of task (viewing a folder, renaming a file, deleting a file, changing ownership or permissions for a folder or file, etc.). The error
 messages tend to say something to the effect that I do not have sufficient authority or permission to execute the task or that I need to get permission from an administrator. But I am an administrator!! I should be able to perform any task on the computer
 that is needed! Something is blocking this access, however. From some experimenting, it seems that if the security for an object (folder of file) includes both the Administrators group and the Users group, my access as an administrator is reduced to the access
 of a standard user simply because I belong to two&nbsp;or more groups. I am frustrated that any user in the Administrators group is limited in any way from the job of administrating the computer. But the problem does not always go away even if I specifically add
 my user account to the security of an object with full control. I'm just really tired of spending hours and hours trying to figure out how to perform basic administration tasks such as renaming a file&nbsp;or deleting a folder. And it gets even worse if I am trying
 to copy a folder from one computer to another on my home network.</p>

            Doesn't anyone from Microsoft or elsewhere know how I, as an Administrator&nbsp;group account,&nbsp;can gain all rights and authorities and access to all items on my computer? If an administrator cannot perform maintenance on all items, who can? What good is a security
 system that prevents all users, administrators or standard, from performing normal maintenance functions on all items and objects?

            <p>I am watching this because I have the similar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the sole user of a desktop running Windows 10 and my account is Administrator. Since the upgrade to Windows 10 I can no longer create a simple Word document and save it on my computer. I am told I do not have permission and should contact the Administrator
 in order to receive permission. I have noted that I am no allowed to save downloaded PDF files because I do not have either access or permission. I can save these things to an external memory stick but not to my hard drive. This is only since upgrading to
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Microsoft Support, first at a storefront and then online. The storefront wanted me to carry in my desktop because they felt it couldn't possibly be their product at fault. Online, I got shuffled from help desk to adviser to adviser and then was
 told to telephone support for Office, which I did but they have so many calls they are unable to help callers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep seeing questions online about Windows 10 users being denied access to their documents and computers but I have seen no acknowledgement from Microsoft that they even believe this is an issue.</p>

            <p>The "administrator" (or root on Unix/Linux) is often misunderstood.&nbsp; People talk about it being "god" and that you are suppose to be able to do whatever you like with that account.&nbsp; This is not true and never has been.&nbsp; The administrator is just restricted
 by permissions as any other account.&nbsp; The main difference is that an administrator can do things like take ownership and change permissions.&nbsp; If I have a file and the permissions are set so that the administrators don't have access to it, that is what happens,
 up until the Administrator changes the permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You ask why such as system should exist that the Administrators group doesn't have access to change anything they want.&nbsp; Well there are many accounts/groups used on a machine, and they all have their purposes, and as such there might be cases where they
 need certain permissions and the Administrators don't, and this is all about security.&nbsp; For instance Windows purposely sets up permissions where the Administrators can't change things in Program Files.&nbsp; Instead a "Trusted Installer" is what does most of the
 changes here.&nbsp; This is to prevent viruses from using your account to install things.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on to why you being in the Administrators group doesn't always give you these permissions.</p>
<p>You can sort of chock this up to the abuse of such privileges by the users and Microsoft for that matter.</p>
<p>If you were to look at the recommendations for security on Unix/Linux it would say that you should only use the root (which is the same as the administrators) account when the extra permissions are necessary.&nbsp; And the same should have applied to Windows,
 but from the get go, the one and only user was put in the Administrators group and it was used for everything.&nbsp; Clearly a security risk and that was proven when the viruses took advantage of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Microsoft needed a change in policy to combat this bad behavior/policy.&nbsp; So starting in Vista they came up with UAC.&nbsp; And what that means is that by default you are running with your normal non administrator permissions.&nbsp; It isn't until you do something
 and causes the program to ask for administrator privileges, that you actually get those permissions.&nbsp; And I might add it is not an all or none thing.&nbsp; A program can ask for only one type of administrator privilege that it needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be illustrated like this.</p>
<p>Create a folder.&nbsp; Put some files in it.&nbsp; Go in to the permissions for the folder and change the owner to Administrators, and remove every other user/group other than Administrators from that folder and below.</p>
<p>Now do Win Key + X -&gt; Command Prompt</p>
<p>Now do: dir c:\FOLDER_YOU_CREATED</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will come back with File Not Found</p>
<p>Now do: Win Key + X -&gt; Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>Now do: dir c:\FOLDER_YOU_CREATED</p>
<p>It will show the files in the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first case you were running with the permissions that your user account has outside of the permissions it would have in the Administrators group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the bottom line is that there is no way for you to just blank change the permissions on all the files on your computer and then just have access to them based on that.&nbsp; It is up to the programs you are using to switch to ask for these privileges, in some
 form.&nbsp; Like when you see the shield icon or if you use Run as Administrator.&nbsp; BTW a program can purposely turn off Administrator privileges.&nbsp; Explorer seems to do that when it first starts.&nbsp; So if for instance started an administrator command prompt and typed:
 Explorer</p>
<p>The Explorer that came up would not be in administrator mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of programs that will not ask for elevated permissions, for instances Notepad.&nbsp; So if you want it to have those permissions you would have to start it with Run As Administrator, or set it in the Compatibility tab of the permissions.&nbsp; Of course
 what you would be doing is trying to defeat the very changes Microsoft put in to protect you from threats like viruses.</p>

            <p>What a laugh!&nbsp; Apple is very much into telling their users what they should do, because they certainly believe they know better than you do.&nbsp; But by all means go buy an Apple and find out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the rest I stated how it works, I'm not associated with Microsoft, and I couldn't care less if you like it or not.&nbsp; And frankly I doubt Microsoft cares either.&nbsp; They have the job of trying to protect users from themselves.&nbsp; As in the users like you
 want total freedom, to leave all the permissions on their machines wide open, to download and run anything they like, and still not be hit by viruses.&nbsp; Not to mention deleting or changing critical system files because they feel that they "clutter" their system,
 and then complain when the system doesn't work right.<br />

            <p>Sound rather bitter. I am aware that Apple does things their way, but my point is that they would not release an update which blocks users from using their computer. I installed Windows 10 on a computer I had used for the last four years to write letters
 and deal with my banking statements plus lots of Internet browsing. Windows 10, with no choice to me as the user, now does not allow me to save documents on my computer. It does not allow me to receive and save my monthly banking statements. I am the same
 user/operator/administrator as I was before the Windows 10 update but my computer has ceased to be useful for anything but Internet browsing and Microsoft Support has no suggestions as to how I can start to use my computer with their product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Store said to go online. Online said to telephone. I telephoned and no one answered. I came here and you suggest that I am expecting too much from Windows 10. I am just suggesting that if part of the design of Windows 10 is to prevent Microsoft's
 customers from being productive with their PC, they have been successful. Evidently their programs are beyond their abilities too. When Microsoft Support cannot remedy the installation of Microsoft's products all is lost.</p>

            <p>This has been an interesting dialogue. In my particular case, I run into these problems when manually moving or copying files or folders using the File Explorer, whether to another location on the same computer or to a location on another computer on my
 home network. Occasionally, the problem does arise when a program is trying to access a location for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to also point out that I have had this same problem when using Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. As someone mentioned above, I believe it began when the UAC was introduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part, I do not have a problem when the OS asks me if I want to gain permission to use a folder or a file. What aggravates me is when it tells me that I flat out do not have permission and the only option is the contact the "administrator," which
 I am. Although one button says Try Again, nothing changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I manually move files and folders if these operations are apparently not going through the UAC? How do I gain permission from this mysterious "administrator"? And why does it seem that the effective permissions for any object reduce to those of the
 lowest group in the security tab ─ for example, ignoring me as an ADMINISTRATOR, and only granting me the access of a standard USER or EVERYONE? In order to use an object as an ADMINISTRATOR, I have to delete all of the other groups. That seems backwards.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the good info. &nbsp;However, regardless of all the "good" intentions,</p>
<p>Microsoft (and Apple and anyone else who deem it necessary to have</p>
<p>complete control over your PC), need to butt out!! &nbsp;Seriously, &nbsp;I am too old</p>
<p>for this crap, and I have a good security system and so far, for past 8 years</p>
<p>they have protected my PC.....AND, you can chat with them on line and THEY</p>
<p>will fix problems, no charge...so...MS...let me be the decider....If I F it up, then</p>
<p>I will pay the consequences. &nbsp;It is just a home PC for my personal use and I</p>
<p>do not need be blocked from making changes...because MS updates just</p>
<p>made big changes to my PC by updating Windows 10 and removed some</p>
<p>of my previous programs. &nbsp;So WTF? &nbsp;...."you don't have access to this</p>
<p>folder"....come on...and while I'm on this rant...the tech guy I had back in</p>
<p>July suggested going from W7 to W10, blah blah, and instead of having my</p>
<p>usual security system installed, he let Windows Defender....NOT do the job.</p>
<p>A day later it let in that big "you must pay" BS...virus...so, after a great deal</p>
<p>of time and trouble, managed to fix it and install my old security program.</p>
<p>Just sayin'........... &nbsp;maybe have a password or six or seven or whatever it takes</p>
<p>to let one have access to their own files? &nbsp;Okay, most of this day has been</p>

            Hi John.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:   
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>.
<br />
<br />After 10 days you can reinstall the older version using downloads available from Microsoft TechBench here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />If you still have an older version than 1903 then I would manually upgrade to the latest version 1903 by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are intractable, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings.  
<br />
<br />Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

    <title>Keybd has no Break&#47;Pause ... how do I work around&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlipkie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keybd has no Break&#47;Pause ... how do I work around&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Studio xps 16. It is</p>
<p>missing a number of keys found on other Dell keyboards such as Pause, Break, ScrollLock,<br />
<br />
Numlock etc.<br />
<br />
I am doing some software development on it and need to have a CTRL-Break combination to break into running code, e.g. infinite loop in Access 2010 VBA. On my<br />
<br />
Latitude the fn+Pause keys were the Break key so to get ctrl-Break I did CTRL+FN+PAUSE.<br />
<br />
There apparently is a registry entry that can be set to do scancode mappings<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer\HKEY_LOCALMACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout\Scancode Map<br />
<br />
but<br />
<br />
• The Pause/Break key cannot be remapped. This special key generates a 3-byte<br />
scancode, but the Scancode Map registry entry only allows for the remapping of<br />
2-byte scancodes.<br />
<br />
I called Dell Tech Support and they said to buy and attach an external keyboard ( !?!? ).</p>
<p>I'd rather not install a third-party keyboard mapper if at all possible.</p>
<p>Is there a solution?</p>

<p>[quote]Posted on PlayOnline:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>New Option Available for Adding Square Enix Crysta&nbsp;(24/11/2011)</i></p>
<p>You are now able to add any amount of Crysta to your Square Enix account, between a minimum of 500 and a maximum of 10,000 Crysta. This means you no longer need to choose from the incremental amounts – although you may still do so if
 you wish.<br />
<br />
<b>In addition, we are currently working hard to add direct credit card payment to the billing options as promised in our previous announcement, and we expect to have it available for you very soon. We sincerely apologise for the prolonged waiting time, but
 a follow up announcement will be provided as soon as full details (including the implementation date) are confirmed.</b><br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your patience and understanding regarding this matter.[/quote]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is good news, and the general consensus about this (heard through my friend and former linkshell) is that this 'could' be implemented next month with the next update and the final level cap raise (95-99). Let's hope the "Return to
 Vana'diel" feature is still active, as I don't relish the idea of starting again from the beginning...</p>

<p>Yes, solely for SE though. When SE first did this new payment option, Crysta wasn't available in every country as it wasn't legally recognised as viable payment. SE is apparently working on restoring a direct payment method for FFXI.. which is what they've
 been 'working on' since last August, but no information about it or when its being implemented yet.</p>

<p>It was last year SE decided to change FFXI's payment option from Direct Debit to also include Crysta (via Clickandbuy) or timecards (like WoW's). It was changed to coincide with the payment options for FFXIV which uses Crysta and also to purchase items at
 SE's Online Store (Japan only though). However... it was only Japanese gamers who had access to all THREE payment options. The rest of the world HAD to change to either Crysta or Timecards... So, you can imagine the uproar caused by that decision. SE announced
 in October last year, that they were looking into reinstating direct debit payment for the rest of the world... just have to wait now for the to put the plan through.</p>

<p>Well, got some good news... SE finally reinstated the Direct Debit feature for payment for FFXI this month, so we don't have to use Clickandbuy to pay now. You will have to transfer your PlayOnline account over to a Square Enix account on their website,
 and from there can change your account payment option and you'll find Credit/Debit Card payment option.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Finally... after 5 months, I can now go back and finish off those expansions... as well as get my Empyrean Armor.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This was helpful but it all seemed to be just the way it should. Maybe my concern is slightly different. I have had the auto update running for ...well at least as long as I've had this computer. It's always frustrating that it chooses to update or warn
 me about updating during the mid morning when I am doing most of my computer work but I live with it because I can tell it to delay for my chosen time and then it pops up again, usually 4 hrs later and I can keep postponing until I'm ready. This morning however
 the box came up but it wouldn't let me select the delay button, it was grayed out. I was warning me that I had x amount of minutes to save things but it wouldn't let me delay. This happened at 8 or 8:30 am as I sat down to do important computer work, errr.
 I tried everything I could think of but the option to delay stayed grayed out so I quick did what I could and eventually everything shut down and it went through it's updating procedures. I don't like having no say or control over when my computer goes dead!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my settings are like you show here and nothing has changed from last week when it updated what's going on? Any thoughts?</p>

<p><span>this always happens to me with sony vaio</span></p>
<p><span>I had new Sony vaio laptop for about two months when my battery was not responding to my pc anymore.<span>&nbsp;</span>It kept on saying<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">“NO BATTERY IS DETECTED,”</span></strong>
 As soon as you would unplug the laptop from the battery it would shut down.<span>&nbsp;</span>I would have to have the laptop connected at all time with the main cord or the laptop would<span>&nbsp;</span>not work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not only that,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>my computer would randomly turn off on its own, too.<span>&nbsp;</span>So I took my laptop to best buy to get it fixed and they couldn’t fix it at all.<span>&nbsp;</span>They told me it was a hard drive problem and not
 the battery.<span>&nbsp;</span>Instead the store gave me another new vaio laptop. ONCE AGAIN THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING.<span>&nbsp;</span>MY PC IS NOT DETECTING MY BATTERY AND MY LAPTOP CAN NOT BE W/O A CORD.<span>&nbsp;</span>What should I do??? I don’t want to give my
 laptop to best buy again for 3 months and never get it back.<span>&nbsp;</span>Please HELP!!! IS THIS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH SONY VAIO LAPTOPS????</span></p>

    <title>When using touch keyboard to type into Cortana&#39;s search, letters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dkoh  say:</h3>
<h2>            When using touch keyboard to type into Cortana&#39;s search, letters get jumbled and misplaced in the search query.</h2>
                    <p>It's fairly common for my Cortana search typed by touch with the onscreen keyboard to have letters placed at the end of my cursor, as if I placed the letter at the end and used the left arrow key once. The result looks something like this in Cortana:</p>
<p>
</p><p>corana is mixing up my letters t</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was copied directly from the search bar while trying to recreate the issue. It was my third try. The t in Cortana was for some reasoned placed AFTER my typing cursor while I was typing. It happens right when I type it and places itself to the right
 of my cursor, meaning I have to press the right cursor movement button and then backspace, and go back to the word "corana" to insert the t.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only ever happens in touch.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems that that issue is related to Surface touchscreen. Just to clarify, did the issue only persists in Cortana or you’re also experiencing it with other applications?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For now, we suggest that you follow the troubleshooting steps provided on this

<p>The issue is only present with the Cortana search bar, and only with touch. This leads me to believe it's a problem with that search bar specifically. I've never seen it do what it's doing in another text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done all the steps on that page you linked me to and it's still acting up as much as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some more info, I just typed a bunch of things into other apps (including this text box, Edge address bar, and OneNote) and the issue hasn't popped up. It didn't take long for it to pop up in Cortana as usual after testing other apps. This also happens
 across both desktop and tablet mode when using touch. The only two common factors linking the issue are 1) Cortana Search Bar, and 2) Touch keyboard. I really don't think it's a problem with the actual touchscreen or hardware based on how Cortana is the only
 place this happens.</p>

            Never mind. I had something typed in here saying it worked, but it didn't. Still happening. Interestingly enough, I've noticed something else. If I type the same thing, it's always the same letter that appears at the end of the cursor. This time I tried
 "cortana search", and after typing the search box always reads "cortana sarch|e". The line represents where the cursor is. It's always the e in search that gets pushed ahead.

<p>While it can sometimes be a common letter or more often than not happen at the same number of characters being typed like commonly the 5th or 6th character gets moved to the rear, it is not always the case. Generally the bug will persist with the same character
 placement for a long time, but I've noticed that it will change after some unspecific period of time and be a different letter or a different number character that gets moved back. Hopefully Microsoft has an update with this issue as it has stopped me from
 using cortana/edge entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also wanting to add that after recognizing the error you cannot simply delete and retype your entry. The problem will persist indefinitely. You have to finish typing everything and then correct the missing character, then delete the misplaced character.
 otherwise the bug repeats itself.</p>

            It appears that Surface Pro is up-to-date. Just to verify, are you encountering the issue before the update? If not, uninstall the update and see if it helps.
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains, we suggest resetting your Surface Pro. You may follow the steps on the

<p>Hello JG,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. You could try an <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
offline update</a>. If that doesn't work you can get it repaired and set it up on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device support</a>, it will cost between $120-160 USD. You also can invest into a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

            I had the same problem as you, factory reset wouldn't fix it either. I did the offline update and it finally started up right. hope that will work for you too.

<h2>            Why is the accept calls in skype for business not green&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>It may be that I only have this problem, but when someone calls me, I always press the red button.
</p>
<p>I believe I expect a green button to hit when someone calls me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there someone else who has this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's a little odd that Skype does not have a green answer button. </p>
<p>All phones have a green answer button or a red button when you do not want to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you make the reply button in skype green.</p>

<p>Hi Torbein,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you are using the Skype for Business. As far as I know, the button should be blue when you receive a Skype for Business call. The red button is used to decline the Skype for Business call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that your are not in this situation. For this issue, could you please provide a screenshot of it? And please also let us know the detailed version of Skype for Business. We'd like to have a test on our side. If I misunderstand anything, please feel
 free to let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>
