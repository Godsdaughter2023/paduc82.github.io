<h2>            how to get a back-up dvd</h2>
                    I need a back-up dvd, usb install method&nbsp;doesn't work, of the win 10 preview build 10240? there will be no official iso for 10240 or any later build from what I've read. I have it on 3 pcs, 1 laptop, 2 desktops. I may need to do clean installs on all,
 but have nothing to install from.

            Hello. You will have to somehow get it to turn on to do anything on the software side. It may just need a new battery. Did you notice rapid discharge/not holding a charge lately? Otherwise it may be a more serious hardware failure.&nbsp;

    <title>Where Are The Promised Improvements For Touchscreen Users&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> motor_mouth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where Are The Promised Improvements For Touchscreen Users&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When Windows 10 was released a year ago, Microsoft acknowledged that there was still work to be done for touch use and&nbsp;promised that it would focus on making improvements in this area. One year on, and just days from the Anniversary Update, and still we
 have nothing at all that makes Windows 10 any better on a touchscreen than Windows 7 (and, yes, I had a touchscreen PC running W7). OK, you put one gesture from the&nbsp;Metro version of IE&nbsp;into Edge but it is still impossible to touch the new tab button without
 closing the tab next to it, or vice versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tablet Mode is completely useless. In fact, W10 is worse for touch users when Tablet Mode is on than when it is off. e.g. What makes full-screen apps specifically easier/better for tablet users?&nbsp;What it amounts to is a mode that makes it look a bit more
 like Windows 8 but without any of the actual functionality that made Windows 8 so good on tablets. Here is some functionality we had in Windows 8 that I would like to see in Windows 10. If this stuff was implemented, I would upgrade to Windows 10 in a heartbeat&nbsp;but,
 for now, I am sticking with Windows 8 because it is every bit as good for desktop work and better for touch.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>A touch-friendly browser with minimal GUI</strong>. The "Metro" version of IE is, quite simply, the best browser I have ever used, either on a desktop machine or tablet. It is simple, elegant and uncluttered. It puts content first and everything
 else second, as it should. It could do with a few more features but I'd take it as it is in W8 over any other browser.</li><li><strong>Desktop in Split-Screen</strong>. What made split-screen so good in W8 was that I could set up a split with my email down one side of my 21:9 super-wide monitor, my music app down the other side and still have a nice,&nbsp;big desktop in the middle.
 That way I could work all day and my email would never get covered over by other windows. Very handy. But in W10, you can only split the screen between open windows, no desktop,&nbsp;greatly reducing it's usefulness. You also only get it in Tablet Mode, which is
 a waste&nbsp;of time. It is basically a dead feature in W10 and I would like it back how it was in W8.</li><li><strong>Customisation options</strong>. I thought the new dark theme might fix this problem but, sadly, it doesn't extend to Explorer, so I have to contend with one super-white window while I am trying to colour-correct photos and video content in W10.
 Software like Adobe Creative Cloud and Autodesk Maya have a neutral grey interface for a reason and in Windows 8 I could match it through customisation.</li><li><strong>Horizontal scrolling</strong>. This one is really more for desktop use, as laptop screens and desktop monitors are all landscape oriented, which means horizontal scrolling uses available screen real estate far more efficiently. Still, horizontal
 scrolling keeps me on W8.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>That's just&nbsp;four things, two of which aren't really touch-specific but definitely make W8 superior to W10, and&nbsp;none of which will affect how Windows works for anyone else but will make W10 attractive to happy Windows 8 users. Realistically, it is the browser
 that is my main issue, as most of what I use my tablet for is browsing the web and Edge is completely useless for that on an 8" screen, even with 200% scaling. Give me a touch-friendly browser and I'll&nbsp;happily pay for a&nbsp;W10 upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Anomalous result for value 22 in Excel using formula</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now using Excel 2013 and I am current entereing a formula in&nbsp; a workbook that I've kept for a number of years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula works perfectly unless I enter the value 22 (twenty two).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried formula painter but it stll doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a new workbook with the fame formula and the same problem presists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I enter 21.999999 or 20.99999 the formula works but but for the whole number 22.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its an interesting problem ... but very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be grateful for any assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formula below:</p>
<p>=IF(AND(A3="",B3=""),"",IF(A3=22,"",IF(A3="",C2+B3,IF(A3="","",C2-A3+B3))))</p>
<p>

</p><p>Of course I've solved the problem mysel...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula should read </p>
<p>=IF(AND(A3="",B3=""),"",IF(A3=<strong>""</strong>,"",IF(A3="",C2+B3,IF(A3="","",C2-A3+B3))))</p>
<p>rather than</p>
<p>=IF(AND(A3="",B3=""),"",IF(A3=<strong>22</strong>,"",IF(A3="",C2+B3,IF(A3="","",C2-A3+B3))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unforunately, it doesnt work, now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd still be grateful if anyone can corretc the formula - its mean to show a blank in the balance column inless a value is netered in column A or B - I though I'd solved it until I hit upon this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still working on it.</p>

<h2>            Permenant setting of column width in Outlook 2011 Mac</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I switch between monitors frequently and have to reset the column width in outlook several times per day. There seems to be a setting for this in other versions of outlook but not for outlook 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you tell me where this setting is?</p>

<p>Another solution would be to somehow disable "Best Fit" but I can't figure out how to do that either...<br />

            <p>Hey Dan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is not a setting that will permanently set a column width, but once you set it (dragging the column to a point) it should hold. If it is not, you may have a corrupted preference file. You can drag the outlook plist file out to the desktop and restart
 Outlook to test (or create a new Mac user account and test outlook).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at Step 4 in the following article for more info on the preference files:</p>

            I appreciate your response. Unfortunately, your suggestion made no difference.
<br />
<br />
If you, for example, make the from column very small and then switch the application to another monitor with a smaller resolution and then switch it back, Outlook decides that the from field should be larger.
<br />

I know that other versions of outlook have a setting specifically for this but it appears that outlook 2011 does not.<br />

            Are you using Mac OS X's zoom button (green button) to fit the window to your screen? If so, you may want to try adjusting the window manually instead.

            That is an interesting suggestion but does not really address the problem. When I disconnect my laptop from the monitor and go into a meeting I have no control over how the window is re-sized. Then I have to spend time resizing the columns... again...<br />
<br />
Seems that there should be an easier solution to this. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if there is a more appropriate place to submit this type of issue? I'd really like to get a direct answer from MS about whether this is somehow possible or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks for responding -<br />

            After re-reading your example, I see what you're describing. Can I assume you're viewing the Reading Pane below your messages or have it turned off entirely?
<div><br />
<div>Do this:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Set your column widths as you prefer.</li><li>Select <b>View</b> menu --&gt; <i>Arrange By</i> --&gt; <i>Make This the Default View</i>.</li><li>Move your window to the other monitor.</li><li>Use the green zoom button to fill the window if you prefer.</li><li>Select <b>View</b> menu --&gt; <i>Arrange By</i> --&gt; <i>Restore To Defaults</i>.</li></ol>
<div>You can assign a keyboard command to the menu item to make this faster using Apple's keyboard preferences. Unfortunately, I see no way to get rid of the confirmation message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            That is easier than manually resetting them each time. I appreciate the tip.<br />
<br />
It is unfortunate that Outlook 2011 does not have the setting to retain the column widths as other versions of Outlook do.
<br />
<br />
Oh well. Thanks for the tip in any case -<br />

            <p>Sadly, no.&nbsp; I got directed here via searching for Outlook column width problems.&nbsp; I'm using the 2016 beta, latest version, but have had the column width problem with all versions of the beta.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I figured out the "default view" setting, I had not thought about assigning a keyboard shortcut, so that will definitely help deal with this problem.&nbsp; So, thanks, Talking Moose.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The column width on the reader pane changes every time I open outlook.It opens a smaller window than was last open. The columns widths are always wider or narrower than the default, and when I hit the green zoom, it will lengthen one column to be ridiculously
 wide and keep the others so narrow that they are unusable. &nbsp;I have searched multiple forums and no suggestion works. This seems to be a relatively new problem since upgrading to OSX. Appreciate any help.</p>

<h2>            Nokia N79 - Huge problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hey, I have a huge problem with my N79, its only about 3 months above a year old. Its been acting up for the last 24 hours. When the phone's on, and i try using the keypad to either to type out a text or to move around the menu, the phone hangs / keypad
 doesnt work. I dont know whether its the phone hanging or the keypad problem because the screen goes dark, and i cant revive it, but its still on, and i have to restart the phone, but the same thing keeps happening. Any ideas? I tried hard reseting my phone,
 that didnt work either.</p>

Try using the phone without a memory card.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently started seeing this problem too with my N79 - it was working fine for over a year and then suddenly this started happening (I bought mine in May 2009 - so it is almost 1 year and 3 months too - that's eerily similar to you cheseaite)</p>
<p>Basically once you start up the phone and start pressing some buttons, suddenly the keypad stops working, the phone is essentially hung, the only thing that works is the Power On/Off key (and maybe the key lock). Glad to hear that this is not some freak
 problem on my phone alone !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I originally thought that this was a hardware issue because if you keep the phone very steady on a desk and press the buttons gently, then the phone doesn't hang, but now that your symptoms sound very similar to mine, I'm not sure anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this issue known to Nokia ? Any one else out there having the same problem with N79?</p>
        </p>

<p>Searching through the forum i found a huge discussion thread that might indicate the same problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/FF04D0EC-E352-469A-B4D9-748743DB9A5B">/t5/Nseries-and-S60-Smartphones/N79-Intermittent-freezing-problems/td-p/429124/page/6</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically it seems like it is a known hardware issue with Nokia, but they wont fix it unless you're under warranty.<span>

            I have had my share of problems with my N79. The camera used to start on its own. Giving it to nokia care did not solve the problem.<br />
<br />
However, I am still using the phone by keeping the camera slide cover open. Strangely, it seemed to fix all the problems faced by me.

<p>Chanchan05 - I did the *#7370#, the phone reset completely like it should, but it didnt fix my problem, im betting its a problem with the keypad, because it just suddenly happened and didn't happen over a gradual period. I didn't even drop the phone or hit
 it against anything. I also tried using it without a memory card, but the same thing kept happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sfali16 - Im never buying a nokia phone again. The trouble i've had with this one is enough for a lifetime</p>

<p>Yep, I'm having the same problems with my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's for a while already that my phone kept changing the background colours and theme all of it's own despite that function being off (you can have it to automatically change its theme when you slip on another cover - but as I never do I turned that off).</p>
<p>I thought that was weird but didn't pay too much attention to it until last night when the keypad froze. It wouldn't unlock with the quick unlock button on the top of the phone nor would it respond to any other button. So I had no option but to shut it off
 the brutal way by taking out the battery. &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking maybe the problem with my phone is that auto-theme cover thingy so what if I blocked the&nbsp;connection between the back cover and the phone on the lower left by slipping a piece of paper between the contacts.</p>
<p>So far *fingers crossed* it has worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know whether this is a permanent solution and whether it works for you too but maybe give it a try?</p>

            <p>If you want something to update automatically, then you need to paste the formula. I'm not quite clear what value you want to update "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">when the cell I've copied updates.</span>" Maybe you don't want to
 use Paste Special but use a reference to the cell that has the value that updates? If you use a formula in B1 like =A1, then any time that you update A1, the value of A1 will also show in B1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paste Formulas is one of the options of Paste Special in desktop Excel. In Excel for iPad there is no "Paste Special" command as such. You can access the Paste Special options to paste values or formulas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you could describe an example in context.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bing Rewards banned accounts</h2>
                    <p>I am sick of this. We don't cheat, we don't use a bot, we don't use vpn, we verified our phone number, we put in our real names and address. Several family members had their rewards declined and then had their accounts banned this week. You refuse to even
 give a reason just a canned answer. We share laptops and tablets and Edge has been caching the data of whomever used it last. I even wrote Bing about this - and in return, what do you do? You ban us. Nice going. Interesting, you didn't ban my wife's account,
 and yet she accesses from the same IP. So if we were doing something wrong, why did you leave her account? This is BS, and you know it. You don't even have the decency to explain what we did - you know why because we didn't do anything - you just have some
 random bot that decides xyz behavior means the person is cheating. I'm an artist, I really liked using Bing for image searches, I often gave feedback. You know what? Forget it, I'll use the Google Art app instead. The canned answers in broken English are the
 worst. So, you ban us using crppy automation software, and then you offshored an American's job and send me an email in stilted English. Nice Going. Double insult.</p>

            It's tiring... they were a tad snarky wanting to know why everyone in my house had the same phone number.. um... it's our landline, sigh. So they unbanned me and the kids.. and then banned my wife (after declining her reward), who is not about to waste
 her time going back and forth with Bing support. She will just use Google.

<h2>            Outlook 2007 email with large attachment hangs when closing, displays &#34;Attachment Size Exceeds the Allowable Limit&#34;</h2>
                    Outlook 2007 running on Win 7 and connected to Exchange 2010.&nbsp; User opens an email containing a large attachment (several MB's, pdf's, tif's, etc.), attachments can be opened and closed, but when user attempts to close the email message window, a pop-up
 appears "Attachment Size Exceeds&nbsp;the Allowable Limit", I click OK on the pop-up and it goes away, but then the email message&nbsp;window locks up.&nbsp; The toolbar in the message window remains visible, but the rest of the window where the email was diplayed becomes
 transparent, I can still grab the&nbsp;window and move it around, but get the same pop-up when attempting to close.&nbsp; User can continue using Outlook, but have to kill process to get the window to go away and to shutdown Outlook.&nbsp; Disabled a pdfmaker plug-in, ran
 a repair on Outlook, but problem persists.

            <p>The problem is not with the message cache - it's a new feature in outlook that reduces network traffic by telling the user the message is too large to send instead of letting the SMTP bounce it back.
</p>
<p>The user should never get it on replies as the attachment is not included. </p>
<p>If the problem is caused by too-large files that will be compressed on send, you can add a registry value to fake outlook into thinking the server allows a higher limit - see

    <title>Worksheet_Change Event VBA Speed Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> va-mickj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Worksheet_Change Event VBA Speed Issue</h2>
                    I have a problem.&nbsp; I have VBA code that runs slowly when triggered by a worksheet change event.&nbsp; But runs perfectly fine &amp; fast when run from the click of a button on that same&nbsp;sheet.&nbsp; Granted the code is complex there there's a custom dialog box, a bunch
 of loops, changing values across many sheets, copying &amp; pasting... I mean a lot happens.&nbsp; The only difference is how the code is called.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When it's started from a excel form button with the macro 'AfterNewDataSet' assigned, it takes 2 secs.<br />
<br />
However, when started from inside the Worksheet_Change event, it takes 40secs.<br />
<br />
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Target.Address = Range("Source").Address Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call AfterNewDataSet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
ScreenUpdating, Calculation, EnableEvents are turned off at the beginning of AfterNewDataSet.&nbsp; I've even tried to use .OnTime from inside the Worksheet_Change event to trigger AfterNewDataSet to run after the Worksheet_Change event is over.
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are helpful.&nbsp;

            Code runs just as slow inside of that event. Or even inside the Workbook_SheetChange event.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;no problems with the macro&nbsp;running in any case.&nbsp; It just goes very slow when triggered from inside of the worksheet (or workbook) events.&nbsp;

            <p>It's pretty hard to hit a target blindfolded but I would suggest getting rid of any subjective references to&nbsp;<em>Selection , ActiveSheet</em> etc in the code for&nbsp;<span><em>AfterNewDataSet</em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>.
 If need be, you could pass a handle to the worksheet along as a&nbsp;</span>parameter<span>&nbsp;when it is called from the&nbsp;</span></span></span><em>Worksheet_Change</em> event macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option would be to move the event, calculation and screen updating commands to the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Worksheet_Change</em> event macro. You do not have to remove them from&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>AfterNewDataSet</em>;
 just duplicate them so they are still there for the button press.</span></p>
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; If Target.Address = Range("Source").Address Then<br />

            <p><span>I've come to find out that it's not the so much the VBA code that is running&nbsp;as it is something about the rest of the model calculation.&nbsp; I've attached an
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzhuDM0tHnjyU0p5TTlSVTFlRHM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
example file</a> that runs perfectly fine when by itself in either mode -- from the button or the worksheet event.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
But if I run this same&nbsp;macro&nbsp;with my Excel model also open:&nbsp; 1) when I click the button, it takes longer than it did when the file was the only one open.&nbsp; 2) when I change the cell, the macro takes almost 10 times longer than the button. In this example the
 macro, never touches the original model --&nbsp;it just takes longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I turn calculation to manual&nbsp;instead, there isn't a discernible difference when run from the button (as compared to when the file is open by itself), but still the 10x&nbsp;greater time when&nbsp;run
 from the _change event exists.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I can't really distribute the model.&nbsp; But the bottom line is I am happy with the speed of operation when I click the button.&nbsp; I just don't know why it's so slow when it runs inside the _change event.&nbsp; That's where I need the ideas.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks, Jan.&nbsp; But no, the&nbsp;Change event is called just once, regardless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would, can you look at this file I've loaded to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzhuDM0tHnjyU0p5TTlSVTFlRHM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Google docs</a>, which represents what I experience. It is a self contained file &amp; when I run it by itself, i.e. with no other files open, everything is fine.&nbsp; However, when I run it with my model open, I notice the slow down in run speeds, between the button
 or change event.&nbsp; &amp; in this case, when this macro runs, it never even touches my model file, but somewhere, somehow, the non-touched model thinks it needs to calculate more times.&nbsp; But it doesn't do those "extra" iterations when triggered from a button instead
 of the change event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">actually</span> different between&nbsp;the&nbsp;EXACT same code&nbsp;being triggered from these &nbsp;different&nbsp;"locations"?&nbsp; That's my question to everyone.&nbsp; Any ideas are greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

            <p>There are a few volatile functions in place -- a few offsets, &amp; indirects that I can't really get rid of.&nbsp;I did kill any dynamic range naming (using offset functions), &amp; instead trigger code to make the names static.&nbsp; That helped the speed calculation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked diligently to make the spreadsheet more calculation efficient &amp; added options to do some things instead of always doing them from the macro.&nbsp; Still it's ~longer, but now it's the comparison between &lt;4 sec and &lt;15secs -- which is more bearable than
 10 secs to 50 secs.&nbsp;&nbsp;But yes in the end I have to live with that difference in speed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the ideas &amp; help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Syncing Outlook and files with PC</h2>
                    <p>Having decided to give Windows 10 Mobile a shot I was about to get a Lumia 950.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>Am I correct in thinking there is no Bluetooth or WiFi app that syncs the Lumia to a PC?</p>
<p>Please tell me I have overlooked it somewhere!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having googled around I do not see equivalent apps like "My Phone Explorer" and unfortunately once you have used this obviously correct and proper way to sync mobile devices to your PC it is an absolute non-starter to start messing about with obsolete pre
 2005 tech</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I was leaving Android... Perhaps Not</p>

    <title>Excel VBA to activate and save an open workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott a.w.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel VBA to activate and save an open workbook</h2>
                    <p>First, any help is welcomed as I am not very savvy with VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a workbook that I put through several steps to clean up data and move data to various tabs.&nbsp; Once done, I save the XLSM file to a different name with a date in the name (i.e., "FILE DD MMM YY OLD.XLSM").&nbsp; Following this, I need to copy one worksheet
 ("FINAL_DATA") to a separate workbook and save the workbook without any other worksheets (so the only worksheet is "FINAL_DATA").&nbsp; When the workbook is saved, the name&nbsp;will be "FILE DD MMM YY FINAL.XLSX".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully coded a WS copy (to a new WB), then delete the blank "Sheet1".&nbsp; Once here though, I can't seem to get the code to let me add the dates (I have it defaulted to "FILE DD MMM YY FINAL.XLSX" so I can just complete the date), hit save, and
 then close the file (using VBA) so that my original file (*OLD.XLSM) keeps the "FINAL_DATA" tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I could show the code, I've tried numerous things without complete success and think it would hurt your eyes to look at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the pre-filled file name because the only difference is the date, since the file is run daily.&nbsp; The other challenge for me is to close the file using a wildcard (i.e., "*FINAL.xlsx").</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is not too confusing.&nbsp; Again, I gladly welcome the help.</p>

</p><p>You don't need to create a new workbook and then delete the default sheet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>worksheets("Final_Data").copy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copies worksheet Final_Data to a new workbook as the only sheet in that workbook.&nbsp; This new workbook is now the activeworkbook.&nbsp; &nbsp; Then you could do
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs "C:\myfolder\FILE " &amp; format(date, "DD MMM YY") &amp; " FINAL.XLSX"</p>
<p>ActiveWorkbook.Close SavedChanges:=False</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can't have two workbooks in excel with the same name - so It isn't clear to me if that will be a problem in the scenario you describe.&nbsp;

                    <p>Hi guys! I am a newbie here and I just wanna ask if the algorithm being used by Bing search engine is absolutely different to those of Google. My concern is that, my website&nbsp;&lt;Removed&gt; is ranking higher in SERPs of Google, while in Bing or Yahoo it is not.
 The fact that I already submitted sitemaps to Bing/Yahoo. I am doing anything wrong here? Hope you can give a piece of advice, many many thanks in advance. More power and God bless!</p>

            <p>Hi zirrom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best you can do is make sure your sitemap is clickable from your homepage and also double check if your XML sitemap is in place (alongside with the robots.txt file).<br />
</p>
<p>Each search engine has its own algorithm, but they do have many in common. Usually when a new algorithm is in place, by applying the tweaks considered good practices (and avoiding the wrong ones), that enhances your rankings in most search engines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to have a look at this article that I wrote myself, where the main Google algorithm changes are explained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://debunc.com/blog/2016/06/6-important-changes-to-googles-algorithm-you-cant-ignore/</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggestion is to follow the good practices explained in the article and your rankings in major search engines are likely to be revamped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll appreciate your feedback once you do that.</p>

<p>Hi, my mum is having the same issue <strong>&nbsp;:-( 'Something went wrong - Sorry, we can't get to that information right now</strong>) and hasn't been able to send or reply to emails for the last 2 weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue does not happen when she signs on to Hotmail from my PC and all her other applications appear to be working fine.&nbsp; Mum hasn't a clue so I'd really appreciate some assistance to get this sorted for her??</p>

    <title>OneNote &#34;Find&#34; option stopped working with PPT printed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylor jv  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote &#34;Find&#34; option stopped working with PPT printed</h2>
                    <p>I have been using OneNote for years in undergrad and medical school. I do the same thing every time, Print to OneNote (not 2016, the new one now). Once in OneNote, it was always able to search the printed slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW, as of the last 2 weeks or so, the "Ctrl+F" function doesn't work on my OneNote application with printed powerpoints. They are no longer searchable. I cannot search through my 20 lectures anymore simply by finding a word, I actually have to do it the
 old way (OMG, who wants to read anyway).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to an issue with MS licensing having two different accounts on the same apps (One school, one personal) there were competing licenses on my computer forcing me to uninstall and then re-install all of Office. I'm not sure if this had anything to do with
 it?? it fits the timeline, but not the problem - to my understanding, anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began taking scribbled notes directly on my PPT presentations (Surface Pro) and then printing them over to OneNote. That is when I first noticed the inability to search. I just thought it was because of the scribblings so I went back to my original habit
 of writing in OneNote. Now it won't work for any of the new PPTs, but it still works for the old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Bottom Line:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I need to have powerpoints easily printed directly into OneNote and then searchable once there. This was the norm for my setup until a little while ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been on with MS Support and they hopped on my screen and looked through settings etc.&nbsp; Nothing weird was found, and no fixes as of today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!!!</p>

            Hi Taylor,<br />
<br />
We've tried to replicate your concern here on our end to check if there's any going issue with OneNote and it seems to work okay when we use the Control + F function. To isolate your concern, kindly answer the questions below:<br />
<br />
• Which Office version are you using for your OneNote?<br />
• Does the issue occur with a specific printed PPT only or with all the printed PPT that you have?&nbsp;<br />
• Do you have the latest Office updates installed on your PC?<br />
<br />
For the meantime, you may try&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repairing your Office</a>&nbsp;</strong>and check if it makes any difference.<br />
<br />
If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you with more answers.

<p><span>Q: Which Office version are you using for your OneNote?</span></p>
<p>A: OneNote Version 16001.10827.20178.0<br />
<span>Q: Does the issue occur with a specific printed PPT only or with all the printed PPT that you have?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A: all of my powerpoints since around October 12th. various authors - professors at m</span><span>y school.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Q: Do you have the latest Office updates installed on your PC?</span></p>
<p><span>A: Yes, I double checked and I have everything up to date prior to this discussion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I proceded with the repair, and checked again for updates. The problem is still occurring with the powerpoints printed to OneNote for the last few weeks (approximately 10/12/18)</span></p>

            Since the issue still persists after performing Office Repair, may we ask if you already proceed with easy fix tool to completely uninstall your Office application? If you haven't tried yet, try to do so and check if it makes any difference.<br />

<p>Jenicel, thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just completed the uninstall and re-install of office as you suggested. OneNote was not automatically removed as were the other office apps, so I manually uninstalled that as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reinstalling all of MS Office and OneNote desktop app, I opened up the application and tried to use the "find" option again. The notes created AFTER October 12th are
<strong>still </strong>not searchable - this is the original problem. Any files put into my OneNote application
<strong>before </strong>that time are still searchable and all functions are the same. This applies to multiple&nbsp;notebooks and sections, not just one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I printed a new powerpoint to the same notebook and tried to search it, but it did not work either. I can only search text that has been typed into the notebook by me (as would be expected); However, text within a PDF or Powerpoint that has been printed/inserted
 as a file to OneNote still cannot be searched. Again, this only started around October 12th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Can you send us a sample of a PowerPoint printed file before and after October 12 so that we can check if it has something to do with the file itself?<br />

We'll be waiting for your response.

<p>I went through another resource to try to figure out the problem. We found out the "indexing" has been turned off or removed - something making ithe search function not work - for OneNote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to rebuild indexing, but it took nearly an hour and i haven't checked my computer yet. Maybe that will be the fix?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I rebuilt my indexing on my computer. I read through a few other posts and discussions regarding similar issues to ensure I included all of the generic Office and also specific OneNote applications. Nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I print Powerpoints and PDFs that were put on OneNote prior to the search function problem, they now have a search issue, while the exact same files printed before ~October 12th have full search functions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Janicel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The powerpoint file doesn't matter at this point. The time it was printed to OneNote is the issue here. I have taken a PPT used prior to the OneNote search option going bad, and printed the same exact unchanged file to OneNote since the problem started and
 it still won't search. Even though the same file can be searched prior to October 12th.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I turn OFF &#40;or maybe even edit&#41; read receipts in MS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> monomeeth  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn OFF &#40;or maybe even edit&#41; read receipts in MS Outlook for Mac&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Yes, that's right, I want to turn this OFF or edit it so that read receipts go to the correct email address.&nbsp;I know what you're thinking, that you can't even use read receipts in MS Outlook for Mac.
 But I have been, although by accident. This is what happened in my case:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Years ago when I had MS Entourage I set it up to ask for a read receipt when I sent emails. I did this by doing the following steps:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. In Entourage I selected "Tools." and then "Accounts."</p>
<p>2. I selected the "Mail" tab and selected the account I wanted to use read receipts with by double-clicking on the account name.</p>
<p>3. I then selected the "Options" tab.</p>
<p>4. And, in&nbsp;the box labeled "Header," I entered "Disposition-Notification-To" and typed my email address into the "Value" box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. After clicking "OK", Entourage was set up to request read receipts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I purchased Office 2011 for Mac, and imported my Entourage accounts etc into Outlook, it also copied this setting for me. This was fine - it just kept requesting read-receipts and that&nbsp;was good.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>HOWEVER, the email account I was using is now no longer active and what I'm finding is that whenever I send an email, that the recipients whose computers are actually trying to send a read receipt,
 are returning them an error message because the email it's trying to send the read receipt to an email address that can't be resolved.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, how do I now change this in MS Outlook? I need to either remove the&nbsp;"Disposition-Notification-To" setting, or change it so that it goes to my current email address.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for any help. It will be very much appreciated!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Joe.</p>

            <p>Oh I see, well that's a really different case then.<br />I know Outlook can import that setting from Entourage and getting rid of it is ridiculously tedious.</p><p>I don't believe there is any UI for editing that field anymore.<br />I'm not sure exactly where the setting is saved, but I fear they are in the Identity itself.<br />One option would be to delete, then recreate the account.</p><p>You could also try to see whether the Entourage Read Receipt AppleScript that could be used to play around with these settings in Entourage still works with Outlook (or maybe it could easily be adapted for Outlook).<br />You can still find the scripts here:<br /><a href="http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/25148/entourage-read-receipt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/25148/entourage-read-receipt</a><br />The download link still works though the developer page is 404.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corentin</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Philip. I updated Excel to 15.17 as you suggested, but after doing so I continued to observe the same problems I described in my original post. As an experiment, I went into Word and removed a custom dictionary I had installed a month
 or two ago. Immediately after doing that I found that the spell-checking function in Excel was fully restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity I opened the custom dictionary file I had removed, to have a look at it. The contents looked OK but I did notice that for some reason it had opened in Script Editor. That didn't seem right, so I decided to re-create the custom dictionary.
 I followed Microsoft's instructions in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-a-custom-dictionary-in-Office-for-Mac-22ce4a39-c63b-41a3-903c-a6881c891ba7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use a custom dictionary in Office for Mac</a>&nbsp;to create a new custom dictionary, then transferred the contents of my old custom dictionary into the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That did the trick. I now have full spell-checking capability in Excel, and my custom dictionary is working as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have marked your response as helpful because it gave me the incentive to try some things instead of just getting frustrated.</p>
<p>

</p><blockquote>&nbsp;I assume the hard reset doesn't clear the SD card?&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>That is correct</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it were mine, if you have programs installed on the SD card I would uninstall them first just to get them off the SD card. You can leave Music and Movies on the card.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We are using Microsoft Office Professional Plus&nbsp;2010 on our organizations workstations but need&nbsp;Microsoft Access 97 to access some older access files/apps. Do we need a license to install and use Microsoft Access 97 if we have a licensed Office Professional
