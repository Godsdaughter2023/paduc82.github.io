<h2>            PowerPoint 2016 printing and pdf problem</h2>
                    <p>I installed OSX Yosemite and Office 2016. If I want to print out of PowerPoint there is a problem with the text output. The spaces between the letters are uneven. On the screen everything is normal, but on the paper and in the pdf-file the text looks awful.</p>
<p>The problem only appears in PowerPoint, not in Word or Excel. I've updated the printer drivers, didn't help. What else can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer!</p>
<p>Mathias</p>

<p>The only way I know is to:</p>
<p>Turn off your phone, then press both soft keys next to D-Pad and power on device. After moment release both soft keys. On the black screen asking for confirmation press "green phone" button and wait couple minutes for phone to initialize

<p>If that does not work then you may have to send it in for repair Gabiko!</p>

<h2>            Unable to add students as a co-owner</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reached out to troubleshoot this issue last year in October 2017. the initial advice i was given to access the Office 365 portal to add in students as a notebook co-owner worked, however, I am now having issues with this route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now only add students to a single one of my co-owned notebooks - is there a work around this. all of these notebooks are less than a year old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Meltrain,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, my understanding is that you cannot add students to your con-owned notebooks(it only works for a co-owned notebook).
</p>
<p>If there is something I misunderstood, please feel free to clarify it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, we'd like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1.For the affected co-owned notebooks, are the other teachers able to add students in the notebooks?</p>
<p>2.When you sign in Office 365 portal&gt;click
<p>Could you provide more detailed information about how you cannot add students to the notebooks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Hi Meltrain,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact a few owners(2 or 3 owners, for testing) of the notebooks, let them add your account to the co-owned notebooks again. Then check if you can find the con-owned notebooks on your side.
 If it works, then you can let the other owners try the same method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we'd like to confirm the following information for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.You mentioned only one or two of the co-owned notebooks show up on your side, we'd like to confirm can you add or remove students for these co-owned notebooks?</p>
<p><span>2.</span><span>If the other teachers create new notebooks and add you as a co-owner, can you add or remove students in the new notebook?</span></p>

<p>Hi Meltrain,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further troubleshooting, we'd like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.You mentioned that you can only add students to a single one of the co-owned notebooks. And only one or two co-owned notebooks show up.</p>
<p>We'd like to confirm that if the number of con-owned notebooks is the same when you check the following 4 locations:</p>
<p>1)<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Go to Office 365 portal</a>&gt;Class Notebook&gt;Add or remove students</p>
<p>2)<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Go to Office 365 portal</a>&gt;Class Notebook&gt;Add or remove teachers</p>
<p>3)<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Go to Office 365 portal</a>&gt;Class Notebook&gt;Manage notebooks</p>
<p>4)<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Go to Office 365 portal</a>&gt;OneDrive&gt;Shared&gt;Shared with me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.If the number of the co-owned notebooks is different, we suggest you check if you can find the co-owned notebook you want and check if you can add or remove students for the notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the number of the co-owned notebooks is the same when you check the 4 locations, we suggest you contact the other co-owners of the affected class notebooks and check the situation on their side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.If all of the co-owners of the affected notebooks have the same issue, we suggest you contact the original owner who created the class notebooks and confirm how did he add you as con-owner.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
go to Office 365 portal</a>&gt;Class Notebook&gt;Create a class notebook&gt;type the name of the class notebook&gt;<strong>Give another teacher permission to use this class notebook</strong>?</p>
<p>Or via sharing the class notebooks with you directly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Does the issue happen to some specific co-owned class notebooks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina </p>

                    I am in the process of creating a word document and have just added a diagram comprising several shapes. But I now find that, when I try to start typing below the&nbsp;diagram to continue the document, the cursor appears&nbsp;<strong>above</strong> the diagram.
 How can I get the cursor to appear below the diagram so that I can continue with the document?

<h2>            Calls are cut off</h2>
                    After last update I cannot call to international land line as the phone call cuts itself after a minute or 2. I have tried to call from Mac computer, from iPhone, from iPad and its the same story so there is clearly something wrong with the software. Any
 ideas how to make the Skype work properly again?

            Hi Kenney, <br />
<br />
You won't need a product key, you need to deactivate your previous Installation and then re-install Office 2016.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On the new computer, go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted
<br />
<br />
Select Install <br />
<br />
Under Install information, locate the old laptop which Office was installed on <br />
<br />
Select Deactivate Install to deactivate the Office installation <br />
<br />
Then, click Install to install Office <br />
<br />

This page shows how to install Office AFTER the license has been activated. It also shows a few other things you can do in the MyAccount site.

            <p><span>Hi Vedpushpak,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Newsfeed means the service after clicking Newsfeed tile in the app launcher, I’d like to explain that normally it is used for conversations in a site. To learn more, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-the-SharePoint-Newsfeed-d1a6a747-5789-498f-9db5-c5692a9c9559?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use the SharePoint Newsfeed</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my test, there is no out of box solutions to display content from other sites in SharePoint Online. Moreover, it’s not feasible to display content across different site collections via out of box solutions. We may need to use
 some custom web part. This is related to SharePoint customization and development. If you are interested in it, you may post a new thread in our<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=sharepoint%2Cwindowsazureplatform&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 SharePoint MSDN forum</a> for further discussion. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>

    <title>Multiple Email Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rxdave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Email Problems</h2>
                    <p>Regarding Hotmail, Live Mail, Outlook Mail or whatever you are calling it this week, my problems are so numerous, I don't know where to begin. &nbsp;I'll just lay this all out and see what happens. &nbsp;I have had a Hotmail email account for about 10 years, and until
 now, I have been very pleased with it. &nbsp;I added two additional addresses for my websites.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In part, this began when I changed my 8.1 desktop to Windows 10. &nbsp;I cannot use the word "upgrade" because nothing has been better since I did it. &nbsp;The W10 email app is excrutiatingly inadequate and incomplete and it's been like this for seven months now.
 &nbsp;Basic things like processing junk mail or finding the header information can't be done. &nbsp;As far as I can tell, not a single enhancement or change to the mail app has been implemented since it was released.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Problem 1: &nbsp;The Windows 10 mail app is incomplete and inadequate with apparently no hope of enhancement.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It didn't matter because I am also a long-time user of Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;I loved this program. &nbsp;It did everything I needed and did it well. &nbsp;All three of my email accounts were easily managed in WLMail. &nbsp;Then I got a notice that in order to continue using
 it, I had to install an update. &nbsp;This update, in fact, disabled it completely in Windows 10 and it damaged it in Windows 7. &nbsp;In Windows 10, it just crashes now when I try to open it. &nbsp;In Windows 7, every email I get is marked "unknown sender." &nbsp;It doesn't
 matter how many time I have previously marked "allow sender," "not junk," "allow address," or "allow address domain," the next email will always be marked "unknown sender." &nbsp;This is not protection, this is a nuisance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Since the update, the header information for emails has become severely abbreviated. &nbsp;It is my custom to forward malicious spam to the FTC. &nbsp;They want the header info, but now I don't know if what I am sending them is adequate.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Problem 2: &nbsp;Windows Live Mail is disabled/crashes in Windows 10.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Problem 3: &nbsp;Windows Live Mail is damaged in Windows 7.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I thought perhaps I needed to reinstall Windows Live Mail on the Windows 10 machine. &nbsp;I went to the Control Panel to uninstall it first. &nbsp;However, the program is not included in the uninstall list in the Control Panel by any name, Windows Live Mail, Windows
 Essentials, or anything else. &nbsp;It does appear in the Windows 7 Control panel. &nbsp;If I right-click it in the Start Menu, then click Uninstall, that just sends me to the Control Panel. &nbsp;An internet search reveals that the solution is fussing with registry keys
 to uninstall it. &nbsp;Do you really want us doing that? &nbsp;I am sorry, but that is just a typical example of the Windows 10 nonsense I have been dealing with since installing it. &nbsp;This is not acceptable. &nbsp;Now I have non-functional software that cannot be uninstalled.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Problem 4: &nbsp;Windows Live Mail cannot be easily and safely uninstalled from Windows 10.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I took a look at Outlook.com as an option for managing my three email accounts. &nbsp;For some reason, you don't allow adding addresses to both send and receive. &nbsp;The mickey-mouse option of forwarding emails to another address is not workable. &nbsp;If any email is ever
 marked as junk, it will never be forwarded, even if later marked "not spam." &nbsp;The alternative is signing in and out of multiple email accounts, but that's much too unwieldly. &nbsp;I understand Gmail can manage multiple accounts, why can't Outlook.com do it? &nbsp;The
 last thing I want to do is put all my emails into Google's clutches.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A year ago I bought an iPad. &nbsp;I loaded my three email accounts into the native mail app and it works beautifully. &nbsp;It even syncs all my contacts. &nbsp;Why can't Microsoft do this?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Problem 5: &nbsp;Outlook.com cannot accommodate multiple email accounts in a useful way.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I use a form manager, Jotform, to create contact forms for my websites. &nbsp;Previously, this worked perfectly. &nbsp;Lately, every email sent using these forms is marked as junk mail. &nbsp;As a result, I have missed important contacts. &nbsp;No matter what spam settings I try,
 every one of these emails goes to junk mail. &nbsp;Apparently it's the "SmartScan" filter or something that's doing this. &nbsp;Again, this is not protection, this is a nuisance and a costly nuisance at that. &nbsp;Searching the net for a solution only produces fixes for
 Internet Explorer which I don't even use, so please don't go there.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Problem 6: &nbsp;The Microsoft email spam filter produces false positives that I cannot correct.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Because of all the buzz, I took a look at Thunderbird as an alternative to Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;It manages multiple accounts well, but it does not sync contacts. &nbsp;I tried to export my contacts in a .csv file, but that didn't work at all. &nbsp;Apparently it is necessary
 to throw caution to the wind and put yourself in the hands of third party add-ins that may or may not work. &nbsp;More mickey-mouse.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Problem 7: &nbsp;Can you recommend an email client that will manage multiple accounts and include contacts?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Does anyone remember Windows Live Spaces, Windows Live Sync, Windows Live Mesh or Office Live Small Business? &nbsp;Microsoft has a pattern of releasing products that people like and use. &nbsp;But when Microsoft gets tired of them, they just toss them aside with a flippant
 "no longer supported." &nbsp;In the case of Office Live Small Business, I was involved with the beta testing. &nbsp;We worked very hard for a year finding problems and suggesting enhancements. &nbsp;When it was released, nothing was changed but the user interface. &nbsp;All the
 flaws and problems were still there. &nbsp;Kind of like the last seven months of Windows 10. &nbsp;In the end, OLSB was just tossed aside to be replaced with a different, more expensive product. The free domain name promised for life was also taken away.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You have loyal customers, but if you keep pulling the rug out, that loyalty will wear thin. &nbsp;Personally, I may never buy another Windows computer. &nbsp;I am seriously considering a move to the Apple ecosystem.</p>

            <p>There is no update patch at the link you sent. &nbsp;There is no link "download the package now." &nbsp;There is only a web page describing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as of February 2, Windows Live Mail is not sending or receiving any mail. &nbsp;I am getting server error 4102, WLM error 0x8DE00001. &nbsp;Outlook.com and the iPad are working normally which is now the only way I can send and receive email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems and screw-ups just keep rolling alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Windows 10 feedback, I have sent multiple feedbacks already. &nbsp;There are hundreds, perhaps thousands more from other people. &nbsp;There is no evidence anyone at Microsoft ever looks at these. &nbsp;By evidence I mean fixes to the problems described. &nbsp;Nobody
 is addressing any of the issues posted at Windows 10 feedback. &nbsp;If that were the case, I would not have to come here with these problems. &nbsp;As I said, there have been no perceptible changes to the W10 mail app in seven months.</p>

    <title>Home Screen Date revisited - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rondr---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Home Screen Date revisited</h2>
                    
<p>After switching to "Normal" mode to get the date to display on the title bar of the home screen I find it will not update automatically at midnight. &nbsp;It will only update if the phone is restarted or switched to another mode and back to the normal mode again.
 &nbsp;Maybe its just me but isn't this phone considered a business phone? &nbsp;Is a proper date display regardless of the mode the phone is set to part of daily business. &nbsp;If I'm missing the "update date at midnight" option somewhere could someone here let me know
 how to find it in the settings menu?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The setting can be found at: Application =&gt; Clock =&gt; Option =&gt; Setting (considering the Clock is in default position and has not been moved to another folder). Or from Control Panel =&gt; Setting =&gt; General =&gt; Date and time.&nbsp; At the bottom you can set Automatic
 time update to on/off.&nbsp; This will auto update your phone time and date to GSM Provider time and date and able to auto update the seasonal time change.</p>

<p>I never has that problem.&nbsp; I think hard reset to factory default is the alternate option to fix the problem.</p>

<h2>            vlookup with two columns</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have one spreadsheet that list employee data. &nbsp;Last name is in column a and first name is in column b. &nbsp;I have another spreadsheet that has departments for each employee. &nbsp; Ideally I would like to do the vlookup with the employee id numbers but I believe
 that there is a formatting issue that is preventing the correct information from coming over into the first tab of the worksheet. &nbsp;I.e. &nbsp;One employee has an employee id number of 61 and there is another employee with an ID of 10061. &nbsp;They are two different
 employees.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to have the vlookup look at columns a &amp; b in the second tab of the worksheet to return the answer? &nbsp;I have several employees that have the same last name.</div>
                </div>

            <p>You should use the employee id # to look them up. They MUST be sorted lowest to highest for the vlookup to work.&nbsp; Excel should be able to see the difference beween 61 and 10061.&nbsp; You may also need to format the column as a number not text.</p>
<p>For vlookup to work with two columns it gets complicated. </p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/74430368-78cb-4b9b-9f3e-69cace45f0ac" title="HENRY WALL">

</p><div>
<p>There are a number of possible explanations for why security codes don't always arrive. Read through the list of the most common causes, and see if any of them apply to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does your phone block calls or texts from unknown numbers?<br />
</strong><br />
If so, change your phone settings then choose <strong>I don't have a code</strong>. We'll send another security code.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Did your email send your security code to your junk folder?<br />
</strong><br />
Check your junk folder for a message from Microsoft account, and use the code you find there. To prevent this from happening in the future, mark Microsoft as a trusted sender. Valid security codes come from an @accountprotection.microsoft.com email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is your phone number or email address entered correctly?<br />
</strong><br />
To&nbsp;keep your information safe when you're signing in, we only show you the last two digits of your phone number or the first two characters of your email address.<br />
</p>
<p>To see if your security info is correct:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to your&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Security basics</strong></a> page with your Microsoft account,</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Update info</strong>.</li><li>You may need to enter a security code to get to this page. Choose a method that you know works, or choose
<strong>I don't have any of these</strong> to replace your security info.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<strong>Does your alternate email address end in @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com, or @msn.com?</strong><br />
<p><br />
If so, you're using one Microsoft account to verify another Microsoft account. This can make it tricky to keep track of which one you're signed in to. When you sign in to the second account (to get the code sent to that email), most browsers automatically sign
 you out of the first account (the one that's actually requesting the code).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
To get your security code:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a browser in privacy mode, sign in with the first account. This lets you stay signed in to both accounts at the same time.</li><li>When you're prompted to enter the security code that was sent to your alternate email address, don't close the browser window.</li><li>Open a new window in privacy mode. <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>Shift</strong> +
<strong>P</strong> is the shortcut for InPrivate&nbsp;Browsing in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. If you're using a different browser, check that browser's help for info about privacy mode.</li><li>In the new window, sign in to your alternate email account and look for the message from the Microsoft account team. Copy or write down the security code&nbsp;from the message.</li><li>Return to the window that is asking you for the security code. Enter the code and follow the instructions.</li></ol>

<p>I cannot sign to my microsoft account on my Lumia 435 Dual Sim. When I try sign or create new one it shows:

 useless for me. Even if i switch to manually the problem is still there. Please, can anyone help me with this?

    <title>Microsoft Office for Mac and Issues with SharePoint Compatability - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Office for Mac and Issues with SharePoint Compatability</h2>
                    <p>Good Afternoon,</p>
<p>I work on a proposal team where some of our users work from a Mac whereas others use a standard PC. During the authoring and review of proposals, our team has noticed issues when using co-authoring in a Word document. We have anywhere between 4-6 authors/reviewers
 in a document at one time. It has become an issue where Word will not save changes from some of our users, even when editing live in the document. Or, the save will have been completed but upon re-opening the document, the changes are not present. Our sections
 of the document will appear locked by a user even if they have already saved their changes and are no longer in the document. Or, a Word document may appear as read only for some authors/reviewers and editable for others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is believed that the issue may stem from compatibility problems between Microsoft Office for Mac versus Office for PC. Has anyone else experienced these problems? If so, was there a resolution to the issue? We also considered that it may be an issue with
 our template possibly being corrupted or that one of our authors was importing material from a source document that may been corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you can provide!</p>

            <p>It is most likely problems with Office for Mac when used with Sharepoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office for Mac is perfectly compatible with Office for PC, but it is not very compatible with Sharepoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For things like bid or proposal writing, the safest course of action is to tell your Mac users to check the files in or out of Sharepoint using the Finder, and work on them locally. &nbsp;Don't try to open documents in Sharepoint.</p>

            <p>I disagree with John on this one. You should not experience the glitches you are seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office 2011 requires&nbsp;Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 or later for co-authoring. Both Microsoft Office 2011 and SharePoint Server require that current updates be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Mac, as of this writing Word must be version 14.4.6.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sharepoint must have Service Pack 2 and other updates installed.</p>
<p>On the PC, all service packs and Office updates must be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first troubleshooting step is to ensure all software is fully updated on all 3 platforms.</p>

 letter also stated that pictures from my web can have been captured and a key logger was used to get my password (s) .&nbsp; It looks like the password was correct but the rest I am not sure what this person has. How do I report it to Microsoft Outlook as this

<br />Hello Juris 
<br />
<br />As already stated, this is a well-known running scam that has been going on for a while and come in a variety of different flavors.
<br />
<br />In addition to changing your email password if you're still using the one that was included in the email message, it's also very important that you change the password anywhere that you have subscribed to something using the same email address/password combination especially for such things as online banking, credit cards, PayPal, Amazon etc etc.

<p>this scam is being perpetuated all over. I have received an email like this, threatening to post a video online unless I send money to the blackmailer at a Bitcoin email.&nbsp;<br />
When I looked up Bitcoin to address the matter their fraud page listed this very same method.</p>

<p>this is from bitcoins own webpage</p>
Blackmail
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(77, 80, 96, 1)">Be wary of blackmail attempts in which strangers threaten you in exchange for bitcoin as a means of extortion. One common execution of this method is by email, where-in the sender transmits
 a message claiming that he/she has hacked into your computer and is operating it via remote desktop protocol (RDP). The sender says that a key logger has been installed and that your web cam was used to record you doing something you may not want others to
 know about. The sender provides two options - send bitcoin to suppress the material, or send nothing and see the content sent to your email contacts and spread across your social networks. Scammers use stolen email lists and other leaked user information to
 run this scheme across thousands of people en masse.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(77, 80, 96, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(77, 80, 96, 1)">this is from bitcoins own page (https://bitcoin.org/en/scams). as you&nbsp; can see its being widely used. also read up at&nbsp;https://bitcoinwhoswho.com/blog/2018/04/21/where-to-report-bitcoin-scams/.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(77, 80, 96, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(77, 80, 96, 1)">firs of all you must calm down. this is so common, as the article states. complain on this pafe and also file a report with your local police and the federal trade commission.</p>

    <title>copy worksheets with checkboxes or option buttons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markusruh  say:</h3>
<h2>            copy worksheets with checkboxes or option buttons</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>In Excel 2013, if I select a complete worksheet (ctrl-A), copy it (ctrl-c), create a new worksheet and paste the copied contents into it (ctrl-v), checkboxes and option buttons look completely wrong. Both the position of the controls are wrong and the
 size of the graphics inside of the controls are scaled incorrectly. This has nothing to do with "object positioning" settings (like "move but don't size with cell"). I also tested the same procedure in Excel 2007, but there the pasted controls look correct.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, is there some kind of workaround for this in Excel 2013 or is this just a bug? (honestly, it looks like a bug, as the scaled option buttons look very bad). Do others have the same effect or is this only on my computer? And if this is a bug, how and
 where can I tell Microsoft so that they can fix it?</div>
<div>Best wishes,&nbsp;</div>
<div>Markus</div>

            <p>I don't have 2013, but a potential work around would be to right-click on the sheet's tab &gt; Move or Copy &gt; Check the "Create a copy" checkbox, OK.&nbsp; Copying the sheet rather than the contents of the sheet may work better.</p>

            This seems to copy the controls correctly, but it's not me who's gonna copy-paste the sheets, but a customer. So I don't have any control over how they will copy the sheet into the workbook.... So a way to fix this would be better, but thank you for the
 answer!

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm doing a presentation of a series of pictures to run on a loop. I have 5 different clips of songs to play in the background. I have the audio playing and it fades from one song to the next, but now the actual slides with the pictures won't advance until
 the very last song starts playing. Can anyone help? I have the event tomorrow.</p>

<p>I imagine you are running the songs with animations. The slide transition won't fire until the animations finish by starting the last song.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could get around this by editing all 5 songs into one file using a program like the free

<p>As JohnK said - you should combine the 5 files in Audacity. Even then though if the presentation loops before the sound has finished it will restart and not sound professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This page has a method of fixing this. It sounds clunky but it actually works well.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a SharePoint account I use for project management. I am looking to display a PowerPoint on the mainsite as well as subsites that are hyperlinked to specific documents. When I add a PowerPoint that is saved as a PDF, all the slides show up. Is there
 a way to only display the main slide, and then when one person clicks on a tile within the slide, it directs them to the appropriate page. I also would like to make this so that way subcontractors are unable to edit the slides. Thank you.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried the method described in the Microsoft support document on embedding
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Embed-Office-documents-and-PDF-files-on-a-website-4b30a00c-2023-49b2-bd15-b65e909338fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office documents on a website</a>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should then be able to control what a person viewing the slides should be able to do with the presention (View Only, or Edit) using the Share settings for the presentation file in you SharePoint document library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can further limit ability to edit the presentation by saving the presentation as a "PowerPoint Picture Presentation" when saving the final copy of the presentation. This keeps the presentation in the PowerPoint file format but flattens the contents of
 each slide to a single, slide-sized picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you found this helpful.</p>

<h2>            Auto-Save Feature not available in O365 office products</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an O365 Pro-Plus subscriber through work and also have a Premium upgrade on my personal Microsoft account. Auto-save feature is not available for any of the office products (word, excel or powerpoint) for either of my accounts. (the toggle button is
 not displayed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've re-installed windows, one-drive, removed my accounts and re-added them but nothing enables this feature to display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've burned hours going round in loops and message boards indicate it's intermittent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is causing this issue and how can it be resolved.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This is the same across all the office products...It was available but now it's not, very frustrating&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep hold of your instructions but seem to have things working for now. I opted to use my Office Professional Plus 2016 as primary as it updates monthly and has the auto save feature. I downloaded the Skype for Business as an app from the O365 pro-plus
 and associated just that app with my work account which works perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4367d891-87bf-410b-a66b-b926b4ab9dd1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4367d891-87bf-410b-a66b-b926b4ab9dd1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The O365 Pro Plus account which I have with work seems to override at admin level. I now have the features I need so will leave them as they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance and will definitely try this option if needed in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Hayley</p>

 there any changes you've made prior to this? Check if moving the pictures to the phone memory will make any difference. You may also try checking if the phone is up to date. Go to Settings &gt; phone update &amp; then tap check for updates. Let us know the outcome.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi M.Etc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, to isolate if the issue is related to your Microsoft Teams Desktop App, please temporarily close your Teams Desktop App, and then disconnect your Teams account from other devices ( like mobile).&nbsp; After that please use your Teams
 account to sign into the Teams Web App ( <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://teams.microsoft.com/</a>) and then check if you could change the status there.&nbsp; By the way, you can try to type /available in the Teams search bar and then see if it can help you to change the status to “ available”, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, if you cannot change the status in the web app either, may I know if your Office 365 organization is still using Skype for Business and Teams, or you are just only using Teams now?&nbsp; If you don’t familiar with it, please try
 to contact your Office 365 global admin to confirm it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your organization is just only using Teams, please suggest your global admin to help you check if you have set up the correct Teams upgrade mode (Teams only mode) &nbsp;for your Teams account. &nbsp;For more
 details, please refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/setting-your-coexistence-and-upgrade-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Setting your coexistence and upgrade settings</a>.&nbsp; Please note, if your admin changed the settings in the Admin Center, it may need some hours to take effect, please wait for it with some patience, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the suggestions above don’t work, I’d like to collect some more information for the further investigation:</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A screenshot about your Teams status. ( Including the offline message).</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If other users in your organization ( have the same domain with you) have the same issue now?</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Please provide two screenshots about the Teams upgrade mode. ( Tenant side and your own teams account side).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

<p>Hi LUCA,</p>
<p>In Exchange Online, it is not feasible to disable hyperlinks for the incoming emails.</p>
<p>I understand if we can do that in Office 365. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</p>
