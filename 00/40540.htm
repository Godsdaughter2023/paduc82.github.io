<h2>            Wireless keyboard and safe mode</h2>
                    I can't boot to safe mode because I have a wireless keyboard and it isn't able to do anything until Windows loads. Hitting F8 does absolutely nothing.

            Yes, this is a common problem with some wireless keyboards. Attach a USB keyboard temporarily to solve the problem. You can get a basic USB keyboard for very little money.

<h2>            Surface Pro with Surface Dock - Ethernet not available when waking up from sleep</h2>
                    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>** DEAR MODERATOR, PLEASE DO NOT MERGE THIS INTO MY PREVIOUS POST.</p>
<p>** THE PREVIOUS ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED.</p>
<p>** THIS IS A NEW ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED YET.</p>
<p>** THANK YOU.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a brand new Surface Pro and Surface Dock, both purchased June 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The surface diagnostic toolkit finds no issues</li><li>All the latest updates (software, drivers, firmware) have been installed</li><li>Surface has been restarted multiple times and the issue is still persistent</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Challenge Details:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I leave the PC for some time and come back to wake it up, the Ethernet adapter is not available and the PC defaults to the WiFi connection as shows in the following screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d35606d-9ac2-49a3-b627-e9f988ae1f41?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d35606d-9ac2-49a3-b627-e9f988ae1f41?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the device manager in control panel, reveals the issue, you can see the warning triangle sign next to the Ethernet adapter:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a1254f1-96d6-44cd-85ac-eaad62b4d05b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a1254f1-96d6-44cd-85ac-eaad62b4d05b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If I right click the adapter and look at it's properties, the root cause is obvious an error that spells: "Object Name already exists"<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10f99640-3b2b-41e2-8c82-a85a2a76f696?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10f99640-3b2b-41e2-8c82-a85a2a76f696?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the web, and found multiple references to the same issue.</p>
<p>In all the articles I found, it was suggested that the advanced properties of two of the driver properties need to be changed from their default setting.</p>
<p>1. Energy Efficient Internet</p>
<p>2. Selective suspend.</p>
<p>I have changed both to 'Disabled' as suggested, to no avail (even after several restarts):<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/391aecb0-8b9e-46fa-abb9-31a1b1314a2f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/391aecb0-8b9e-46fa-abb9-31a1b1314a2f?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2371db1-b172-4bfe-8e0d-067b36215d35?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2371db1-b172-4bfe-8e0d-067b36215d35?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get the network adapter back and working, is to disable and re-enable the device from Device Manager:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a64d4422-aa98-4979-b2f8-8a3ddf471d62?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a64d4422-aa98-4979-b2f8-8a3ddf471d62?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Disable - Re-enable, the error disappears, and the device works again:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a8dce9a-5ffe-415d-9ff2-962a6fd19090?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a8dce9a-5ffe-415d-9ff2-962a6fd19090?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>And the network automatically reconnects using the Ethernet instead of the Wi-Fi:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21bb5cae-228c-4564-aa00-68e408c0058e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21bb5cae-228c-4564-aa00-68e408c0058e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ami,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Surface Pro may be losing Ethernet connection when it wakes up from sleep because of a possible software or hardware issue. I see that you have tried several troubleshooting to work on this. You mentioned that restarting the Surface does not resolve
 the issue. Does this mean that when you lose the Ethernet connection, it doesn't come back after restarting the device? Or the connection returns but disappears when the Surface goes into sleep mode then wakes up? Instead of restarting the Surface normally,
 I suggest that you perform a two-button reset while the Surface is docked. This process will reload the software and drivers properly. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Switch off your Surface.</li><li>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button simultaneously for at least 15 seconds. It may enter the Surface UEFI. Wait until the screen goes off before releasing both buttons.</li><li>Switch on your Surface normally.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest that you run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter when you lose the Ethernet connection. It can be accessed by going to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt;<strong> Update &amp; Security </strong>&gt; <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Network Adapter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, try to replace the Ethernet cable or at least interchange the ends when you lose the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be happy to get back to you if you need further assistance.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Ruz San and thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed your instructions, to no avail.</p>
<p>The issue persists.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks, I can say that it doesn't happen every time the computer wakes up.</p>
<p>Some days it will be OK, and then all of the sudden the Ethernet adapter is gone again, with the same error message.</p>
<p>Some days, this will happen every time the PC wakes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought I'll share my findings and solution in case someone else encounters the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface dock Ethernet driver crashing was not related directly to sleep mode, it happened occasionally even when the PC was not in sleep mode. The root source is a double fault - one of Microsoft, and one of Apple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trigger for the driver crash was Apple's Bonjour software, which is installed by default with iTunes.</p>
<p>The Bonjour service is Apple's 'zero configuration networking'.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/bonjour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/bonjour</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Bonjour has a known issue - it raises an error when it is connected to the same network via both Wi-Fi and Ethernet, as it detects it as a duplicate network name.
</p>
<p>The Application log shows the following cryptic error:&nbsp;<em>"The description for Event ID 100 from source Bonjour Service cannot be found. ....</em><em>"</em></p>
<p>My network uses the same router for both Wi-Fi and Ethernet, and of course they share the same name.</p>
<p>Microsoft's fault here, is that this error causes the Ethernet driver to completely crash, and the device to become unavailable.
</p>
<p>This should never be allowed to happen... </p>
<p>The only way to bring the device back to life, is to restart, or to disable and enable the device from Device manager as I've shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solutions:</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>1. Disable WiFi when connected to Ethernet</p>
<p>2. Use a different Wi-Fi network name, most modern Wi-Fi routers also offer an additional 5 GHz network, typically suffixed with -5G.</p>
<p>3. Uninstall Bonjour - iTunes works great without it too. iTunes will complain about it once only.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tip:While you are at it, you can also uninstall Apple's resident software updater, you will still be prompted to update when iTunes launches and an update is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have issues with the Surface Pro, and many unexplained errors in the log, for which I will open a separate thread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone from MS will take this information and let the developers know about this bug, so it can be fixed.</p>
<p>It is easily reproducible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ami</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - it is very disappointing that in this forum none of the MS experts even bothered to follow up on this annoying issue.</p>
<p>I would expect better support experience from MS for these high-end surface machines.</p>

<p>This issue is not (only) related to Apple Bonjour. I do not run it, at all... never have. I have the same issue with the dock's Ethernet not being available after sleeping (almost always) and, occasionally, at other times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the general notion is true, but it's not only triggered by Bonjour. Yes, Microsoft, get with the program. All MS hardware and software and it's not reliable. I cannot believe these issues persist after so many years in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem here, without Itunes/Bonjour. </p>
<p>Connected on the same router wifi &amp; wired.</p>
<p>Surface 4, brand new dock.</p>
<p>Have to disconnect the cable from the surface and reconnect it to make things work again.</p>
<p>Both Surface and Dock at the latest patch level.</p>
<p>

<p>I am experiencing the same problem, but in my case Surface Book 2 (Windows 10 / 1803) and using USB Ethernet adaptors still experiences the same issue.<br />
</p>
<p>Fix it Microsoft. I bought a Microsoft product partially because I thought Microsoft might be able to make their own product less buggy, but that seems not to be the case.</p>

<p>Same issue here. Surface Book 2 using a Surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Surface Book goes into Sleep mode, I'll wake it, and the NIC won't connect. I disconnect the dock cable, wait, reconnect, wait, and the NIC connects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kinda like if I had a Ferrari that wouldn't start. So, I have to remove the battery and reconnect it to get the car to start each time. I wouldn't own a Ferrari for long, and wouldn't recommend one to anyone else.</p>

<p>Apparently, Microsoft doesn't give a flying F**K...</p>
<p>This is a crappy, buggy piece of S**T, and the service on the forums is even worse. Not a single forum moderator cares to show some minimal care...</p>
<p>I've had nothing but grief since day 1.</p>
<p>In addition to the network issues, I have monitors that keep disappearing or losing their settings for no reason, matrix like vertical pixels appearing every now and then which go away only after restart, machine is slow and hangs frequently for seconds
 at a time, error log that looks like a field or red roses...</p>
<p>I don't know what laptop I'll get next, but I know for sure what I'm not buying ever again!</p>

<h3> dan_367  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update and Router &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is Cisco (Linksys) router compatable with the upgrade? Currently I have full signal strength on the icon for Network Internet access. This icon is located on the lower right hand corner of the taskbar..&nbsp; Where will I see this on a new screen with Windows
 10? Will it still be there?</p>
<p>This is windows 7 .&nbsp; I will be totally lost if I lose internet access.&nbsp; Plus, I have a laptop, that is the only other computer on my network. I don't plan to update that computer.. (only this desktop) . Will there be ANY effect on the laptop's internet access
 after the update?</p>

            <p>The Cisco \ Linksys&nbsp; Router&nbsp;\ Wireless Access Point should be fully RFC compliant meaning that yes it will work with Windows 10.&nbsp; You should also validate that your Wireless network card has the latest drivers and that those drivers are Windows 10 compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The icon will be in the system tray as you see on Win7.&nbsp; The icon itself may change to the Wireless icon though, but that will have no affect on the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to look in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithUpdatedFilters?TempOsid=Windows%2010&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;Architecture=X64&amp;Type=Hardware&amp;ProductCategory=Networking&amp;ProductSubcategory=Ethernet%20adapters&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=436&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hardware Compatibility List</a> for your Networking device.</p>

            <p>You state that I should "validate that your wireless network card has the latest drivers".&nbsp; So it's a possibility that if I don't do something, that I will lose my internet connection? I will click on the blue link above "Hardware Compatibility List".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even know what a wireless network card is, that's how little I know.&nbsp; I just know where everything plugs in and I do have saved the long number-letters for the router connection, but other than that lost.&nbsp; I appreciate any info you can provide.</p>

            Looks like that link is "temporarily unavailable" when I click on it.&nbsp; Whew.... Is there any possiblity, that I won't need to do anything or is it guaranteed that I will need to do something for the network ( this desktop and one laptop) to continue working

            <p>Again you should not be worried about your Access Point.&nbsp; The worry should be geared more for your Wireless Network Card.&nbsp; You can do the following to get that information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Device Manager</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; [Win+R &amp; type Devmgmt.msc]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expand&nbsp;Network Adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reply back with what adapters you see there.&nbsp; You can also try right clicking the adapter and select Update Driver Software.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Because, if I try to use the link from the Kiss 1600&nbsp;in the early stages of Windows 10 boot, it works (so, the drivers must be there), but, by the time Windows 10 is fully loaded, it doesn't work....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is therefore installing a setting which blocks it...</p>

<h2>            How to autostart UAC Trust Shortcut 1.0 service&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>A few week ago their was no avoiding Windows 7 when I had to buy a few laptops and PC's for some friends. Not wanting to disable the UAC&nbsp;I started imidiately searching for a program to start some legacy programs without the hated&nbsp;UAC-prompt.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Eventally I found UAC Trust Shortcut 1.0. It let you make shortcuts (like a whitelist) , that won't prompt anymore.<br />
The only caveat is, that you have to start the&nbsp;the UAC Trust Shortcut-service manually, everytime the machine is restarted.</p>
<p>Does&nbsp;anyone know a way how to automatically restart&nbsp;this service?</p>
<p>TIA,&nbsp;Jem.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.s. I already tried the Task Shedule way on the tracer.exe found in the installation folder, but to no avail.</p>

How did you install the program? The 1.0 version had some issues in the <br />
past while the next 2.x is going to work much better and include much<br />
more options etc. <br />

Have a nice day...<br />

I downloaded and installed the 1.0 software from the following link "http://www.itknowledge24.com/uacts_x86.zip" I have looked around for a newer version of the program (I noticed that a new version had been released v1.0.1), but I am unable to locate the 1.0.1
 build and I haven't found any 2.x versions on the net. have they been released yet?<br />

<h2>            &#34;Back up and Restore &#40;Windows 7&#41;&#34; present in Control Panel &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my laptop from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 when the initial update came out. I recently went onto the Control Panel and noticed the "Back up and Restore (Windows 7)" option available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, does anyone know why this option to restore my laptop to <strong>Windows 7</strong> is coming up instead of Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, if I choose to restore my laptop (to Windows 7 presumably) and then use the back up I made on Windows 10, will my computer still be on Windows 7 but with my data, or will it revert to Windows 10 because that's the system used to make the back up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for any help! :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backup and Restore (Windows 7) :</strong> "Windows 7" in the bracket doesn't mean it will revert or restore to Windows 7. It states that in Windows 10 there is also an option to backup and restore the way it was in Windows 7. Getting the feedback
 from several customers using Windows 10, Microsoft has retained the earlier Windows 7 style for backup and restoring the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Windows 10 has two ways of Recovery options, one is through<strong>
</strong><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update and Recovery

<p>
</p><p>If you used Backup and Restore to back up files or create system image backups in previous versions of Windows, your old backup is still available in Windows 10. To get to it, right-click the
<strong>Start </strong><strong>button</strong>, and then select <span>
<strong>Control Panel </strong>&gt; <strong>Backup and Restore (Windows 7).</strong></span></p>

<h2>            How to change the way Cortana&#39;s search displays filters&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Hello,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I'll get right to the point: sometimes, when I use Cortana's search feature (not Windows Explorer's search), the filters (audio, video, pictures, docs, etc.) are displayed at the bottom of the menu, as shown here:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99801972-861f-4fbc-878c-7e3e6f8c1cb7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99801972-861f-4fbc-878c-7e3e6f8c1cb7" height="305" width="255" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Now, this is not how Cortana's search shows filters by default (and I have no idea what triggers this change), but this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f3636412-d654-4ffd-a6b6-3d562df83a6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f3636412-d654-4ffd-a6b6-3d562df83a6b" height="433" width="255" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><div style="text-align: justify">As you can see, the first way is much more convenient, since it shows all the filters by default, instead of forcing me to click on "Filters" to search for, say, music files (which is for what I use the feature, most of the time).
 How can I change the way filters are shown, so as to make the first way the default?</div>

<p style="text-align: justify">Hi Alden, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Not at all, I haven't made any hardware or software changes to my laptop recently. The only thing I can think of is that a couple of days ago, my brother logged in to his local user account , something which he rarely does, since
 he only uses my laptop when he needs to use moderately demanding software (Adobe Premiere Pro CC). I can't be completely sure, but I believe I noticed the change in the way the search filters are displayed when I first logged in to my account once my brother
 was done using my laptop. I also can't remember if this happened the other times I noticed this change. I will try to rule it out by asking my brother to log in to his account - checking the way the filters are displayed by default on his account -, sign off,
 and then log in to mine.</p>

<p>Hello Alden,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I've been using my brother's account all day, trying many combinations of: signing out, in, restarting, signing in to my account, etc. It didn't trigger any change in the way Cortana's search displays the filters, so perhaps it
 has nothing to do with it. I thought it was somehow related to some user preferences option that was somehow different in my brother's account, but it doesn't seem like it. So, the questions remains, is there any way to change the way in which the search filters
 are displayed? It's certainly not a big deal for me, but it's nicer to have them all displayed by default, like in the first picture.</p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback. The reason that you're search filters shows above instead of the usual which is below. Because the filters has been added by an
<strong>All</strong> filter. In this case, it is by design that it will stay above of the menu to show all filters when you click the drop down menu.<br />

<div style="text-align: justify">Thanks for your response, Alden. If, by design, the filters are supposed to be grouped under
<strong>All</strong>, and displayed at the top, how is it that sometimes they are displayed separately at the bottom? I suppose there's a setting that controls the way the filters are displayed, right?

<p>We suggest to post your feedback using the Feedback Hub. It is a communication forum included in the Windows 10 operating system as of the 2016 Anniversary Update. It includes a feedback board for submitting suggestions and problems, announcements on new
 Insider Previews of Windows and apps, "quests" for testing new workflows, and a dashboard for tracking achievements in the Feedback Hub. Feedback was formed from the merger of two earlier apps, Windows Feedback and Insider Hub. It is mostly updated through
 server-side changes, although it sometimes receives updates through the Windows Store, and it requires an Internet connection for full functionality. To access the Feedback Hub, kindly click on Cortana and type in Feedback Hub.</p>

<h2>            Message could not be displayed - Windows Live Mail encountered an unexpected problem while displaying this message. Check your computer for low memory or low disk space and try again.</h2>
                    <p>I have tried Repairing all Windows Live programs, as per Giridhar J's suggestion, but it didn't help.&nbsp; I'm still not able to view some of my emails.&nbsp; It's not all of my emails that I'm unable to view, just some of them.&nbsp; When my email was on the DeltaSync
 protocol , and this kind of thing happened, I would see a message at the bottom that said, "To view this message anyway,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">click here</span>."&nbsp; But now that my email is on the IMAP protocol, I'm not even being given that option.&nbsp; Fortunately I'm still able to view my job leads and my emails from family and friends, and the emails that I'm
 unable to view are advertising, but I still want to be able to view those emails also.&nbsp; I am able to view them through Outlook, but having to access my email through a browser to be able to view all my emails pretty much defeats the purpose of having Windows
 Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to remove my account and have to reinstall Windows Live Mail on my computers, because I'm afraid I might lose my emails, and I already went through a lengthy process of setting up new email accounts on my desktop and my laptop, when I had to
 switch from the DeltaSync&nbsp;protocol to the IMAP protocol, and frankly, I don't have time to go through all of that again and wait for all my emails to download onto new accounts again.&nbsp; Also, I'm having this problem on both my desktop, which has Windows Live
 Mail 2011, and my laptop, which has Windows Live Mail 2012.&nbsp; Is there some other way that I can solve this problem so I can view all my emails again, without having to remove my email accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder, would it help to set up new email accounts on the POP3 protocol?&nbsp; Or will Microsoft not be supporting email on that protocol after June 30th?&nbsp; I never had this problem before, when my email was on the POP/DeltaSync protocol.&nbsp; I wasn't sure if it
 was on POP or DeltaSync, because it mentioned both in Properties.</p>

            <p>When I viewed my email account through a browser just now, I saw that it still said "Outlook.com" and not "Outlook Mail" in the upper left hand corner of the screen.&nbsp; Is that why I'm having this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows Live Mail 2011 is no longer being supported by Microsoft, this may explain why I am unable to view some of my emails on my desktop, which has Windows Live Mail 2011 on it.&nbsp; But this still doesn't explain why I also cannot view those same emails
 on my laptop, which has Windows Live Mail 2012 on it.&nbsp; I could upgrade my email on my desktop to Windows Live Mail 2012 and see if that solves the problem, but I suspect that it won't, because I am having the same problem with my Windows Live Mail 2012 on
 my laptop.&nbsp; But I will try upgrading my email on my desktop to Windows Live Mail 2012, when I have time.&nbsp; I'm not at home with my desktop right now, so it will have to wait until the weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you think of any reason why I am also experiencing this issue on my Windows Live Mail 2012 account?&nbsp; And how do I go about updating my Outlook.com to Outlook Mail?&nbsp; Will that solve the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to know if Windows Live Mail on the POP3 protocol will be supported after June 30th, because I never experienced this problem with my email until I switched to the IMAP protocol just a couple of weeks ago, so I strongly suspect that that's the
 cause of the problem, and I wonder if POP3 might allow me to view all my emails and work better in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what rules I may have accidentally created to cause this problem.&nbsp; I would need someone to walk me through configuring my Windows Live Mail account in such a way that I can view all my emails once again.</p>

 to download Windows Essentials 2012, it wants to run this add-on:&nbsp; Name ActiveX Control.&nbsp; It says that it's from Microsoft Corporation, but still, I don't want any more add-ons that I don't know anything about.&nbsp; Is there another site where I can download Windows
 Essentials 2012 without getting any add-ons downloaded along with it?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I really don't think that it will help at all to upgrade my Windows Live Mail 2011 account to Windows Live Mail 2012, because my Windows Live Mail 2012 account is having all of the same problems.&nbsp; But if I can somehow download Windows Essentials 2012
 without any add-ons, I'll be willing to do it, and then, when I continue to have the same problems, maybe we can look at next steps.</p>

            This actually concerns both, because I've been experiencing this issue on both computers.&nbsp; And I wasn't aware that I could miss some messages on my computers if IMAP wasn't set up properly, but that makes sense.&nbsp; I did follow
<span>
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f56d9012-0474-4f54-b2f6-e10490146e0b" title="¡Firedog"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">¡Firedog's</span></span></a> instructions
 to the letter, so I feel confident that I set up IMAP properly on both computers.&nbsp; I haven't been missing messages in Windows Live Mail on either computer.&nbsp; I've compared my
<a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.com</a> to my Windows Live Mail on both computers, and all my emails are there in my Windows Live Mail accounts.&nbsp; But I think I understand what you mean, it would be simpler to just access Windows Live Mail on just
 one computer and maybe use <a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.com</a> on the other.&nbsp; Of course, then I would have to remember to delete it in my search history on the computer at my boyfriend's place.&nbsp; I like that you can't pull up my Windows Live
 Mail account in my browser history, but even more, I like the formatting so much better than that of outlook.&nbsp; But if it proves to be too cumbersome, I might consider it.&nbsp; Thanks for the suggestion.</span>

            <p>You're seeing the "Message could not be displayed - Windows Live Mail encountered an unexpected problem" errors on the Desktop PC running WLMail 2011 as well as the Notebook PC running WLMail 2012, is that correct?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Truth be told, there are seemingly endless possible causes for the error (e.g., corruption of your message store; "leftovers" from Norton and/or McAfee applications; injudicious use of "registry cleaners"). For many users, uninstalling WLMail then doing
 a clean install of WLMail resolves such problems. Of course you'll be "wiping" your current message store if &amp; when you do so. "Recovering" afterward gets a little more complicated&nbsp;since you're accessing the account via IMAP -
<em>especially</em> on two (2)&nbsp;computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever you decide to so, good luck!</p>

            <p><span>Yes, that is correct, I have been seeing this message on both my desktop PC running Windows Live Mail 2011 and my laptop PC running Windows Live Mail 2012.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It has been getting better, for some reason.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve been able to view emails from the senders that I wasn’t able to view emails from before.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I thought that maybe the problem had been resolved, but I just got another email today that showed that message.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But this time it took a long time for that message to show up.<span>&nbsp; </span>
For a long time it was just blank.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It was just an occasional error before, though it was happening more often than is it now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now it’s much more rare.<span>&nbsp; </span>I noticed that it was emails from certain senders (all advertisers) that displayed this message.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But I am now able to view most messages from those senders now.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>No, I have never been prompted to upgrade my email account on my desktop PC to Windows Live Mail 2012.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I did just get another email today from Microsoft, though, telling me once again that as of June 30 I will have to either upgrade my computers to Windows 10, get a free one-year subscription
 of Office 365 Personal, or start accessing my email through a browser.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Nowhere in that email does it mention protocols that are or aren’t going to be supported.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But I’m trusting what you said, that Windows Live Mail will still work on the IMAP or POP3 protocols.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have never had McAfee on either computer, but I did have Norton for a very short time on my desktop, and I had Reg Clean Pro on it for a while too.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The next day, after Norton was installed on the desktop, it crashed and automatically did a system restore, which removed Norton.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I think that I’ve removed any trace of Norton and Reg Clean Pro from the desktop, though I may want to check again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also, I think that My PC Backup may be somehow been downloaded onto the desktop also, and I will want to make sure that any trace of that is gone also.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My laptop has never had any of these programs on it, so I don’t think that that’s the problem, but I’m sure that it wouldn’t help any.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So thanks for mentioning that.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ll make sure that all of those programs are completely gone from my desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would be very afraid to reinstall Windows Live Mail, because if I weren’t able to recover all my emails, this would be a real problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Would this be less complicated if my email were on the POP3 protocol?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, I have recently had a couple of other problems with my email.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A few emails that I sent to friends apparently never reached them, and their emails didn’t reach me either.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But now my emails are reaching them, and theirs are also reaching me again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And a few emails from a couple of friends somehow ended up in my Junk folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But I added them to my safe sender list, and I am now seeing their emails in my Inbox.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And on my computer at home, I sometimes get a popup message saying something about not being able to connect to IMAP.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I get back home and I see the message again, I’ll let you know exactly what it says.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And just now, I had another, unexpected problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I tried to access my email through Outlook, it wouldn’t accept my email address and password when I tried to sign in.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It said that either the email address or the password that I had entered was incorrect.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was able to sign in eventually, after I waited a while, but I wonder why that happened.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And then, when I looked for the email that I wasn’t able to read in my Windows Live Mail in my Outlook.com, it wasn’t there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That’s the first time that that has happened.<span>&nbsp; </span>So now my Windows Live Mail is working quite a bit better (though it’s still not quite problem-free), but I am now having problems with my Outlook.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Hmm.</span></p>

<p>I'd love to see that email!&nbsp; Of course, you do NOT need to upgrade to Win10 (i.e., in order to access your account via Win10's Mail app), you do NOT need to install Office 365 Personal (i.e., in order to access your account in [MS] Outlook), and you'll still
 be able to access your account via IMAP &amp; POP3 in WLMail <em>as well as via <a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.com</a>&nbsp;using a browser.</em></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><span>When I tried to access my email through Outlook, it wouldn’t accept my email address and password when I tried to sign in.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're referring to Outlook.com (<a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com</a>), I assume. [Yes, it's very confusing. "Outlook" can mean Outlook.com, MS Outlook, and even Win10's Mail app! What were they thinking?]</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your WLMail issues are far too complicated for a one-size-fits-all fix. That being said...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Assuming neither a Norton application nor a McAfee application is currently installed on either of computer, running the
Norton Removal Tool and/or the <a href="http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</a> (each followed by a reboot) <em>MAY</em> improve things.<br />
<br />
</li><li>If you have backups of ALL the changes registry cleaners (e.g., Reg Clean Pro) have EVER made to the computer, restoring ALL of them (followed by a reboot)
<em>MAY </em>improve things.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Never, EVER running another "registry cleaner" again will DEFINITELY help to avoid these problems in the future.</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows Virtual PC won&#39;t start - Cannot start Windows Virtual PC Host Process. Check the System event log for details</h2>
                    
<p>I've been running Virtual PC for several months, and it suddenly is broken. I get a pop-up that says: Cannot start Windows Virtual PC Host Process. Check the System event log for more details. An error occurred during a seek operation."</p>
<p>There are two apps I need to run in XP mode, and this is a big problem. Seems to have happened after the most recent set of Windows updates. I did a system restore to before the updates, and get the same results. I uninstalled and reinstalled Virtual PC
 and XP mode, and get the same thing. Anybody else experiencing this problem? Any ideas on how to fix it?</p>
<p>Running 64-bit Win 7 Pro on Athlon II X4 620 w/4 gigs RAM.</p>

    <title>Problem with Dell Integrated Webcam on Inspiron 1545 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kakikala  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Dell Integrated Webcam on Inspiron 1545</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 with an integrated webcam. It came with Vista but I upgraded it to a Windows 7 64 bit. The webcam used to work in the beginning. I don't know why but one day it stopped working and never worked anymore. I've looked all over
 the internet for ways and tried many ways and it still doesn't work. The device manager identifies it as "Unknown Device" and identifies it as a Universal Serial Bus controller. I've tried uninstalling it and letting it detect it, but it still detects it as
 unknown device. I've also tried reinstalling the driver, the vista one since it doesn't have a windows 7 one. What that did was uninstall the old one, and tried to install the new one (which is the same). But the thing is, installing it doesn't work. It'll
 try to install it, and then a message saying "An error occured while installing the driver" or something like that and then it doesn't work. I ended up having to do system restore to get the driver back. I've tried many ways and still doesn't work. Even the
 USB cable way. I have been using a USB mouse. I even plugged in USB cables in all my USB ports and it didn't work. I tried not plugging in anything too and it doesn't work either. I can't even ask Dell for help cause there is no support thing I can get. And,
 my drivers are all up to date. Can someone help me fix this problem?<br />

<p>Hi Kakikala,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>At this point, I suggest contacting Dell to see if the device Windows 7 compliant.</p>
<p>If it is, they need to provide you with a driver that will correctly identify and install the device.</p>
<p>You might also ask them if some other device, like a USB controller, needs a driver to be able to identify the webcam hardware and install it correctly.</p>

            Hey westway,
<br />
<br />Only thing I can think of is going to <a href="http://icloud.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://icloud.com</a> and log into it, then go into Contacts. This will only work if you've logged into your iPhone with your Apple ID and enabled the ability to sync contacts. You should see it on your browser and from there you can print it out.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            Hello westwayjD68#
<br />Please follow these methods 
<br />Method 1
<br />All you just need is to toggle on “Contacts” in the iPhone Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; iCloud, and then follow these steps below.
<br />
<br />Make sure you’ve activated the iCloud contacts syncing features.
<br />Open iCloud.com on your computer, and log in with your Apple ID.
<br />Click into Contacts icon, and check all your contacts to see if there’s any missing.
<br />Click on the Gear icon, first hit Select All; then again click Gear icon and choose “Print”.
<br />After adjust the printing settings, you can now print out all your contacts from iPhone.
<br />
<br />Method 2
<br /> Make Use of iTunes Syncing
<br />You can also sync contacts from iPhone for later printing with iTunes. No any third-party programs needed, but you must have the latest version of iTunes installed on your computer, and you have to turn off iCloud contact syncing. To print contacts from iPhone, simply follow the steps below:
<br />
<br />Make sure you’ve turned off iCloud contact syncing in iPhone Settings &gt; iCloud &gt; Contacts.
<br />Connect your iPhone to the computer. Launch iTunes and click the “iPhone” icon on the left side of the screen.
<br />Click the “Info” tab and place a check mark beside “Sync Contacts with”. Select “Windows Contacts” under the drop-down menu and hit “Apply”.
<br />Minimize iTunes, click “Start” and then click your username. Locate the “Contacts” folder and click into it.
<br />(Windows 7) On the menu bar, select “Export”. Choose “CSV” and then click “Export”.
<br />Choose where to save the file and click “Next” to continue. Select the iPhone contacts filed you wish to keep and hit “Finish”.
<br />Now that you have your iPhone contacts in CSV file. Open it as a spreadsheet and print your contacts.
<br />I hope it heps

    <title>Too High Disk Usage Windows 8 Pro 64 Bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rohit gnair  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too High Disk Usage Windows 8 Pro 64 Bit</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Over the past couple of weeks I have been getting high disk usage on my computer, causing it to run extremely slowly.<br />
Is there any way to fix this issue?<br />
"Service Host: Local System (Network Restricted)" jumped to around 16MB/s after some time of usage and sometimes might lag when viewing across start menu or apps just after booting and at that time the disk usage will be high and I have already tried switching
 of virtual RAM and also the problem does not occur in Windows 7.<br />
Looking in resource monitor the main things causing the high read speed are: 'rundll32.exe' and one just called 'System' and sometimes by my Internet<br />
Browser. If you require any more information just ask because this issue is getting very annoying while playing games and sometimes while browsing with Firefox or Chrome.<br />
Thanks a bunch<br />
<br />
Rohit<br />

            I was so desperate with 100% disk usage 99,99% of the time that I tried every piece of black magic I read about in the Internet. The only thing that worked: running CCLEANER. After running it, disk usage sometimes will go down to even 0 (zero), which had
 never happended since I installed Windows 8.&nbsp; The disk use LED now is off most of the time and only stays steady on when I am doing a file transfer or something similar that is known and expected to have heavy disk I/O.
<br />
<br />
Caveat: I don't know why it worked. I don't know why other disk and register cleaners I tried did not work. I don't know if it will work persistently: I did it only about two hour ago. But, for the time being, I am really happy with the results and think you
 should give it a try if you have a similar problem.<br />

            <p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>service host local system (network restricted), when i boot or exit game it has 80%-100% disk usage, but when it comes to game i think sometimes it starts while i'm in game like ESO for a example, cause suddenly it starts to lag, the type of lag what happens
 with single player games when u play with to high setting with what ur PC isn't capable of playing normally, not data transfer lag what u get when u have connection issue, i can make difference between the two types of lags, well any gamer should be, u learn
 it when ur playing single player games &amp; then mmo's quite fast, when i exit game disk usage is&nbsp; 80%-100%, so i think that's what makes my game lag, that processes was at&nbsp;80%-100% while i was playing, it makes sense when u think about it, so i believe that
 windows 8 &amp; 8.1 have to meany security protocols that cause this issue, win7 was less problematic, also when the disk usage is that high my 64bit sys feels like 32bit sys, well a bit worse then 32bit sys, when it comes to speed, on boot it is some time 5min
 or so then disk usage is back to zero, after i exit game same, with game it isn't always a problem, not always lagging
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i believe its also the cause of why win explorer crashes after awry bigger update, after boot what is after update, u know, update, restart then boot &amp; when win opens it crashes &amp; when i look at error reports ic win explorer stopped working, i believe this
 issue is connected to service host issue, this host issue + a lot of preparation win is doing after update = explorer crash, cause the 80%-100% on boot + preparation that win makes also want disk usage, &amp; when it doesn't get enough disk it makes explorer cash,
 that's just what i think/believe <br />

            <p>Got exactly the same problem. Want ENG appearance and NOB keyboard. Every time I log on, its starts up with ENG. Did of course tried as you have recommended. Use Kaspersky Internet Security, is of course Administrator. Attach a screenshot indicating that
 I have set up Display / Input language as NOB and ENG. Has struggled with this a long time and starting to get really frustrated.</p>

            I have this issue too, and it started the moment I linked my windows 10 to microsoft.com - before that it was fine, UK English. Now it's linked to microsoft.com it changes to US English every time I re-boot. It is obviously something to do with settings
 on my Microsoft account conflicting with my local machine, but I can't find it anywhere.

            <p>I had this problem but my solution only works if you only need one keyboard. I have a French keyboard but I type in English mainly and sometime French. I deleted the English keyboard, but kept English as a language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into "Language Preference" - you can do this on the language icon next to the clock on the taskbar</p>
<p>Click "Region and Language"</p>
<p>Click on the language where you don't need the keyboard. In my instance "English* and choose "options" and delete the keyboard that you don't need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>English is still my default language for typing but the keys on the keyboard now correspond to their actual layout on the actual keyboard - it's a french layout "QWERTZ" rather than "QWERTY".&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I tried this and it worked initially. But now it's reverting to the unwanted keyboard again (in my case I want UK but it reverts to US.) The US language pack seems to have reinstalled itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm &nbsp;trying another solution. It begins the same way as yours but goes a bit further:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click where the language is shown in status bar (in my case ENG)</li><li>Language preferences</li><li>
<p>Click on the unwanted language pack (in my case English (United States))</p>
<p>Options</p>
</li><li>Remove</li></ol>
<p>Now when I hover over the language in the status bar, the pop up only listed the UK keyboard not both UK and US. So I'm hoping this works and the US doesn't reinstall itself.</p>

<p>I need to work with 3 different languages on Keyboard: English, Russian and Hebrew.
</p>
<p>I can't delete any of them, each time I re-boot the language is back to only English.
</p>
<p>It's driving me nuts! </p>
<p>Not only that, all the favorites in Internet browser are also deleted to default. So I can assume that another features are also deleted by rebooting and are resetting. Its quite a bug.
</p>
<p>Have anyone some solution for this??? HELP</p>

<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all methods of changing setting in WIN 10. Nothing works. </p>
<p>The biggest problem is combination of outlook proofing language and windows display language.
</p>
<p>If you use only one language and add more keyboards - {here is nothing to switch to automatically}, office don't recognize keyboards language but only main language.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I override this terrible changing of language by adding second keyboard to the main language. But outlook (word) does not know it is different keyboard. Then it keeps proofing language different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case. Windows is in ENG, I want to have primary keyboard and office proofing language in CZECH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When everything is done, after computer sleep you need to switch again and again like idiot to CZECH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only normal solution for me is:</p>
<p>1. change windows to CZECH - primary</p>
<p>2. ENG use as secondary</p>
<p>3. set office in setting to not use primary language, but ENG.</p>
<p>4. set proofing in office to CZE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Now you can have office in English, which most important is excel and excel equations.</p>
<p>=Default is CZE so keyboard and proofing is always default CZE.</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>I have the same question.</p>
<p>I have a DELL desktop with US keyboard and a DELL laptop with a UK keyboard - both running Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have set up both keyboards in my Microsoft profile but the desktop keeps reverting to the UK keyboard whenever it "wakes up" or is re-started. I can toggle it back to US keyboard using WIN + Space bar but it is annoying to do this every time I use the
 PC.</p>
<p>Seems like there is a bug in the Microsoft/Windows10 interface which hopefully the Microsoft gurus are working on!</p>

<br />
That's 3 different drivers. None of them work.<br />
My computer does not recognize the device.<br />
