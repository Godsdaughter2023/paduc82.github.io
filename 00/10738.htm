    <title>Open file from Internet in Protected View -- no prompt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craig_mb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open file from Internet in Protected View -- no prompt</h2>
                    It appears that a recent update has added to/altered the option (pre-set as on)
<em>Enable Protected View for files originating from the internet.</em><br />
<br />
The trouble is, the prompt that normally appears (about file type mis-match, do you wish to proceed?) is no longer appearing and
<strong>the file never opens or it opens a blank spreadsheet. </strong>There is no prompt or error message.<br />
<br />
The only work around is to un-check <em>Enable Protected View for files originating from the internet.</em><br />
<br />
Anyone else having this issue?

    <title>Lumia 950 rattling noise&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bongosrice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 rattling noise&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have had my 950 since Christmas and have recently been noticing some rattling noises emerging from the top of the device. If you shake the device you can hear a slight rattling noise, even when the back cover is off, and a very noticeable reverb-like noise
 when you put the phone down face-first, but you don't get any of this when the phone is facing screen-up. I don't know if it's the camera, if it's natural or not... Also makes loud vibration noise when you tap it even the slightest near the top-back of the
 device. I think that it might be the camera housing and it is not the battery, if so then never mind I can deal with it as long as it isn't something loose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else?</p>
<p />

            Turns out it's a bearing for the Optical Image Stabilisation feature for the camera, and if you listen closely to your phone when you go off the camera app, you will hear a subtle click which is the same bearing doing what it's supposed to. It's not an
 error, it's meant to happen.

            There is noting wrong i also thought something was wrong but its just the OIS both on my l950 and l950 xl and if you shake the iphone 6s you can barely hear just the same sound just not as loud

    <title>Checking a textbox, combobox, etc for blank, empty, null all at once - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris  parker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Checking a textbox, combobox, etc for blank, empty, null all at once</h2>
                    <p>I have a form (unbound) that I am using for data entry. Once fill it has been filled in, the user clicks on a "commit" button to save the data to the database.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now at the point where I am writing the code to make sure that the data is valid before allowing a commit to proceed. I'm stuck on how to check for empty textboxes or combo boxes. Here's what I've got:</p>
<p>
</p><p>good = True</p>
<p>If (IsEmpty)) Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good = False 'Bad if it is empty</p>
<p>ElseIf(IsNull)) Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good = False 'Bad if it is Null</p>
<p>ElseIf(trim(Not ((TextBox.Value &amp; vbnullstring) = vbnullstring)) Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good = False 'Bad if it is blank</p>
<p>End If</p>
<br />
<p>Because VBA doesn't use lazy evaluation like C, I can't put all three predicates into a single If statement; before I can check for blank I have to check if it is Null, and before I can check if it is Null I need to check if it is empty (I'm not sure about
 empty and null, but I know if I check if a null value is blank I will throw an error). Even if I need just two nested If statements, that's still a lot. I have six text- and comboboxes that I need to check, so that is a lot of code to test what seems to be
 something very simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an easier way to do this?</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases you can use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(TheTextbox &amp; vbNullString) &gt; 0 Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' The text box is not Null or empty string</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's possible that the text box contains only one or more spaces (which is hard to get it to do) then you can make double sure this way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(Trim(TheTextbox &amp; vbNullString)) &gt; 0 Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' The text box is not Null or empty string or blanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need to test for Null first; the concatenation takes care of that.</p>

<p>Hello Myron.</p>

<p>There are so many similar questions unanswered that I recommend that you ask the question in a specialist Outlook community - they're great, and fast.

<p>Here's their Home page to give you an idea of their range of expertise: <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Windows 10 Beta testing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uncletedkennedy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Beta testing</h2>
                    I am a member of the insider community, and very happy to be a part of this group. I enjoy running the beta programs and working out the bugs, with the obvious goal of working out the kinks and having a smooth operating program. Or programs, I should say.
 I want to know how I can get windows 10 onto my other laptop..I am running Windows 10 on a Toshiba Satellite L505D. It is a holdover from the days of XP Professional. Amazingly, the L505 is totally compatible with Win 10, with the sole exception being the
 Toshiba onboard DVD program, which cannot be fixed. The good folks at MS cured the problem with their own DVD player which works perfectly in all formats, and file types. This computer came from the factory with xp pro as the OS. I have another L505D almost
 identical to this one, except it arrived from the factory with <em>vista</em>, unfortunately. So now, I've got a 'puter that is capable of handling Win 10 but isn't amenable to the standard upgrade like all of the rest of the world... like, 98.76% of the rest
 of computers that <em>didn't</em> get the Vista curse. However, I'm told that I am eligible for a clean install windows 10 download on the beta tip. Is this correct? Will you please hook me up with the OS, and the directions for wiping the Vista away forever?
 I WANT THE WINDOWS 10 BETA IN ANY ROUGH FORM YOU'D CARE TO SEND. I will clean out the bugs to the very best of my abilities. Anything!! I will do anything you ask of me if we can only be rid of Vista Home on my other laptop. It is an eyesore; it is an irritant...it
 is... similar to an STD of the electronic intelligence. Hopefully you can offer me a cure. I thank you. I know it soon will be done. Again! in advance: I thank you profusely to the point of obsequiousness. You rock Microsoft!!

<p>I think you have 2 issues here.&nbsp; First, is the install of W10 on a PC and then the activation of W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fry my good W10 Insider from time to time.&nbsp; I then have a temp paper weight.&nbsp; I keep a good bootable USB on the shelf obtained from the Media Creation Tool for Anniversary build.&nbsp; I ask for&nbsp;updates which gets me to latest public build.&nbsp; I have to boot
 from BIOS since I have a dead O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My W10 PC is activated so no issue for me.&nbsp; I lose my apps and settings but I can choose to keep my personal files and folders.&nbsp; This may not apply to you but the bootable ISO may be a good route since it is bootable.&nbsp; When I get back to latest public build,
 I can then select Fast Lane, if I wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Media Creation Tool is readily available.&nbsp; I might be cautious about putting an XP era PC in the Insider group.&nbsp; I have at least 2 XP laptops on the shelf and tried to give these away but gave up in trying to pull of some data.&nbsp; They seemed slower than
 snails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Good luck on your endeavor.&nbsp; </p>

            Preview builds are not free copies of Windows 10. &nbsp;You will need to purchase Windows 10 and after clean installing it you can set it to receive insider builds. &nbsp;There never was a free path from Vista to Windows 10. &nbsp;

</p><p>I understand you&nbsp;have been experiencing issue with Whatsapp reinstallation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you cancel the pending download if any, and do a<br />
soft reset by pressing and holding volume down + power buttons until the phone restarts.</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure the date and time are correct: in Settings &gt; Date + Time &gt; turn Automatically to Off &gt; set up current date, time and zone manually.</span></p>
<p><span>If you use SD card, try changing the location for the new<br />
apps to the phone. If possible, try a different Wi-Fi connection. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, I suggest you contact the developer.</span></p>

<h2>            How to delete all end-of-line hyphens with or without space with find-and-replace function&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Background: I converted a table with hyphenated text from PDF into WORD. Now I want to get rid of the end-of-line hyphens – some with and some without space behind them. Because there are so many hyphens, I do not want to manually check them as recommended
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/remove-all-end-of-line-hyphens-in-word-2001-for/0ab00b4d-274a-480a-9c5d-96756abf63d2">
here</a>. I hope there is a way to do this by using the find and replace feature. The
<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/352352/remove-unwanted-hyphens-using-find-replace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
suggestion here</a> does not properly work in my instance but it appears to be an approximation. Thanks for your help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to not delete desired hyphens might be to exclude "- " followed by "and" or "or". I'm not sure whether that would be possible by using wildcards. Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Unable to rename database objects - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to rename database objects</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm having a problem renaming database objects.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I right click, say, a table, then it is briefly displayed in edit mode and then the orange highlight flicks down to another table.&nbsp; I&nbsp;originally thought&nbsp;that this was the table under the Rename option as occasionally I have been able to rename a module
 because, it seems, there are only a couple in this database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried using the shortcut letter [m] and can change the first character if I'm quick! It then drops back to having the object name in bold/highlighted in orange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Name AutoCorrect options are disabled in the current database</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can copy the database to a W7 65bit laptop running the same version of Access 2010 and I am able to rename objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas would be gratefully received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thanks in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            brother printer multiple tray problems in Word&#47;Excel</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>
I have a brother 8890DW mfc with a second tray and using Word 2011 for mac. When trying to set the trays for page 1 and later, it can see that a second tray exists but will not allow me to assign tray 1 for the first page and all subsequent pages from tray
 2. This option is greyed out and I am stuck with the default of all pages autoselect, although I can make all pages to come from tray 1 or 2 or the MP. I just can't seem to allocate page 1 to tray 1 and all the others to tray 2.</p>
<p>
Brother reckon it is a MicroSoft problem. Hmmmm</p>
<p>
Any assistance gratefully acknowledged</p>

            Thanks Bob,
<div><br />
<div>Same problem exists when trying to print from Preview and from Text Edit.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So it looks like it is a printer issue and probably more specific it is a driver problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Interestingly when I use one of the older drivers BR-Script3, the second tray option is no longer greyed out, and I can select Page 1 from Tray 1 and all others from tray 2. However what actually prints out is weird. I get a single line with gobbled gook
 on page one followed by a stack of blank pages.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I might throw this back to Brother. When I spoke to them last time time they were not interested in discussing the driver issue with me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help</div>
<div><br />
<div>cheers</div>

    <title>Made Win10 mine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smokeykaja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Made Win10 mine</h2>
                    <p>Greetings Insiders,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Having been playing with Win10 since October or so, I think that I have finally got it to work the way I want. (Almost)</p>
<p>I spent about a week slogging through disk/folder/file ownership and permissions. Digging through Regedit and getting RID of so much junk, trash and basically worthless stuff, I have Win10 kind of running like I want it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I got rid of Cortana, everything Xbox, Zune, Groove, Edge (what a waste of programming) and a few other things that I did not want/need/care about.&nbsp; The system seems to run quite a bit faster.&nbsp; Boot is 3 seconds faster then it was before.&nbsp; I don't allow
 Trusted Installer to put ANYTHING on my machine that I do not approve of first.&nbsp; That made a HUGE difference in the way that different apps get called!</p>
<p>&nbsp; The working through the Registry takes the most time.&nbsp; There are just so many keys that M$ has "protected" that you just do not want anymore.&nbsp; I takes a bit to work around those and get rid of any calls to them.&nbsp; But once done, it seems to make a real
 difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp; In many of the directories the ownership of folders cannot be done because M$ has decided to "drive" it deeper with inheritances.&nbsp; It required going to individual files within certain folders to change the ownership.&nbsp; Once that is done you can delete those
 files and folders that pertain to Cortana and such. This also gave me a large chunk of space back on my SSD.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now to see if it all "holds" through the next couple of updates.&nbsp; If you decide to try this take notes!&nbsp; It will help when M$ throws junk back on after an update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; If I could only figure out how to put Aero and some of the nice customization features onto Win10.&nbsp;&nbsp; THEN it would be a class act.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Take care,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; DISCLAIMER!:&nbsp; I know that there are some of you out there that like Cortana, Xbox and some of the stuff that I consider total junk stuff.&nbsp; That is OK.&nbsp; That is entirely up to you.&nbsp; In the same way, it is entirely up to ME how I want my computer to operate
 and with what,.&nbsp; It is not your call and is NOT Micro$ofts' call to tell me what I must have on my computer.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

    <title>Lack of apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> new_phone_user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lack of apps</h2>
                    <p>So I'm pretty new to using a Windows phone (just got it today), and I've noticed that while it looks and works pretty well, the lack of apps in the windows store is very, very concerning. &nbsp;Not only does it not have practical apps like Google Chrome, Gmail,
 or any other Google-related app on the phone, but also very popular apps like Pinterest, Tumblr, Yik Yak, Snapchat, Tinder, and countless others aren't in the store. &nbsp;Even Instagram is only in Beta mode, and apparently has been that way for the past 3 years.
 &nbsp;Multiple articles and blog posts have been made over the past few years complaining about the lack of apps in the store, and I know that this problem is either going to or is already hurting the sales on this line of phones. &nbsp;And no, the replacement apps
 that Windows has in its store isn't a viable replacement for these apps. &nbsp;To me they seem like cheap solutions to a glaring problem. &nbsp;These apps may work like the apps that they're trying to replace, but they don't have the same amount of users as the popular
 apps, and I have no clue if these apps are going to actually work or if they're going to mess up my phone somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a young consumer I can verify that the lack of apps will turn away the interest of any user that's under the age of 30, guaranteed, and possibly consumers over that age, as well. &nbsp;Like seriously, because of this app issue I can't picture this phone as
 being anything else but a temporary phone for when someone's phone dies or gets broken unexpectedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some of the online sources addressing the app issue:</p>
<p>http://www.extremetech.com/mobile/216823-windows-phone-apps-are-disappearing-from-the-platform-can-windows-10-turn-it-around</p>
<p>http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/23/9602350/microsoft-windows-phone-app-removal-windows-store</p>
<p>https://rcpmag.com/articles/2015/10/01/windows-phone.aspx</p>
<p>http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/features/item/21004_Exploring_the_app_gap_for_Wind.php</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post isn't really about fixing a specific problem that I have, but to address an issue that most Windows phone users experience when using their products. &nbsp;Hopefully this post will get enough attention that Microsoft may see it as worth their time (if
 they're not working on it already) to look at this issue and try to fix it. &nbsp;Not only would it be helpful to current Windows consumers, but also make the idea of a Windows phone be more attractive to younger audiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, here are some questions that I would like Microsoft to explain to me:</p>
<p>Why don't you have these really popular apps? &nbsp;Is it a financial or technical issue?</p>
<p>Was the idea of making replacement apps something that the company came up with or was it just coincidence?</p>
<p>Just how important is this issue, which has apparently been around for years, to the people who make these phones? &nbsp;Are there people working on this issue?</p>
<p>How many times has this issue been addressed to your company over the years? &nbsp;What's the average age of the consumers that use Microsoft phones (and is that a problem)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long post. &nbsp;If anyone else has anything else to say about this issue, please don't hesitate. &nbsp;Microsoft, please for the love of God do something about this. &nbsp;And also thanks for reading this if you made it this far.</p>

            I am&nbsp;well over&nbsp;30 and have been using Windows phones for years. I have never felt the desire to have more apps on any of my phones. I have also&nbsp;never bought an iphone or android, though I have come close on a couple of occasions. It is probably just a
 difference in the age of users, but I always find&nbsp;people's&nbsp;desperate dependence&nbsp;on phone apps puzzling.&nbsp;You must have known there was an&nbsp;'app deficit' regarding Windows phones as that is all most Windows Mobile detractors write about. I hope that the developers
 of the apps you are concerned about step up and create these apps for the device you are using. I&nbsp;don't like seeing a&nbsp;viable platform like&nbsp;W10M&nbsp;losing market share&nbsp;for&nbsp;reasons such as this.

            Microsoft cannot force any other company to create an app for W10M. There is nothing they can do about that. It's up to consumers to put the pressure on the app developers by requesting the apps directly from them.

            <p>new_phone_user, I have to agree with what you say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew in advance (from loads of adverse reviews) that there were very few apps being developed for Windows Phone. But the dearth still surprised me. I have only one practical app in a Windows Phone version - I've been attracted by many more apps, but there
 was no Windows Phone version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it may be time for Microsoft to bite the bullet, and license virtual&nbsp;Android technology within the Windows Phone OS.</p>

            That is a very lame answer. At least offer an avenue to accomplish the pressure.&nbsp; We are in a rewards economy and Microsoft is able to offer adequate incentives . I am totally and completely disappointed in the worthless windows app store and even embarrassed
 for Microsoft to offer such a paucity of resources. Why are they not listening to their customers. (By the way I threw my WIndows phone away because of its lack of apps.)

<h2>            pivot table fonts suddenly change color</h2>
                    I have a pivot table that part way through the font colors change from black to red. All the cells should be black. How do I get the cells to change from red back to black. I have tried using the selections available in the ribbon such as Fonts and Colors,
 but nothing works.

            There is no Unified &lt;Inbox&gt; option in Outlook (desktop) which is a very commonly rquested feature
<br />
<br />Each IMAP and Outlook.com/Exchange account will have it's own folder set (Inbox)
<br />
<br />POP3 accounts can all be configured to use a single PST file (single &lt;Inbox&gt;

            Multi-part answer to cover everything
<br />
<br />#1 - GMaill accounts can be &lt;either&gt; Imap or POP3. All depends on you configure the account on both sides. Server side (i.e. you have to set the account to be either POP3 or Imap) as well as desktop side
<br />
<br />Remember that POP3 only downloads the &lt;Inbox&gt; folder so as long as you're not using anything other then the Inbox on that account - you're going to be all good
<br />
<br />#2 - Ignoring the 3rd account not configured yet as POP3 - the way you configure your existing POP3 accounts is as follows
<br />
<br />Summary:
<br />
<br />You'll need to select one of the existing PST files, make sure it's the default data file for the profile
<br />
<br />Details
<br />
<br />a) go to Outlook --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; email tab
<br />b) highlight each of the POP3 accounts --&gt; go to bottom of that screen to the &lt;Change Folder&gt; button --&gt; take note of the folder/file name where the email for that account is being delivered
<br />c) switch to the Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab --&gt; pick the PST file you want to use for all of your accounts and make it the default data file for the profile. The default data file is also where your default contact/calendar folders are going to be stored
<br />d) exit Acct Set screen and go to main Outlook window
<br />e) copy all the data from the folders in the PST file you're NOT going to be using to the corresponding folders in the one you've chosen to be used for all your accounts
<br />f) &lt;IF&gt; by any chance, your IMAP .ost data file was set as the default for the profile and the IMAP folder tree contains contact/calendar folders (will have the words "This computer only" in the folder name), be sure to copy the items from those folders as well since you will lose everything if you don't when you delete the IMAP account to set it up as a POP3 account. Your email data will be fine, no need to copy anything from the &lt;Inbox&gt; BUT if you have other email folders, you'll need to copy those to the PST file as well
<br />
<br />g) When all the above is done and you're satisfied everything has been copied correctly, go to Account Settings again, remove the IMAP account and add it back as a POP3 account just like you did for the Yahoo accounts with 1 exception
<br />
<br />&lt;make absolutely sure&gt; that during the manual set up process you select the option to use an existing PST file and select the one you decided on to be your main file
<br />
<br />*** above assumes you've gone into Gmail and set the Imap account to be POP3
<br />
<br />h) go to Acct Settings --&gt; Data Files tab and remove the PST file you are no longer using
<br />
<br />That in a nutshell will give you a Unified &lt;Inbox&gt; for all your POP3 accounts

            Why don't you create rules? You could forward the email from the others two account to one account. Checking the option keep a copy on the server. <br /><br />That way you can have all of them in one, also could create then a folder and another inbox rule to send the incoming emails to specific folders.

    <title>Switch Office 365 to Offline Mode while connected to the internet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Switch Office 365 to Offline Mode while connected to the internet</h2>
                    I'm just wondering how I can switch my Office 365 Small Business Premium to Offline Mode. (Why don't you have this version as an option in the topic list?)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's why...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do consulting work and while on site I use my laptop on a corporate wi-fi connection that blocks connections to skydrive and many other related services but allows basic internet connections for browsing etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This means I frequently have trouble opening and saving Office documents while on this connection. I can't even open documents that in the SkyDrive folder on my hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I switch to airplane mode (or just disconnect from the wi-fi) I can open and save documents locally and continue to work on them. This is not satisfactory as I need the connection for just about everything else I do.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, can I tell Office 365 to work in offline mode even while I'm connected to the internet?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please don't tell me to do something with my proxy settings or unblock skydrive from the corporate proxy. Like I said I consult for this company, I don't work for them let alone determine their internet policies.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Interestingly they do allow Google Docs so that remains an option...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks for reading.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would need more information to help you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Please elaborate 'I frequently have trouble opening and saving Office documents while on this connection'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Are you using Office on Demand ? And what is the exact error message you receive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the replay. I'm not using Office on Demand, not even sure what that is. I'm using Office 365 Small Business Premium and I'm using the installed applications not the web versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Trouble Opening and Saving&nbsp;Documents...</p>
<p>When I try to open a file from the recent files list in Excel or Word (the others too I'm sure but I don't use them as much) I can see its trying to open it from an internet location (d.docs.live.net) instead of the local copy on my laptop. I'll get an error
 saying Sorry, we couldn't open 'https://username-my.sharepoint.com/.....'. I&nbsp;even get this error when I try to open the file from the SkyDrive directory using Windows Explorer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I put the laptop into flight mode (or just drop the Wi-Fi connection) it will open the file from the local directory. That's primarily why I want to know if/how I can put Office 365 into offline mode even if a Wi-Fi connection is present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the problem is that its in Read Only and it tells me if I want to save changes I need to give it a new file name. Shouldn't it just save the changes locally and re-sync with Skydrive when a Internet Connection is available?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also when I try to&nbsp;save new documents to the local SkyDrive folders so they can be synced as soon as a connection is available. I get an error saying 'There has been a network or file permission error. The network connection may be lost. (<a href="http://username-my.sharepoint.com/perso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://username-my.sharepoint.com/perso</a>).
 OK' Clicking OK on that error pops open the Save As dialog again but the crazy thing is the file has actually been saved as intended in the SkyDrive folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trying to Save a document that was created offline&nbsp;I'll also sometimes get 'Word cannot complete the save due to a file permission error. (This is a new document created in fil...). No doubt all would be made clear if I could read what came next but
 there is no way to expand the error box to see the rest of the message. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SkyDrive Pro&nbsp;icon in the&nbsp;system tray will also be telling me the my credentials are needed&nbsp;to sync the library. This is not correct. The credentials are fine its just the proxy is blocking the connection to the destination.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is enough information for you be able to tell me if I can manually put Office 365 into offline mode. If the answers no just say so, if the answer is yes please tell me how.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Autofilter, then CUT and PASTE only filtered results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allenwhitelock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autofilter, then CUT and PASTE only filtered results</h2>
                    <p>I need to filter a worksheet on column G, displaying rows where G = 2.&nbsp; AUTOFILTER works fine.&nbsp; I then need to CUT (not COPY) the displayed data to worksheet 2 in same workbook.&nbsp; CUT and PASTE commands are working fine.&nbsp; My problem is defining the range
 for the CUT and the PASTE.&nbsp; I need to CUT only the displayed data and i need the PASTE to start in A2 on worksheet 2.&nbsp; Here is the code I have so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Objworksheet1.Rows(1).copy objworksheet2.Rows(1)<br />
set objrange1 = objworksheet1.usedrange<br />
set objrange2 = objexcel.range("G1")<br />
objRange1.Sort objRange2, 1, , , , , , 1 <br />
objworksheet1.cells(1,30).autofilter 7,"2"<br />
set objrange1 = objworksheet1.usedrange<br />
objrange1.cut<br />
Set objWorksheet1 = objWorkbook.Worksheets(2)<br />
objWorksheet1.Activate<br />
Set objrange1 = Objworksheet1.range("a2")<br />
Objworksheet1.paste(objrange1)<br />

            <p>It is easy enough to copy only the visible rows after using autofilter, however I'm not sure you can 'Cut' non-contiguous rows. Even on a blank workbook if you select row 2 and row 5 and select 'cut' you will get an error.</p>
<p>To 'Copy' only the visible rows we use special cells -</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.UsedRange.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).Copy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to either copy the values you want to sheet 2, &nbsp;then go back to sheet 1 and delete the rows you copied</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Apply 'Sort' so that the rows you cut to sheet two are contiguous, then you should be able to 'cut' to sheet 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it isn't really necessary to use autofilter, you could also loop through each row and cut&nbsp; each row that fits your criteria to be pasted to sheet two.</p>

    <title>Problem adding new phone to PC Suite - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pkirkaas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem adding new phone to PC Suite</h2>
                    
<p>Hi;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have PC Suite 7.1.18 installed on my XP sp2 pc, and configured to my new 6220-classic.&nbsp; I use the USB cable connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to add my wife's new 3110 classic, but when I plug it in via the USB and try to click on settings/add new phone, I get the "Welcome to new connection wizard" dialog.&nbsp; This dialog just re-installs the USB driver, tells me I am now connected, but
 it still shows only my 6220 profile.&nbsp; It doesn't add the other phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone else have this problem?&nbsp; Am I dong something wrong; is there any solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
