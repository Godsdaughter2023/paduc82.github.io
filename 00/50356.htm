<h2>            gpedit</h2>
                    When my laptop crashed, I lost my copy of gpedit.msc&nbsp; which I cannot get anywhere.&nbsp; I lost the file when my laptop (Win 10, 64 bit) installed my backup but not the file.&nbsp; All I get is spammed when I look for it even from Microsoft.&nbsp; So I am including this
 on every forum and website hoping some one can help.&nbsp; It's not like I want the CIA's list of uncover agents, just a damn file.

            Thanks. I did come across that site and had purchased a charger online but even though it said it was compatible it didn't work. The items on that site are US based and I couldn't find them in UK. Will try looking a bit more. I wondered if anyone has found
 one that did before I try more.

            Do you mean the message says this:<br />
<br />
Can't Collect Information<br />
Cannot access the Windows Management Instrumentation software.&nbsp; Windows Management files may be moved or missing.<br />
<br />
<br />
When running msinfo32 you see:<br />
<br />
Can't Collect Information<br />
Cannot access the Windows Management Instrumentation software.&nbsp; Windows Management files may be moved or missing.<br />
<br />
Either the Windows Management Instrumentation Service is not running and/or your Windows Management Instrumentation information files are missing or corrupted. It is easy to rebuild the WMI information files and replace any corrupted or suspicious files.<br />
<br />
To resolve your issue, stop the Windows Management Instrumentation service, rename the suspicious or afflicted WMI folder, the restart your system.&nbsp; When the system restarts, the WMI service will start automatically and rebuild the WMI folder and it's contents
 automatically.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
services.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Services applet.<br />
<br />
Locate the Windows Management Instrumentation Service.&nbsp; If the Status column says the WMI Service is Started (running), right click the WMI Service and choose to Stop The WMI Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not try msinfo32 again or the Service will start up again (you don't
 want that right now).<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to stop the Security Center and Windows Firewall Services (with those services stopped your system is vulnerable to attack from the Internet so do not get on the Internet again until you restart your system).<br />
<br />
Now would be a good time to also check the Properties of the WMI Service to be sure the Startup type is set to Automatic so the WMI Service will start automatically the next time the system is rebooted.&nbsp; Make any adjustments needed so the Service Startup type
 is set to Automatic (don't restart it yet though).<br />
<br />
Using Explorer, navigate to the following folder (assuming your boot drive is C):<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\Wbem\<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Locate and then rename the "Repository" folder to something you can remember, such as:<br />
<br />
Repository.old<br />
<br />
Restart the computer and then check to be sure that the WMI service has restarted automatically and that a new Repository folder has been created to replace the one that was renamed.&nbsp; It may take some time to completely rebuild the Repository folder (several
 seconds or minutes) so wait for it to complete.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
After rebooting, you will notice the wmiprvse.exe Service running in Task Manager and it will keep running until it finishes rebuilding the Repository (this could take a little while).
<br />
<br />
This rebuilding process could take several minutes depending on your system but eventually the wmiprvse.exe Service will complete and disappear from Task Manager.<br />
<br />
If you then look in the Event Viewer Application log, there may be some error messages like this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WinMgmt<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br />
Description:<br />
Failed to load MOF C:\WINDOWS\MICROSOFT.NET\FRAMEWORK\V4.0.30319\MOF\SERVICEMODEL.MOF while recovering repository file.<br />
<br />
This is normal because when the system restarts, the wmiprvse.exe process must rebuild those parts of the repository as well. It is a sequencing error as indicated below. You should not see these errors again after the system has been rebooted and catches up
 with itself and finishes rebuilding the WMI Repository.<br />
<br />
Explanations for the errors seen in the Event Viewer Application log while the WMI repository is rebuilt:<br />
<br />
Explanation<br />
Windows Management Instrumentation might have tried to compile (mofcomp) a .mof file marked for autorecover, but the compilation failed. This failure is probably caused by a sequencing issue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
User Action<br />
To correct the problem, try to compile the .mof file again. If this does not correct the problem, contact the support provider for the program in question.<br />
<br />
You should not have to do anything about these error messages and should not see them again after XP has finished rebuilding the WMI Repository.<br />
<br />
I cannot say how long this rebuilding will take, maybe 10-15 minutes until it settles down completely.<br />

            Hi Lukey,
<br />
<br />HEVC (H265) compatibility has nothing to do with the specifications of your hardware - though you do have a nice system
<br />
<br />HEVC (H265) compatibility is simply a codec that you can install to enable you to play that type of video. If your Windows 10 is up to date, then you will be able to play HEVC video with no problems . ..

                    <p>Using Windows 7 64-bit. When other computers see my computer on a wireless network, they see an (goofy) ID that was set by the custom builder. I have changed the "computer name", "computer description", "workgroup name", "network name", etc.. Nothing worked.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer ID seen on the network remains the same as was set by the manufacturer. I want to know how to change it, how do I do that????&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is your computer on domain network?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the make and model of router?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to Change the Name of a Wireless Network</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you originally set up your wireless network, you likely gave it a name. If you didn't, it probably defaulted to the brand name of your wireless router. You don't have to be
 stuck with the name you originally gave it or the default name. You can change the name of a wireless network quite easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Look in your router's instruction manual to find its internal IP address. The IP address is a series of numbers, broken up by periods. For example, a common IP address is 192.168.0.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open an Internet browser window, such as Firefox or Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type the router's IP address into the address bar and click, "Enter." This will open a web page with your router's control panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Enter your user information if required. The username will often default to "Admin" and then enter the personal password you set up when you originally created your wireless network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Access the "Wireless" link on the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Enter your new wireless network name in the field labeled "Wireless Network Name." This field is also commonly labeled as "SSID" which stands for "Service Set Identifier." Your new wireless network name will
 be saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Change the default SSID</b></p>
<p>Routers and access points use a wireless network name known as a service set identifier (SSID). Most manufacturers use the same SSID for all of their routers and access points.
 We recommend that you change the default SSID to keep your wireless network from overlapping with other wireless networks that might be using the default SSID. It makes it easier for you to identify which wireless network is yours, if there's more than one
 nearby, because the SSID is typically shown in the list of available networks. Check the information that came with your device for instructions about how to change the default SSID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>There is no domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The network SSID is not the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a modem on the wireless network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are/were 3 computers on the "Home" network. That network is/was working just fine. All computers on the network have been ID'd correctly, as I had previously specified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just added a new PC with Windows 7 to this network. The custom builder of this PC had given the PC a computer name of the "account#". That "account#" continues to be displayed as the ID of the PC, on the network. All the other computers' displayed IDs
 are correct/unchanged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have changed the "computer ID", "computer name", "workgroup name", etc., every ID that I can find, to a meaningful ID on the new PC running Windows 7. But, the ID of this PC remains the "account#" when identified on the network. I have contacted the "builder",
 they told me to do what I have already done, ie, change the "computer ID", which I had already done, but did it again, just in case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your response, Lloyd</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow these steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong>1. Try disconnecting from the network (unplug cable or disconnect from wireless)<br />
2. Reboot the computer and log on with a local user account with admin rights.<br />
Does that change anything; do the options seem to be ok when you do this?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2</strong>: <br />
If not check if the Network ID option is disabled in ‘Safe Mode with Networking’.<br />
Below are the steps which talks about how to get into ‘Safe Mode with Networking’:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Safe Mode with Networking’ and press Enter.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should then be at the Welcome Screen.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.<br />
Access the below link to know more about ‘Safe Mode with Networking’:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3:<br />
</strong>You may also run Network Troubleshooter that would help us diagnose the issue better.<br />
Access the below link for detailed information on Network Troubleshooter:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 4:<br />
</strong>If the issue still persists, try deleting and recreating connections, reconfigure the Network connection and check for the issue.</div>
<div>Hope this helps.<br />

<p>So. Umm... What exactly is this? I understand that you're trying to recreate the cars behavior in the game, but the videos look just like a regular lap around the track. I'm particularly interested in a Group B rally car but by watching the video it feels
 like just a normal car. Maybe show some telemetry or at least explain what is so ideal about these setups.</p>

<p>VIPER THE LOUD: &nbsp;Try my Ford Sierra tune in A class! &nbsp;I gave it strong grip and acceleration but my version of a rally suspension. :P &nbsp;It's got weak springs but rally stiff dampers. &nbsp;It doesn't float or bounce, but you can tell it's really different. &nbsp;Very

<p>I'm not looking for suspension tunes but more of something that has massive power output focused towards acceleration. One of my little goals is to drift and power slide all the way through Rally di Positano with a minimal amount of "normal" driving.</p>

<p>Ok that's not it then... &nbsp;It has very good acceleration and handling, but is not geared towards drifting. It IS geared towards getting around a bumpy road course as fast as possible however...

<p>What kind of times have you had with these builds and set ups?</p>
<p>I understand tuning is a personal preference thing but that BMW set up and build seemed a little odd to me</p>
<p>1. You added an intercooler - These just add&nbsp;far to much weight and are pretty much pointless</p>
<p>2. You added a race tranny - Again why,&nbsp;would the sport one not suffice?</p>
<p>3. The diff set up looked bizarre to me - low accel setting but almost 100% for decel</p>
<p>There were a few other things as well like no forza spoilers being added, i know they're not essential but on&nbsp;most of the tracks you need them to be competative.</p>

<p>The car has the necessary improvements to get the actual weight, the actual equipment, the actual wheel size, the power of real size, real displacement .... And this tuning to have the real maximum speed, the typical behavior of car cloning, to do real-time
 car.</p>
<p>No time to make unreal, unreal in cars, making 25s times. Unless the real car. Neither are thought to be the number one Xbox LIVE.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t use numpad alt codes with usb keypad. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chaiguy1337  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t use numpad alt codes with usb keypad.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I just purchased a Microsoft Arc Keyboard for use with my Vista system. As I am a programmer and the keyboard is lacking a numpad (which I use frequently for alt-code character entry), I purchased a separate USB keypad (from Targus--model AKP10CA) primarily
 to enter alt character codes.</p>
<p>To my dismay, the alt codes don't work! I checked with a keystroke recorder the keycodes the keypad is sending, and they are the correct numpad keystrokes. So my question is why aren't these working with my Microsoft Arc Keyboard's alt key, and what can
 I do about it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Well, at least we've ruled out the keyboard as the problem - I didn't really think it was but it was worth checking.</p>
<p>I'm not sure (I don't use keyboard shortcuts) but did you try turning on the NumLock on your keyboard and using the numbers listed on the various keyboard keys that are used instead of a numpad when you don't have one available?&nbsp; I don't mean the numbers
 at the top (I know they won't work) but if you set the keyboard so certain keys operate like a numpad, then perhpas shortcuts using those keys when the NunLock is activated will work as expected.&nbsp; Still turning on an off the NumLock sort of defeats the purpose
 of making it shorter (but it may work entirely from the keyboard which was you question).</p>
<p>I do not believe it is possible to get this to work because the keyboard and the USB numpad are separate devices and don't talk to one another - neither can "see" what is happening on the other device and so there's no way to get them to work in oncert.&nbsp;
 The system doesn't recognize that both entries are actually supposed to be one action and I know of no way to tell the system how to do that if it is possible at all (even with a registry modification).&nbsp; I have no idea where to begin even comiing up with a
 workaround.&nbsp; I believe you just need to live with the fact that you can't use the devices together to issue commands.&nbsp; Perhaps you can change some of the more frequently used shortcuts involving the numpad to a different shortcut requiring only the keyboard
 - the shortcuts can be re-programmed (and if you can't re-program a current shortccut you ccan always create a new shortcut using only the keyboard that does the same funtion).</p>
<p>I'm sorry there's no real solution to your problem, but that's the way Vista works and we just have to live with it as best we can.</p>
<p>Good luck and best wishes!</p>

<p>Are you seeing a timeout error message - code 0x800CCC19? Or some other one? There is probably a problem with authenticating you to the server. Google make it a bit difficult for users of mail clients like Windows Live Mail that don't happen to support Google's
 preferred authentication method. Yahoo play the same trick.</p>

            Hello Rachel, hope this message finds you well. My name is Steve and I'm an Independent advisor.
<br />
<br />To enable 5.1 Surrounding to work with Miracast, you have to install Intel WiDi drivers. Unfortunately Intel has discontinued development for Intel Wireless Display (Intel WiDi) and Intel Pro Wireless Display (Intel:registered: Pro WiDi) applications. The Miracast standard is supported in Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 OS. The only option you have is to use 5.1 Surrounding via the HDMI cable.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>start up repair</strong> and check if you are able to boot into normal mode.</p>
<p>To perform Start up repair, restart your computer and tap the
<strong>F8</strong> key as the computer is booting to open the <strong>Advanced Boot menu</strong> option.</p>
<p>From the list
<b>click start up repair</b>.</p>

<h2>            y&#8734;y&#8734; showing up on boot in vista</h2>
                    hi there i do some computers repairs, but i'm stuck on the following error - y∞y∞.<br />
i have no install disks.<br />
can't access recovery console.<br />
i have no system restore point to work with, and can't access it anyway.<br />
i've tried to fix it with many different programs so far.<br />
the hard drive is good.<br />
i'm pretty sure the problem is with the mbr.<br />
need to get access to the recovery consoel so i can try and fix it.<br />
and may need to change the drive letter.<br />
<br />
i'm also thinkin that the problem mite be with the volume name. cos i changed the volume name some time before hand with easeus partition manger.<br />
so i beleive that the system is confused some how.<br />
and it just needs to be up dated.<br />
<br />
if i had a program like EasyBCD 1.7.2 that would boot up instead of install. i could prob fix it.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Above link shows what the process looks like, and a how-to, as it loads to the Repair Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I can still see the list of messages in the vertical bar to the left of the screen. However, the main section of the screen (where you read/type/read messages) is completely blank. I can't do any form of messaging in desktop. It works fine n my work PC,
 I only have this issue on my home laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like a settings issue but I can't figure out what it is. Logged out. Re-booted etc. All to no avail.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Disables touchpad when I unplug my laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clintlancaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Disables touchpad when I unplug my laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have a Cyberpower PC.&nbsp; The touchpad was fully functional on Windows 7, and works fine when the laptop is plugged in.&nbsp; When I unplug the laptop, the mouse does not move.&nbsp; I've tried using the function keys to enable and disable the touchpad, to no avail.&nbsp;
 To compound the strangeness of the issue, at the log in screen, or at the signing off screen, the touchpad is fully functional.&nbsp; However, when I'm in an unlocked Windows 10 desktop environment and my laptop is unplugged, I have no touchpad use.&nbsp; I can plug
 in a mouse, and it works fine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I look at the device manager while I unplug the device, nothing happens.&nbsp; Both devices stay enabled.&nbsp; I'm assuming there some kind of issue in the power saving settings that is disabling the touchpad, but I'm unsure how to disable those settings.</p>

            <p>Well, I went back to 7 for a few months, and came back to 10, and the problem still happens.&nbsp; Here's how you can fix it.</p>
<p>Delete anything elan.</p>
<p>Delete the driver and software, and let windows load defaults.&nbsp; I don't get some of the scrolling features, but I can live without those, I need my laptop to work on batteries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very helpful support desk technician named Kathleen helped me out for about 3 hours on this.&nbsp; We finally figured it out.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business - Conversations History Questions</h2>
                    
<p>We are new to Office365 and have deployed SFB. We have been using the Skype for Windows/Mac free client for years. Everyone is struggling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Skype conversations seem to not be persistent. If I close SFB, then restart SFB, all of my conversations are gone. However, if I click on Conversations ICON there seems to be a history here. Then if I click on a user and select the IM icon, there they
 are. This is very confusing to people who have been using normal Skype.</p>
<p>a. Is there a way to lock conversations such that you always are using a "single" conversation like normal Skype? This would keep a running history by user for all conversations.</p>
<p>b. Is this by design? Users are going to continue to start new conversations with the same user and now there will be several conversations in the history.</p>

<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>Here is the answer to your questions:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;Is there a way to lock conversations such that you always are using a "single" conversation like normal Skype? This would keep a running history by user for all conversations.</p>
<p>&gt;It’s not feasible to lock conversations for using a single conversation with the user in Skype for Business.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;Is this by design? Users are going to continue to start new conversations with the same user and now there will be several conversations in the history.</p>
<p>&gt;Yes, this is by design.</p>

    <title>For users suffering with a faulty screen autorotate orientation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelsey tidwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            For users suffering with a faulty screen autorotate orientation problem...please read&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're reading this, then you're probably going through what I did with my Windows 10 2-in-1, a Cube iWork10 Pro. Excellent machine with the internals of a Surface at WAY lower prices...and USB-C, but since it's an imported unit it can be hard to find
 fixes and help for it. But if you're the owner of ANY 2-in-1 I have some good information for you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a writer, and even though the iWork10 has a very good little keyboard, I wanted to detach the display to orient it in a tall book-page-like position for writing. You can't do that with the factory keyboard, of course, because the keyboard HAS to be attached
 in order to work. So I purchased a Black Friday special deal on a "gaming" USB keyboard with the Brown Cherry-type switches. For those who care, the Brown type are the quiet ones...I like to write after everyone here at home is in the bed. Being a gaming keyboard,
 it's metal and has some heft to it which I like because it's much more stable than a plastic keyboard.<br />
</p>
<p>My trouble arose when I separated my laptop to test out my new setup and the screen rotated, but was upside down whether I placed it in landscape position or vertical. My immediate suspicions:</p>
<ol>
<li>A problem with the Bosch Accelerometer driver on my 2-in-1. I had one other different issue soon after purchasing that went back to this driver.</li><li>The recent (within the past few days) cumulative Windows update.</li><li>The activation two days ago of the voice control aspect of Windows.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The last two suspicions aren't based on any evidence other than that they are the only changes I've made to the laptop, and everybody and their brother is having problems with the Windows 10 updates lately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did a system restore to the pre-update setup. That would have also taken care of the voice stuff because I activated that AFTER the Win 10 update. No improvement. That left the driver as the only possibility I could think of, so I went searching online
 for information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read unknown numbers of related online posts, most of which on this Microsoft site consisted mostly of very frustrated users yelling at the bots that Microsoft unleashes like flying monkeys on us with their stupid canned responses. You can tell the responses
 are not based on any reading of the original post by a human at all. So frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were also a few sites where people had good luck doing registry edits. That's not out of the realm of do-ability for me, but it's not exactly as much fun as eating doughnuts either, so I figured I'd leave that as a last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I found a site called TechTablets.com, and that's where I got some real knowledgeable help and my answer. There's a lady (I surmise by the name of 'Laura') on there who did a step-by-step that fixed things for me. I will supply a link here, but NOTE:
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>IT ONLY WORKS FOR THE CUBE IWORK10 PRO</strong></span> AS FAR AS I KNOW. I figure this particular page will be useless for everybody else, but I'm providing it AS AN EXAMPLE of what to look for on the TechTablets
 site for YOUR PARTICULAR DEVICE. They have coverage of many types of 2-in-1's and other machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AGAIN: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DO NOT</strong></span> PERFORM THE OPERATIONS ON THIS LINK ON YOUR MACHINE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CUBE IWORK 10 PRO. LOOK FOR
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>YOUR </strong></span>BRAND OF DEVICE ON THE SITE FOR APPROPRIATE INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://techtablets.com/forum/topic/fixing-the-infamous-bosch-accelerometer-yellow-triangle/</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempted to follow the directions, I ran into a situation where I could not delete files because of permissions. I've lost the link to the site that explained how to change the permissions, so I'm afraid I'll have to leave you to your own resources
 there. But in the end, once I did as Laura instructed and reinstalled the accelerometer driver and rebooted, everything WORKS CORRECTLY NOW! Yay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't Windows...it was the driver.</p>
<p>
