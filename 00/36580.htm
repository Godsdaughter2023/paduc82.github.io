<h2>            Windows Wireless Desktop 3000 2.4 ghz Wireless Transceiver Replacement</h2>
                    Hello, I currently own a Wireless Desktop 3000. It works great, besides the fact that the wireless transceiver has failed and no longer functions. The mouse and keyboard function properly, and I have tried it on other PC's and it doesn't&nbsp; want to connect
 to it. I was wondering if there was a way to replace it, or if I would have to buy a completely new desktop. Thank you for your help.

<p>According to this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://the-gadgeteer.com/2009/06/17/microsoft-wireless-desktop-3000-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://the-gadgeteer.com/2009/06/17/microsoft-wireless-desktop-3000-review/</a></p>
<p>and other similar ones, it seems the transceiver and keyboard/mouse are sold as a "mated pair" so there are no replacement dongles available, nor is there a way to program it for a 3rd party one or MS replacement.</p>
<p>Another person mentioned that they bought a new wireless mouse, hoping to get that one to work with the existing dongle for the keyboard, but found no way to program either one to work with the other's dongle, so ended up with both dongles inserted, thereby
 taking up 2 USB slots.</p>
<p>Looks like you're out of luck, sad to say.</p>

            Hi Carol09876,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!<br />
<br />
<strong>Snipping Tool is a feature to capture a screen shot, or snip, of any object on your screen, and then annotate, save, or share the image.</strong>
<br />
<br />
You will not find this feature if you’re using<strong> Windows Vista Home Basic</strong> on your computer.<br />
<br />
If you’re using the later versions of Windows Vista Home Basic, then you’ll find this feature.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click on Start&gt;&gt; Choose All Programs.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click on Accessories and there you’ll find Snipping Tool.<br />
<br />
If you’re not able to find it under Accessories, then the feature might be turned off.<br />
<br />
To Turn on Snipping Tool, follow the steps below.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Go to Control Panel and open Program and Features<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the task pane on the left, click Turn Windows features on or off. If necessary, click Continue when prompted by User Account Control.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Scroll through the list of features, check the box next to Tablet PC Optional Components, and click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Turning on these features gives you not only the Snipping Tool, but also the Tablet PC Input Panel, Windows Journal, and other stylus-related features.<br />
<br />
Link below talks about on<strong> How to Use Snipping Tool to capture screen shots</strong>
<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Use-Snipping-Tool-to-capture-screen-shots

Hope this information is helpful.<br />

<h2>            Hardware and Devices troubleshoot problems&#58; stating Windows Update configured to never install drivers.</h2>
                    <p>Few months ago i decided to go ahead and do some troubleshooting to see if there were any errors need fixing on my computer. In Hardware and Devices my computer found two errors which seem to make no sense and whatever i do to try and fix it, the problem
 is still there and i don't know what to do. I posted something like this few weeks after it happening but didn't get much help due to them no longer replying for some reason.</p>
<p>- Anyway the first error is apparently, i need to restart my computer to finish installing drivers, i have restarted my computer many times and the problem still gets picked up by the troubleshooter, the second error which gets picked up is that apparently,
 i have windows update to never install drivers, where it quite clearly is ticked to install the drivers. Look at the images below to help understand.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have uninstalled the&nbsp;driver. Once you restart the system, Windows will automatically detect&nbsp;drivers and install them&nbsp;on your system<em>.&nbsp;</em>You don't need to find them and install them manually, kindly make sure that you are connected to the
 internet and check for Windows&nbsp;Updates. It is always recommended to keep all the latest Windows Updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check for Updates follow the steps:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key </strong>and click on <strong>
Settings &gt; Update&nbsp;&amp; Security&nbsp;&gt;Windows Updates &gt; Check for Updates. </strong>If updates are pending, kindly install them.</span></p>

 &nbsp;Even when you uninstall it and select the box to throw the driver away, it still gives you the same result. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            System Image to 1 disk, Multiple computers, Same Computer Names</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have a question&nbsp;regarding the functionality of&nbsp;Backup and Restore provided in Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am backing up 2 PCs with the same Computer Name to 1 USB disk. I want to know if it is safe to rely on System Images made in this configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my limited testing it has ended up with the WindowsImageBackup folder being wiped from the last backup and being recreated when I swap the disk between PCs.</p>
<p>The (.zip)&nbsp;file-based backup seems to be unaffected by the machines having the same name.</p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed this?</p>

            <p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>It has to do with how the two functions are handled. "Zip" refers to a group of files, a subtype of Windows Explorer, its hardwired to 'protect-files-of-a-given-type' so it renames those files -(1), -(2), etc. ; whereas WindowsImageBackup is a folder - in
 essence a file -&nbsp;&nbsp;and single files&nbsp;are hard-wired to 'update-unless-protected'. Its the nature of the beast.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your files "protection", I'd at least designate at least 1 computer with a unique identifier, like a "0".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>When you restore from an image you are shown this dialog box when the system has analysed the contents of the WindowsImageBackup folder.&nbsp; Note that the PC concerned is identified &amp; that you can also select a different image [it has to be in the WindowsImageBackup
 folder though].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fptsvaa.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pMAYrRlz4ZOPRzWzOPCbb9n0irskwSGr0zvO9vM0-GOEWW4ysSc1wmVQK41rKbPEyT3ZU_ybTriH5wS5_Gfwq6liZBSKNAXYe%2f026.JPG%3fpsid%3d1" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>On the face of it, therefore, Windows can handle multiple system's being imaged within that same folder.&nbsp; You'd just have to look through all the images you can select to find the one that is needed.&nbsp; This might give you sufficient grounds for feeling
 that&nbsp;a thorough test&nbsp;was worthwhile.&nbsp; I have never seen a report of anybody else having&nbsp;done this so I quite understand that you'd want to do several tests before deciding to rely on this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span><em>System images are not completely reliable but I have only had one that has failed to restore during the eighteen months I have been making weekly images [I rely on them to get back to where I started if I'm recklessly experimenting with the system].</em></span></p>
<p><span>- - - -</span></p>
<span>
<p>As a workaround though [which is what I do]:</p>
<p>If you want to manage the images for complete confidence then you&nbsp;can manually move the whole of the WindowsImageBackup folder into a different folder to have multiple independent images on the same drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a folder called Dell7Images that has subfolders for each image so before making yesterday's image I moved last week's WindowsImageBackup folder into H:\Dell7Images\20130519 and it sits there next to H:\Dell7Images\20130512 which has the WindowsImageBackup
 folder from the week before.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If I then want to restore an image, I have to move the whole of the current H:\WindowsImageBackup folder out of the way&nbsp;into H:\Dell7Images\20130526 and then move the one I want to restore&nbsp;from, say, H:\Dell7Images\20130519 back into H:\WindowsImageBackup
 because it is only in that location [off the root folder of any drive]&nbsp;that Windows can work with the image for restoration [which is why the latest one sits in that position for a week where it is ready for action].</p>
<p>In your case, you'd have Computer1\20130526, Computer1\20130526 and so on.</p>

                    <div>I've cracked my Retail XP Pro Sp1 UPGRADE disk which I bought years ago to to upgrade an OEM (Dell) XP Home Sp1 computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer was fully up-to-date with Sp3, but the the hard drive with the OS on it died suddenly and I need to reinstall XP in order to use some applications which I had custom-written and can't afford to to migrate to a newer OS right now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already reinstalled the Dell OEM XP Sp1 Home edition so just need a Retail Upgrade ISO or CD since I still have my Retail CD Key.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also...do I need to get another Sp1 Upgrade disk or will the a newer version (Sp1a/Sp2/Sp2b/Sp3) work with my Sp1 CD Key?</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I might not be of much help here but I can suggest the following...</p>
<p>First of all, ask yourself do you really need XP Pro? Can you get by with Home until being able to afford a Win7 PC?</p>
<p>Secondly, if upgrade CDs behave the same as oem CDs, the SP level is not relevant, you should be able to use your XP Pro upgrade code (which I assume you still have) with any XP Pro Upgrade CD regardless of SP level.</p>
<p>Finally, whatever your eventual version, if it is pre-SP3 you will need to get it to SP3 by the stand alone installers...</p>
<p>If its pre-SP2, download SP2 from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28</a></p>
<p>Then you can install SP3 - download from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24</a></p>

<h2>            Transfering Xbox 360 Avatar Contents to the Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm about to buy new stuffs for my XBL Avatar.</p>
<p>Already pre-ordered my Xbox One =) *Throws Confetti*</p>

<p>I don't know if I should wait until the Xbox One comes out or shall I buy it now on my Xbox 360.</p>
<p>The only problem is that I do not know if all my avatar contents are going to get transfered to the Xbox One if i would have had use the same XBL profile....</p>
<p>Tried to ask this question to the german support but they referred me to this forum.</p>

<p>So by any chance&nbsp;can some of the officials answer me this simple question?</p>
<p>I am not going to buy anything without knowing this answer.</p>
<p>Just don't wanna throw away all my money for nothing on the Xbox One.</p>

<p>Can you guys please answer me? Would it be possible to use the purchased avatar contents from the x360 on the xbox one?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to say that you have made a great choice by pre-ordering the Xbox One - it looks like it is going to be amazing :) Secondly, Microsoft have confirmed that everything on your profile on your Xbox 360 will be transferred over to the Xbox
 One so you should not have to worry about purchasing the avatar items.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Okay thx for answering Finn500.</p>
<p>Hope my english doesn't suck but I don't trust non-officials.</p>
<p>I am expecting an answer from an official like the support promised me.</p>
<p>I am not talking about some cheap 0,80 bucks worth walmart contents,</p>
<p>im talking about luxury avatar contents costing me a bunch of notes.</p>
<p>So no offensive to you buddy, appreciated your answer but can any Xbox Official answer to my question?</p>
<p>The Support told me that an official would answer me in this forum section so yea thx for reading &amp; trying to helping anyways Finn :)</p>

<p>Hello Taylan15! </p>
<p>Your Gamertag, Gamerscore, and Items will transfer over. Like Finn500 had Brought up, IGN covered this in the Link above Which was Confirmed by Microsoft. As for getting it confirmed by an Official you can try to directly contact them by Emailing the Support
 team to get your answers. But....Like Me Finn500 Is an Xbox Live Community Ambassador. We are supposed to browse the forums Help people out and &nbsp;give them Answers to the best of our ability. I hope this helps you.</p>
<p>The little icon across from Finn500 and I's Level on the bottom of our Forum tag Means that we are Xbox Community Ambassadors So if you notice more of your posts getting Answered or replied from people with these tags its not just random people trying to
 mess with you, Microsoft trusts and asks us to be as beneficial to the community as possible. (:</p>

<p>Hi Taylan15, hopefully an official support agent will be along soon to shed some light onto your question. Personally I suspect that the Avatar system would work exactly as it does right now due to the fact that your profile will be cross compatible on both
 the 360 and Xbox One, of course that's just my view. Whether your current and future purchases of &nbsp;Avatar items on your 360 will be able to be downloaded to your Xbox One I don't know but I'm sure that an official support agent can clarify things.</p>

We have confirmed that Live accounts, gamerscore, and avatars will transfer with you to the Xbox One.<br />
<br />
Avatar <strong>ITEMS</strong> are still unconfirmed. We don't have any further information on that at this time.<br />

Hello My PC was slowing down so I decided to reset my computer. After the reset is not working properly.&nbsp;</p>

When I turn on the computer everything works just fine but after a minute the internet goes away and my computer starts going slow, the computer won't connect to the internet anymore and I cannot open settings, control panel, or anything related.</p>

            Hi,Miguel
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall entirely. You won't even need an activation number or any proof of purchase, either. Just make sure you have more than 4GB of space available, as that's how much space the file you'll download takes up. Here's how to reinstall Windows 10:

<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi Miguel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you want to save time I'd follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The reason I suggest this first is that no one who has followed closely the install in the above link has ever come back with subsequent problems that I have seen.
<br />
<br />_________________
<br />
<br />Otherwise I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>

<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />What is the exact version of W10 (winver command) ?
<br />
<br />How did you reset it ?
<br />
<br />If bugs persist,
<br />Create a Windows 10 installation USB drive following this article written by Andre Da Costa
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-recovery-drive-for-reinstalling/58df9c7d-84de-4652-9952-8bac34abc6c5">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Then reset Windows 10, or if reset doesn't work or doesn't help, reinstall Windows 10 following this article

            Hi Miguel
<br />
<br />After you reset Windows 10,, did you install a full set of device drivers from the support page for your device on the manufacturers website?
<br />
<br />If not, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

    <title>xbox 360 wireless controller dpad not working while playing skyrim on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larrysellers  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox 360 wireless controller dpad not working while playing skyrim on pc</h2>
                    <p>I recently discovered that one can use Xbox 360 controllers to play certain pc games. &nbsp;This is wonderful, as the 360 controllers are my favorite gaming controllers ever. &nbsp;However, I've encountered a problem when playing Skyrim on PC. &nbsp;For some reason, the
 d-pad will not work. &nbsp;All the other buttons work fine. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I check the in-game options menu for controller button layout, the d-pad does not show up. I have tried two different controllers and both have this problem. The lack of d-pad makes playing the
 game more difficult because the d-pad is used to hotkey spells, weapons, and items.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The d-pad works when I play games on my Xbox 360. &nbsp;&nbsp; I have not tried the controller with any other games on pc, so I don't know if it's a problem specific to Skyrim or for all games.</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 7 (64) Professional. &nbsp;The xbox 360 controller is a Microsoft product, but the wireless adaptor i'm using is 3rd party. &nbsp;Any help resolving this would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            word &#40;not zipped&#41; attachments are shown as zipped</h2>
                    <p>I often receive email with word attachments which are not zipped, but in Outlook they are shown as zipped. &nbsp;When I download these files the PC tries to open them with Word but fails &amp; thinks they are zip files. Therefore I have to view them online, use the

</p><p>I have tried send a word file (.docx) to myself. &nbsp;The file size of the attachment is the same as the Word file, so it is not zipped, but Outlook still shows it as zipped. &nbsp;How can I stop this problem?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the issue description I understand that you have multiple languages folder in Temp on Windows XP computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help you and guide you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When you install something, the install files get "unpacked" to a "temp folder" somewhere and then the installation copies the needed files to the destination directory. The temp folder should be cleaned out by the installer, but that doesn't always
 happen. In this case you may do it yourself manually or run Disk Cleanup/ just delete it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310312?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Description of the Disk Cleanup Tool in Windows XP</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In Internet Options there is an advance option that enables you to clear browser cache after it is closed. This will automatically clear any garbage collected during surfing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>To clear Cache</span></b></p>
<p><span>1. Open Internet Explorer, <b>Press F12</b>, then <b>Ctrl + R</b></span></p>
<p><span>2. A pop-up "<b>Are you sure you want to clear browser cache</b>" pops up</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select Yes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted if you face any issues on Windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Anil, Thanks for taking the time to respond.&nbsp; A couple of points:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have been deleting these files via Start &gt; run &gt;&nbsp;%temp%.&nbsp; I do this especially just before my PC kicks off a scheduled security scan.&nbsp; But they get set up everytime I start my computer so it is becoming a bind to keep remembering to do this.&nbsp; Do this
 on the assumption that the security package will have less to scan so reducing the time.
</li><li>tried your "to clear Cache" instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get the small pop up you mention and I select "yes" as you said but it does appear to do anything.&nbsp; The temp files are still there BUT also keep getting another pop up at the sametime with what looks like html
 script for whatever the internet site I am on.&nbsp; For example my home page is google search and so I get html script for that site.&nbsp; Have tried this with other website in the background and exactly the same - get html script concerning that site.&nbsp; Inadvertently
 did it with my hotmail open and I got html for hotmail and my PC froze.&nbsp; Had to crash the session.
</li><li>Have before now used the Disk Cleanup option too.</li></ol>
<p>Really would like a more permament solution rather than having to remember to manually delete these files everytime I switch on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thought?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, my XP was installed by the retailer so not sure if when installing XP there is an option to only load selected languages.&nbsp; Really am nervous about reinstalling my PC because I am not a technologist and don't fully understand what I am doing when
 in comes to ground zero technology.</p>

            <p>Clearly I have really annoyed you for which I am sorry.&nbsp; And, apologies to any one else who has taken offense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As my post name suggests I am a novice&nbsp;however with my initail post I knew that I was in a public/community forum.&nbsp; Then when I got a response from "Anil", I managed to convince myself that my issue had somehow got filtered through to Microsoft because the
 respondent sounded like he was employee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my last post you must know that I thought I was communicating with that person in Microsoft.&nbsp; He clearly understood my issue and the solution he suggested I had already tried many times over - it's a temp fix and doesn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is by no means&nbsp;an excuse but an explanation that for someone like me it is PERHAPS an easy mistake to make if you are struggling with a technical issue that you can just about grasp but not understand well enough to solve without clear guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, please accept my apology.</p>

<p>You need to go to&nbsp;the Control Panel, then search for "view scanners and printers" (I can't find out how to get to it any other way). A "Scanners and Printers window should come up that shows your printer and anything else you have. At the bottom of the window,
 there's the buttons "Refresh" "Add Device" "Scan Profiles" and "Properties". Click "Scan Profiles". That brings up a place where you can see all the profiles and can add a new one, edit them, set one as the default, or delete them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Having problems with windows 10, it is a bad program and deletes anything that I do, i.e I deleted the start up password on my computer last night and it worked fine last night and this morning. And now I just turned on my computer and it took me to the
 startup window for my password. And when I tried to correct it, it tells me that the command that I typed in is not a recognized prompt command. I don't like this program,&nbsp;I have no control over my computer and when ever I log in it always tell me that I have
 entered the wrong password and that's why I did the bypass on the startup window. Please can someone help in&nbsp;DELETING/REMOVING&nbsp;WINDOWS 10 from my computer. I tried restoring to my old windows 7, but it won't let me. I had windows 10 for less than 45 days.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Tyler,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you make any system changes prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span>Are you using Microsoft account to login into your user account?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may be facing this issue due to some system changes made on the PC. Reverting the changes made may help in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> If you are using Microsoft account to login, I suggest you to change the login password from the link below and try logging in into your user account to check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>https://account.live.com/password/reset</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue persists, I suggest you to perform
<strong><span>System restore</span></strong> since the issue occurred recently and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you think an app, software or a driver that you recently installed or uninstalled caused problems with your PC, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a
<strong><span>restore point</span></strong>. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to <strong><span>Restore from a system restore point </span></strong>from the link below:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system
 restoring. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Write to us with the answers to the above questions and the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            How are you getting to Google?&nbsp; Try typing "http://www.google.com" in the address window of your browser.&nbsp; If you're still getting the same error, it could be due to malware that has altered your "hosts" file.&nbsp; Examine your "hosts" file with a text editor
 such as Notepad.&nbsp; The hosts file is usually located at C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts.<br />
<br />
A default hosts file will have only one line that does not begin with a "#" character and that should be the line:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp; localhost<br />
<br />
If you have other lines in this file, you should clean out your hosts file.<br />

<p>Hi Lodge-,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may mostly happen if the programs running on the computer do not quit I would prevent the computer to shutdown this may also happen due to any third party software or its
 services interrupting the shutdown process. I would suggest that you try the clean boot procedure and check if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean
 boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

            <p>Hello Rakesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;What I am specifically talking about is a printing error when trying to print pictures from a folder within Win 10. &nbsp;I am enclosing screen shots to show you. &nbsp;If I select multiple images within a folder that has photos, then right select on my mouse
 and use the print option, the following problem occurs when trying to print a contact sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OS produces a preview that shows the images in a contact sheet with the filenames truncated. &nbsp;It does not print the full filename under the photos on the contact sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;I am NOT using any third party software. &nbsp;This is a Fresh Clean install of Win 10 on a SSD and no other software, including Antivirus is presently on the computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is coming from within the OS, or a setting that is causing this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the printer troubleshooter as suggested, but no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the images of the print issue.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your help on this.</p>

<p>So after just spending 3 hours with Level 1 and Level 2 IT help at Microsoft. &nbsp;I was told that printing contact sheets in Windows 7, 8 or 10, the file-name is limited to 16-20 characters!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>YGTBKM!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really?? &nbsp;So when you take photos of a friend with a long last name, you're going to have to abbreviate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't believe I was just told, "Sorry, your out of luck!" Win 10 is limitied! &nbsp;No wonder I've been still using XP for printing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time to go to Linux!</p>
<p>
</p><p>By Microsoft.</p>
