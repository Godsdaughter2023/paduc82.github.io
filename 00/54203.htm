<p>
</p><p>Sorry hear this. Some solutions is to&nbsp; make sure the address on your Xbox Live account matches the address of your credit/debit card and the card number, expiration date, and cvs matches the card.&nbsp; Contact customer service who issue the credit/debit card.&nbsp;
 If you tried on your Xbox, adding it via the internet.&nbsp; If it stills doesn't work then yeah contact customer support.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro on-screen keyboard appears for webpages in Chrome even when type cover is attached</h2>
                    <div>The virtual on-screen keyboard will appear whenever I select a text entry box within a web page in Chrome. &nbsp;This happens with every page I tested. The same pages do not do this in IE. &nbsp;I have not tested other browser types.</div>

</div>
<div>This very well could be a Chrome bug and not Microsoft, but I wanted to see if this was a known issue and if there was a workaround (other than "don't use Chrome"... &nbsp;;-) &nbsp;</div>

<p>This is a known issue with Chrome (Chrome isn't very 'touch friendly'). Hopefully Google will update Chrome with improvements soon.

<div>I thought it was a checked build or something, apparently its for developers.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Their descriptions however were the same, so I thought of asking here.</div>

    <title>local area connection lost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pack fan  say:</h3>
<h2>            local area connection lost</h2>
                    I believe a trojan somehow infected my computer(4 kids have access to the desktop) and my internet connection was lost. After two hours on the phone with time warner's tech support, it was determined that the local are connection is gone. Disappeared.
 When you go to control panel-network connections, you are greeted by a blank white box, There is the network tasks, see also, other places and details sections on the left but nothing in the white box where local area connection used to be. time warner was
 unable to help in restoring the local area connection. Any suggestions on how I get the desktop connected to the internet again? Thanks.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>First scan the computer for Viruses and Malwares.</p>
<p>When you are sure that it is clean, try fist this.<br />
<br />
<strong>WinSock and TCP/IP Refresh.</strong> <br />
<br />
Type Cmd in the Start Search text box.<br />
<br />
Press Ctrl-Shift-Enter keyboard shortcut to run a&nbsp; Command Prompt as an Administrator.&nbsp; Allow elevation.<br />
<br />
Type <strong>netsh winsock reset</strong> in the Command Prompt , and then press the Enter key.<br />
<br />
Do the same processes for refreshing the TCP/IP just replace the typed command with.<br />
<br />
<strong>netsh int reset</strong> &nbsp; press Enter<br />
<br />
<strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; press Enter<br />
<br />
Restart your Computer.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Not working yet?</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.<br />
<br />
Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Local Area Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.<br />

<br />
Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are connected (few more will be even better).<br />
<br />
Switch Off the computer and the Router, Reboot the Router, and the computer.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><strong>On IP status.</strong> <br />
<br />
TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.<br />

<h2>            WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR BSOD Windows 10 Education when booting on Macbook</h2>
                    <p>Recently there was an OS X update which totally broke down my Macbook, so I want to install Windows 10 on it. It was quite a hard job, because first I was trying to install the 64-bit version but that didn't work. After that I wanted to install the 32-bit
 version but my USB didn't get recognized anymore, so I installed it on my windows PC. This worked great and I logged in, I shut down the pc and disconnected the drive. Now when I boot windows on my Macbook, at the spinning white circle it gives a BSOD with
 error WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR. I really don't know how to fix it, so that is why I asked it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you with the issue, getting blue screen of death after installing Windows 10 from one computer and moving the hard drive to another computer is normal. The reason for this are the drivers that are being installed and update. On the computer where
 you install Windows 10, it will install and update the driver of the mother board. If your going to transfer the hard drive to another computer, the OS will not recognize the new mother board. It will not match to the drivers that are being downloaded to the
 hard disc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you install Windows 10 on your Macbook by following the instruction on How to install
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows using boot camp</a>.</p>
<p>

            <p>No Abel. Macbook are intentionally made for Apple products. When your about to install Windows to a Macbook, the operating system should be automatically downloaded the drivers. But if those driver are not available and no good for Windows, that's where
 blue screen came up.</p>

    <title>All games cutting to dashboard randomly mid game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> razmataz08  say:</h3>
<h2>            All games cutting to dashboard randomly mid game  </h2>
                    
<p>I just purchased an Xbox One 3 days ago, part of the Master Chief collection bundle. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All of my games are randomly cutting to the dashboard mid game. &nbsp;I can quickly get back into the game (its not closing out of the game) but it is happening almost every 10 mins. &nbsp;It almost seems like certain button prompts send it to the dashboard. &nbsp;Like
 holding X , Y, or A or clicking the left joystick down (sprinting in battlefield hardline).</p>
<p>Very frustrating especially during multiplayer.</p>
<p>Anyone experiencing this with a newly purchased Xbox One</p>
<p>Any causes for this. &nbsp;Any Solutions?</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;RAZMATAZ08!<br /><br />Sorry to hear about the crashing issues, I can definitely understand how frustrating that could be. I recommend trying a few troubleshooting steps to see if we can get this issue sorted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Once your console is powered off, unplug the power cord.</li>
<li>Wait 5 minutes and then plug in your console.</li>
<li>Power on your console and check to see if the issue continues to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give the suggested steps a try and be sure to let us know the results. Thanks!</p>

<p>I have tried this and the crashing still persists. &nbsp;I have noticed that sometimes when i shake my controller it will cut to the dashboard. &nbsp;Every time it cuts to the dashboard it seems to be related to the controller, a button I've pressed or shaking it.
 &nbsp;It randomly picks a button and treats it like I'm hitting the home button. &nbsp;It will do it every time I hit that button for about 5 crashes then its picks a different button.</p>
<p>Could it be my controller?</p>

<p>mine did this from time to time its like the game crashes to desktop ...its running windows 8 sort of .what worked the best was leaving the power saving feature on every time you boot up it will take longer but i have had better results with it ..some of
 my games would not show up in the tab when i left it on quick start .you could try using a can of air to blow out controller maybe nexus button has something in it .try blowing around the nexus button . but most of my problems were from quick boot the longer
 you use it the more games will act up .</p>

<h2>            Discrepancies between &#34;View Update History&#34; and &#34;Installed Updates&#34;</h2>
                    <div>I am having discrepancies between "<b>View Update History</b>" and "<b>Installed Updates</b>". &nbsp;The updates do not match and there are plenty of discrepancies. &nbsp;I am going to try and link up a Snippet picture so you can see the differences.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a <b>Gateway GM4574</b> with an <b>AMD Live 64-bit</b> processor, but am running Windows
<b>Vista Home Premium&nbsp;(32-bit) SP2,</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found this problem when some Office&nbsp;updates (<b>KB2760411</b>,&nbsp;<b>KB2760583</b>, &amp;&nbsp;<b>KB2760588</b>) kept wanting to be installed over and over. &nbsp;That problem is now solved.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the problem that I am experiencing now...<br />
<div>When I compare the following, I come up with a <b><u>LOT</u></b> of discrepancies:</div>
<div>a)&nbsp;<b>Control Panel, System and Maintenance, Windows Update, <u>View Update History</u></b></div>
<div>b)&nbsp;<b>Control Panel, Programs, Programs and Features, <u>Installed Updates</u></b></div>
<div><b><u><br />
</u></b></div>
<div>Please see if your system shows the same problem. &nbsp;I don't know if this will work, but I am going to try and link a picture of the two control panel views so you can see the differences. &nbsp;Just look at the dates and you'll immediately see there are problems.</div>
<div><b><u><br />
</u></b></div>
<div>Here's the link to a picture I snipped: &nbsp;<font color="#0000ee"><u>https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=95DC3CEDE6DDD9BD!814&amp;authkey=!AEwfCYrNsbmnUk0&amp;v=3+<br />

<div><br />
</div>
<div>When you use the link, and the page opens, look at the bottom of the page and you'll see a thumbnail of the image.&nbsp; Right click on it and click on View Original.&nbsp; It looks better this way.&nbsp; It's easier to read.<br />
<br />
Plus, I never knew you could view the updates two (2) different ways, but <b>there are a lot of the updates do not show up on Installed Updates that show up on View Update History.</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I worry about this because I don't know if the updates are really installed or not.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated.</div>

            <p>The history isn't important, it's the installed updates that are important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At some stage you may have reset Windows Update thus losing your history, or you may have installed some updates manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't worry about it. As long as the computer is up to date and the updates are listed under "installed updates", that's the main thing.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Repair and Expedited Shipping</h2>
                    
<p>I spent three hours and three trips to FedEx to ship my xbox to Microsoft for repair. &nbsp;The only thing that went smoothly was the initial troubleshooting and online order. &nbsp;When I selected my shipping option, I selected "Expedited Shipping for an extra $10.50.
 &nbsp;cording to Microsoft&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="color: rgba(76, 76, 76, 1)"><b>Note</b>&nbsp;If you've paid for an expedited shipping option for your service order, locate a FedEx Office Store where you’ll be provided with a free box, packing material
 and an expedited shipping label. Don't go to any other locations as you may be charged for packing.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Trip one the FedEx agent packed up the Xbox and said "That will be $15 please". &nbsp;After telling him the shipping was included, offering to see the email acknowledgment with the above language and showing him the "expedited Shipping" printed on my receipt,
 we went back and forth for a while but he held his ground and I left frustrated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I then spent over 90 minutes on three chats and one phone call that was transferred to hold music for over 30 minutes with no updates before I hung up. &nbsp;I then called another FedEx office that said they' would "take care of me" only to have the same issue
 when I arrived. &nbsp;I left with a shipping label deciding to pack it myself using some bubble wrap I had and my wife's old ski boot box. &nbsp;Dropped the box off this morning. &nbsp;There seems to be a disconnect between Microsoft and FedEx. &nbsp;Anyone have a similar experience?

<p>I had the exact same issue. I paid for expedited shipping. There was no provided label for me to print, only an SR # (that they indicated I should give FedEx as the RMA number). The clerk at Fedex had no idea what to do (after an hour of phone calls and
 hold time). Speaking with another Fedex location, I was told that I would have to pack it myself (but at least she could see the RMA record). I paid for expedited shipping and the same note was in my email. "Note If you've paid for an expedited shipping option
 for your service order, locate a FedEx Office Store where you’ll be provided with a free box, packing material and an expedited shipping label. Don't go to any other locations as you may be charged for packing."</p>
<p>Unbelievable. </p>

<p>Though I did not have this same exact issue and it did not concern console repair or delivery, I CAN say that I think that there is a disconnect.</p>
<p>Several years back, my father had won Xbox equipment from a raffle and/or pre-ordered package (something Microsoft was endorsing), and we were supposed to have a package delivered &nbsp;by FedEx according to a courrier report via e-mail. When it had passed more
 than several weeks, we figured we should contact FedEx and they took no interest in the situation, not even online support.. Lo-and-behold, we contacted Microsoft Services, and they immediately rectified the situation (much to our suprise) by having it shipped
 through UPS.</p>
<p>Even most recently I was supposed to earn a gratuity item, and yet again, the package vanished from existence and FedEx simply shrugged their shoulders, and once more a Microsoft service team was right on it...and shipped it through UPS.</p>
<p>Somethin' tells me FedEx employees and Microsoft representatives don't exactly get along, being that they never want to be connected to one another to rectify an issue.</p>

<p>I never had a problem with fedex, but each time I shipped my 360 I did use UPS, so I can't say for sure about Microsoft and the fed ex side of it. It's possible that Microsoft messed up on the weight, and that may be why fed ex is not working with you.
</p>
<p>I would really contact MS about it and talk to them, as it seems like it could be MS that is having some problems with pricing their packages.

<p>I faced the same issue, one hour ago, I went to an fedex office store and the clerk told that the payment was just for the shipping even after I showed her the Microsoft message so to finish the discussion I paid 10 dollar more for the packing</p>
<p>The message is clear so I do not what is the issue but I blame Microsoft, and after seeing all the troubles to try to get a refund, I am just going to wait to receive back my console</p>

<p>It can't be obtained from Microsoft.&nbsp; I suggest you do a search for "Purchase Vista or XP" on Bing and/or Google and see if they come up with anything helpful.&nbsp; I know of no places to get them anymore but I haven't really looked.</p>
<p>If available, you should br able to find sources on those search engines.&nbsp; Refine the search term if that one doesn't provide any options.&nbsp; Do NOT buy OEM software because the license allows it to be installed only on the original computer it came installed
 on - you can't legally install it on your machine (and you may not be able to activate it when the time comes and then you'll be stuck).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Original 360 Disc Unreadable With New Twist. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deman81188  say:</h3>
<h2>            Original 360 Disc Unreadable With New Twist.</h2>
                    
<p>My original 360 plays most games fine(freezes on a few but that's a different post altogether) however when it comes to Halo: Reach my Xbox makes me want to elbow drop someone. The first 3 levels play fantastically as do some Multiplayer maps but after that
 I get a game error saying that the disc is unreadable. To be fair, I left it out and my cat scratched it. So I went out and bought a new copy. Same error. Understandable I'm both outraged and confused. I cleared the cache, have no attachments on it except
 for A/V and power cables, and even tried to play without the HDD hoping it would solve my problem. No such luck. It only does this with Reach, and most other games play fine(Even Skyrim, Mass Effect [1,2,3], Oblivion, Other FPS, Netflix, Youtube, ect.). I
 have no idea how to go about fixing this since it only affects the later Campaign levels and the error shows up sporadically on MP. I would love a new 360, but it's out of my budget for now and repair is a no go as I'm out of warranty anyway and the Xbox is
 my only entertainment portal.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>Game read error on some levels of Halo: Reach only.</p>
<p>New disc, same error.</p>
<p>No other games affected by error.</p>
<p>Owner/Operator at wits end.</p>

<p>Update</p>
<p>All Campaign missions not working but Multiplayer still works occasionally.</p>
<p>New and original game disc giving same errors.</p>
<p>Noted that both discs have an error in the animation showing the Asteroid field surrounding Reach in the sequence that happens when you first insert the game disc. A spot where the video does not render properly.
</p>
<p>Original game disc has a scratch running around the outside of the disc but the new one is free of any scratches. Still the only game giving me problems.</p>

            <p>Hello Deman! This certainly sounds like an odd issue. It looks like you've tried some solid steps with no success. What is the exact disc read error you receive? Also - have you tried installing the game to the HDD? Let us know! :) </p>

<p>The exact disc read error is</p>
<p>"Game Error</p>
<p>This Dic is unreadable.</p>
<p>1. Clean the disc with a soft cloth.</p>
<p>2. Restart the console.</p>
<p>For more help, visit</p>
<p>www.xbox.com/support."</p>
<p>I installed the game and after that point it would launch to a green screen and then return me to the above error message. It never launched the game just went green and then error. I deleted the install and it would launch again, but still had the same
 error once I tried to launch a level.</p>
<p>Additional information. Xbox is an original 20GB model from 2006, though it red ringed sometime in 07-08. I sent it in and received a refurbished model in return though HDD is original. Like I stated earlier, some games will freeze on me occasionally but
 a restart fixes that so I am chalking that up to old equipment paired with new games. I am fairly positive that the two issues are not related in any way. I don't have a huge base for that assumption, but the games that freeze aren't usually big name titles
 but smaller releases that may have had enough time to be refined for a generations of 'box. For example; Skyrim and MW3 run without so much as a tic. Titles that will freeze on me occasionally are Star Wars The Force Unleashed(II not I) and Spider-Man: Edge
 of Time. The fact that most titles run smoothly and the fact that they do not give me an error message at all lead me to believe that the two issues are unrelated.</p>
<p>So far the only game that it flat out prevents me from playing is Halo: Reach. It started after my cats scratched my original disc a few months after release. It played perfectly up to that point, but even with a new disc it gives me the same error, which
 points to the Xbox rather than the disc. I would almost think it is a HDD error with my Reach file, like it was corrupted somehow by the disc, but it gives me the error sans HDD.</p>

<p>In an effort to rule out anything software related in my problem, I moved both the save game data and gamer profiles off my HDD. I moved the game data first thinking that if there were corrupted bits contained it might solve the problem, and the profile
 after realizing that it caches my progress and that also might be a factor. After removing both to the relative safety of portable storage I disconnected from live and once again cleared the cache. No such luck. Game freezes during the opening cinematic(The
 first level's cinematic, not the Microsoft/Bungie/Xbox cinematic I mentioned earlier as having a glitch.) so I cannot reproduce the game disc error.</p>
<p>Sadly I'm beginning to suspect that my Xbox has a flaw buried somewhere that only the old tried and true method of replacing hardware pieces one by one and testing in between will fix.</p>
<p>I am open to suggestions since I have neither the resources nor the desire to try such a thing.</p>

            <p>Well, that certainly sounds like you did some great troubleshooting steps! Just to be clear, when you moved the save game data and profiles, you moved them to a USB Flash Drive, then removed that drive from the console, correct? Did you have any files pertaining to Halo Reach on your console at that point? Have you tried redownloading your profile at all? I re-read the post, but unfortunately cannot see any direct reference to redownloading the profile. Thanks! </p>

<h2>            Net Framework 4.5 cannot install Fatal Error Message Fixes not working-HELP</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon.&nbsp; I had trouble with installing Live Mail on my computer, so I was given some instructions from support to try and fix my Net Framework, which was on version 4.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and ran the MSI software update Fix it.&nbsp; Then I attempted to repair the framework and it did not fix the Live Mail install.&nbsp; Finally I was told to uninstall and reinstall the Net Framework.&nbsp; Well, this is where the problem has gotten out of
 hand.&nbsp; Now my Net Framework will not install any version past 3.5.&nbsp; After I re-installed it and went to Windows update, it said it could not install.&nbsp;&nbsp;It said it was unable to install version 4.&nbsp; It gave me a code 643. I am now in a clean boot environment,
 and received a fatal error during installation message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read one fix that involved removing 3 KB windows updates, which I tried, and still would not work.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Update is trying to install the Net Framework Update, and every time I go to either shut down or restart the computer it is trying to install
 the update.&nbsp; It says it has, then reboots and configures.&nbsp; The only way to prevent this was to go into Windows Updates and hide the Net Framework update so it doesn't keep trying to do it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to do now.&nbsp; I have a new error message and problems with Net Framework.&nbsp; I did speak via chat with Microsoft support and they told me they could fix one issue for $99, or $149 for a year for all problems that arise.&nbsp; I am just frustrated
 as I started this wanting to fix my mail, and now I can't even fix the Framework.&nbsp; Any help on this would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Isha, just an update so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I referred to the article you linked me to, and here is what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I followed Step 1 to Fix the MSI software update, when the update did not install the message was</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failed Update </p>
<p>Error Code 643 Windows encountered an unknown error</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed Step 2 to repair the Framework, and the update did not install and the message was that the program should</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reregister Windows Installer Service and</p>
<p>Restart Windows Installer Service</p>
<p>
</p><p>I let it do both, and I could not install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to uninstall and reinstall the Framework.&nbsp; As I had stated&nbsp;I followed these instructions originally with the Mail issue but perhaps something just did not click inside my PC.&nbsp; I'll let you know but I figured the information so far might help you
 see something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In Step 3, I ran the cleanup tool.&nbsp; I restarted and installed Framework 1.1 and the SP for that.&nbsp; It asked me to restart to have the changes on 1.1 to take effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the instructions do not mentioning restarting between downloading the 1.1SP and
 the last download, the one for 3.5&nbsp; Should I restart or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the 3.5 download offers me the choice of the bootstrapper or the full version.&nbsp; Does it matter which I go with?&nbsp; I am sorry to be so precise but I want to make sure I am taking all the right steps in order to fix this.&nbsp; Thanks again.&nbsp; I'm just going
 to wait on restarting and moving forward until I hear back.</p>

            Funny thing, I have this exact same issue with regards to trying to install .NET Framework 4.5.2 and Visual C 2010, which are both required by NERO Platinum&nbsp;15 to be installed and after generating 11, yes ELEVEN CASE ID #s along with numerous lost hours
 with level 1 and level 2 techs my computer is WORSE THAN WHEN THEY STARTED TO DIAGNOSE AND REPAIR IT !&nbsp; All of this started after I purchased WIN 7 Ultimate Upgrade from Frys and upgraded (or so I believed) both my computers. Update issues on both my computers
 which NEVER BEFORE HAD ANY ISSUES yet here I set, cannot use or install NERO, much less use it and now this computer has explorer issues as it keeps asking me if I want internet explorer to be the default program and now the explorer icon on my desktop has
 vanished and I have to go to update and a Microsoft website then hit the Home icon and get back to yahoo and onto whatever I needed to do. UNREAL&nbsp;

            <p>Seancady,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all started because I went to re-install Live Mail and couldn't.&nbsp; I was on the phone with someone from MS for quite some time, and when we couldn't fix it with the basic steps I was told it would be $99 for a one issue fix or $149 for a year of coverage.&nbsp;
 I upgraded to 7 Professional and hadn't had any problems until recent.&nbsp; I can't imagine having 11 case ID's.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a new wrinkle on mine.&nbsp; This is the craziest yet.&nbsp; When I use Firefox to open my Hotmail, and hit the link to get to this community support website it can't connect.&nbsp; I get the message on a MS screen that 'Something went wrong and we can't sign you
 in right now.&nbsp; Please try again later.'&nbsp; This has happened for 2 days.&nbsp; However, if I load my Hotmail through IE, I can click on the link and it goes right through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heckety heck?&nbsp; Now everytime I boot up, I receive a pop-up stating that one of my programs won't work correctly without at least Net Framework 4.0.&nbsp; I am going for a restart now, and going to try and get 3.5 on.&nbsp; If you don't see me back, my computer
 is either blown up, on fire or at the bottom of a lake somewhere sleepin' wit da fishes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>According to my programs list, I am at Framework 1.1.&nbsp; I did download the 3.5SP1 but when it went to install it said that I needed to go to Control Panel and to 'Turn Windows Features on and off.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a main checkbox for&nbsp;Net Framework 3.5.1 which is full with a solid blue.&nbsp; There are 2 check boxes which were both empty.&nbsp; One for Windows Communication Foundation HTTP activation and Non-HTTP Activation.&nbsp; Which box do I check before I install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried choosing both and setting it, but it told me there was an error and the settings could not be changed.&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype startup</h2>
                    I am running WIndows 10 on a Dell Inspiron. I recently had to restore my Windows to original factory settings and reinstall all my software. I downloaded and installed Skype 12.1803.279.0. With my previous version, I had Skype setup to startup automatically
 with Windows startup. I cannot find that setting in this new version. Task Manager/Startup does not include Skype. How to I setup Skype to start up automatically?

<h2>            Tap And Say</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 screen has something like this on it:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8ea4d2b-0c78-44ed-b8d1-0ed36bab6e8a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8ea4d2b-0c78-44ed-b8d1-0ed36bab6e8a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I tap and say "show me movie showtimes" nothing happens, except I get a mucky fingermark on the glass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC screen is not touch sensitive, so what's the point of that message?</p>

    <title>Download Historie und Einkaufsverlauf werden nicht korrekt angezeigt - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Download Historie und Einkaufsverlauf werden nicht korrekt angezeigt &#40;xbox.com&#47;account.microsoft.com&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Ich wollte heute mal anfangen die Rock Band 4 Songs herunterzuladen und wollte aufgrund besserer Übersicht auf die Xbox 360 Download Historie auf xbox.com zurückgreifen, denn dort sollten die Käufe ja aufgelistet sein.</p>
<p>Ich habe allerdings festgestellt, dass verschiedene Käufe und Downloads, wie bspw. Spiel-AddOns nicht korrekt angezeigt werden. Die Auswahl "Alle" oder "Alle Spiel-AddOns" listet maximal Käufe/Downloads bis zum 1.8.15 auf.</p>
<p>Gleiches Problem auch bei account.microsoft.com. Ich kann keinerlei Käufe vor dem 1.8.15 anzeigen lassen, obwohl ich seit 2008 Kunde bin.</p>
<p>Was ist da los?</p>

<p>Vielleicht bist Du nur auf der falschen Website.</p>
<p>Wenn ich zu meiner <a href="https://live.xbox.com/de-DE/Download/History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download-History auf dieser Seite hier</a> gehe, werden mir all meine Käufe seit meinem ersten Kauf von "Uno" im September 2006 angezeigt.</p>
<p>Beachte aber, dass die Download History wie beispielsweise Twitter oder Facebook ältere Inhalte dynamisch erst nachlädt, wenn Du selbst mit der Scrolleiste am unteren Rand der Seite angekommen bist.</p>
<p>Also mit der Maus oder "Strg+Ende" ans Seitenende scrollen, und weitere Downloads nachladen lassen (es werden immer nur ein paar Inhalte einer Bildschirmseite nachgeladen).</p>
<p>Drücke also mehrmals Strg+Ende bis Du an den Anfang Deiner Download-Historie angekommen bist.</p>
<p>Stelle auch sicher, dass Du eventuelle Erweiterungen wie Adblock oder NoScript so eingestellt hast, dass sie das Nachladen von Inhalten via Script NICHT BLOCKEN!</p>

<p>If you have one xbox one in a family please log in with the account that owns the games and gold and do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button &nbsp;to open the guide. </li><li>Select <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt;<strong> Personalization</strong>, and then select<strong> My home Xbox</strong>.
</li><li>Review the information, and then do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Make this my home Xbox</strong>&nbsp;to designate the console as your home Xbox</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>This is not my home Xbox</strong>&nbsp;to remove the designation.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>After doing that sign in on the other accounts on the console and they all have access to your digital games and gold BUT this does NOT share gold to xbox 360 games, so they will have to have their own gold for backwards compatible games.</p>

<h3> stephenm99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 to Windows 7 Rollback Mouse and Keyboard Failure</h2>
                    <p>Bad news and I need some help<br />
Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-970A-D3P -- AMD 970<br />
Processor: AMD FX-8320 CPU (8x 3.50GHz/8MB L3 Cache)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ever since ive bought my computer (from Ibuypower), I've always felt a lot of lag within my games such as Guild Wars 2 and Dirty Bomb. I have a 970gtx graphics card so that isn't the issue. I was talking with some of my friends and they told me that it was
 probably my processor and motherboard were not very compatible. So I looked on part picker and it turns out "Some AMD 970 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Vishera CPUs.". Mistakenly I tried to change my drivers and I used this "Gigabyte
 AMD 9/8/7 Series Utilities" disk to get more drivers... However I've just installed Windows 10 (no problems), and this utilities CD was way outdated and kept having errors saying "This Driver can't release to failure!!" and it told me to restart my computer
 because new drivers were installed. So I did but then my ethernet would not work and I had no internet so I decided to roll back to windows 7 to see if it would work there. So I rolled back and it seemed fine, except none of my usbs were working, my mouse
 and keyboard were unusable. The USB ports are recognized as it says "Driver installation finished" but they are unusable. Ive tried random mice and keyboards and switched from 3g to 2g ports and everything. Now Im stuck and I can't use my computer. (Also the
 Ethernet now works in windows 7?) Also the keyboard and mice to not work in safemode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me as I need to use my computer and I cant use my mouse and Keyboard or anything and i dont know if the "AMD 9/8/7 series utilities dvd" has messed up my computer<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To
 know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps
 eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<em><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’</span></em><span>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Update the drivers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To update the drivers, you may refer to the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>If the issue still persists, I would recommend you to visit the computer manufacturer’s support website and download the compatible drivers
 for your system.</span>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to do so, try to reset BIOS to default settings and try again. To do so, either refer to the manual provided along with the PC or contact the hardware manufacturer of the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Disclaimer: </em><span><span><em>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</em><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />

Why is my Internet connection so slow?<br />

Wired and wireless network connection problems in Windows<br />

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your drivers (Wifi/Wireless and NIC/Wired) and clearing <br />
the&nbsp;network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually <br />
using the methods&nbsp;below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System <br />
maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
<strong>Repeat above for network card (NIC)</strong> and is a good time to get other updated
<br />
drivers as Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests <br />
one just HIDE it as they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers<br />
manually as needed.<br />

<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Left&nbsp;Side click Manage <br />
Wireless Networks - Right Click the Networks - Remove Networks - <br />
REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect&nbsp;To - to logon on to Network.<br />

<p>To me this would indicate that Skype surreptitiously uses a back door to my Computer Contents.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t refresh to fix &#34;Something happened and the Windows Store is no longer working&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 8.1 64-bit on drive C, a solid state drive. I use drive A, a hard disk drive, to store programs, files, etc. In addition, I'm dual-booting Debian Linux as well; Linux is installed on its own partition on drive A, and hasn't interfered
 with Windows before or now. The problem with the Store was around before I installed Linux, so it's likely that Linux is not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The series of events is like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. A small "x" icon appears on the OneDrive and Photos tiles on my Start Screen, and their live-tile capabilities no longer work. Research into the issue suggests that an update, or uninstalling and reinstalling these apps from the Windows Store, may fix
 the problem.</p>
<p>2. I attempt to open the Windows Store to fix the problem, to be greeted with the following error message immediately: "Something happened and the Windows Store is no longer working. Please restart your PC and try again. If this problem continues, you might
 need to refresh Windows on your PC."</p>
<p>3. Following the above directions, I restart the PC and attempt to open the store again, with the same results.</p>
<p>4. I insert my Windows 8 installation disc and boot from it, attempting to refresh my PC. However, another error message pops up, saying, "The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again." I have not locked, encrypted, formatted,
 or otherwise touched the drive since I first installed Windows. Also, I do not have BitLocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating the BIOS, Windows, and running a disk cleanup/defragment to no avail.</p>

Something happened and your purchase couldn’t be completed</a>. Today, we’re going to provide you the fix for yet another error we&nbsp;came across!</p>
Something Happened &amp; Windows Store Is No Longer Working
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f08%2fFIX-Something-Happened-And-Your-Store-Is-No-Longer-Working.png%3fc2fdaa" height="400" width="620" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the above image, Refresh seems the option to fix it, if it doesn’t gets resolved by a reboot. You could also&nbsp;upgrade, like if you got this error on
<strong>Windows 8</strong>, then you could to <strong>Windows 8.1</strong> and it will fix the issue significantly. But what if you’re not comfortable with both of these ways. Well, frankly speaking, we have a simple solution here which you can implement so
 that you avoid the tedious ways mentioned above.</p>
<p>Do the following!</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Press <em>Windows Key + R</em>, and type or paste this location:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows</strong></p>
<div><br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f08%2fFIX-Something-Happened-And-Your-Store-Is-No-Longer-Working-4.png%3fc2fdaa" height="217" width="415" /></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the<em> Windows</em> folder, look for <strong>AppRepository</strong> folder. Some of the log files inside this folder is root cause of the issue.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f08%2fFIX-Something-Happened-And-Your-Store-Is-No-Longer-Working-1.png%3fc2fdaa" height="494" width="606" /></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> When you click the <strong>AppRepository</strong> folder mentioned above, you’ll get following prompts:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f08%2fFIX-Something-Happened-And-Your-Store-Is-No-Longer-Working-2.png%3fc2fdaa" height="195" width="777" /></p>
<p>Please use <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/take-ownership-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="take ownership windows 8">
this way to take the ownership</a>&nbsp;of <strong>AppRepository</strong> folder so that you can avoid above shown prompts and get directly into the folder.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> After taking ownership of the folder and getting into the folder, you’ll see
<strong>edb.log</strong> and <strong>edbXXXXX#.log</strong> files. Where <em>XXXXX</em> can be
<em>00001</em>, <em>00002</em> and so on depending variably from computer to computer. You have simply
<em><strong>delete</strong></em> these<strong> edb.log</strong> and <strong>edbXXXXX#.log</strong> files to fix up the issue.</p>

<p>After deleting the above said files,&nbsp;restart your computer and see if it helps. If it does not, then you may want to consider the

            <p>Hello, Phil! Thanks for the quick reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions in your post to delete the edb.log and edbXXXX.log files. However, after restarting, Windows Store still isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've considered and attempted the Refresh PC option; however, Windows refuses to do so with the error message "The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Please unlock the drive and try again."</p>
<p>I cannot refresh to fix the Windows Store issue until after I've fixed the issue preventing me from refreshing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, the option that seems like it would fix this best would be a clean install of Windows 8; while this is possible, as I have the recovery media; it is also very inconvenient, as I have well over 250 GB of files and applications on the computer that
 I'd rather not have to migrate or spend hours reinstalling. Therefore, I am only considering this option as a last-ditch effort. If nothing else works, then I will reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to "unlock" my SSD so I can refresh Windows and fix the Store problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />
ML</p>

            <p>Hello! Thank you for your reply and for helping me solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am utilizing a hard drive, "A", and a solid state drive, "C". The "C" drive has two partitions according to Disk Management: "C:" and "System Reserved". The "A" drive has three partitions: "A:", which I use for storage and to install applications on and
 is by far the largest, and two unmarked partitions that I have set up as Linux partitions: one for the actual installation and one for "swap space".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to reset the Windows Store cache as you described by utilizing WSReset, but upon doing so, the Store gave me the same response as before. Then, I attempted the PowerShell method to reregister the Store, but I got this error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Add-AppxPackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073CFE, The package<br />
repository is corrupted.<br />
error -550: Windows cannot process a deployment operation because the package<br />
repository database encountered an ESENT error. Use the Reset Your PC feature<br />
to recover your PC. See the Application event log for messages with ESENT as<br />
the event source for more details.<br />
NOTE: For additional information, look for [ActivityId]<br />
681d9503-c12e-0000-269e-1d682ec1cf01 in the Event Log or use the command line<br />
Get-AppxLog -ActivityID 681d9503-c12e-0000-269e-1d682ec1cf01<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;nager.Commands.AddAppxPackageCommand</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says I should use the Reset My PC feature to recover my PC; I presume this means I will lose all of my files, applications and settings and be forced to run a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the only way to solve this, then I would like to know: why did this happen? How can I prevent something like this from happening in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if there is still a way to solve this otherwise, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

Lets test if the problem with Store repeats itself in a new user account. Please follow the article below and create a new user account:

<p>The complications in refreshing the PC is multiple hard drives, the easiest way around would be to disconnect the hard drive which has Linux installed and change the boot sequence to make your windows drive primary.<br />
<br />
However, since resetting your computer is not your primary concern and this results in data loss. I would suggest you not to perform this unless absolutely necessary.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply once more!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new user account and it booted up to the Start screen. On the new account, however,
<em>all</em>&nbsp;of the Metro apps have the little "X" in the corner, and upon launching any of them, Windows gives me this error message: "There's a problem with &lt;app name here&gt;. Contact your system administrator about repairing or reinstalling it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, attempting to launch the Windows Store on the new account will have it appear as though it's launching, but then it will immediately close again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will attempt refreshing my PC by disconnecting the hard drive like you mentioned, and edit this post with the results later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I've taken out the A drive, but unfortunately, upon booting into the recovery CD, it still claims that the drive is "locked" and that I need to "unlock" it before I can refresh. In addition, Automatic Repair is unhelpful; it works for a bit, but then
 stops and tells me that there were problems, but Automatic Repair couldn't fix them. I'm going to start backing up my files just in case. That way, resetting won't be completely destructive if I end up having to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more ideas?</p>

<br />
Thank you for keeping us updated.<br />
<br />
Let’s try to run SFC scan and see if this resolves the issue<br />
<br />
System file check (SFC) is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed,
 or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this please follow the article below</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply with the results of SFC scan.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Coming back to your second issue. After unplugging the A drive you need to get into the BIOS and set the first boot priority to the primary HDD. The steps are different for different computers. I’d suggest you to get in touch with your computer manufacturer
 to do the same.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp; </span>
