    <title>Problems with blue screen on startup. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with blue screen on startup.</h2>
                    ok. i came downstairs to fire up my faithful pc, and bam, its booting up, the hard drive is spinning, and all of a sudden, click, the hard drive shuts off, and i get a blue screen for 1/2 of a second before it restarts. the auto-fixer can't find anything
 wrong with it, so im like. ok, lemme document this, so i took my camera (old model, crappy resolution) and recorded bits and peices of the message when it flashed to peice it together so it looks like this&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>the error code is C0000135, (unable to locate component)</div>
<div>an application has failed to start because advapi32.dll was not found. restarting the application may fix the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>now, i tried a boot into safe mode, to see if it was an application, but that failed, and the computer restarted. im very frustrated at this pc right now, and need some help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>some notes about me</div>
<div>1, im fairly tech-adept, so don't spare the technical details.</div>
<div>2, i have another computer, so if i need to replace files ect, i can do them. as well as anything else, because of the handiest cable known to man.</div>
<div>3, if you fix this, i love you.</div>

<p><span><span>Hi bandanaman,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us try Last known good configuration to resolve your issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears.
 If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you
 want to start, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight <strong>
Last Known Good Configuration</strong>, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If your computer has more than one operating system installed, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system that you want to start by using Last Known Good
 Configuration, and then press ENTER. Windows will then resume starting normally.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that does not work we need to perform a startup repair.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Startup Repair is a Windows&nbsp;Vista recovery tool that can fix certain problems, such as missing or damaged system
 files that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. When you run Startup Repair, it scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the instructions in the link below to resolve your issue.</span></span></p>

            Funny, I'm getting a very similar message, but working on an old Windows 2000 computer.&nbsp; I, too, got the split second error message recorded on my camera (using video mode).&nbsp; My error message says:<br />
<br />
STOP: c0000135 (Unable to Locate DLL)<br />
The dynamic link library winsrv could not ...(off camera)<br />
Load Path.<br />
<br />
The basic message was that it could not find winsrv.dll in the load path.&nbsp; But it is there.&nbsp; I found it while using the repair disk (in dos type mode).<br />
<br />
Well, I copied someone else's W2000 winsrv.dll (happened to even have the exact same number of bytes, so I was hopeful) using 'Insert' distribution of Linux into /system32 where the supposedly missing file was still sitting.&nbsp; Didn't work.&nbsp; The computer is still
 rebooting right after it finishes the colorful windows startup screen.<br />
<br />
And, I, too, used the restore disk, and even let it replace any file it wanted with what it had.<br />
<br />
Still no help.

            Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Sorry for not delivering an answer but I have a similar problem. It started after the recent Vista updates. I don't know if the sound was coming from the HDD or the DVD drive but one of them two would hiss and sound like it was slowing down. Seconds after the
 computer would freeze. That lasted for 3 days until it just got to the point where it would happen every 30 seconds. I then tried a system restore which made things worse, after the system restore I booted the computer up and got a Blue Screen for 1 second
 and it only happened that time, never again. When I rebooted again it would only boot to "loading vista screen" with just the little loading bar at the bottom and after that it just went to a black screen with a cursor, but it wasn't frozen. Occasionally the
 loading symbol would pop up beside the cursor but it never did anything. I tried all above methods..safe mode...last known config...and all other options availble when you press F8...and all the utilities on the Vista CD won't run. I know it wasn't a virus
 becuase I had scanned the computer directly before it died on me. I'm guessing the HDD is dead..just to have a look at things I unplugged the HDD to inspect it...all seemed normal. plugged it back in and now it says: "Reboot and select proper boot device"&nbsp;
 I went into the BIOS and made sure the boot order was the HDD first and everything was OK but it showed that it didn't detect anything in SATA 1...I'm pretty sure the HDD is gone..but not 100% sure. Can anyone provide some clarification?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
Max<br />

            <p>Thanks for clarifying it out. If that is the case, we suggest the following: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: <strong>Isolate the issue.</strong> </p>
<p>Try the mouse into another device, this is to determine whether the issue is caused by the mouse or the device.
</p>
<p>If the mouse does work on another device, the mouse is working correctly. But in instance it doesn't work on another device, then the mouse itself is faulty.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: <strong>Verify power levels</strong>.</p>
<p><span>To make sure that there is sufficient power for the Bluetooth device, disconnect any unnecessary USB devices, and then test the device when there are no other USB devices connected. Make sure that the device is plugged into the root hub or to a powered
 USB hub (But not to a "bus-powered" USB hub. This kind of hub is actually not powered).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome. </p>

 sites on the internet that say they can download Freecorder but its total nonsense. When you go there thay want you to download oh so many pieces of garbage that its rediculous and to make matters worse if you don't accept their wonderful offer Freecorder
 won't download. I'm not even sure you wold get it if you took all of there offers.</p>

</p><p>As you mention the program which is third party and not supported by Microsoft. So if you have the program support contact details you can contact with them and get it downloaded.<br />

</p><p>If there is a problem with that (oh so many pieces of garbage) tell us what that means.</p>
<p>

            <p>I've recieved several suggestions about downloading Free Corder from various sites however every site I've visited wants you to download some&nbsp;3rd party software. So far all have been the same. If you decline the 3rd party software it scts like its downloading
 Free Corder but when its finished it has down loaded nothing. on the other hand if you select all or some of the 3rd party software it will download what you've selected&nbsp;but Free Corder does not. Believe me its very difficult to get some of that 3rd party
 stuff to go away. For some you either restore to an earlier date or in the worse case you had better have a clone or your screwed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though Aplian no longer supports Free Corder I am convinced that somebody out there has either created a similar program or has somehow retained Free Corder and is willing to share it with others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not adverse to paying for software but I demand that what I purchase work the way I want it to work, does the things I want it too do and in general is simple. The original Free Corder, for those of you unfamiliar with it, placed a small icon on the
 tool bar of IE and if while searching the web you came across something you could use you sselected that icon which dropped down a menu from which you could select what it was that you wanted to capture (video, audio, you tube, etc. It didn't offer a lot of
 bells and whistles but they arn't need for most. All of the paid applications I have tried require many, many, many steps to capture something and then provides you with multiple options to create MGM masterpieces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody can help please do so. I used this software in the past to capture snippets of audio and video tp enhance both power point presentations and classroom presentations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all who help.</p>

            <p>Hello Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in <strong>Safe Mode</strong> and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If everything works fine in safe mode then it means that there is some issue either with third party services or third party application so, I would suggest you to boot your computer in
<strong>clean boot </strong>and check the status if it helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry but applian does not have a paid version of freecorder. Instead they offer a lousy, large, cumbersome program that is nothing like freecorder. I am still looking for something LIKE freecorder that is an internet explorer tab or tool bar that facilitates
 capture of audio and video without all of the bells and whistles provided in the more upscale offerings. Thanks for the effort I will keep trying. By he way if your looking for simple and easy to use don't go to any of the standard ones they are all over priced
 and over worked.</p>

<h2>            Older Direct X Installation Issues on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded to Windows 10 and I am trying to play a game that requires Direct X 9.0c. I figured no problem I will go onto the disc and run the Direct X installer off of it. It starts installing and stops on d3dx9_30.dll. Not sure if it is freezing
 or what it is doing but I let it sit for 30 min and still nothing. I also tried the end user runtime from the Microsoft website as well as the web installer. All of them hang in the same spot except the web one which instantly hangs when it starts copying
 files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The game I am trying to play gives me the error d3dx9_41.dll is missing even with whatever direct x versions come with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU- AMD 1055t</p>
<p>Graphics card- ATI Radeon R9 280x</p>
<p>Ram- 16gb ddr3</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Someone please help this is frustrating.</p>

    <title>Activate Windows message after going back to Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heathermccartney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activate Windows message after going back to Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I bought my laptop one year ago and it came with Windows 8 pre-installed, after a little adjusting, I liked the OS.&nbsp; I gave in to temptation and installed the free Windows 10 offer that popped up every time I turned on my PC.&nbsp; I immediately began having
 problems with it (freezing up on restart being the most frustrating); and so I opted to revert back to Windows 8.&nbsp; New problem.&nbsp; Now upon start up I keep getting this message about "activating Windows" and needing a product key.&nbsp; To my knowledge I never received
 a product key with the purchase of my laptop, and now I have no idea what I can do to fix the issue.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>

Since notepad.exe resides in a protected folder it takes a bit of an effort to delete it. You can restore it by copying it from some other Windows 7 machine.

<p>I have a Canon MP280 printer and a PC with Windows XP. My question is how can I locate the printing history so I can see what I had printed previously?</p>

            <p>You had posted your question in the Feedback forum, a forum for posting feedback about the Microsoft Answers web site, not for asking printing questions.&nbsp; Therefore, I moved your post to the Windows XP "Performance and Maintenance" forum, which seemed more
 appropriate to me.</p>
<p>Click Start&gt;Run.&nbsp; In the Open field that appears, type</p>
<p>eventvwr</p>
<p>and press Enter.&nbsp; The Event Viewer should open.&nbsp; On the left side, select the System log and you should see Print events there.&nbsp; You may have to search the log to find them.&nbsp; There will likely be more events than just those.</p>

            Are you sure?<br />
<br />
I just printed this page (because I actually test things), printed 8 emails, printed another web page followed by a spreadsheet and PPT for a meeting tomorrow and there was nothing in the Event View about it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, my last event in the System log is from 2+ days ago:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7036<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11/11/2011<br />
Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7:25:08 AM<br />
Description:<br />
The Remote Access Connection Manager service entered the running state.<br />
<br />
For more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.<br />
<br />
I know-w-w-w- I have printed many things locally and remotely since then.<br />
<br />
Do I need to turn something on to see my printing history?<br />

Despite the "applies to" list, the info is good for XP also.<br />
<br />
There are a number of boxes you can check.&nbsp; By default (at least that's the way it was on my XP computer), the box for "Log spooler information events" is not checked.&nbsp; That's the option that causes an "information" event to be written to the System Event Log
 each time a print job is spooled.<br />
<br />
And yes, I tested it.<br />

            Thanks, I tried all that. But what I am confused about is how do I know what the printing job is? It doesn't say print in the source under the system log.&nbsp;How do I know what it is when the source says service control manager or event log?. Does this mean
 it did not record it printed?

<h2>            Need help with a gameshare problem.</h2>
                    So, my younger brother recently got Sea of Thieves. I wanted to play it with him so once he installed it via a code from GameStop I went to my ready to install list. For some reason though it wasn't there. I had known about this already but I thought just
 his games he got with gold weren't there because he no longer had a gold membership. But apparently his purchased games arent showing either. We have both properly changed home xbox's so I was confused. Anyway I had him come and install the game via his profile
 and it installed but now its saying I need to renew my gamepads subscription that I haven't had for around a month. I never installed Sea of Thieves with it either. I've even tried just making a new account that has no hold or gamepads info on it but its saying
 that whoever's owns the game needs to sign in to play. Normally I would just try and check to see if the home xbox isn't actually mine but I assumed it was because I can play Rainbow Six Siege without him signed in. Even

            <p><span>Hi Madonna,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We appreciate your time and effort spent to troubleshoot the issue on your own.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before assisting further, can you please let us know which all troubleshooting steps you performed to get the issue resolved?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform <strong><span>startup repair</span></strong> using a Windows 10 installation disk by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Startup Repair</span></strong><span> is a Windows Recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem, and then tries to fix it so your computer can
 start correctly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Startup Repair is one of the recovery tools in the System Recovery Options menu. This set of tools is located on your computer’s hard disk, and on the Windows Installation disc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are on Windows 10, I suggest you to repair your computer by creating a Windows 10 Bootable media (i.e. USB or DVD) using
</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Media Creation Tool</span></strong></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">. &nbsp;</span><span>Once you're ready with Bootable Media, follow the
 below mentioned steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Insert&nbsp;the Windows&nbsp;installation disc in the disc drive or connect USB media and&nbsp;then start the computer.</span></li><li><span>Press a key when the&nbsp;message <strong><span>Press&nbsp;any key to boot</span></strong>&nbsp;from CD or DVD appears.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your PC does not detect the media automatically </span>
<ol>
<li><span>During the&nbsp;restart process, read the screen for any instructions that explain how &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;interrupt normal startup and enter the basic input/output system&nbsp;(BIOS)&nbsp;setup utility. Most PCs use the F2, F10, ESC, or DEL key to&nbsp;begin the&nbsp;BIOS Setup.</span></li><li><span>Look for a tab&nbsp;in the&nbsp;BIOS Setup Utility that is labeled <strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Order</span></strong>,
<strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Options</span></strong>, or <strong><span>Boot</span></strong>. Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to go to the
<strong><span>Boot Order</span></strong>, then&nbsp;press <strong><span>Enter.</span></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Locate the CD,&nbsp;DVD, or&nbsp;USB flash drive (this might be called Removable Device) in&nbsp;the Boot list.&nbsp;Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow&nbsp;keys to move the&nbsp;drive up so that it appears first in the Boot list.&nbsp;Press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.&nbsp;The boot order sequence is&nbsp;now changed to boot from the CD, DVD, or&nbsp;USB flash drive.</span></li><li><span>Press <strong>F10 </strong>to save your&nbsp;changes and&nbsp;to exit the BIOS Setup Utility. Select
<strong><span>Yes</span></strong> in the confirmation window. The&nbsp;PC will <strong>
<span>restart</span></strong>. Allow the PC to restart&nbsp;normally. The scan will take a few minutes&nbsp;and remove any malware that&nbsp;may be infecting your computer.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Select a&nbsp;language, a&nbsp;time, a currency, a keyboard or another input method, and&nbsp;then click
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the&nbsp;operating&nbsp;system that you want to repair and then click <strong>
<span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong><span>Choose an option</span></strong>&nbsp;screen, select <strong>
<span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>.&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<strong><span>Advanced options</span></strong>&nbsp;from the window&nbsp;and click on
<strong><span>Startup&nbsp;repair&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>option</span></strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Write back to us with the answer to the above question and the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important:</strong> When finished, it is recommended to reboot the computer to apply the changes and after reboot proceed with
<strong>Method 2</strong>.</div>

</p><p>The error message you're seeing means that the Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant service isn't running. If you start the service in the

First and foremost, I can assure you there is nothing wrong or unusual with the hit detection in Black Ops. The reason it is being brought into question with greater frequency than in previous COD titles is because we have new features that encourage and enable
 further scrutiny than ever before (namely, Theater).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I saw a YouTube video where a player loaded a Wager Match in Theater Mode slowed down time, and showed his bullet traveling straight through his opponent's chest in One in the Chamber. Yet his opponent did not die, and winds up getting the kill instead. As
 you know, One in the Chamber is a One-Shot-Kill game mode, so the natural conclusion is that there is a bug with hit detection. In reality, it's the visual replay that is misleading you.<br />
<br />
The explanation lies within networking, and physics. The fact is, your Ping (latency between you and the Host) will affect what you think you see happening, and what actually happens in a match. Because Theater films are based on the Host's recordings of events,
 the visual disparity between what you see happening in the game from your perspective may differ from another player's (or more importantly, the Host's). This can result in occasions, like my example above, where misleading visual replays occur. Now, thanks
 to Theater, so many more people can go back, scrutinize, and upload their cases to YouTube and flood social media with questions. Whereas in past games, the debate stopped at shouting "GAH, stupid lag!" over the mic.<br />
<br />
Killcam works a little differently, but the same principles apply. Some people notice that a guy was *way* outside of Knife range, but still got the knife kill. This leads to another perception that there is problem with Knife hit detection. This can be especially
 visible in Game Winning Killcams that end with a knife, often times it looks like the knife comes nowhere near the guy, but it still gets the kill. Because especially when a player is already on the outer-boundaries of knife range, that extra half-step of
 disparity can really stick out like a sore thumb.<br />
<br />
The Bottom Line: You shouldn't use Killcam or Theater mode as justification for your kills / deaths. They are designed to be fun replay features for the game, not forensic science lab tools to make your case on YouTube and social media.<br />
<br />
Lag is something that frustrates all gamers sometimes. Network delays are a reality that all games and gamers must face. In Black Ops, we have Locale Matchmaking to help mitigate this, and are constantly refining our Host Selection and weeding out poor hosts
 over time. Ironically enough, the more you play, the better it gets!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

There is "anti-lag" in Black Ops, but it has been in the last 3 or 4 COD's as well. Black Ops is no different in this regard, and the only reasons there are perceptions the network coding has changed is because of my last response - Theater makes it so much
 easier to scrutinize and discuss the problems via Social Media than ever before.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of really smart people at Treyarch who have contributed to the technologies that power Multiplayer. I'd never challenge their intelligence on technical matters like these, and respectfully, don't think forum threads are going to teach them anything
 they don't already know either .<br />
<br />
I didn't come here to debate how the game should be made with you guys, I just wanted to shed some light on why it seems things are broken when they really are not. If there was something we could solve, we'd happily do it - just look at the Community Update
 stickies. You could argue that Host Selection / Matchmaking needs to be improved then, to match you with players closer to you to minimize lag. But that's a separate problem from "hit detection" - and, gets better over time (the more bad hosts that get host
 banned for having inadequate internet connection speeds).<br />
<br />
Host Selection and geographical matchmaking is quite good in Black Ops. Still, for players in geographically isolated areas, or areas where there aren't a ton of COD players online at the time, the game will match you into the next-closest game possible (though,
 that may wind up being a bit far away). The logic here is, it's better to get you playing than have you just sit idle in a lobby forever.<br />
<br />
<strong>JD_2020 wrote:</strong><br />
Your logic is backwards. The only person who knows precisely where you are at a given moment in the virtual space-time continuum is the Host. The Host is what is calculating the anti-lag computations. He does not extend these computations to connected clients.
 In COD, your client-side visuals are generated in realtime. You only see the result of your actions after your actions travel to the Host, the Host then accounts for anti-lag (to get as close to what you saw happen as possible), then sends a response back
 to you which will cue your game to show the outcome of your action (i.e. the enemy player dying).<br />
<br />
In Black Ops, the Host is not predicting where players will be at a specific time - it's actually rewinding the events of a match by an approximation based on your Ping, then evaluating what was happening in that match at that time, then displaying that outcome
 to the connected Clients.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

What you're experiencing is "anti-lag" - a technology introduced to the franchise many many years ago (not just Black Ops). In a world constrained by the physical limitations of networking, everyone in a match will see slightly different things (depending on
 their Ping - their latency) at slightly different time intervals. These delays are tiny (milliseconds) but in the realm of a twitch-sensitive First-Person-Shooter, the perceptions of these differences can be very impactful. So who's to say, in a given gunfight,
 what one person saw was "more right" than what the other person saw? Well, the Host is to decide - and with the help of anti-lag, he can make the fairest judgment possible (and not give the favor to either one of the players).<br />
<br />
It wouldn't be fair for the Host to be immune from this though, so anti-lag is calculated against his own actions as well. Now, network speeds and latency can fluctuate during a match so these computations aren't always consistent, but the Host's connection
 is always consistent, so he in-general may still have a *slight* host advantage, which some people can pick up on, but it's certainly better than nothing...</p>

You must be playing a different game than me then, because I'd be 100% in your corner if I could reproduce what you're seeing and... Aside from occasional lag that every gamer experiences on every game, I have a pristine experience in Black Ops.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, I can find you "Laggiest game on the Earth" threads on every major Multiplayer video game forum, ever. Halo, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Medal of Honor - they all got 'em. I'm not saying that to dismiss what you are saying; I'm telling you
 that each game's net code is different. Every other game might play perfectly for you, personally, but COD games don't. If that's the case, then it could be as simple as port forwarding or a router that handles NAT better. These are things our Customer Support
 team can help you identify.<br />
<br />
If you think Black Ops is drastically different, it's most likely a perception caused by Theater mode and the over-awareness of this perceived disparity because of it. If not, then it is a technical error that I am confident Customer Support can help you with.
 It is not a bug in the game that we need to patch... If it were, we'd happily do so to end the debate .<br />

You're never put at a disadvantage. In-fact, in-general, you'll still have more of an advantage than your counterpart if his connection is worse. The only reason you might think you're at a disadvantage is because you've psyched yourself out. What I mean is,
 if you know you're host, you're expecting to rock face because everyone thinks "It's great to be host, I'll have such an advantage!" - then when it doesn't happen, you feel like you got robbed. When in reality, you still had a slight edge still anyhow.<br />
<br />
It's a weird concept I know, which is why I never wanted to go into it in the first place haha. But it's better for the majority of players this way, I am sure of it .<br />
I did respond to that, earlier in this thread. Read all my responses, in-order, from when I started replying.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>JD_202 wrote</strong>:<br />
<br />
But in brief summary, Theater mode (which is what that was captured from) should not be used to make cases like these. There is a visual disparity between what the Host recorded during the match, and what each player did in it. Theater mode can show people
 up to a full-step ahead or behind of where they really were at a given time, making their death seem way unlikely. But in reality, it was much much closer in the match.<br />
<br />
It's just a question of, who's visual disparity should be considered more right when viewing a Theater clip, since all Theater clips are created from the Host of the match? This is why Theater should not be used to investigate things like this and make cases
 on YouTube or social media, because there can be these types of visual discrepancies. It's meant to be a fun replay feature, not a scientific lab tool heh.</p>

<p>Bottom line is &nbsp;There is a huge difference between the in game lag/gameplay and hit detection problems from Black ops and MW3 &nbsp; to W@W MW2 and cod4... it's completely different and much worse in BO and MW3 than previous.</p>

<p>You have to remember there is a lot more data being transferred between consoles on black ops and MW3 than previous games. A lot of people in the UK especially have not had any major changes to their internet speeds in that time and will obviously experience
 more lag because of this. I agree there feels like a lot more lag but when any game runs off a host setup then there is going to be some. Not saying I fully agree with Jd_2020 but U have to consider it.</p>

<p>Oh jeeze. I'm just going to start with: constantly refining our Host Selection and weeding out poor hosts over time.</p>
<p>My friend lives in the same city as I do. We group up all the time. When he gets host the game last about 5 minutes and then he drops out as host. Happened in BLOPS....happens in MW3. Yet he still gets host....several...times...a....night.</p>
<p>Oh, and we discovered another wonderful thing about MW3 and grouping up. If I play alone I can usually be competitive. If we create a xbox live party, then group up in the game we are both lucky to ever go positive. If we just group up in the game (no Xbox
 live party) then we are both able to at least compete and get positive K/D ratios. And before you jump and say K/D doesn't matter.....it does when you play team deathmatch to the exclusion of all other game types.

<p>GunSHEEP - You are spot on with your analysis of "partying up" vs "not partying up". &nbsp;Individual performance is much better when not partied up. &nbsp;What you describe has been my experience since COD4:MW. &nbsp;Not only does your analysis hold true when partying
 up with neighborhood friends (neighborhood is all fiber optic cable), it also holds true when we party up with our clan members who live from east coast to west coast. &nbsp;If you have a solution for this, please let me know!</p>

<p>Sorry, no solution. My guess is that Microsoft is applying some kind of QOS to the connection that prioritizes chat so that it isn't interrupted by other traffic. I've noticed that even downloading demos has no effect on the party chat. While in theory this
 is a good idea...in the real world you want the game traffic prioritized. Especially in FPS games. QOS will also add a small amount of lag just due to the packet processing.</p>
<p>Game chat definitely doesn't prioritize the chat channel. The quality difference between the two is very noticeable.

    <title>DICTIONARY.COM APP HACKED&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sd173  say:</h3>
<h2>            DICTIONARY.COM APP HACKED&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After the app crashed every time I opened it, I thought there might be an update I didn't see. Instead I saw this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Fixed Bugs :<br />
&nbsp;- Word of the day displays as "NaN".<br />
&nbsp;- Clicking in the description of the Hot Word crashes the application."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not really a question. I immediately uninstalled the app but other people need to know this too and I didn't know how else to do tell people.</p>

            I think it has been hacked because "Clicking in the description of the Hot Word
<strong>crashes the application</strong>" doesn't sound like a fixed bug to me. Also, why would Dictionary.com make their word of the day display as "NaN" instead of what it is supposed to be?

            <p>I think Dictionary.com fixed this problem, because my app doesn't crash anymore. But for some reason, that suspicious text is still in the "Details" section of the app store. Even more suspiciously,&nbsp;the app didn't fix itself with an update, it just didn't&nbsp;crash&nbsp;one
 day or anytime after&nbsp;that&nbsp;when I was testing to see if it worked.</p>

 Isn't the point of Microsoft Community for people who don't know anything about their problem to get help from someone who does know something?</p>

            <p>boy! LCRT has an ego problem.&nbsp; SD173, I too am experiencing problems with Dictionary.com accessed via yahoo search. When it comes up another site immediately pops up over it, disallowing use of the dictionary.&nbsp; I depend on this reference site and frustrated
 as to what is happening. If anyone knows how to reach Dictionary.com would greatly appreciate hearing from you OR if you know how to resolve the issue directly would REALLY (excuse the dramatics LCRT) appreciate receiving that info.&nbsp; I do understand that this
 is not a Microsoft issue. Hope you understand that I am not a techie type and just reached out hopefully to a site that has a few of those. Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Outlook Express has been out of production since June&nbsp;2006 and XP was the last OS to use it. Vista had Windows Mail. Win7 has no built-in e-mail client. Windows Live Mail is the successor to OE and WinMail. It runs in XP, Vista and Win7. You can use that,
 MS Outlook that comes with Office, or a third party program of your choice such as Thunderbird.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Outlook Express&nbsp; has been gone for several years. Windows XP was the<br />
last version of Windows to include it. <br />
Windows Vista had Windows Mail as its replacement (it's essentially a<br />
newer version of Outlook Express), but that is also gone in Windows 7<br />
(however it can be brought into Windows 7 from a Windows Vista<br />
machine). <br />
Windows 7 comes with <strong>no</strong> e-mail or newsgroup program. Although many<br />
people object to this, I think it's a step in the right direction,<br />
since it leaves everyone more free to choose whatever program(s) he<br />
likes best. There are many choices available, both from Microsoft and<br />
from third-parties. Some are free and some are for sale. Microsoft has<br />
Windows Live Mail (which is essentially also a newer version of<br />
Outlook Express/Windows Mail, with still another new name) available<br />
for download for free and Outlook (a different program from outlook<br />
express) available for sale, either alone or as part of Microsoft<br />
Office.</p>
<p>Some people will tell you to use Windows Live Mail; others will tell<br />
you to use Thunderbird; still others may have other recommendations.<br />
My advice is to ignore all such recommendations. I personally use<br />
Microsoft Outlook for e-mail and Fortй Agent for newsgroups, but you<br />
should try several and choose what <strong>you</strong> like best, rather than make<br />
your decision based on what I, or anyone else, likes best (or even<br />
what Microsoft suggests).</p>
