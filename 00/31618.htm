    <title>Loading a flv or mpg video with KMPlayer takes over 40 seconds - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Loading a flv or mpg video with KMPlayer takes over 40 seconds</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since upgrading to Windows 8 Pro from Windows 7, I've had a problem with my video files taking over 40 seconds to load; I currently only have mpg and flv video files and the problem occurs with both.&nbsp; Once loaded the videos run just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem occurs with my favourite program (KMPlayer) and also with Windows Media Player, Media Player Classic and Ashampoo Phot Commander X.&nbsp; It doesn't occur with&nbsp;Applian FLV player or the Metro video player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My preferred application is KMPlayer and I would be grateful if you could&nbsp;assist me in getting to work&nbsp;more quickly (as it did with the previous version of Windows).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dave Jones,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community!!!</p>
<p>Based on the case notes I understand that you are facing a performance issue while playing mpg and flv video using KMPlayer, Windows Media Player, Media Player
 Classic and Ashampoo Phot Commander X.</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the Windows Media Player settings troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong><span>Windows 8 User Interface Start screen</span></strong> select
<strong><span>control panel </span></strong>or right click on the bottom left corner on the desktop to select control panel.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>. Click on
<strong><span>view all </span></strong>and select Windows Media Player settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click next and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Perform a <span>Clean Boot and check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
<br />
Step 1: </span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes
 that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected
 service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes
 that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer
 to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 7: </span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:
<b>KMPlayer</b> <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would recommend you to post the same question in KMPlayer forum and check if it helps.<br />

            <p>One other thing to note, if the 2 charges are both pending, you'll need&nbsp;to wait a day or two for the charges to be processed and posted to your card. At that time one should drop off and disappear.&nbsp;Most companies will be unable to do anything about a duplicate charge until the charges post to the credit&nbsp;card. </p><p><br /></p><p>I have this issue happen with a number of&nbsp;different retailers, including gas stations. Day or so later, the duplicate charge disappears and all&nbsp;is right on my statement.</p>

<h2>            My alt keys do not work consistently.</h2>
                    <div>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
I am on:
<ul>
<li>Windows XP </li><li>Service Pack 3 </li><li>Nvidia graphics card </li></ul>
Problem: My alt keys do not work consistently.
<ul>
<li>If I press CTRL+Alt+DEL, this command works. If I press ALT+Enter, this command does NOT work. Some "alt codes" also work. If I press ALT+0134 it makes a cross †, but I cannot do most others.
</li><li>I have tried using both alt keys on the keyboard. They seem to be both be having the same issue, not just one. I tried plugging in a new USB keyboard, and the alt keys work fine on it with no problems at all.
</li><li>My alt keys seem to work for some commands and not others, I am wondering if anyone knows what the cause of this is. I have tried reading around forums and other places and haven't had any luck.
</li></ul>
If you need more information or have any ideas I would appreciate your help. Thank you for your time.</div>

            <p>You have a couple of choices, you can go to AMD/ATI and download the latest driver or go to Windows Updates (from the Start menu), check for updates and look in Optional Updates to see if there is&nbsp;a driver available.</p>
<p>Also with the driver you have it may give you the choice of installing the driver only without Catalyst and that might work.</p>

            If you are using a laptop you should download all&nbsp; drivers from the&nbsp; mfg's&nbsp; web site.<br />
Using Windows Updates is not advisable for graphics drivers, particularly dedicated graphics cards.<br />
<br />
Sometimes Anti-virus software or your firewall will block installs as well, so try disabling
<br />
your AV, or firewall&nbsp; temporarily.<br />

            <p>Hey there Ninja!<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear you're having issues downloading MLB 2k13. Let's see what we can do to get things sorted for you.<br /><br /><strong>To start things off, here's a couple questions to help us better understand your situation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When the download stops at 20%, does it give you any error codes or messages?</li>
<li>Are your Account Region and Console Locale both set to the same region as your physical location?</li>
</ol>
<p><br /><strong>The first thing I would check would be your region setup.</strong> You'll need to make sure that your Account Region (which you can change at account.live.com) and your Console Locale (which you can change on your dashboard by going to Settings &gt; System &gt; Console Settings &gt; Language and Locale) are both set to the same region in which you're physically located.<br /><br />Once your accounts are squared away, you'll need to go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage and delete the partial downloads before redownloading the content from your <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/view-download-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download History</a>.<br /><br />Let us know how that goes and we'll work with you from there! ^_^</p>

<h2>            GeForce Experience and Task Scheduler Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I have been trying to fix a recurring issue with my Nvidia GeForce Experience.</p>
<p>When I try to open it, a message pops up saying, "Windows task scheduler service should be running&nbsp; to continue. Please start the service and try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted solutions from reading other forum posts from both Nvidia and Microsoft:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>1. </em>Opening services.msc, and trying to run and set Task scheduler to automatic. It is already automatic, but when I try to start it just says, " The Task Scheduler service on Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically
 if they are not in use by other services or programs."</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2</em>. Opening cmd in administrator mode and using using the scannow command and restarting my computer. No files were found to be corrupted and it still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>3</em>. Opening cmd in administrator mode and using the&nbsp;<span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>DISM.exe /Online
 /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span><span>&nbsp;commands. Again, it says that no files were found to be corrupted, and nothing still works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If there is anyone willing to help me with this problem, any and all forms of help will be appreciated. I've also fully scanned my computer with Avira, and it didn't detect anything. My GeForce experience was working
 around a month ago, but now no longer works. Thank you for taking your time to read and consider my post.</span></p>

            Hi Kenneth, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />As a first step, I would recommend updating your graphics drivers to see if it fixes your issue.
<br />
<br />NVIDIA GeForce:
<br /><a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.geforce.com/drivers</a>
<br />
<br />You could also try completely uninstalling GeForce Experience through Apps &amp; Features in Settings, then reinstalling it. Sometimes an uninstall-reinstall can resolve issues like this.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />If you're still having issues, you could also try resetting your PC or restore a system restore point. If you choose to do this, you'll need to reinstall your apps:

<h2>            Being Banned From The Enforcement Team</h2>
                    
<p>I got an Xbox One for xmas im a single father to two small girls, Iv had x box live for nearly a month. I play with my twin brother and two friends and always stay in party chat never in game chat. On the 3/01/2016 i received an email to say i had been banned
 for 24 hours due to inappropriate behavour. I was really shocked I then called X box live and was told they cannot help me i had to go to enforcement history to file a case review. so i was talked into the steps on how to do it but there was no option to file
 one so i left it and just came on the next day. i received an email today at 5.18am this morning to say the exact same message from the enforcement team but this time its for 14days, I dont harm, insult or try to bully anybody i put my children to bed then
 come on the x box for a few hours in the evening to keep my mind busy. This time i do have the option to file a case review but can only do 500 characters so cant explain properly to them. I think it is quite bad that there is no one to contact via chat or
 phoneline because i have done nothing wrong and feel like a child that i have to prove iv done nothing to violate any rules and would love to see the proof of what iv supposedly done wrong. What a waste of money and time I wish i got a playstation 4 instead.
 I have previously had a 360 for 5 or 6 years never had bad reputation or a bad thing said about me then come on the x box one and had to deal with all this crap and time waste Thank you for a lovely start to the new year enforcement team &nbsp;</p>

<p>Would be nice to know what the issue was instead of being told in an automated message that it could have been 20 different things like i said there was a ban on the 3rd then 3 days later looked on my history ie messages two had been sent since then nothing
 indecent but when they take hundreds of pounds off people to play servers that arent very good anyway like being disconnected most times loads of error codes well you get my drift i also stated i have two daughetrs so wouldnt dare speak rudely so yeah they
 dont ban me for no reason so let me know but hey you can keep chuckling :)</p>

<p>Pingu is right,you don't get banned for no reason.The stars on your gamercard have nothing to do with anything now,they are to do with feedback on the 360 &amp; was broken anyway.</p>
<p>You can't file a case review on a 24 hour suspension,which it does tell you,but you can on anything longer.</p>

<p>An email is always sent to the address linked to your account explaining why you were banned.</p>

<p>I have never had a problem with my gamertag the past several years being in live chat and telephone calls always given my details and they have not had an issue with it even called x box live yesterday and asked could it have been my name and they said no,
 and it doesnt mean what u think it is. My brother made these names up on 360 and its meant to be noob but u couldnt put another character on. and im sure it did not offend you but thanks for the input and trying to spiral something into something else And
 like i said i received an automated message from an EMAIL to say it could have been a few things. And as for the no case file review because of it only being for 24 hours i was talked into the steps by x box live support and if he did not know then how was
 I. I am using my brothers home page where it comes up with his profile and mine to use so surely mine is visible on his &nbsp;and was told by GAME and live chat that it was perfectly legal to do so so how could it be my responsibility to keep an eye on my account
 when x box lets you use someone elses homepage.</p>

<p>Your tag hasn't been changed as it hasn't been reported.Doesn't matter what you meant it to think,it also means something else &amp; violates the CoC.</p>
<p>It clearly tells you that you can't ask for a case review for a 24 hour suspension.</p>
<p>Phone/chat support are nothing at all to do with xbox live enforcement but should at least be able to read.</p>
<p>Not sure what you mean by someone elses "homepage",i think you are talking about a "home" console.</p>
<p>Only way to appeal your 2nd suspension is via case review,which I posted a link to earlier.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Very Slow Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ces12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Very Slow Startup</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Dell XPS 8900 I7 desktop with Windows 10. It takes about 45 minutes to power up or restart. Once it is up, it works great. The only 3rd party software on it is Google Chrome and Adobe Reader. I let it go to sleep mode for now to avoid the slow
 start issue. Any ideas on a fix? Dell was no help as they wanted $250 for a software service agreement. I already did a clean boot per MS tech's suggestion, but it didn't resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any suggestions.</p>

<p><span>Hello Grace,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>There are a couple of things you can try to see if it helps with your screen saver not saving issue</span></p>
<p><span>1) Are you using a Microsoft Wireless mouse? If so, look at the following KB for help</span></p>
<p><span>KB 911895 - The screen saver does not work when you use a Microsoft wireless pointing device on a Windows Vista-based computer
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/911895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/911895</a></span></p>
<p><span>2) Do you have any video files in the same folder as your pictures? This could cause a problem, you can move the videos to another
</span></p>
<p><span>folder and try the screen saver with your pictures again.</span></p>
<p><span>3) Try changing your screensaver to another option, click apply and then change back to your pictures. See if that will help.</span></p>
<p><span>4) End the (ehtray.exe) process in task manager. Then try to initiating the Vista Aero display.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply back and let us know if any of these suggestions helped with your issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            How to consolidate multiple user accounts into one Admin Account&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to clean off old files from my personal home pc and it keeps telling me I need permission from the admin. I am the admin but it looks like there are a few user accounts and I just want one that can manage everything. I had to restore my pc
 from a backup recently, would that have anything to do with have more than one admin account and if so, how do I access them and consolidate the files I need into 1 admin account?

                    I have just bought a new computer and have installed Skype. Somewhere along the way I have entered wrong information and although it has loaded successfully I am unable to retrieve my information from my existing account and thus access to my contact list
 or the amount of balance and other information on my account such the set up for auto recharge etc. I have tried uninstalling the program and reinstalling and yet it somehow keeps picking up on the details from the unwanted account that I have tried to delete
 and I am unable to get back to my old account . Please help
                </div>

<h2>            What the heck is wrong with Minecraft&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So, my kids were super excited about downloading Minecraft from Xbox live, but now they are completely bummed. &nbsp;They say the controls are "backward" and it is a total "dud". &nbsp;They &nbsp;used their hard earned allowance to buy it and now they are saying it is
 a "rip-off" &nbsp;Is this just a lesson learned for my kids or is there something we don't know about the controls on the game?</p>

<p>hmm lol that is a new one. &nbsp;I'm thinking maybe they clicked in the left joystick and went to third person, there are 3 camera angles 1. first person aka you can't see you person only his hand. &nbsp;2. &nbsp;3rd person your behind his shoulder and can't really see
 were your aiming. &nbsp;3. &nbsp;is the camera is in front of your character looking back at your player. &nbsp;Im thinking they click the joystick until they landed on that one. &nbsp;So if they see there character on screen click in the left joystick to get back to the camera
 were you only see his hand, if that's not it I'm not really sure what it could be. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds like the controls are inverted. Hardcore gamers tend to prefer a control where pressing the joystick forward or up makes the character look down and vice versa. To see if this is the problem: 1)Click start, the small button in the right center of
 most controllers, 2) Move the cursor to the second option "Help &amp; Options" and press a, the green button on the right, 3) move the cursor to the third option "Controls" and click a on the controller, 4) near the middle of the screen will be a box that can
 be checked called "Invert Look". If this is checked, it means moving the cursor down will make the character look up. If it is, move the cursor down one and when "Invert Look" is highlighted hit a on the controller.
</p>
<p>Message of friend request me at coachbranden for any help.</p>

    <title>People App Sorting Anomaly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertlbradley  say:</h3>
<h2>            People App Sorting Anomaly</h2>
                    I have found a strange anomaly in the way the People App sorts titles. If I put a Dr. title in front of the first name of a doctor, sometimes it is sorted into the D's and sometime it is sorted into first or last name sequence. I would actually like to
 be able to reproduce the sequence where it is sorted by Ds so that all doctors are put into the same area. Anyone have any ideas or thoughts?

<p>I double checked my Outlook.com accounts and they are all set to First, Last for both Display and Sort too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the trouble-shooter and it did seem to find a problem with the windows store cache and fixed it; however, it hasn't changed anything that I can see yet.&nbsp; I've attached 2 snips showing my problem. First one has 2 unsorted Drs. and the second one has
 a much larger list of sorted Drs.</p>

    <title>Multiple Skype Contacts on Windows 10 Phone APP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trevorsaldanha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Skype Contacts on Windows 10 Phone APP</h2>
                    <p>I think this problem started after the Feature 2 AKA Fall Creators Update on my Lumia 950.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Skype contacts have duplicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I delete them out of Skype APP (not Desktop) on my Windows 10 laptop they get re-created even though 'Don't use my address book' to add contacts automatically is turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One Skype contact shows only Skype functions on the contact card e.g. Skype Call, Skype Video, etc.</p>
<p>The other shows Skype functions plus mobile functions e.g. call mobile, text mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have an Outlook contact card with mobile number, I don't need the Skype contact card with mobile functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I delete the Skype contact card and stop it being re-created?</p>

<p>No, it doesn't solve it at all. I actually just uninstalled both MS Jigsaw and MS Sudoku. So fed up with all the problems with these games. They've had years to solve the issues. There are plenty of other JigSaw games to choose from in the app store. games
 that actually work. I'm done with the Microsoft garbage games. Oh, and the other brand games don't ask you to pay yearly for the same ill functioning game. And if ever there's an issue with those, the makers actually solve it for you.</p>

            I figured out how to resolve this after searching for similar issues in Windows 7. &nbsp;To fix, set both the ThinkTDA.exe and Excel.exe files (in Program Files) to "Run as Administrator" on the right-click &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibility tab.
<div><br />
<div>This is apparently also the fix for making Excel 2013 work, too.</div>

                    Either get an error that says wrong profile(which it isnt) or services are down. I have seen a few posts and my friend is having the same issues so it isnt me. But xbox still hasnt released anything on it. I can't access any online game. I might have to
 go to playstation if this continues

<p>Hello Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently there is an active <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Service Alert</a></strong> which is consistent with most errors occurring in the involvement of digital items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The website allows us to notify you when the services are back up through the notify me selection in the green bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our suggestions are to follow basic troubleshooting procedures as our engineers release a patch throughout each region for all users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This process takes time, what is advised is to follow variants of <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Restarting the Console</a></strong> as in some cases the console may
 only need a fresh start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>No codes, no hints, no way of really knowing how to troubleshoot this other than to come&nbsp; ask for help.</p>

</p><p>Can't even play games offline because they wont start.</p>
<p>Probably going to honestly just sell the Xbox and get a PS4; Tired of all the little issues with this console...</p>
<p>My buddy has had PS4 since it came out and has raved about it being great ever since...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not trying to cause a havoc but really I only bought the Xbox One because I loved the 360 when it came out and wanted to re-live that but Microsoft really doesn't seem to be keeping up anymore from what i'm seeing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could at least play games I paid for offline I would probably be more patient but for it to be disabled like this is unacceptable in my opinion... Among other problems I've had throughout the last year...</p>
