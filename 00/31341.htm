<h2>            Secondary Monitor Set to 1920x01080&#59; Displays at Primary Monitor Resolution of 3840 x 2160</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">I added a Seiki SE39UY04 4K monitor to the PC&nbsp; as the primary display. It's connected via HDMI and is set at the recommended resolution of 3840 x 2160.The secondary monitor is a Samsung P2770, connected via VGA,&nbsp; and is set to
 the recommended resolution of 1920 x 1080. The graphics card is a NVIDIS GenForce GT&nbsp; 640 in a Dell 8500 running x64 Windows 8.1 Professional.

<p style="text-align: justify">

 I drag it just a little further.<br />

            <p>Thanks KB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using 4k for &nbsp;3840x2160.&nbsp;The left&nbsp;screen is&nbsp;set to&nbsp;3840x2160,&nbsp;the right&nbsp;to 1920x1080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen shot&nbsp;doesn't capture what I actually see.&nbsp; On my displays, the box (and icons) on&nbsp;the right&nbsp;are about&nbsp;twice&nbsp;as big as&nbsp;on the left, what I think is 1920x1080.</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c0e7e00-a0ab-4be8-b898-883fa7d51bd2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I drag the box a little further to the right, it will suddenly become smaller, to what I'm guessing&nbsp;is 3840x2160.</p>
<p>

    <title>mouse pointer not crossing evenly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doug136  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse pointer not crossing evenly</h2>
                    I have a two monitor desk top set up running windows 10. #1 is set up as HDMI #2 is set up VGA.&nbsp; I have settings as 1920 x 1080 (recommended) orientation Landscape, multiple displays as 'extended" The only issue I have is when dragging mouse pointer from
 screen to screen the pointer is not aligned. it will be a few inches apart up or down from one monitor to the next. Same if I am dragging a window from screen to screen. Only thing I can figure is HDMI compared to VGA rates. Anyone have a suggestion?

            Hi Doug, 
<br />
<br />I’ve seen this happen before to others. 
<br />
<br />Right click on the background, then click personalize. Click on Display. Make sure 1 and 2 are positioned correctly. The photo I attached is an example of an incorrect setup...but I wanted to show an example. Move them around, and then snap them back together. See if there’s any difference with your mouse crossing. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

    <title>Some icons too small in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> handoflogan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some icons too small in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi. So I have Windows 10 on my laptop and for the most part everything is fine. The text scale on some items seemed a bit off but didn't interfere with any functionality.<br />
Like the Power Point or Word opening screen:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc687973-5959-41fd-a672-2d1f8c543035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc687973-5959-41fd-a672-2d1f8c543035" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Then I started up another program for my java programming class called Eclipse:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ca64cd9-5472-41f4-951e-87e81b97deed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ca64cd9-5472-41f4-951e-87e81b97deed" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The toolbar at the top is unusable. The icons are way too small for me to have any idea what they represent. I have tried to resize the screen, to zoom in, to go into display and change to the size of everything, to change just the size of text of certain
 parts. Nothing enlarges any of those icons, I can get the File... etc bar to enlarge but that doesn't help with the other bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I fix this so I can read the icons without having to use magnifier each time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>As you already mentioned that you tried the "resize the screen, to zoom in, to go into display and change to the size of everything, to change just the size of text of certain parts" and as of now you use the Magnifier, please try to run the program in compatibility
 mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Right click the&nbsp;application file&nbsp;and select Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the compatibility tab, go to compatibility mode, tick the Run the program in compatibility mode for: select the windows operating system you want the driver to run in. (Windows 7/8/8.1)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then we would kindly ask you to contact the Eclipse support, as they&nbsp; might be able to assist you further in this regard.</p>

            I tired running it in compatibility mode, but the icons remained small. I don't think this is a problem with the eclipse program because other things on my computer are displayed very small. Again, the Microsoft powerpoint, word, excel all start up with
 small squares in the middle and when my Norton program pops up box showing status, it is also very tiny. While it doesn't effect anything, it proves it's not a bug with Eclipse but has something to do with a computer-wide issue. I also ran the Microsoft PP
 and Word in compatibility mode and the boxes remained small.

    <title>Surface tiles not opening or responding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jojozu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface tiles not opening or responding</h2>
                    <p>My pc settings won't open, neither will the internet tile. I am having to use my surface in desktop mode.&nbsp; I have taken all documents and photo's off the surface in case there&nbsp;is a storage issue, but it hasn't made any difference.</p>
<p>I want to set it back to factory settings, but I am unable to go into PC setting to enable me to do this.&nbsp; I don't know whether there has been a problem with updates or if it is to do with my network!&nbsp; But I have no idea how to sort this out!
</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thank you. JojoZU</p>

</p><p>The first thing I'll suggest we try is to ensure your Surface is fully up to date both Windows and firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please go over the steps below and let us know your outcome afterwards:</p>

            <p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description, you are getting blue screen error. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are unable to open the link provided by you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you made any recent change on your system prior to this issue?</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the make and model of your system?</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you getting any error message/ error code on your screen?</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the methods given below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To diagnose whether this issue occurs in <strong>
“Safe Mode”</strong>, let’s reboot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. This helps us in identifying whether the issue is due to some
 third party programs conflict. The word Safe mode appear in the concern of your monitor to identify which windows mode you are using.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the steps given below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type settings in search and click on Settings.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>Update and recovery</strong>, and then tap or
<strong>click Recovery.</strong></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Under Advanced startup, tap or click Restart now.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Once your PC restarts, on the Choose an option screen, tap or click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you don't see the Startup Settings option, tap or click
<strong>advanced options.</strong></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Tap or click <strong>Startup Settings.</strong></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Tap or click Restart.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>On the Startup Settings screen, choose the <strong>
Safe Mode.</strong></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Sign in to your PC with a user account that has
<strong>administrator rights.</strong></span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. Check this issue in clean boot state.</span></span></p>

<strong>Disable</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Close Task Manager.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the <strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong>OK</strong>, and then restart the computer. </span></li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer

<p><span>July 30, 2015 -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgraded from Win 7 Pro to Win 10.</span></p>
<p><span>Following Week - &nbsp;&nbsp; Hard Disk Failure.</span></p>
<p><span>Next Couple of weeks – Replaced Hard Disk; Used recovery disks to reinstall Win 7.</span></p>
<p><span>Next – Upgraded again to Win 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since then I have been getting the Bluescreen error. This usually occurs within a short time after AM startup and will restart the computer after gathering info. After the restart, the computer usually runs OK until it is shut
 down and restarted the next day.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have tried a couple of fixes as follows but have not resolved the problem.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Today I copied memory.dmp before Blue Screen Error and renamed it as memory01.dmp.</span></p>

<h2>            making fonts bold therefore easier to read</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been reading some of the comments about later editions of Windows 10 home, having "improvements" which effectively make life harder for some users, myself included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a mild visual impairment and need to have fonts in <strong>BOLD for ease of reading/eyesight on most websites.</strong>&nbsp; I see this (pun intended) as an accessibility issue, and I am sure I am not alone in making this request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any options besides enlarging the font size, to make all fonts seen in
<strong>BOLD?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>And does Mircosoft really care about accessibility issues for those who have mild/moderate issues?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>warm regards</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hello Mike</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your prompt reply and helpful advice.&nbsp; &nbsp;I called my&nbsp;computer techie, and he has helped me enable some further enhancements to hold some types which are proving useful it itself.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Given that I use Google Chrome browser, he also tweaked&nbsp;those settings, however, still not able to bold type most fonts on websites other than enabling a Right click to provide some contrast.&nbsp; As mentioned above, it is something inbuilt into most
 websites today.&nbsp; I wonder why webmasters make life difficult for some users?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We also enabled <strong>Winareo</strong>&nbsp;tweaker a small programme which gives some further tweaks and which is also useful.&nbsp; &nbsp;As you can see from this sample thee is quite a difference between font samples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks again.</p>
<p><span>warm regards</span></p>
<p><span>Maureenc</span></p>
<p><span>PS - I will also post this isse in Chrome browser community forums and see if there are any further enhancements which can be made.</span></p>

<h2>            Extremely slow Internet browsing in Vista wireless</h2>
                    I was using wireless network connection on my Dell Inspiron 6400 laptop for months without any problems. Suddenly, three days ago I started having a problem - my computer still sees and connects to all wireless networks, but the Internet browsing is extremely
 slow. My browser (I.E.8, Firefox and others)would see the web page, but it takes forever to download it. Most of the time the I.E.8 simply gives up and says that it can not connect to this web page. My computer has Dell LAN wireless card, so I tried to use
 different external USB wireless card - the same result. The speed of the network connection is 10 Mb, so it should not a problem. I tried for two days different solutions - checked my LAN settings, disabled the antivirus software (Microsoft Essentials)&nbsp;etc.
 Long story short, I have found that the only thing that works for me is to restart the Network Store Interface Service. Once I restart it, everything returns to normal and browsing is fast again... untill I restart my com

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Does this happen when you use&nbsp;the ethernet cable connection too?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file.<br />
The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or corrupted system files and repairs them.<br />
To do this, follow these stepsf ollow the steps mentioned in the article below.<br />
<strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.<br />
</strong>I would ask you to perform a clean boot and check if any third party application is causing the conflict.<br />
a. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password, Or click Continue.<br />
b. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
c. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup items check box.<br />
d. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
e. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
f. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>g. Also you need to uninstall and reinstall the problem software on your computer.<br />
Reset the computer to start as usual <br />
h. After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
i. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
j. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</div>
<div><br />
Hope this helps.</div>

<p>Hi Shekhar,</p>
<p>I did run SFC before and it didn't find any problems. I ran it again today - and again it didn't report any problems.</p>
<p>I always kept my start up configuration and running services&nbsp;to a minimum and didn't expect any problems on this part. In any event, I restarted my computer as you suggested via msconfig with disabled start up and non-Microsft services. The problem was there
 as before. So, it is not any third party software.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I had everything running smoothly for many months. When the problem suddenly occured a few days ago, I was not installing or updating&nbsp;any new software or changing any configurations. The only thing I did the previous day was Windows
 update, which installed Update for Windows Vista (KB982519), Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, Windows Vista SP2, and Windows Server 2008 SP2 Update x86 (KB982525), and Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile for Windows Vista x86 (KB982670). Plus daily
 Definition updates for Microsoft Security Essentials. That was it. And suddenly, next day&nbsp;- there was a problem with extremely slow browsing. I tried to uninstall Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile for Windows Vista x86 (KB982670), since it was a recommended
 update, not important as others - but it didn't help.</p>
<p>The problem is not with the outside network signal - it is always strong and connection is relatively fast (10 Mb). Plus others do not have this issue. It is not the computer hardware - I have the same problem with the internal Dell WLAN mini-card and external
 USB wireless card (and cable -&nbsp;to a lesser extent, since the speed is much higher). It looks like something in the Windows network system configuration runs into conflict or installs incorrectly, which slows dramatically the Internet connection. I can snap
 it out of this crawl by restarting the wireless services (specifically, Network Store Interface Service). It worked for me in the last three days, but today it was not very successful. Or sometimes (not always), I can switch from internal wireless adapter
 to external USB, and it would again snap my computer from the crawl and Internet browsing works fine for a little while. And all the time when I restart my computer or wake it from sleep, it goes back to the almost non-existent Internet browsing. It is interesting
 that the Web pages are recorgnised almost immediately, but it takes forever to load them. I wish there was a way to cleanly repair that part of Vista software. Although it might be some other Windows components that run interferance with networking. I checked
 the Task Scheduler and it looks like it is running a lot of things, which I do not even recorgnise. I wanted to try to disable it, but all controls (in the Properties) were completely grey and wouldn't provide any way to influence it.</p>
<p>Well, I hope may be you will be able to find a new solution for me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I have spent the entire week trying to figure out how to resolve my Internet connection problem. Checked all settings (including LAN settings in Internet Options etc.), disabled Windows Firewall, removed all Antivirus software, uninstalled all recent updates
 that I had just before the problem occurred, reset TCT/IP and Winsock settings, ran System File Checker and OneCare scan, ran several different&nbsp;Antivirus scans, updated all network drivers, reset all network adapters etc. Nothis was working.</p>
<p>Finally, I installed all settings for IP addresses Manualy, instead of leaving it in "Obtain IP addresses Automatically". And it worked!!!!! Now I have my Internet connection functioning perfectly with Manual settings for about 4 days.&nbsp;However, as soon as
 I switch to Automatic mode, everything goes back to a crawl.&nbsp;I had this switching done probably a dozen times and it is like a clock - working with Manual and bad connection with Automatic.</p>
<p>Even though I can work now with my Internet on Manual settings, I still would like to understand why my system is having a problem with Automatic settings mode.</p>
<p>Any ideas? I would appreciate some suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>browsers have dropped their support for older systems....as a result their updates will not include those older systems....this could cause conflict as the internet moves forward in favor of newer systems.....you'll notice all the newer updates are for .net
 services beyond both Vista, and XP.....many sites load Flash ads....the sites might actually 'hang' because the browsers no longer support much of Flash in favor for HTML 5 instead....although no one will admit it, this is also done to 'force' the consumer
 to spend money on upgrading to newer systems....gaming systems do the same thing....it's all in the coding, and older systems have been deliberately coded out</p>

    <title>keyboard layout switches by itself to US-international - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard_brown  say:</h3>
<h2>            keyboard layout switches by itself to US-international</h2>
                    <p>I have several languages installed, each with a single keyboard. Two varieties of English are installed, US and UK, but they both use the same US English keyboard. After&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;10 Pro updated to build 10586.36, the system started switching from time to
 time to&nbsp;the US-International keyboard, and this leads to mistakes in typing. I never selected that keyboard for any language, and if I look at the language and keyboard settings, it is not specified there either. Yet it is on the taskbar language input methods
 list as a second keyboard for US English. I've been unable to remove it. I tried going to language settings, selecting this keyboard, then later deselecting it, but that did not succeed in removing it.&nbsp;I see that similar problems are mentioned elsewhere on
 the web. Does anyone have a solution?</p>

            <p>Thanks. I tried this (assuming in point (g) you meant to remove the UK keyboard). This seems to be a problem with Windows 10. The only way I can remove the US Intl keyboard is to restart the system. Then it is gone. But it reappears after a while. If I look
 at the language settings, this keyboard is not present, even though it is present on the language bar. That would be a minor problem, if the system did not suddenly switch to the US Intl Keyboard while typing English..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like previous versions, Windows 10 allows keyboard shortcuts to switch between languages. I use these to switch between various languages. But when the US Intl keyboard suddenly appears, while typing English, the shortcuts cease working as well. Restarting
 the computer returns the language bar to normal function, but only for a short time.</p>

<h2>            Contacts&#58; Missing buttons on toolbar, but no &#34;contacts&#34; folder template option</h2>
                    
<div><span>Hello,&nbsp; </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Am running Vista Home Premium SP2 and IE 8 on a 2-week old Dell xps 1340 laptop.&nbsp; I am another newbie to Vista and getting adjusted to Windows Mail and Contacts, coming from XP Pro and Outlook Express/Address
 Book on a different pc.&nbsp; </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Initial setup of Windows Mail went well, importing messages and contacts from the OE/AB data I'd backed up.&nbsp; Problem now is that, in the Contacts folder, I'm missing several buttons&nbsp;on the toolbar&nbsp;(New
 Contact, New Contact Group, Import, Export).&nbsp; The only buttons I have now are&nbsp;Organize, View, Burn.&nbsp; I need a way to export the contacts to a .csv file.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>I've seen many posts about this problem, but the fix doesn't work for me.&nbsp; I tried selecting "Contacts" under "Use this Folder Type as a Template", within Customize This Folder.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;I don't have
 a Contacts option in the drop down.&nbsp; My only options are:&nbsp; Documents, Pictures and Videos, Music Details, Music Icons.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Related Information -- Possible Clues: &nbsp;(I'm afraid this is a mess)</span></div>
<div><span>(1) On my prior pc, I frequently backed up to an EHD, including email messages and contacts (address book in O/E).&nbsp; I did this by using a temporary folder ("ToBackup"), copying files/folders to be backed
 up into it, then copying the entire ToBackup folder to the EHD.&nbsp; The first time I tried this on the Vista pc, I made the mistake of copying the Contacts folder&nbsp;(folder, not individual .con files) to this ToBackup folder.&nbsp; BTW, the location of the Contacts
 folder is c:\users\owner\contacts, which I believe is standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when I say "copy", I do mean copy, not move.&nbsp; Anyway, I copied that Contacts folder (green icon) into an empty regular folder I created called Contacts, within my ToBackup folder.&nbsp; This
 resulted in the (green icon) Contacts folder within ToBackup/Contacts&nbsp;&nbsp;being totally empty -- no .con files at all.&nbsp; The original Contacts folder in c:\users\owner is intact with all .con files.&nbsp; However -- it is missing the buttons on the toolbar that I reference
 at the start of this post.</span></div>
<div><span>I attempted to delete the empty Contacts folder in ToBackup and got several warning messages from Windows so I cancelled and left it there (being cautious - didn't want to worsen the mess).&nbsp; Bottom line,
 I now have 2 Contacts folders (green icon):&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; one in the standard location (c:\users\owner) with all .con files but missing the toolbar buttons and the fix for that doesn't work due to no option for "Contacts" in "Customize this Folder"; and (b) another
 in ToBackup/Contacts with no .con files.&nbsp;&nbsp;With (b), it was originally missing the toolbar buttons as well, but&nbsp;(out of curiosity) I tried "Customize this Folder"&nbsp; and "Contacts" was an option as the template to use, and it worked -- all buttons now present--
 but, of course,&nbsp;the folder is useless anyway due to no .con files.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>BTW,&nbsp;to backup I&nbsp;now copy the .con files at file level, not entire&nbsp;folder level (open Contacts and select all .con files and copy them).&nbsp; Seems to work fine and not mess anything up.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>(2) Now, when&nbsp;I select the Contacts button on the main screen of Windows Mail, it comes up completely empty&nbsp;(seems it is referencing the folder in ToBackup-- item b in above paragraph).&nbsp; So to use contacts
 I need to navigate to item (a) in above paragraph - in the Owner folder- the one with missing toolbar buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I created a shortcut to it on the desktop.)</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>(3) Last part.&nbsp; This new Dell/Vista laptop had&nbsp;a "initial setup" done at the retailer where I purchased it (removed free trials, junkware, applied updates, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;In that process,&nbsp;what appears to be an
 "Owner" folder was put on the desktop.&nbsp; (A folder, not a shortcut.)&nbsp; I assumed this was standard&nbsp;for Vista.&nbsp;&nbsp;This desktop&nbsp;"Owner" &nbsp;folder does not appear when exploring the C drive and navigating to users\owner\desktop, ie. the contents of&nbsp; the "desktop" folder
 do not contain an "Owner" folder.&nbsp; Yet it physically appears as a folder on the desktop (not shortcut).&nbsp; When right-clicking on the Owner folder sitting on the desktop, it has no properties option -- just "open, explore, open command prompt, copy, create shortcut,
 delete" .&nbsp; Upon opening it, it's not a standard folder... right-clicking in the open space at right has no properties, just "view, sort, stack, refresh" and it has "Customize this Folder" a message with a red X and "desktop" in the title bar and says "properties
 for this item do not exist".&nbsp; In it's contents it shows 2 Contacts folders -- one indicates a folder path of c:\owner and the other has folder path pointing to the ToBackup folder.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Sorry for this long post.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could anyone&nbsp;kindly help straighten out my Contacts mess..... and (ideally) end up with only one Contacts folder within c:\users\owner which has all proper toolbar buttons?&nbsp;
 Also, is the "owner" folder appearing on the desktop (item 3 above) supposed to be there -- since it's not truly a folder, don't understand it's purpose, can it be safely deleted? &nbsp;Thanks SO much in advance.</span></div>

            Hi Gloria, thanks so much for the prompt, helpful response.&nbsp; Yes, I'd thought about doing a system restore too --&nbsp; thinking that it's&nbsp;just too much of a mess to&nbsp;safely resolve with individual, manual actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've identified a date I would use, which
 is just prior to when I copied the contacts icon folder.&nbsp; I'm also thinking about moving to WLM, which is already installed on this laptop since it is so new.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, I installed WLM on another pc that I use as a backup system, and, from brief playing
 around,&nbsp;I really like it so far.&nbsp; :)<br />
<br />
Additional questions:<br />
<br />
-- If I did a system restore now&nbsp;-- &nbsp;I understand that&nbsp;the process&nbsp;normally leaves personal data alone.&nbsp; The "extra" contacts folder I have in the "ToBackup" folder is personal data, and I would use a restore data prior to when I copied it there.&nbsp; So, would
 the system restore leave it in the ToBackup folder (since that folder is personal data), or remove it from ToBackup since it may consider the contacts icon folder as system-type data?<br />
<br />
-- If I want to go to WLM, would you recommend doing that now or after I did the system restore?&nbsp; I am leaning toward after the system restore, since my current situation could cause unpredictable results with the WLM install and migration of data?<br />
<br />
-- In moving from WM to WLM, is&nbsp;using an exported&nbsp;.csv file&nbsp;the only possible method of transferring contacts?<br />
(Right now I have no way of exporting a .csv from contacts since I don't have that button on the folder that contains contacts, and I have no way to get it there, as explained in first post.)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

<p>I would try a power cycle. To do that press the power button for ten seconds. After the console shuts down unplug the power cord for at least a minute. Than put the power cord back in and restart the console. After that the game maybe will Show up again
 in the ready to install section. If not try to delete the profile. Repeat the power cycle and redownload your profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If this won't solve the issue try a factory reset. There will be an option to keep your games and apps.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the versions for PC and Xbox are different for that game, as in not fully being Xbox Play Anywhere, so that could be the cause.</p>
<p>You own the PC version but not the Xbox One version perhaps?</p>

<p>Hi Vincenzo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. As WPAK stated which could be the case as there is a PC version and Xbox version. If you think it is the Xbox version, please make sure you are signing in on the exact same account as the one on the PC. If it is available
 on the PC it will be on the console. Try <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a> the console and check ready to install after the console powers back up. If you are on the same account, and still having issues, go to
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders?refd=support.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
order history</a> and look for the purchase of the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>Today I had two talk about my problem, the first using the chat and the second by phone: the answer is the same: I have bought the PC version of the game. But I have played the game on Xbox!! (see picture below). "Maybe you have played a demo"...But&nbsp; according
 to the dates (purchased the 25 november and achievements obtained on 1st december, I should have played the demo AFTER the game purchase (nonsense). By the way, currently there is no demo of quantum break for Xbox one!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, probably I'm a real quantum_breaker!!! I purchased the game for Xbox, I've played it, then I went back on time, I asked for a reimboursement and then purchased the PC version!! seriously, I have no idea of what was happened with this game!</p>
<p>Any suggestion?</p>
<p>thans in advance and have a nice evening!</p>
<p>

<p>This is a real <a href="https://mandelaeffect.com/berenstein-or-berenstain-bears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Berenstein vs Berenstain situation.</a>&nbsp; I would say make sure that you go through your Order History at your<a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Microsoft Account</a> under Payments &amp; Billing and find the purchase.&nbsp; From
 there, click on the item and it should take you to the store item that was purchased.&nbsp; That will identify what the purchase was, Win10 or Xbox One. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's PC, then is it possible that you played a copy someone else owned while they signed in, or had the console set to their Home Console?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The achievements aren't going to be a helpful guide, as the PC and Xbox versions share achievements, even though they are not Play Anywhere.&nbsp; Meaning that if you only played the PC version, you'd unlock the same achievements you would if you only played
 the Xbox version, and vice versa; they are a shared pool of achievements, so no double dipping with this game.</p>

<h2>            meltdown patch related question.</h2>
                    <p>I was able to go through some hoops and was able to get the latest microcode for my Intel kaby lake processor loaded using this Vmware windows driver tool. However there doesn't seem to be a way to enable the windows patch on the fly unfortunately. Is there
 anyway to get windows to enable the meltdown patch after boot up?&nbsp; I do hear the patch is being pulled because of the AMD issue so who knows now totally. I was mainly trying to do this so on old machines with no hope of a BIOS update anytime soon could be
 patched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I get this on the patch test.</p>

            I can do that.. the Vmware driver is not really virtualization per say just a tool that loads microcode to the CPU dynamically on the system. Sort of like what linux does.

<h2>            Provisioning Operations for Skype for Business</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are going to start using Skype for Business Online early next year, and are preparing all day-to-day operational tasks we have to perform. &nbsp;We will be using Azure AD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to know if there are any Operations Guides etc that talk about how to provision/de-provision a S4B user, change their conferencing plan, etc. &nbsp;I guess we would use PowerShell for all these activities, and I know there are commands like New-CsUser
 that we will probably use, but I'm looking for overall provisioning/operations documentation that might contain commands like those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <span>Hi Pari,<br />
<br />
To let a user use Skype for Business in your organization, you just need to assign one Skype for Business Online license to this user. As an admin, you can refer to the article below to assign a license to a user:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Assign-or-remove-licenses-for-Office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business</a><br />

    <title>My printer only prints pink - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ecka  say:</h3>
<h2>            My printer only prints pink</h2>
                    My printer started printing only pink and I changed the cartridge, but it still only prints pink. It works if I print just black as black but if i do black and white the white part turns out pink.&nbsp; Is there a way I have changed my dominant color to pink?
 How can I fix this? <br />
Thanks<br />

            Hi ecka,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Which cartridge did you change?&nbsp; If the only color that is printing is pink; there is some type of issue with the color ink cartridge.&nbsp; Color ink cartridges contain three colors.&nbsp; Magenta (Pink), Yellow, and Cyan (Blue).&nbsp; It looks like with your printer, the
 yellow and cyan are not printing.&nbsp; This could be due to low ink levels, a clogged print nozzle, or some other hardware issue.&nbsp; If you did replace the color ink cartridge and are still having the problem, you should have a print nozzle cleaning function that
 came with the printer software or driver.&nbsp; Try running this a couple of times, and see if it resolves the issue.&nbsp; Did you just buy the cartridge that you replaced or has it been sitting around for a while?&nbsp; Please let us know.&nbsp; Thank you.

                    <p>Since upgrading from windows 7, I can't seem to burn disks. The system recognizes the disk and goes to the drag files screen.</p>
<p>I tried sharing,and there is a burn button but it does nothing. The drive reads fine and worked great under 7. what am i doing wrong?</p>

            <p>Same issue here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirmed my lite-on blu ray driver is up-to-date - model DH-4o1s.&nbsp; Driver is from 2008, but seems to be the most current.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Tunes 12 doesn't recognize a CD/DVD ROM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can insert a CD and it plays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a playlist, and click to burn, but it tells me it'll burn once I put in a blank CD (which I've tried, 5 different ones [yes, they're CD-R]).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, I'm not sure if it's just Win 10 not recognizing it (because of the I Tunes error) or because it's so old WMP can't burn to CD's for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 8/27/15: I put a new Blu Ray combo player in and it burned right away. &nbsp;My old one must have been messed up. &nbsp;Anyhow, it works no issues now. &nbsp;Just thought I'd update this in case anyone else was/is having issues.</p>

I am also experiencing the same situation. I checked my computer for compatibility. I had windows 7 and I wanted to upgrade. I have windows 10 now, and it is super nice and very easy to navigate. The only problem is I can not burn, files, pictures, or my music.
 I think windows 10 system still needs some work. &nbsp;

            I'm in the same boat. I guess we have to get a third party software burning tool, unless they come up with something within windows 10, maybe Windows media player?

            Same issue.&nbsp; Drive appears to work fine, says I am copying to disk, but the burn button does not work.&nbsp; If I hit the eject button it tells me it is reading the disk to be read on other computers but when done, and disk comes out, it does not look like
 anything was actually written to it.&nbsp; I put it back in it seems the data is there, but in the past that is only on this computer and when taken to others it is blank.&nbsp;

            <p>While doing some research on this problem, I found that Microsoft did not include any CD/DVD burning software in Windows 10.&nbsp; You are expected to get your own third party software for this purpose.&nbsp; I have also found that any drives dating back beyond some
 date around 2012 may not be compatible.&nbsp; You may have found that you should also invest in a third party backup software if you want to make an image backup other than using the old Windows 7 Backup still included in Windows 10.&nbsp; I would expect it to go away
 some time in the future.&nbsp; You can only restore the Windows 7 backup with a Windows 10 Restore Flash drive.&nbsp; Your old Windows 7 rescue disk will not work.</p>
<p>Another note:&nbsp; Be careful using repair software from Tweaking.com for Windows 10.&nbsp; It is good but I found that it makes changes to the Windows.old folder instead of the Windows folder.&nbsp; I found this out when I could not make a Windows 10 Recover disk.&nbsp; I
 tried to delete Windows.old folder but security is too tight.</p>
<p>Oh the joys of being first with new operating systems!</p>

    <title>My Music folder missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmbp52  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Music folder missing</h2>
                    I have just installed Windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; After I completed the install and migrated my settings to the new computer from a Vista install on my old PC, I tried to move the My Music folder to a folder on a network drive.&nbsp; No idea what happened, but there
 is no longer a My Music folder available - the one on the network drive doesn't have a location tab and I cannot locate it elsewhere.<br />
<br />
In the Library, nothing.&nbsp; Probably for an entirely separate reason it won't allow me to add the folder on the network drive to the library because it is not indexed.<br />
<br />
I can see the reference to the My Music folder in <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</strong>, and it looks just like the other default personal folders there&nbsp;but otherwise no trace of it.&nbsp; All other
 folders are OK.<br />
<br />
Can someone guide me how to simply restore the My Music folder as a default?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.

<p>Hey dmbp52,</p>
<p>If you remember a file name&nbsp;from the missing&nbsp;folder, try searching for it from where you can trace the location of the entire folder. Otherwise you can update your media library and see if the files come show up. This way you can locate the folder on the
 computer. If you still can't find the folder, then you can add the ones from the network folder by indexing the folder. To index the folder, make the folder offline.</p>
<p><strong>To make files or folders available offline:</strong></p>
<p>While connected to the network, locate the network file or folder that you want to make available offline.</p>
<p>Right-click the file or folder, and then click Always available offline.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To confirm that the file or folder is available offline, right-click the file or folder and make sure that a check mark appears next to Always available offline.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you no longer want a network file or folder to be available offline, right-click the file or folder, and then click Always available offline to clear the check box.</p>
