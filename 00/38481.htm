<h2>            Recovery partition damaged</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone this past few days have been really bad(My pc crashed twice and lost all my files twice). I finally got a dvd of windows8.1 pro&nbsp;and installed it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After installing windows8.1 I discovered that hp recovery manager was gone and my recovery partition was damaged(I cant find the software online). I have gone to different forums looking for a way to create a recovery partition but they need me to reinstall
 windows8.1 again to take a screenshot which I don't want to do. I have tried Acronis true image and Acronis start up recovery manager and it does not seem to work(I even ended up formatting the bad recovery partition!). Please any ideas? How can I get the
 recovery partition back?&nbsp;Would the refresh options and reset options still work in windows8.1?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery partition is provided by the computer manufacturer, so that you can recover the computer back to the factory settings. If none of the troubleshooting works and once you have&nbsp;reset the computer to factory settings, your computer will work as brand
 new computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have performed clean installation of Windows 8.1, then you will not be able to find recovery partition on your computer. Once after performing clean installation of any Operating System, you will not be able to create a new recovery partition. You
 will have to contact your computer manufacturer for a recovery disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may perform refresh and reset by using the Windows 8.1 Installation disc. For further information about restore, refresh and reset, you may refer to the following Microsoft Help article.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning: Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the
<span>Windows</span> Store will be reinstalled. <span>Windows</span> puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.
</p>
<p>Warning: All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. All apps that you installed will be removed. Only apps that came with your PC will be reinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have seen this time and again and I will tell you why this is happening. Microsofts released update of 8.1 corrupts the access to your recovery partition on all Asus notebooks. It
 deletes the access to them and makes it unrecoverable. That's what no one is telling you all here. I have spoken to Asus many times. And microsoft doesn't want to admit that they screwed up royally. They are at fault for everyone losing access to the only
 way that all of us who own Asus notebooks can recover their system if anything goes wrong with our systems. I to had serious issues go down with my system. I had the com surrogate issue and needed to factory reset my Asus 501A and realized that my notebook
 couldn't recover anything at all. Not even from a back up or my jump drive that i had made in case of emergencies. I have spent hours calling Asus and researching online trying to find answers. And i finally got them and was in disbelief when i discovered
 that microsoft was the reason that my $400 computer that was only a year old was basically garbage now. And you think they would be helpful in trying to resolve my issue? No they were not. I am a disabled single parent. There is no way i can afford to go out
 and replace it. It was a gift. So now i am stuck on my daughter 6 year old computer that barely runs. Its ridiculous. So i am sorry to say its a losing battle cause microsoft doesn't care what happens really. They just place the blame on Asus and its not their
 programming that caused this problem. It was the release of 8.1.</span></p>

<p>do you please have any idea of how can MV C++ 2012 x64 Redistributable be repaired or reinstalled on Windows 10, when it says everytime when trying to repair or uninstall:</p>

<p>When restarting, nothing is happening, I still can neither uninstall, nor repair this programme. And I need to get this working because of installing some Autodesk programmes. Can it be, please, somehow forcibly removed and uninstalled?</p>

            <p>Thank you for a very quick response. I have tried practically all you described, but nothing worked really... When I&nbsp; finally uninstalled MV C++ 2012 x64 and wanted to install it again (actually I have reinstalled all versions of MV C++), but still having
 troubles with the mentioned one. Now, I cannot install it. Therefore maybe the troubleshooter finds nothing, since it´s not installed. Not having any other idea. Maybe completely reinstall Windows could help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have just tried system restore and have to say that it did not work at all. Sad to say this, especially when this is a new PC and I need to run the 3D CAD Software on this. I suppose I need to return it back. What is truly remarkable is that first I installed
 the system, it worked well, everything, even 3D CAD, but I had to do the system restore right after that because after windows updates, the system permanently disabled the all firewall, antivirus, antispyware, everything, there was just nothing to do with
 that... Sad to say this and even though I´ll try return this back, I believe the software is responsible for this. Could that be the MV C++ 2012 Update 4, which could be faulty??</p>
<p>Thanx</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just wanted to write a brief text to the issue, I´ve experienced... Since I could not have done anything which could help to solve that, I bought another PC. On the first one, everything has started to go wrong after the update to 1511 Windows 10, not
 a clue why. The second one had the older version as well, so it was going to be updated to 1511 as well. Nothing similar has still happened, everything has been working fine this week. I haven´t tried to reinstall x64 or x86 C++ MV 2012, because I do not want
 to risk any troubles, but all CAD programmes are running without any difficulties as it seems... I´m writing this to say and confirm that the problem was not on one side solved yet, bud on the other it was not pretty easy to deal with that... Maybe some really
 tricky HW/SW compatibility, at least for me...</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks guys for your quick and pleasant help. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jiri</p>

<p>I was trying to install Titanfall 2 through Origin when I got an error, I followed the instructions on EA's website to try and fix it which led me to the redistributable which then gave me the 0x8007015e error. &nbsp;I tried downloading the update and it didn't
 fix anything.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Disable Extended Display in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disable Extended Display in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if there was a way to disable extended display in Windows 10.&nbsp; Sometimes, when a user logs in, the displays are extended instead of duplicated. I have made sure that the duplicate option was selected in the display settings under the admin
 login and user login for the users that use them the most. Even after doing this, the users still experience the issue from time to time. I have updated all the driver and made sure that Windows 10 was up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not looking for help on troubleshooting the issue as it would be quicker if there was a reg hack or something in Win10 to just disable the feature. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 network connection issues Alienware Area 51 &#40;2009&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Alienware area 51 (2009) and installed windows 10 from 7 but now my network connection drops after a few minutes to an hour+ and i have to re-connect or re-plug in the Ethernet cord to reset the connection. &nbsp;I have tried to reinstall the network
 drivers but that did not stop the problem as they have not updated drivers for the Alienware area 51 since 2012 or 2013 and discontinued support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway i can fix this problem while keeping windows 10?</p>

            <p>I have a 2010 &nbsp;Alienware Aurora and have just upgraded from W7 to W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet connection also drops randomly with the only solution to disable and enable / unplug / replug etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems this may be an alienware issue since our machines are no longer supported :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another little bug I found is when I shut-down, sometimes everything shuts down (monitor, keyboard, mouse etc) except the tower, and I am forced to hard shut-down...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this isn't fixed soon I may be forced to revert to W7</p>

            <p>Downgrade your driver to the one on the Dell support page.&nbsp; The driver that comes with W10 is rubbish and the connection will die at a random interval and make the system somewhat wonky.&nbsp; You may have to force install in compatibility mode for W7 x64 but
 mine just worked installing over top of the build drivers.&nbsp; The jraid.sys driver is also not W7 compatible.&nbsp; W10 comes with a working RAID driver and just install Intel RST.&nbsp; Very few drivers needed out of the box for the A51... just TactX keyboard, graphics,
 Broadcom driver 12.4.0.3 dated 2009, and the SiL driver for SATA.&nbsp; Command Center is iffy but go here:

                    Hi I was wondering if the gamertag Bloo, (Capital B, lower case L and 2 lower case O’s) was taken because when you try to change your name to it it says it is unavailable but when you search for the player with that name no one appears at all. Is it available
 for use?

<p>To clarify what Njal the Blue is saying in his post&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do a search the you have to put it in exactly as the person entered it into the system the problem is the system on the back end does not see capitalization or spaces in a gamer tag so for example in the gamer tag you are looking for&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Bloo</p>
<p>BLOO</p>
<p>b l o o</p>
<p>BlOo</p>
<p>
</p><p>Etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are all considered the same gamertag but when you go to search for it in the system you have to put it in exactly the way the person has entered it in for it to show up but if you try and change your gamertag to one of them it will show as unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not good with math but with 4 letters that could be capitalized, and spaces between each one I would say that there could be 1 in 1,000,000 chance that you may guess what exactly the person put in for their gamer tag.<br />

            <p>I spent ages experiencing the same problem and trying to get&nbsp;it sorted. This page is a bit out of date but it's one of the first relevant pages listed when you do a search, so here's my pennyworth. If I can spare&nbsp;someone the same hassle I had I'll be happy!
</p>
<p>Assuming the printer itself is functional and you've installed the HP Windows 8 drivers successfully, it's pretty likely that it's a USB issue. The older models of this printer have&nbsp;USB 1.1 ports and most new&nbsp;computers come with USB 3.0 ports. If you're
 lucky your new computer will have one USB 2.0 port - if so, that could well solve your problem. If not, I'm afraid you won't be able to use your printer until this compatibility issue is addressed.</p>
<p>If you get Windows to try to find a solution when the printer is&nbsp;in an error&nbsp;state&nbsp;it will tell you that you need to use a USB 2.0 port. I spoke to HP and they told me the same thing.</p>
<p>There isn't much you can do. Believe me I've searched far and wide and there isn't yet an adapter for turning a USB 3.0 port into a USB 2.0 - or at least I can't find one. Until something like this is available &nbsp;you probably will have to&nbsp;use another printer.</p>
<p>I know that this is an excellent (and expensive) printer and it's galling that you can't use it. As I see it the advantages of USB 3.0 (whatever they are) are outweighed by the fact that you can't use a printer that should last a lifetime. Whatever happened
 to "if it ain't broke don't fix it?"</p>
<p>I'm not claiming this is definitely the cause of the problem, but it is very likely. Windows 8 (which seems pretty good, once you've downloaded a program to get the Start button back!) isn't to blame here. HP should support their products and produce something
 to link the incompatible USB ports together. Maybe they will, but I'm not holding my breath.</p>
<p>I hope this is of some help.</p>

            Thanks for the reply, Neil. I actually recently found a workaround to this issue, but I must have posted the solution in a different forum. I'll post it here as well.
<div><br />
<div>I installed an HP JetDirect 600N card in the printer, and hooked it up to my router. I was able to easily install the printer over the network and use it with Windows 8. My problem must have been the USB issue that you are describing, because it works
 perfectly wirelessly.</div>

    <title>Why Email Address&#39; In Infected Emails are Hidden - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> databaseben  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Email Address&#39; In Infected Emails are Hidden</h2>
                    <p>Ok, this is a follow-up question to an earlier post called "How to see infected emails"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After receiving an spoofed email supposedly from a friend, I decide to examine the email address's that the email has been blasted to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I click on "Reply All" but have no intention on sending it to anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then double click each email address's and the "add contact" property page pulls up (but i have no intention on adding the contact to mine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all but one email address, there was 1 standard email address that can be seen inside the "personal email" field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But on one of the email address's, not only is there the standard email address inside the "personal email" field but another inside the "work email" field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work email field has the address of: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, one of the email address's in the "To" field has 2 address's linked to it while the others only have the one address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i look up the work email address and found that its from some place in paris france and maybe the source of the spoofing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here is the question at hand:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it that a secondary address hidden from us? </p>
<p>
</p><p>So i checked the email properties page and the "To" line has only the standard email address's in it, just like in the email message.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is no sign of that secondary "work email" on that "to" line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only clue i have is the following from the email properties page:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas as to how one email address inside the "to" line can have both a personal and work address's but only the personal is visable?</p>

<p>Is your intention to acquire the skills to do this yourself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is much more to an E-Mail than you can see in the header block. Each mail has a certain structure which you can study on Wikipedia while looking for keywords such as MIME. Below is an example. By not following the prescribed structure, spammers can
 generate various effects which can get detected by virus filters so they can flag the item as spam. You can examine the raw contents of an E-Mail with tools such as getmail.exe. Be prepared to spent a substantial amount of time on the effort.</p>

<p>Do it! you know 6 to 12 months after launch of SF X? (X? y not vs?) Tekken they will release version 2.0&nbsp; ( with 6 more characters and colors!) to be followed 8 months later by 3.0. SAM likes MVC3 and thought it was super ez and fun for every one to play
 unlike other fighting games where my wife or kids per say are completely lost because they haven't played the games for decades and have no fundamentals</p>

<p>lol boycotts never work, either because </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A) There's not enough people willing to boycott the game to actually get their message across to the developers or
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) The people who claim to boycott the games actually end up buying the game anyways (i.e.: The people on steam who tried to boycott Black Ops)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not trying to defend Ca$hcom or anything, but I do feel that its inevitable that they'll do another iteration of Street Fighter x Tekken a few months or a year after the release the first version. I mean, people still buy the new version so its not like
 they'll stop that trend simply because most people have a problem with it. </p>

<h2>            Creative update problems</h2>
                    <p>After installing the creative update I have been having odd problems so I decided to do some checking:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Started with SFC</p>
<div>C:\&gt;sfc /scannow</div>
<div>Beginning system scan.&nbsp; This process will take some time.</div>
<div>Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.</div>
<div>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</div>
<p>
</p><p>Then DISM check health</p>
<div>C:\&gt;DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</div>
<div>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool<br />
Version: 10.0.15063.0</div>
<div>Image Version: 10.0.15063.0</div>
<div><strong>The component store is repairable.</strong><br />
The operation completed successfully.</div>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Does repairable mean it needs to be repair?</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then an attempt to restore health</p>
<p>1) Tried using just doing restore but said it could not find source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) clean the startup</p>
<div>C:\&gt;Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup</div>
<div>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool<br />

The operation completed successfully.</div>
<p>
</p><p>3) I download the windows create tool and made the ISO file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Tried restoring with ESD file</p>

<p>
</p><p>5) So I created an WIM file from the ESD</p>

<h2>            Modern Warfare 3 Disk Read Error &#47; Disk Unreadable</h2>
                    
<p>Was excited to play MW3 after the midnight release, just to get home and it say unreadable, or not even recognize that I have a game in the console at all.&nbsp; Went to the store the next day, replaced the disk with a brand new copy and the same thing happens.</p>
<p>Before I continue I want to get this across, DO NOT post telling me to do the disk reading trouble shooter, I'm not the average idiot on here that can't do some research before he posts something, I've tried everything.</p>
<p>Both copys would not work on my console, but work on my friends'.&nbsp; Both copys were completely clean, scratch free, out of the box straight into the console.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>From what I see this is a problem affecting a LOT of players (since theres already&nbsp;an unbelievable amount of&nbsp;forum posts about&nbsp;it on here and almost any other major&nbsp;Xbox forum).</em></span></p>
<p>So all I'm wondering is <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">what the fix by Microsoft/Activision/IW will be and when will we get it?</span></strong></p>
<p>Will it be soon or should I just grab a PS3?&nbsp; Not paying for online service for a working game is sounding a lot better than paying for online service for a game that barely works right about now.&nbsp;<strong> Especially when Microsoft is going to tell me to
 pay just as much as a new PS3 to "fix" my Xbox that plays every other game perfectly fine.</strong></p>

<p>1. Make sure you remove any corrupted game,video, or downloaded content files by going into your hard drive and manually deleting anything with a yellow warning sign next to it. I had 3 corrupted files. Restart console before attempting to play disc.</p>
<p>2. Go into console settings/display. Make sure resolution is set to 720p (I was at 1080). After these modifications are made turn off the console before attempting to play the game.</p>
<p>3. Clear memory cache by going to memory and press Y. Again, restart console before attempting to play the game.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. It worked for me!</p>

<p>I tried all of those steps and it's still the same. If it's true that it only works in newer consoles, should we be penalised for having ours longer? I'm not sending it to Germany to be fixed. I'd rather go out and buy a console that actually works, like
 a Ps3.</p>

<p>Its not just you guys I have a 250Gb S and Ive had issues with the past three games I've bought being, Forza 4, BF3 and now MW3 all get the disc unreadable error after about 10 min of gameplay and all would not load to the HDD. Now I believe its an issue
 with the consoles and the new disc format as all 3 have been the newer format. The first MW3 disc that came with my Hardened was visibly flawed the second disc is clean though.</p>
<p>Both Forza 4 and BF3 work fine for me now so it is just a matter of time until I think MW3 will as well... Sigh too much hassle to keep spending good dough on these games especially getting the Limited editions of all of them.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Yosifmaroof,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error message: An unexpected I/O error has occurred. Status: (<strong>0Xc00000e9</strong>) is a hardware error pertaining to your system’s BIOS. Basically it is telling you that the computer is not able to reliably communicate with the hard drive. You
 may try <strong>startup repair</strong>. <strong>Startup Repair</strong> is designed to prevent a time-consuming reinstallation by diagnosing and repairing problems that prevent Windows from booting.

Hi Steve
<p>I think you may have copied that error message wrong.</p>
<p>The error <strong>An exception has been thrown by the target of an "Invocation"</strong> is a common error seen in the mail Washer application. It occurs when the application makes a call to an incorrect .DLL file.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the results of a search on the Mail Washer forums.</p>

<p>I didn't really know why this would be happening, but after hunting around on the internet, I found a site with good info. So, here it is, verbatim and word for word, a list of reasons and solutions for your blackscreen troubles:</p>
<p>"Issues with the TV- It’s possible that the TV that you are using is having some technical issues or nearing the end of it’s life.</p>
<p>Cables are not properly connected - It has been shown that cables that are not attached or faulty will usually cause this problem.</p>
<p>Problems with cable itself – cables that are faulty will also cause this problem to appear.</p>
<p>Console may be overheating – In some cases, when the console overheats, it will loosen the clamps of the video card, causing the video card to stop functioning.</p>
<p>If you want to begin the process of repairing the unit, start by doing some troubleshooting to narrow down the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Try connecting to a different TV. Simply connect the console to another TV and see if the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Disconnect all cables. After you detach the cables, put the cables back in individually. This will ensure that the cables are properly set.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use another set of cables. If you’re currently using HDMI cables, switch to AV cables or vice-versa. See if you can borrow a friend’s set of cables. If any of these fixes the problem, it’s safe to say that the cables were the cause.</p>
<p>If you’ve tried all the suggestions above without success, it is possible that the video card may have come loose or there is another hardware issue. You can call Microsoft for assistance. Here you will be required to send in the unit to their service center
 for immediate repairs. It takes about 4 weeks to get the unit back and could end up costing you about $150 dollars. You only need to pay the charges if the warranty has expired or is voided because of custom modifications. The other way is to fix the problem
 on your own."</p>
<p>I hope I could help you out with this!</p>

            <p>Hi guthisman! Thank you for answering. Just a few more questions, promise! :) Has this ever worked for you? Does the flash drive play the game properly when inserted into a friend's console? Do you have another flash drive you can try? </p>
<p>Thanks! :) </p>

            Currently not possible.
<br />
<br />Can I transfer Skype subscriptions or Skype Numbers to another Skype account?
<br />No, Skype Numbers and subscriptions are associated with the Skype account used to make the original purchase. Therefore, it's not possible to transfer these from one Skype account to another.

            To port out your Skype number, we highly suggest for you to contact your new carrier to ask for the porting process.
<br />
<br />Also, to process your request, you need to give your complete name, billing address and your Skype Number.

    <title>Where can we find a Windows 10 Event Viewer Event ID code listing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> temporaryuser0101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where can we find a Windows 10 Event Viewer Event ID code listing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a new system from Lenovo, that is a ThinkCenter tower desktop and have a lot of issues with it.&nbsp; In December, it was decided we should do a Master Reset and now I am having a lot of issues with Office365, specifically Excel and Word.&nbsp; Today, 12/26/2016
 it reached the point where now I cannot even open any of the Office apps, like Excel and Word.&nbsp; Actually, I had them open, then errors were mounting faster than I could stay up with them so I closed out, shutdown and rebooted and now, I cannot open Excel,
 Word nor even&nbsp;Access.&nbsp; I went to Event Viewer and there are a lot of errors and warnings.&nbsp; I tried "Office Support" only to get a Tech Support person who apparently didn't have a clue as at first she said I needed to reinstall Office because she said the Master
 Reset wiped out Office but when I asked why then I could open and use Excel and Word for over a week before it failed completely and she said it was because of Microsoft updates that are not compatible with Office and when I challenged that, she called me
 insisting I give her permission to enter my system remotely because I did not understand that the updates were interfering with printer settings and I told her I was not having printer issues and had not tried to print anything, she was lost and just kept
 saying I needed to give her remote access to my system - WRONG!&nbsp; I trusted a tech support person once over a year ago with doing that which eventually lead to total destruction of my system which is why I now have a new system and when a techie cannot answer
 simple questions, I am not giving permission for remote access.&nbsp; So I want to be able to create a spreadsheet with all of the Event Viewer codes.&nbsp; Now, quite obviously, if the codes exist, Microsoft has the meaning of each code and so the question is, will
 they release the codes to customers so we can make our systems work great?</p>
<p>
