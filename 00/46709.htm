Check there and you can use Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot - Last Known Good Configuration<br />
and maybe even System Restore back to a point before this happened. If no luck follow the guidelines in<br />

If no joy :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not have<br />
a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker<br />
will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

<br />
=======================================<br />
<br />
More troubleshooting :<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out the dust bunnies and clear the vents. Add a small<br />
fan blowing into the intakes to reduce the effects of heat. On a laptop about all you can do is reseat<br />
the memory, clear the vents, and use a fan to reduce heat. Memory, drive issues, and antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs are among the other possible causes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xC0000221: STATUS_IMAGE_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH</strong></p>
<p>The STATUS_IMAGE_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH bug check has a value of 0xC0000221. This indicates that a driver or a system DLL has been corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p>If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Contact
 Support</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Resolving STOP (Blue Screen)
 Errors in Windows</span></a>.</p>
<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors. </li></ol>
STATUS_IMAGE_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH Parameters
<p>This bug check will display a descriptive text message. The name of the damaged file is displayed as part of the message.</p>
Cause
<p>This bug check results from a serious error in a driver or other system file. The file header checksum does not match the expected checksum.</p>
<p>This can also be caused by faulty hardware in the I/O path to the file (a disk error, faulty RAM, or a corrupted page file).</p>
Resolution
<p>To remedy this error, run the Emergency Recovery Disk (ERD) and allow the system to repair or replace the missing or damaged driver file on the system partition.</p>
<p>You can also run an in-place upgrade over the existing copy of Windows. This preserves all registry settings and configuration information, but replaces all system files. If any Service Packs and/or hotfixes had previously been applied, you need to reinstall
 them afterward in the appropriate order (latest Service Pack, then any post-Service Pack hotfixes in the order in which they were originally installed, if applicable).</p>
<p>If a specific file was identified in the bug check message as being corrupted, you can try replacing that individual file manually. If the system partition is formatted with FAT, you can start from an MS-DOS startup disk and copy the file from the original
 source onto the hard disk. If you have a dual-boot machine, you can boot to your other operating system and replace the file.</p>
<p>If you want to replace the file on a single-boot system with an NTFS partition, you need to restart the system, press F8 at the operating system<strong>Loader</strong> menu, and choose
<strong>Safe Mode with Command Prompt</strong>. From there, copy a fresh version of the file from the original source onto the hard disk. If the file is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer using the Recovery
 Console in order to access the file. If these methods fail, try reinstalling Windows and then restoring the system from a backup.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the original file from the product CD has a filename extension ending in an<strong>_</strong> (underscore), the file needs to be uncompressed before it can be used. The Recovery Console's<strong>Copy</strong> command automatically
 detects compressed files and expands them as they are copied to the target location. If you are using Safe Mode to access a drive, use the<strong>Expand</strong> command to uncompress and copy the file to the target folder. You can use the<strong>Expand</strong>
 command in the command line environment of Safe Mode.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a disk error problem:</em> Disk errors can be a source of file corruption. Run<strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and resolve any file system structural corruption. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a RAM problem:</em> If the error occurred immediately after RAM was added to the system, the paging file might be corrupted or the new RAM itself might be either faulty or incompatible.</p>
<p><strong>To determine if newly added RAM is causing a bug check</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Return the system to the original RAM configuration.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use the Recovery Console to access the partition containing the paging file and delete the file<em>pagefile.sys</em>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>While still in the Recovery Console, run <strong>Chkdsk /r</strong> on the partition that contained the paging file.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Restart the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Set the paging file to an optimal level for the amount of RAM added.</p>
</li><li>Shutdown the system and add your RAM.
<p>The new RAM must meet the system manufacturer's specifications for speed, parity, and type (that is, fast page-mode (FPM) versus extended data out (EDO) versus synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM)). Try to match the new RAM to the existing installed
 RAM as closely as possible. RAM can come in many different capacities, and more importantly, in different formats (single inline memory modules -- SIMM -- or dual inline memory modules -- DIMM). The electrical contacts can be either gold or tin and it is not
 wise to mix these contact types.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If you experience the same error message after reinstalling the new RAM, run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>When you can log on to the system again, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error.</p>
<p>Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve this error.</p>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.</p>
<p>As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery<br />

Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>
</p><p>i have a kxd gamepad that says it is compatible with windows 8, but when I plug it into my windows 10 computer, it shows up in control panel, and when you use the test and calibrate thing there, that works, but it doesn't work in any games? Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i know windows 8 and windows 10 aren't the same thing, but I guessed the packaging was just printed before windows 10, as most things that say windows 8 work with windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ethan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am sorry to know that your game pad is not working. Not to worry, I will certainly assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to outdated or corrupted Game controller drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Update drivers from Device Manager.<br />
1.&nbsp;Press Windows + X.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select Device manager.<br />
3.&nbsp;Find game pad controller diver.<br />
4.&nbsp;Right click on the device and select Update drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method2</span></strong><span>: If issue persists Install the Game controller
 drivers in compatibility Mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘properties’.<br />
c. Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue
 persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span></p>

<br />
<span>So I had decided that whatever networking adaptor was in their must have failed, which is odd, everything else is fine, and the light goes on when you plug the ethernet cable in, and was considering whether to buy a PCI network card, or a USB wireless
 card... </span><br />
</blockquote>
<br />
I assume that "the light goes on" refers to one of the LEDs on the Ethernet jack.&nbsp; Without that, I would say that it really sounds like a hardware problem with the NIC, but it seems that it's at least getting power.<br />
<br />
I suggest opening the case up (power disconnected, of course) and checking to see if the Ethernet NIC is on a separate card or built into the motherboard.&nbsp; If it is a separate PCI card, then pull it out and put it back in. Possibly re-seating the card&nbsp; is all
 that's necessary.<br />
<br />
While you have the case open to see if the NIC is built in or on a separate card, you ought to replace the CMOS battery.<br />
<br />
If the NIC is built into the motherboard, the only thing I can think of -- other than damage to the electronics -- is that when the CMOS battery failed, the BIOS switched the NIC off.&nbsp; (Come to think about it, such a setting might also affect a non-built-in
 NIC.) <br />
<br />
Take a look in the BIOS configuration utility to see if there's a setting to turn the NIC (or LAN adapter or some similar name) on and off.&nbsp;

            Hi I'm Peter an independent advisor, you could try rolling back your display driver incase it's updated with the new update:<br /><br />To rollback the driver, you may follow the steps below:<br /><br />Press Windows + R on the desktop screen.<br />Type devmgmt.msc and hit enter.<br />Expand the category you want and right click on the driver and select properties.<br />Navigate to driver tab and click on RollBack driver.<br /><br />Hope this helps

            Hi Harshad
<br />
<br />Rarely is this caused by a monitor driver, generally, this indicates a problem with your video card device driver . . .
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Is resolution set to 1680 x 1050 (native resolution of that monitor) and is that resolution marked (recommended)?
<br />
<br />If that resolution is set, please explain what you mean by the monitor is not displaying correctly
<br />
<br />If that resolution is not set and also not available in the lost of available resolutions, go to the support page for your PC on the Manufacturers website, from there download and install the video card device driver they recommend, that may be an older version of the driver, it will however, be compatible . .. 
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty locating the support page for your PC, what is the Make and Exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<p>I am having the same issue. What is strange is that I hooked up an older laptop running Windows 7 and it works just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is really annoying is that it USED to work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Company Stand-Alone System not Running on a Windows 10 &#40;according to our help desk&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I just bought a new HP laptop with Windows 8.1 with it. &nbsp;I'm a licensed insurance advisor and with my work I need to install in my laptop a Proposal stand-alone system that runs on Windows 8. &nbsp;At the same time I wanted to updgrade to Windows 10 (Because
 Windows 8 is still new to me, I've been using Vista for the longest time and so I thought if I'm gonna learn a new one, i wanted the "newest" one) &nbsp;I called help desk in my company if the stand-alone system runs on Windows 10 but they said they encounter error
 when installing it on a Windows 10 o.s. &nbsp;So up to now their system requirement for us to have our own system installed in our laptops is Windows 8. &nbsp;Up to now i haven't have the stand-alone installed because I'm weighing which is more important to me, upgrading
 to Windows 10 or installing the stand-alone so that even when I'm mobile I can still use the tool that I need for my work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now what I do is that I bring sample proposals for my clients and then just email to them the actual proposal afterwards. Can you advise me on this please because I wanted to be an effective advisor and part of it is creating a tailored fit proposal
 for my clients right there when I meet them the first time. I don't want my client waiting for an email from me and then leave them with unanswered questions regarding the email i sent them. I know you understand what I mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is why cant my company have the program run on a Windows 10? I know they're our tech people and I trust them. But I'm quite having trouble what to do. Thank you for your patience reading my letter.</p>
<p>

            <blockquote>Unfortunately, they are admins and yes initially they were given rights but isnt there a way I can undo that...&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>and what is encryption how do I go about setting that up?</div>
<div><br />
<div>thirdly, they wont go that deep into looking for something. The catch is, if its there they'll pry. If it's not, no probs. So how do I block em from getting in besides clicking properties and setting the folder as
<b><i>hidden?</i></b></div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
If they remain administrative users, there's nothing you can do technically other than encryption.&nbsp; And if they go poking around and either don't know what they are doing (or do and are cruel) then they could mess up any encrypted files you have and prevent
 you from accessing them again (unless you are wise enough to backup the encryption key externally.)</p>
<p>All you have to do is go in and change their user accounts to plain old standard users instead of administrators (<a href="http://www.vista4beginners.com/Manage-User-Accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account type</a>.)&nbsp; They will no longer be able to go everywhere on the computer,
 they will not be able to install things system-wide and it is possible some things might stop working for them depending on how certain programs installed.</p>
<p>If it was me - I would create two other administrative accounts, password protect them and remove everyone else from the administrators group.&nbsp; No one should be using the computer daily as an administrator.&nbsp; (Why two?&nbsp; In case one becomes corrupt or something
 else happens.)</p>

                    <p>Even though I have $9.46 credit on my Skype a recorded message comes on to say 'You don't have enough Skype credit to make this call" when I try to ring a landline in South Africa. Usually my calls to there will cost about $ 0.50 for half an hour's connection.
 What is going on all of a sudden?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also noticed, that recently Skype has changed to show me as not available even though I haven't closed the app or logged out. It never used to do that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that the virtual keyboard doesn’t automatically appear in desktop mode in Windows 8 but appears in modern user interface.
 I do understand the inconvenience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am sorry to say that you will not be able to make the keyboard automatically appear in desktop mode all the time. This is a design
 issue. </span></p>

Yes, Please Microsoft fix this. It makes no sense to me why I must manully bring up the Virtual Keyboard in desktop mode.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Window 7 Update Notification - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Window 7 Update Notification</h2>
                    <p>I know this is all over the net...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying several solutions the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No notification in the system tray that updates are waiting to be installed. &nbsp;Prior to August of 2015, I received a notification in the system tray about updates. &nbsp;Since then nothing. &nbsp;I checked all the appropriate places...I even reset the update database
 on my machine. &nbsp;Still no notification. &nbsp;I checked the notification icon behavior and had to reset it to display the icon and notifications. &nbsp;Still no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked for updates yesterday...there were 3 waiting to be install, still wasn't notified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the Notification Area Icons...now the Windows update Icon is missing!?!?! &nbsp;****?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Window 7 Home Premium SP1. &nbsp;Also my copy of Win 7 is not eligible for upgrade to Win10 (thank god) - EOM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why windows would remove the update icon for display in the system tray?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Using GWX Control Panel, I delete the Windows 10 apps (KB&nbsp;3035583) and the Windows Update Icon is back in the Notification Area Icons window. &nbsp;I think that it has also brought back the notification in the system tray. &nbsp;We'll see what happens when
 next Microsoft sends out updates.</p>

</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The current version of IE8 is 8.0.7601.17514 Update version: 0 &nbsp;I don't know what KB3035583 is, I assume it was an update to IE8, IE8 has

<p>
</p><p>Note: Effective 12 January 2016, IE11 is the *only* version supported in Win7. &nbsp;</p>

<p>And exactly how have you come to that conclusion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact: Internet Explorer is part &amp; parcel of your Operating System. If Internet Explorer (IE11) isn't fully-patched,
<em>Windows 7</em>&nbsp;isn't either - and if IE isn't working properly, ditto!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If IE11 is not installed and no Internet Explorer (any version) updates have been installed since you did the clean install of Win7 in July 2015, the
</strong><strong>computer should NOT be connected to the internet or any local networks (i.e., other computers) in its current state. All business &amp; personal data (including online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should be considered at-risk, if not already

            <p>So, what your telling me is that Microsoft is in violation of all the court orders over the year to decouple IE from the operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as My computer goes...it's my computer and I decide what is installed, not Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine will stay connected...so maybe you should disconnect yours so mine doesn't come looking for yours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm sure my machine is virus free and malware free...is yours? &nbsp;And I can ask you the same question...how do you know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I never ran Windows 1.0, it was Windows 3.1 or nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before, I don't surf the net with IE any version. &nbsp;IE is an accident waiting to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome and Blue Moon and Tor are the only browsers I use. &nbsp;If I could I would delete IE, like we were supposed to be able too back in the 90's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for trying to solve a problem that nobody has yet to be able to solve since the introduction of Windows 10. &nbsp;It seems to be **** with all the updates of all the versions. &nbsp;It would seem MS wants to control the update process and put things
 (bloatware and such) on my machine at will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'll be switching to Linux if MS can't fix the problem.</p>

    <title>How does Speech, Inking, and Typing work&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shmiddy mcshmiddington  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does Speech, Inking, and Typing work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The description of Getting to know you sounds pretty scary.&nbsp; Windows says that it'll collect "contacts, recent calendar events,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">speech and handwriting patterns, and </span>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">typing history.</span></strong>"</p>
<p>So basically, if I enable this, Windows will keep track of <em>everything I type</em>?&nbsp; I'm usually okay with letting programs and Google stuff know my location and access parts of my computer, but I'd have to draw the line at what basically amounts to
<strong>keylogging</strong>.</p>
<p>I've been searching around for a better explanation on exactly how this feature works, but I haven't found anything both reliable and helpful.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-912417/windows-10-privacy-and-what-is-the-advertising-id" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
One guy</a> who claimed to have worked for Microsoft in the past&nbsp;said that only things you type into the Cortana/Windows search bar is logged, but there's no good way to verify if what he's saying is true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, basically, to what extent does Windows track what I type?&nbsp; Does it only log the input of certain fields such as the Cortana search bar, or does it give&nbsp;Microsoft access to&nbsp;basically
<em>anything</em> I type <em>ever (i.e. Google searches, emails, social media comments, etc.)?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a huge difference between the two, with the former being slightly unnerving but still practical and the latter being a total invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please, I don't want an explanation of why Microsoft thought this was a good idea (I know, they're trying to make things more 'personalized'), I just want an answer to my question.</p>

    <title>Surface 3 Pen Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> surface 3 pen issues  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 Pen Issues</h2>
                    <p>So, I have been having a ton of issues with my Surface 3 and its pen. I already called Microsoft once about it and they said it was a problem with the motherboard not recognizing the pen, so they sent me a new surface 3 and a new pen. I was hoping that would
 solve the issue, but this new surface and pen are having the same problems. These are the problems I am having:</p>
<p>1- Surface pen just stops writing all of a sudden. I don't open up any new programs, it just randomly stops working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- Other times, my pen writes when it is not even touching the screen. I can hover about 1/4 of an inch of of the screen and it will still write, and select things.</p>
<p>--note on that one. I attempted to calibrate my pen by going in to the settings and selecting the calibrate option. Now that I have done that when I put my pen over the task bar, the pointer zooms all over the place. I can't select any icons any more because
 when I try clicking on one note, it will think that it is over Cortana and open that up, or word, or any of the other programs I have on my task bar.</p>
<p>And yes, I have checked to make sure that my surface was up to date before, during and after each incident.</p>
<p>Am I the only one experiencing these issues? Am I just doing something wrong, or is this a problem with windows ten? Because I did not have any of these issues before updating my old surface to windows ten (my new one came with windows ten already loaded
 on it).</p>
<p>These problems are VERY infuriating because I am a student who needs to take notes in very fast moving high level college classes, and having a broken pen SEVERELY disrupts my note taking abilities.</p>

            Yes, I have done all of these. With my old Surface &nbsp;and pen (the ones they replaced) it stopped working so often, that because I had to unscrew the pen so many times, the threads got stripped and my pen cap would no longer stay on my pen. The spring for
 the battery would just pop my pen's top right off. I am in the middle of trying to work with Microsoft tech support, and so far all of their suggestions have failed to fix the problem. They might still have some more serious suggestions that we haven't tried
 yet, but we haven't gotten that fer yet. I am just wondering if it is something I am doing wrong, or if this is a widespread issue (if someone knows a fix that wouldn't hurt either though :) ).

            <p>I am having <em>exactly</em> the same problem with my surface pen. I know two other people with the same Surface Pro 3 and pen combo, and neither of them have this problem at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, since I've removed and reinserted the battery so many times, the threads have stripped and the cap no longer stays on. I've had the device for about a year and a half, and it's always had this weird, janky pairing problem with the pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone succeeds in figuring this out, I'd love to hear a solution. I have to go out and buy a new surface pen -- I'll probably spring for the new model, since its a little bit more robust.</p>

<h2>            Commander Shepard WILL return after Mass Effect 3 afterall&#33; &#58;D</h2>
                    
<p>A few months back, Legendary Pictures showed up at Comic-Con to start pushing some of their upcoming product, but included
<a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Comic-Con-2011-Live-Blogging-The-Legendary-Pictures-Panel-25838.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
very little information</a> regarding their adaptation of the popular video game franchise
<i>Mass Effect</i>. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.gamefront.com/legendary-pictures-mass-effect-movie-is-about-male-shepard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
GameFront</a> has dug up a blog posted by Legendary last month (seemingly in secret) that gave us a few answers we were looking for as fans of the **** Commander Shepard and his crew.
<br />
<br />
First, we won’t be seeing the story from the video games portrayed on the big screen. Sure some of the characters will carry over, but the folks at Legendary have the go ahead to create a story from scratch, though they are working with the game’s producers
 at BioWare to keep certain aspects consistent. With about 120 hours of gameplay between the three games (the third being released in March) there’s plenty to draw from, but since they will be building their own story, hopefully they don’t shoot themselves
 in the foot for the many sequels this series could create. <br />
<br />
Next, not surprisingly the film will focus on the male Commander Shepard, rather than the female version gamers can opt to use. This shouldn’t be big news, but it could have been an interesting choice to have a female lead in a hard sci-fi film like this. We’re
 not sure where the story will fit into the timeline of the games, but if it falls after the trilogy, then this could be an indicator that our beloved Shepard makes it through
<i>Mass Effect 3</i> unscathed. <br />
<br />
Last but not least, Seth Green will not be reprising his role as Joker, one of the Normandy (their space craft) engineers. While his voice has become iconic in the series, Green himself doesn’t exactly look the part. However, this
<i>is</i> Hollywood. If they really wanted him in there they could do it. <br />
<br />
In a bit of unconfirmed news, a fan had asked if Daft Punk would be producing the soundtrack. Legendary said they love the electro duo, but it’s too early to say who will handle the music for the film. A film like
<i>Mass Effect</i> would be a great film to stretch their legs with. <i>Tron: Legacy</i> gave Daft Punk a chance to make a video gamey soundtrack, but this sci-fi piece would open doors for their creativity that could create something even greater than their
 last efforts. <br />
<br />
What’s nice about Legendary taking the time to answer these questions is that it means they’re working on the film and not tabling it to let people forget about it. It’s really early in the pre-production process, but that they’re working with BioWare and not
 just spinning their own yarn in the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe is a good sign. We should hear some more news fairly soon about where they’re going to take the franchise, and who will be on board.</p>

<p>Is this an animated movie? &nbsp;I wouldn't be all that interested in a motion picture with the usual Hollywood inuendos, how many franchises have been destroyed by Hollywood hands, Spider-Man, Transformers, the list goes on. &nbsp;Just the fact that they went with
 the male version off the bat is all ready one strike against in my books. &nbsp;I don't think that this is all that great of an idea artistically or for commercial purposes, there is potential for a really good animated movie, but it's gotta be Jennifer Hale, that
 male Shepard has no personality or voice charm whatsoever...:-)</p>

<p>Likely not animated if they're concerned about Joker not looking his part. I'd be annoyed if it was cartoony like Dead Space stuff was....the ONLY way a Mass Effect movie that is animated would work...is if they rocked the CGI awesomeness of the Final Fantasy
 movies.</p>
<p>Otherwise....real actors please.</p>

<p>Not happy that they are making a movie featuring Shepard. Every Shepard is different. I would probably spend the whole time saying "Shepard wouldn't say that. Shepard wouldn't do that. Shepard is a girl. What is Shepard doing! he wouldn't do that!". &nbsp; &nbsp;And
 if it is after ME3, that would also make me mad. Because the endings are likely going to be different. &nbsp;I think that they should do a movie on First Contact. From the discovery on Mars up until you see the Normandy on the way to the Citadel years later. &nbsp;Then
 you get your Shepard cameo, and a decent movie.</p>

This part doesn't make any sense to me at all because of course Green looks like Joker.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype stopped working after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the latest windows update Skype stopped working (together with Netflix and Jing). It seems that something went wrong with the sign in processes. Skype cannot log in and freezes (Not Responding). &nbsp;Luckily I still have another laptop with windows 7.
 Everything works fine there. However, it is a nuisance that the win 10 update messed up something. Please, forward the message to Microsoft about these problems. Is there something that I could do to solve these issues or is it likely that MS will soon correct
 the issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, I was about to follow your instructions but then as my laptop started to have more issues I forced it to shut down by pressing the on-off key for 10 sec. or so. After this it has been working okay. Skype, Jing and even Cortana search box work again.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Private messages not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until recently I started getting issues with private messaging. I use mac os and iphone to chat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The version is&nbsp;&nbsp;8.46.0.60.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The private messages keeps losing conversation, saying conversation ended and shows a button "Send new Invite".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I click on it, it again starts the conversation once the other person clicks on "Confirm" button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other person is on Windows 10 and their version is 8.47.x.x.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It behaves the same from my iPhone too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to check, I also tried creating a new skype ID but it didn't help either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi Deb Vanvelse,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Answers Forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
To create a link which directly opens the default media player to view your video, you need to upload the video to https://skydrive.live.com . After you upload the video, copy the link of the direct location of the uploaded file and send it to your customers.
 This way it directly opens with media player as soon as you click on the link.<br />
<br />
Note: the https location should end with the file name and the file format.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
