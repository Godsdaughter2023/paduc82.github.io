    <title>How can I copy a filename from Windows Explorer search results&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric 98  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I copy a filename from Windows Explorer search results&#63;</h2>
                    After finding a file in Windows Explorer, I'd like to be able to copy the complete file name, including path, so that I can paste it into a document.<br />
<br />
I can see how to open Properties, but that window shows the path (location) in one field and the filename in another. Obviously it's possible to copy them both and put a slash between. But that's several steps, and I'm hoping that there's an easier way.<br />

            It uses a Bluetooth connection, not a USB receiver. You can connect the Arc mouse to any Bluetooth enabled device.

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that your computer is running slow and you get error message that Internet Explorer is not responding due to long running script.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is this issue restricted to slow Internet Explorer or overall the computer is slow?
</span></li><li><span>When exactly do you get this error message about long running script? Does this message appears while browsing any particular website or performing any particular action on Internet Explorer?</span></li><li><span>Apart from slow performance and long running script error message, does the computer works fine normally?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>There can be two scenarios, where the issue is restricted to Internet Explorer and overall internet surfing, downloading and uploading files on Internet Explorer is slow, or overall the computer performance is slow.
 Depending upon the scenario, let’s follow the steps below to get this problem resolved.

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong><span>:</span></p>

    <title>Windows Update causes missing mscorjit.dll error&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update causes missing mscorjit.dll error&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, as I shut down my PC, Windows Update installed 18 updates.&nbsp; Upon reboot into Windows, I got several identical errors informing me that some of my startup programs (i.e. programs that load on startup) were: "Unable to load Jit Compiler (mscorjit.dll):
 file may be missing or corrupt."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I spent all day yesterday uninstalling and reinstalling those programs, as well as .net Framework 4.5.1.&nbsp; But nothing I did was able to restore the missing dll file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally today, I restored my entire PC from a backup drive, and everything worked perfectly again -- no errors about a missing dll.&nbsp; BUT THEN... Windows Update installed the same 18 updates, and voila!, I am getting the exact same errors about a missing
 mscorjit.dll!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!&nbsp; Why would Windows Update steal my dear old mscorjit??&nbsp; And what should I do from here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jay</p>

            <p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion!&nbsp; I performed a clean boot with no problems and no error messages.&nbsp; But perhaps that was to be expected; the error messages come from 3 different applications that are present in my Startup Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before those 18 Windows Updates, these 3 applications launched on startup just fine.&nbsp; But even directly after a clean boot, if I manually launch any of them I get the same error: "Unable to load Jit Compiler (mscorjit.dll)" or "DLL entry point not found."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I restore my whole compute to a point before those Windows Updates, everything works perfectly again!&nbsp; Until the Updates are required to be applied...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I suppose I could do is:&nbsp; restore to a point before the Updates, perform a clean boot, and run all the Updates while in clean boot mode.&nbsp; Would that be worthwhile to try do you think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Jay</p>

            <p>Hi Anil,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks VERY much for your continuing help with this nightmare!&nbsp; The startup programs which generate the error messages are:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Memeo Auto Backup&nbsp; (specifically MemeoLauncher2.exe)<br />
</p>
<p>- Norton Ghost (specifically VProConsole.exe)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Both these programs are installed on my C partition.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and reinstalled bothprograms, but they still are generating these error messages:<br />
</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please note:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Two other programs ("Intel Rapid Storage Technology" and "What's my computer doing?" were previously generating the same mscorjit errors, but ever since I reinstalled them, they are no longer are having problems.<br />
- I have uninstalled and re-installed the .NET Framework, yet my mscorjit-related problems persist.<br />
</p>
<p>- Lastly, and apparently somehow related, all my MS Office applications are firing up an "installer" when I open them for the very first time (meaning, for the first time after restoring my system to an earlier time, and running the 18 Windows updates.)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I remain VERY keen to hear your additional ideas and suggestions.&nbsp; Many thanks, Anil,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Jay<br />

</p><p><span>This issue can be caused due to corrupted .NET Framework. I would suggest you to manually remove all the .NET Framework versions by using Windows Cleanup Utility and reinstall them

            64 bit (x64) can run both 32 and 64 bit programs interchangeably, they are both compatible. So, no, it won't cause any damage. Some components in the 64 bit version of Windows 10 remain 64 bit.<br />

    <title>Can MS create a version of dosbox&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tryst46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can MS create a version of dosbox&#63;</h2>
                    Many users of Windows use Dosbox to play old games and use software that isn't compatible with Windows. This has come about because MS decided to drop all support for Dos. The problem is that Dosbox does not have the source code for windows and cannot
 integrate it properly. As a result we get endless amounts of bugs and other problems.<br />
<br />
For example, I try to play Wing Commander and the cutscene movies play at 3 or 4 times the speed they should. I have tried all sorts of ideas that I have had from Dosbox techs and other users to no avail. Also, Dosbox does not often slow the processor speeds
 down so games are often far too twitchy.<br />
<br />
I would prefer to see a version that uses 4mb to 8mb protected RAM and allows you to specify the processor it is to emulate, a 486/66 for example and calculates the current processor speed and slows it down accordingly. It should also reserve a core of the
 processor exclusively for the Dos emulator while it is running so nothing uses shared resources with it. It should also properly emulate a Vesa compatible graphics card and a SoundBlaster Sound card which Dosbox seems incapable of doing. For all intents and
 purposes, it should be an early 90's Dos gaming rig.<br />
<br />
I could take a 911 Carrera and put a VW Beetle body on it to make it look like a VW Beetle but it would be way too powerful and fast to pass for an original. Such is the problem with Dosbox, they put a shell on a fast machine to make it look like a 1990's model
 but the engine is still way too overpowered.<br />
<br />
IMO, Dos games rocked. They had 99% of the processing power and speed, 100% of the graphics power and speed and 90% or more of the memory. Practically nothing ran in the background to eat resources or freeze the game while it wrote a file to disk and there
 was nothing to interfere with the game at all.<br />
<br />
MS are the only company with intimate knowledge of the workings of Windows and therefore, the only company with the ability to produce this software successfully.<br />
<br />
I just wonder why MS seem so unwilling to do it. <br />

            This is just a user forum so you&nbsp; won't get any notice from the people who work at Monopoly$soft.<br />
Personally. Win7 is quite compatible with games. Most issues are to do with DOS, 16bit compatibility and DRM.
<br />
-The DRM issues that come with many games from mid 2000's is out of their control.<br />
<br />
<i>"I just wonder why MS seem so unwilling to do it. "</i><br />
<br />
Too easy - Money, big heaping piles of it, and that's never enough....<br />
Fans of DOS based games are not a large enough demographic for MS to care. They would never<br />
recoup the cost of doing your dream, much less be able to add to their profit margin.<br />
-It's similar at the other end of the gaming spectrum. There are a good number of gamers with
<br />
high end machines who are consistently disappointed with games that are ported from console and
<br />
not optimised for the high end. While they think they are a large group, on a percentage basis they are not large enough for game developers to truly care about.<br />
-It's really a very complex thing when you have to deal with untold hardware configurations and<br />
then try to make them forward and backward compatible with every imaginable software option,
<br />
and the OS is already bloated enough as it is<br />
<br />
Actually, I reckon Monopoly$oft have done enough damage to gaming with the advent of GFWL
<br />
and the incursion of the&nbsp; XBOX controller as default in games. <br />
<br />
As you mentioned yourself - the real issue is hardware. DOS BOX does what it's supposed to.<br />
- Regarding your processor being too fast. There are a number of open source programs that allow<br />
you to setup profiles to use only one core of your processor (also possible via Task Manager, but not so you can save a profile), and overclocking software can be used to reduce clocks speeds.
<br />
-Graphics cards can also have their speed lowered via OC software if necessary, but the issue here with DOS games is as much to do with the drivers, and the way graphics processors do their job, as it does Windows&nbsp;
<br />
(The Glide3 to OpenGL wrapper for Diablo2 comes to mind ) . Again, not an MS problem.<br />
- If I were as enthusiastic as you about DOS games I'd have an old machine dedicated to the task.<br />
The parts are still out there in the e-waste depots or garage sales and can be had for next to nothing.<br />
You wouldn't have to go back to a 486. A single core Pentium2 or Athlon should not be too fast.<br />
<br />
I'm just grateful we have open source developers for the PC community and the open source third party<br />
developers&nbsp; (The Gimp, Blender and Linux, and game fix people ) deserve our thanks ( Thanks to the creator of the 64bit installer for Grim Fandango) appreciation and support.
<br />
Things would be grim indeed if Monopoly$oft had it's way with everything.<br />
<br />

            My gripe is that they try to make the OS do everything because it just ends up doing nothing well, (jack of all trades, master of none).<br />
<br />
Offices have little need for sound. A musician has little need for fancy graphics. An operating system has little need to look pretty. Those should be add-ons for the user to decide to have or not as they wish.<br />
<br />
GEM OS back in the DOS days was compact, neat and functional and it was all that is needed for a WIMP OS. The bells and whistles that Windows has are just a way to make more money.<br />
<br />
A good OS should simply interface between the software and the hardware and also serve as a network bridge to connect several computers together, whether that be LAN or WAN. It really needs to do nothing more than that. It should use as few resources as possible
 so that as much of the resources as possible are available for the programs. Maybe a very basic text browser since many programs are available via download. If you want a fancy browser for the web, download one but if you don't, you can continue using the
 text browser to download other software you do want.<br />
<br />
Email and other software should be an add-on only. Same goes with drivers, they should be hardware specific and supplied by the manufacturers and should give compatibility for their hardware directly and not via an OS that screws it up on the way through by
 insisting that hardware be compatible with the OS's unstable software (DirectX).<br />
<br />
DLL's should do what they are supposed to do and not reside permanently in memory. What use is a JPEG DLL when I'm not accessing JPEG graphics? What use is a sound DLL when I'm not using sound? Moreover, what use is a sound DLL if I don't even have a sound
 card installed? Why are these things held in memory, taking up more resources that could otherwise be used for programs? Why is my OS doing 10 million things in the background, using processing power and resources when I need as much of both as possible to
 run a game or something?<br />
<br />
I just wish someone could bring out a modern version of GEM OS for gamers etc who need all the resources they can get to run their programs. Load that instead of Windows, maybe as a dual boot at first, and we would eventually see a mass migration from M$ bloatware.<br />

            <i>"I just wish someone could bring out a modern version of GEM OS"<br />
</i>From before my PC experience.<i> </i>Any gaming I did that would be similar to DOS based games was on console, starting in '90. I didn't move to PC until '04<i>.<br />
<br />
"My gripe is that they try to make the OS do everything because it just ends up doing nothing well, (jack of all trades, master of none)."</i><br />
<br />
I'm with you on that on some levels, but&nbsp; If you want a bare bones OS like&nbsp; DOS you have to use DOS, and most people don't want to use an OS that requires as much arcane&nbsp; knowledge as DOS does/did.
<br />
I certainly don't. I took one look at DOS BOX and my brain went into fog mode, and I like to know about<br />
the nuts and bolts of things, but comes a time when there is just too much to know. If I had a real
<br />
interest in reliving vintage games I'd be more inclined to stay focused, and learn though.<br />
The only DOS games I play are a couple from Good Old Games; already setup with DOS BOX.
<br />
<br />
I do like flexibility though, and while I have Superfetch disabled because I'm using an SSD for the OS,
<br />
I don't really mind having stuff reside in memory for quick access by something I may not use until next month. I have tons of RAM and HDD space.<br />
Having&nbsp; a lot of things running in the background is not mandatory either. They can be disabled in
<br />
System Configuration, but that's not new. XP had the same setup (I wasn't using a PC with '98 so<br />
don't know about that). <br />
I also don't mind Windows having IE even though I use Firefox and Thunderbird, or Media Player, etc.
<br />
as long as alternatives are available.<br />
It's no good being self centered about things like email, Media Player or browsers. There are heaps of users who want their hand held. They don't want to know
<i>anything</i> about the in's and out's of their machine (most people I know are like this), and who don't want to have to find and install a browser, media player or photo viewer.<br />
They want a plug and play machine that does everything imaginable, and rightly or wrongly MS tries<br />
to cater to them. Not out of&nbsp; a sense of altruism, you can bet.<br />
<br />
My main gripes are that when MS introduce a new 'feature' you should be able to disable it or uninstall it altogether (without having to fiddle in the registry - Libraries) if you don't want it, and if MS decides to do something like add 200 ways to automatically
 arrange your files/folders you should still be able to use your own method of arranging by being able to disable auto-arrange.&nbsp; It's painful to have to deal<br />
with having a useful function replaced with another function that may also be useful for some, but not
<br />
to you. At least AERO can be disabled, thankfully.<br />
<br />
<br />
By and large I don't mind Win7. It's been very stable and forgiving for me. I've had it installed for<br />
a bit over three years. and that includes imaging it from my old machine to a new one with different<br />
brand cpu, gpu and motherboard chipset&nbsp; seven months ago without it getting a bit confused or
<br />
slowing down <br />
(I did do a very thorough uninstall of drivers and some manual registry deletions, obviously ).
<br />
I play a lot of high end modern games with no issues, other than those that are part of gaming.<br />
<br />
On the topic of bloatware - How about the Security suites from Norton and the like, and
<br />
all the addon's that come with the machines form HP, DELL, etc. Once again, catering to the masses<br />
of don't wanna know users. That's cool. Many don't mind taking the machine down to the local<br />
'repair' man and pay for him to defrag and run Disk Cleanup for them because they refused to listen to his advice last time (my sister-in-law). To paraphrase - 'I just want to turn it on, and it works, Damnit.'<br />

            You'd normally use unicode when you want a text file that contains those outside of the normally ASCII set... accented characters and the like. These are rarely used when defining hostnames.

<h2>            Windows Media Player wont play MP3 files</h2>
                    I can't play my downloaded MP3 files. At first I thought I needed to upgrade my windows media player but then I read that the Windows media player doesn't support MP3 files - that they need to be changed to another format through a codec software. Any
 experience with this?

            I agree with the recommendation to use VLC, but you should be sure to get version 3.0.7 or later, and if you already have VLC installed, you should click its
<strong>Help &gt; Check for updates</strong> menu item.&nbsp; See <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/vlc-307-is-biggest-security-release-due-to-eu-bounty-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>This issue occurs if a Windows Update client or a Microsoft Update client cannot access the user token. To resolve this issue, stop and then restart the Windows Update Service. To do this follow these steps:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Close any Windows Update or Microsoft Update browser windows.<br />
2.&nbsp;Press Windows + R, type cmd, and then click OK.<br />
3.&nbsp;Type the following commands. Press ENTER after each command: <br />
net stop wuauserv<br />
net start wuauserv<br />
4.&nbsp;Close the Command prompt window.<br />
5.&nbsp;Try to install updates again.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I would suggest you to refer the suggestion from the below link and check if it helps.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-error-0x80240016?woldogcb=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-error-0x80240016?woldogcb=0</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>If issue persist, I will suggest you to boot your PC in Safe mode and see if you get this error. If you don’t get the error, try to run your PC in Clean boot mode and
 see if it works. Clean boot will help you to identify the third party applications causing this error.
<strong>Follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot</strong><strong>.
</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section
<strong>"How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”.
</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will fix the issue. Feel free post us if you need any assistance with Windows. We'll be glad to assist you.<br />

            <p>I tried the net stop wuauserv net start wuauserv with no change to the error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggested link is simply the installer trouble shooter which we have tried several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started in Safe Mode where I got the message error 1084: unable to start windows installer in Safe Mode.&nbsp; I tried the How to start in safe mode as explained in the second link.&nbsp; I&nbsp; got to the services page and highlighted the windows installer but the
 start option was not available with error 1084.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I continued to get the error I didn't try the clean boot.</p>

<h2>            Manage order of connecting WiFi networks in Windows 10.</h2>
                    With Windows 7 --&gt; Network and Sharing, Manage Wireless Networks, click on the network --&gt; "move up", "move down."&nbsp; Any clue how to do this in Windows 10?&nbsp; And people wonder why my new 6th Generation i7 PC was purchased with Windows 7 Pro last month.&nbsp;
 Thank goodness some still sell them....&nbsp; :-)

 the Windows 10 result.&nbsp; Now, the next photo shows the Windows 7 Network and Sharing "base" screen.&nbsp;(sorry, no it doesn't) &nbsp;Note the "manage wireless settings" in the upper left - if you attach 3 images.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last screenshot shows the manage wireless
 network screen.&nbsp; Note -- you can now&nbsp;change which network is connected first (Jerogo 5 - the higher band on a dual band router is on top - connects first), and then which is second (Jerogo - the lower band).&nbsp; When I go camping there will be&nbsp;4 more networks
 within reach.&nbsp; THAT's where I'll need to be able to EASILY change the order - depending on which campsite I have and which router is currently working at the campground.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; During the winter I remove those networks to make life simple.&nbsp; :-)Thank you in
 advance for your assistance.&nbsp; If you need any other clarification please let me know.&nbsp; Best Regards, Chris -- Note: I believe this reply has a maximum of two attachments.&nbsp; Please correct me if I'm wrong.&nbsp; Thank you again.</p>

    <title>After Windows 10 upgrade I have not been able to turn laptop off, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> big962003  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 10 upgrade I have not been able to turn laptop off, camera doesn&#39;t work, can&#39;t wake from sleep mode.</h2>
                    <p>After I upgraded to Windows 10, my HP 15 laptop will not shut down. I select Power then Shut Down and the screen goes black and the machine gets quiet. However, the Internet/Airplane Mode light stays on, and the drive indicator light stays on. The laptop
 never completely powers down. I have to hold the power switch until it shuts off.</p>
<p>Also, when the unit goes into sleep mode it would not wake and I would have to power down with the power button, and then restart with the button. This happened for the first 2 days after upgrading to Windows 10. Then on the 3rd day it started waking most
 of the time&nbsp;from sleep mode. However, not&nbsp;every time.</p>
<p>Also, the on board camera has stopped working. It comes on some times and you can see what it sees. Other times it does not come on. It will not take a picture or video.
</p>
<p>Also, I disabled the track pad,in the Mouse and Touch Pad setting, when a usb pointing device is installed. That will work until I shut down the laptop.&nbsp; Once powered back up the settings have reverted to the default settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on these problems would be greatly appreciated. I would like to keep using Windows 10, but I will have to go back to WNDWS 8 if these can't be worked out which would be horrible. Windows 10 seems to be far superior if these problems can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup
 Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click <strong>
Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am understanding correctly, I will need to revert back to Windows 8.1 to use these two methods. Is that correct? I am assuming this as the instructions for both are referring to Windows8 and Windows 7, but not to Windows 10. Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, do I need to do them in that order, or can I try Method 2 first? It looks to be a little more simplified than the first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know as soon as possible so I can revert as soon as possible in order to get this computer back to running smoothly.</p>
<p>

<p>Hey, guys...<br />
</p>
I'm not sure if it is actually the same case, but something very similar was happening to my laptop Asus X550LA (came with Windows 8):<br />
After upgrading to Windows 10, through an update and making a clean install (yeah, I've experienced this three times already) everything just seems to work fine, restarting the PC as drivers and programs ask and so.<br />
<br />
However, when I go and turn the PC off it actually does not turn off completely, the power and internet indicators are still lit and I can hear the sound of the fan still running. The problem gets worse if I try to force it turning it off using the power button
 because when I turn it on it shows an error and no option available is able to fix and make the OS work again. So I reinstall windows, it all happens again except that now I realized that I have to make the battery drain completely not to damage the OS.
<p><br />
</p>
I tried resetting BIOS to default,<br />
I tried disabling the Fast Boot in BIOS,<br />
I tried turning off "Turn on fast startup" inside power options<br />
and none of those worked.<br />
<br />
the only solution that worked for me and apparently for HP laptop users as well, is this one:
