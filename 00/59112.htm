<h2>            Transfer Xbox identity&#47;purchases to different microsoft account</h2>
                    When my son first started using his Xbox One we just logged him in using my microsoft account, including purchasing some games and Xbox Live.&nbsp; We have decided we want him to have his own account.&nbsp; How do we transfer everything Xbox to his Microsoft account,
 including gamertag, Xbox Live account, and purchased games?&nbsp; (I have seen instructions that many search engines send me to on Visihow, but that only tells me how to move the gamertag using Xbox 360, so not helpful.)

<p>Hey there Chalene thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the confusion but rest assured we are here to help, unfortunately there is no way to "transfer" content between Microsoft Accounts. What we can suggest is setting up a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12407/microsoft-account-change-email-phone-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Account Alias </a>since this would give him access to his Gamertag, Xbox Live ect. With a new Microsoft Account. We also understand that this can get a bit confusing so<span>

<h2>            Desktop monitor settings have changed to narrow view not wide view as before</h2>
                    <p>I have just had my desktop settings changed and didn't not instigate the change . The screen is squashed in to a narrow view. I have tried restore settings to a previous point in time but that has been unsuccessful. I have tried going to adjust monitor settings
 and that didn't work either. I am using Microsoft windows 10 . Monitor is a phillips .
</p>
<p>I notice a download of dropbox was the only thing that was downloaded on 6/8/2016 by someone else at home and have uninstalled it now ,though I cant see how that has caused the screen resolution and view change. Any ideas out there ?</p>

            <p>Hello Jacob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding further, I would like to know what is the make and model of the Computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to <span>go to the manufacturer’s website and search for the latest available display driver and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't help, try uninstalling the driver and restart the computer and have Windows automatically install the latest driver upon restart.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below steps to uninstall the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press “<strong>Windows + X”</strong> and select <strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2. Select <strong>Display Adapter</strong> and expand the driver icon.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right click on the driver icon and click on <strong>Uninstall </strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>4. Restart the Computer and check the functionality.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.

<h2>            Windows Restore failed to extract the file xxxx from the restore point</h2>
                    <p>After selecting the restore point the system attempts to recover but fails with the above error then states an unspecified error 0x8007025d has occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the file name given in the first error and it is present in the \Windows\WinSxS\Backup folder but I don't know how to verify it's contents. Running sfc reports no errors. I've tried disabling AV software and running from safemode but I always
 get the same error, I have tried different restore points too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest what else to try?</p>

<p>Hi bezook,</p>
<p>a. Which is the CD Player that you own?</p>
<p>Most of the CD Players do support MP3 file format as it is a old format.</p>
<p>Ripping is the process of copying songs from an audio CD to your computer. During the ripping process, the Player compresses each song and stores it on your hard disk as a Windows Media Audio (WMA), WAV, or MP3 file. After that, you can sync the files to
 a portable music player, burn the files to a CD, add the files to a playlist, or simply play the files without having to find and insert the CD.</p>
<p>You can use Windows Media Player to rip (or copy) tracks from your audio CDs onto your computer. After you rip the tracks, they become files on your computer. There are a number of settings that you can customize to make ripping work better for you.</p>
<p>To change rip settings in the Rip settings menu:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click the Start button Picture of the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button Picture of the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Insert a CD into your CD drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click Rip settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click one or more of the following menu items:</p>
<p>Format. Choose a format for the files that are created during the ripping process. The default format is Windows Media Audio. Here are other available options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Media Audio Pro. This format supports a broad range of uses, from full-resolution, multi-channel audio for surround sound systems to highly efficient audio compression at low bit rates for portable devices. Not all devices support this format.
</li><li>Windows Media Audio (Variable Bit Rate). This format can reduce the file size, but ripping might also take longer.
</li><li>Windows Media Audio Lossless. This format provides the best audio quality; however, the file size might increase.
</li><li>MP3. This format is older than the Windows Media Audio format and is supported by most media devices.
</li><li>WAV (Lossless). This format produces very large, uncompressed files. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your selections apply to tracks you rip in the future; it's not possible to use the Player to change the format of a track you've already ripped. If you're not sure which format works best for you, try ripping to different formats
 and quality settings and then listen to the different tracks to help you decide.</p>
<p>Once you change the Rip settings and set the format, you may then burn the CD.</p>
<p>Refer these links for more information:</p>

                    Is it safe to leave netwrok discovery on and file sharing off? Because I was just wondering if I should turn it off for my home computer since other devices have had virus before. Can I get a virus if I leave network discovery on and file sharing off,
 if I have another computer or device that has a virus on the same network?

            You can turn off Network Discovery in both places.  If you have any issues then turn it back on to test it.

    <title>Why is Windows 10 networking so unreliable&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> venutius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows 10 networking so unreliable&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My home network connects to three Windows 10 PCs, 3 Android mobile phones, a NAS drive and various TVs, DVDs etc.&nbsp; The mobile phones always see all other devices on the network.&nbsp; The Windows 10 PCs will sometimes see all the devices but more often than not
 do register the NAS drive.&nbsp; Sometime they see each other on the Homegroup, sometimes not even when you can access a folder&nbsp;of another PC using the Network section of Explorer.&nbsp; Sometimes you can see a NAS drive folder by searching for it, other time the Windows
 10 PC state that the NAS drive is not connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this could be because one or more of the Windows 10&nbsp;PCs is having a "bad hair day" or sulking but it's far more likely to be a coding or timing error.&nbsp; Are these bugs going to be resolved in the new Creative Update or are they just going to continue
 to fester and annoy users?</p>

<p>I have read in the forums that some NASes have issues. It might be worthwhile to check with your NASes manufacture for possible fixes for that aspect of your network.</p>
<p>As to the other issues, I unfortunately don't have any ideas. Hopefully someone else will.</p>

<p>I have same situation, and I try to buy a color of cable that semi-matches the carpet or wall molding and then run it up against the edge of the wall so that there is a minimum of cable going across carpets/floor in view.</p>

<p>What about inconsistent network connections to other win 10 computers on <em>wired</em> LAN connections?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I "have" four Win10 computers connected to a router with static IP addresses (so no IP conflicts).</span></p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/86156804-667f-4713-9c86-0623703c3596" title="Venutius">Venutius</a><span>&nbsp;rightly
 points out, sometimes network connections connect, sometimes they don't.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For me, sometimes computer A can see computer B but B sees no one else. Sometimes they all see each other...sometimes only three, soooo frustrating</span><span>.&nbsp;</span>This was the
 reason I avoided NAS drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since I edit videos, I need to move lots of files around the my 20 Hdds on my Network, so I often resort to external drives, small flash drives or email between computers which&nbsp;are right next to each other!</span></p>

<p><strong>I have Windows XP home edition on my pc and it recently is unable to boot up after coming out of standby. After failed attempts to reboot in safe mode or last known good config, the blue screen headed 'UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME' along with the tech
 info: 'STOP: 0x000000ED (0x8337EE30, 0xC0000006,0x000000000m0x000000000)' appears. If I had selected safe mode, this is usually preceded by a log list of multidisc drive codes or file names which I have no clue about.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately I don't have a recovery disc and haven't installed any recent hardware that would have conflicting drives. I can only remember a couple days prior allowing my pc to reboot when prompted that some Windows updates were ready to install.
 I'm also wodering if my McAfee av program, which of course updates periodically is causing any registry or other problems.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Would really appreciate if anyone could shed some light on this.</strong></p>

            <p>You need to somehow get an internet connection working -- be it through a USB-to-Ethernet dongle, or a WiFi access point it remembers -- to get the device to connect. (Disclaimer: I do not know if it will down-sync the&nbsp;new password.)</p>

            <p>I solved&nbsp;my problem without reverting or reinstalling operating system. Here is how to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Try to disable some or all Startup Tasks. You do so from Task Manager, expanded view. There is a Startup tab that contains the Startup Tasks. Write down which are enabled for future reference, then disable all. Make changes to Startup Tasks take effect
 by logging out and back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Try to disable some or all Services. You do so from Task Manager, expanded view. Click File/Start new task. When new dialog appears, type msconfig into&nbsp;its box. It is tricky when the screen blinks and best done one letter at a time. Click Ok, which is
 also tricky. The next screen is System Configuration. It has a Services tab. Uncheck "Windows Error Reporting Service" and "Problem Reports and Solutions" first, they are likely candidates. Make changes to Services take effect by clicking Ok on System Configuration,
 and Ok on the next "Do you want to restart" screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If disabling all Startup Tasks and all Services does not work, your&nbsp;problem is different. Restore both to the&nbsp;state you wrote down before messing with them - or just enable all.&nbsp;Good Luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my computer, enabling Norton Download Startup Task gave me a notification that a new version of Norton Antivirus was available. I installed it, then reenabled all Services. My computer runs Win10 just fine now.</p>

    <title>Find a specific word anywhere on your computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julie25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Find a specific word anywhere on your computer.</h2>
                    I too am UNABLE to find all instances of a specific word on my computer even using the methods above.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was easy as could be on XP.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did they ruin such a good thing?&nbsp; Furthermore, if people have to always go to libraries to search for things, why doesn't the thing default to libraries in the first place?&nbsp; I don't think anyone else in the world could've
 made&nbsp;something that was wonderfully simple in previous versions so outrageously difficult and ridiculous.&nbsp;&nbsp;One more version like Vista and Windows7 and I'll become an Apple user for life!<br />
<br />
Surely they can produce updates to undo the horrific mess of changes in the Windows7 search key!&nbsp; It really has become a horror show!

<div>Hi Julie25,</div>
<div><br />
If you're having problems locating specific files, folders, or other items on your computer, try using the Search and Indexing troubleshooter to fix the problem. It makes sure that the Windows Search service is running, and checks to see whether you have the
 correct permissions to search all the directories on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Follow the below steps to run the troubleshooter.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Search and Indexing troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click View all, and then click Search and Indexing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information, refer the below link:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also add the file type that's not currently recognized by the index, to the index so you can search in Windows by that file type.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.Open Indexing Options by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type indexing options, and then click Indexing Options.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2.Click Advanced. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.In the Advanced Options dialog box, click the File Types tab.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4.In the Add new extension to list box, type the file name extension (for example, "txt"), and then click Add.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5.Click Index Properties Only or Index Properties and File Contents, and then click OK.</div>

<div><br />
Also check whether all the drives are added to the location to&nbsp; be indexed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Click on Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Indexing Options-&gt;Place a check mark on all the drives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. If the drives are not mentioned click on Modify and add the drives from here.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Once you have enabled the Indexing Option, you can type in any word or phrase in the Start menu and you will be able to open the particular document or file.</div>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to solve your concern. Follow the steps below:</p>
(Note: Make sure to create a backup before proceeding on editing/changing registry values)
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong> and type <strong>regedit</strong>. Click OK or press Enter.</li><li>Navigate to <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\StickyKeys</strong><span>&nbsp;in the left pane.</span></li><li><span>In the right pane locate</span>&nbsp;<strong>Flags</strong><span>, double click it and change its value to&nbsp;</span><strong>506</strong><span>.</span></li><li>Navigate to <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\Keyboard Response</strong> key in the left pane.</li><li>Locate <strong>Flags </strong>in the right pane, double click it and set its value to
<strong>122</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\ToggleKeys</strong> key in the left pane.</li><li>Locate <strong>Flags </strong>in right pane and set its value to <strong>58</strong>.</li><li>Close Registry Editor and <strong>restart </strong>your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the steps above does not work, you may need to try to use a different keyboard or a new keyboard, as faulty keyboard tend to have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Windows Logo and Spinning Dots In Windows 10 on Reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadydi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Logo and Spinning Dots In Windows 10 on Reboot</h2>
                    <p>I read all the previous questions and answers about this problem, and the last entry was in January 2017. &nbsp;My problem is a little different in that in addition to having the windows logo and spinning dots on a black screen, my mouse also did not work during
 the few times I got the automatic repair screen to come up. &nbsp;You have to click on one of the buttons and without the mouse, it won't work. &nbsp;Even tried the arrow keys and they didn't work either. &nbsp;Would appreciate any help you can provide on this issue. Thank
 you.</p>

<p>If you can download Windows 10 setup using another computer and create a bootable USB stick, you can boot your computer with that. Then try
<strong>Repair your computer </strong>link from the second screen of setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If auto-repair does not work, you can get a Command Prompt by using SHIFT-F10 from the first screen of setup, after booting from the install USB. Then you can try commands like
<strong>chkdsk </strong>and <strong>sfc </strong>to see if you can repair Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other way to get to Repair screen is when computer starts and you see swirling dots, hold power button in for 5 or more seconds until it powers off. Do this twice. On third boot, it should go to Repair (but you say your mouse may not work).</p>

<p>No. If you do a new install, it says to skip entering any Product Key if you are reinstalling Windows. It will just auto-activate when Microsoft servers recognize your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to Repair Windows. If you install it clean without finding a way to back up your data, you would lose what is saved there.</p>

<h2>            Intel compute Stick STK1aw32sc issues with windows update</h2>
                    <p>I have an Intel compute stick running windows 10 ( Atom Processor). When windows update updated the intel HD graphics driver it caused the screen to go blank. I have booted it into safe mode and uninstalled the driver. it then works until windows updates
 the driver again. I am my wits end, I cant stop the update . This is the second time i have had this issue. The first time I downloaded drivers from intel directly, it worked fine until windows decided&nbsp; to update my drivers again. I keep uninstalling and window
 keeps updating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas.</p>

            Yes.&nbsp; I had already done all of the reset and sfc stuff before I made this post to the community.&nbsp; Hello works after you have logged into the computer, when it goes to "sleep" after sitting for a time and screensaver goes off.&nbsp; Hello will not log you into
 the computer.&nbsp; There is a setting that changed in the upgrade somewhere. Hello comes up when you turn on the computer, it accepts my face like it did, and then it just goes back to the lock screen.&nbsp; You then have to double click the screen and it gives you
 "sign in options" to click.&nbsp; I can then click it and click pin and it will log on the computer.<br />

            My problem is fixed.&nbsp; However, I don't know exactly if this fixed the problem or not, but if you go to the settings menu, accounts, sign-in options, privacy( at the bottom), turn off "use my sign in to automatically finish setting up my device after an
 update or restart".&nbsp; My Hello has been logging into my computer for the last 2 days.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the exact same problem and the change you suggested fixed it for me aswell. Wish I found your suggestion earlier as it would have saved me a lot of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Win7 SP1&#58; Win Update fails with 80080005&#59; Always &#34;Preparing to configure new updates&#34; on restart&#59; Can&#39;t run sfc &#47;scannow</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a perplexing problem, or series of problems, which appears to have started about a week ago. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The summary of the issue is that Windows Update will not run, reporting error&nbsp;80080005. &nbsp;As well as breaking new updates, more urgently it's also preventing me from using basic USB devices on new ports (even my mouse and keyboard), which means I can't use
 a new USB hub I purchased. &nbsp;It's also preventing me from upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent the last two days trying to resolve it, trying a myriad of different fixes found on this site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from the below I have already tried a great deal, including many things that have resolved issues for others. &nbsp;I'm willing to try anything and everything else that might resolve the problem, short of a full re-installation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do realise that my system sounds pretty screwed, but I can't currently re-install because I do not have any Windows 7 media. &nbsp;(I hoped I could download it from Microsoft, but it seems only Windows 8 is still available for download.) &nbsp;And in any case, what
 I ultimately want to do is upgrade to Windows 10, but I can't do that unless I can get Windows Update working so that I can download it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the long post but I hope all the detail provided will help narrow down the problem and rule out things I've already tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />
</p>

</li><li>Every time I restart, Windows hangs at "Preparing to configure Windows / Do not turn off your computer."
<ol>
<li>I have on multiple occasions left it at this point for several hours; no hard drive activity is visible and it never proceeds.</li><li>I tried removing the file C:\Windows\winsxs\reboot.xml, which made no difference.</li></ol>
</li><li>I cannot run sfc /scannow due to error "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service".
<ol>
<li>But TrustedInstaller (Windows Modules Installer) service is working fine, which is the most frequently mentioned fix for this problem.</li><li>Running sfc /scannow generates the following Event Log error:
<ol>
<li>The server {8F5DF053-3013-4DD8-B5F4-88214E81C0CF} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li><li>Control Panel -&gt; Programs and Features -&gt; "Turn Windows features on or off" : shows no features listed at all; I cannot add or remove Windows features
<ol>
<li>I looked at this with a view to disabling Windows Search, as my Windows Search service hangs on boot.</li><li>I don't particularly need/want to remove or change Windows features, but it is another system problem that's occurring that perhaps is indicative of something?</li><li>When I go to "Turn Windows features on or off", it shows "Please wait.." for a couple of minutes. &nbsp;Then this message disappears, but no list of features appear. &nbsp;It just shows an empty control with OK/Cancel buttons.</li><li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/HCSorlV.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Screenshot showing the empty Windows Features control</a>.</li><li>When opening the Windows Features control, I see the following Event Logs:

</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem(s) trigger:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the problem started around September 26th, as that is when Windows Update was last able to check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not installed any significant software on or since that date - just a couple of minor third-party programs. &nbsp;To be safe, I have uninstalled everything I installed since then, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only possible cause I can think of is that a week or two ago (I am not sure of the exact timing), I suddenly found myself out of disk space. &nbsp;My C: drive is a 64GB SSD drive and so I am always quite low on space, but I try to keep it to always having
 5GB free. &nbsp; A week or two ago I suddenly found I had no space free at all. &nbsp;This resulted in explorer.exe crashing. &nbsp;Once it had restarted, I quickly removed some downloads and uninstalled some programs to resolve the issue,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the sudden loss of disk space was probably related to Windows Update downloading Windows 10 in the background, though I can't be sure. &nbsp;Later I found I had 2.6GB used in SoftwareDistribution, and a few hundred MB (can't remember the precise amount)
 in C:\Windows.~BT - both of which I have subsequently removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if the timing of this disk space issue relates to when updates stopped working, as I only noticed the problem a couple of days ago when I found USB devices weren't working. &nbsp;But it's the only issue I can think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I've tried in detail:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>A malware scan with two different tools; no problems found, only a couple of regkeys relating to "potentially unwanted programs", removed by the first scan.</li><li>Running sfc /scannow
<ol>
<li>It fails each time with "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service"</li><li>Investigating this, I found multiple references to the problem being related to the Windows Modules Installer service, AKA "trustedinstaller"</li><li>My trustedinstaller service runs fine - it is in Disabled state, and starts fine when I manually start it</li><li>I also checked the registry keys mentioned in fixes for Trusted Installer, for example in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/959077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB959077</a>, and found them to be fine.</li><li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/3lSbkae.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This screenshot</a> of an elevated command prompt shows me successfully starting TrustedInstaller, followed by sfc /scannow failing.</li><li>After running sfc /scannow, I see the following error in the Event Log:
<ol>
<li>The server {8F5DF053-3013-4DD8-B5F4-88214E81C0CF} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li><li>Running the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System Update Readiness Tool</a>&nbsp;(KB947821)
<ol>
<li>After a very long process, this installed itself; seemingly successfully.</li><li>However the only noticeable result was that the system now takes longer to get to desktop - it used to be that after I clicked on my username on the Login screen, I would see the desktop in ~15 seconds. &nbsp;It now takes up to two minutes, including 1.5 minutes
 of a black screen with just a mouse cursor visible.</li></ol>
</li><li>Moving C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution and C:\Windows\System32\Catroot2
<ol>
<li>I am now not sure if I should have done CatRoot2 - it was mentioned in one lengthy answer to a similar Windows Update problem, but I later realised that the answer was related to Vista.</li><li>I was going to move it back, but I saw that it had by then been rebuilt by the Windows Update Reset Fixit</li><li>I still have my original Catroot2 directory that I could move back if needed, however the problem has not changed since it was moved/rebuilt - and the newly re-built directory is of a similar size to the original.</li></ol>
</li><li>Ran the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update Reset Fixit</a>, twice:
<ol>
<li>Both times it took at least twenty minutes to run.</li><li>Both times it listed a bunch of issues that it said it fixed - I think the same list each time, though I didn't save the first report so I can't be absolutely certain.</li><li>Though the second time the overview screen seemed to say that it had not fixed some of them, but then when I went to the full report it said it had Completed all the fixes.</li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0gMJmoTq7-ZeF90MkxBeVNxdnM/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This is a link to the full report</a>&nbsp;from the second time I ran the fixer,&nbsp;printed as an XPS file (the only option the fixer seemed to give me
 to save the report was to print it, so I printed it to an XPS file.)</li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0gMJmoTq7-ZTEM1dENYSVlzdkE/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This is a link to the zip file of log files</a> the fixer created, again from the second run. &nbsp;It contains DataStore.edb, dism.log and
 WindowsUpdate.log.</li></ol>
</li><li>Installed the latest versions of the Windows Update Agent, from this Fixit: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/949104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to update the Windows Update Agent to the latest version</a>
<ol>
<li>After doing so, &nbsp;I then re-registered the components as follows (following advice from Shenan in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/code-80080005-error-on-windows-update-with-windows/45cdbfa6-5d39-4223-8acc-c5fbc1c347d4?page=1">
this thread</a>), all of which completed successfully:
<ol>
<li>regsvr33 Jscript.dll</li><li>regsvr32 wuapi.dll</li><li>regsvr32 wuaueng.dll</li></ol>
</li><li>The first time I tried this (I've now done it twice), it resulted in the only change I've seen throughout the whole process:
<ol>
<li>I installed the Windows Update Agent, then rebooted, then I ran the three regsvr32 commands as above, then rebooted again</li><li>After this second reboot, I did <em>not</em> get the "Preparing to configure Windows.." screen; the first and only time I have not seen it.</li><li>However the next time I rebooted it was back again, and has always been present since then, including after I repeated the re-installation of Windows Update Agent and then re-registering the three components a second time.</li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li><li>Run the&nbsp;<span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Genuine Advantage Diagnostics Tool</a>, which reported no problems.</span></li><li><span>Ran chkdsk c: /f /r, which ran on reboot and reported no problems.</span></li><li><span>Moved the file C:\Windows\WinSXS\reboot.xml, in an attempt to remove the persistent "Preparing to configure updates.." screen on restart</span>
<ol>
<li><span>I had only reboot.xml, not the related file pending.xml</span></li><li><span>This did nothing: &nbsp;on next restart the Preparing screen still showed, displaying this time with no reboot.xml present at all (it was not re-created.)</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Resetting Winsock with &nbsp;</span>NETSH WINSOCK RESET &nbsp;in an elevated cmd.exe, then rebooting
<ol>
<li>I found this advice in a <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/255049-windows-7-update-error-code-80080005-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
thread on a Windows 7 forum</a>, as a possible fix for the 80080005 error which they said "can be related to Winsock".</li><li><span>It had no noticeable effect.</span></li></ol>

<p>I have the following random errors in my Event Logs</p>

<p>A couple are obviously related to the issue, but I do do not know if the rest are, or even whether they are new or have been going on for a while, as I regularly clear out my Event Logs (using the tool CCleaner Professional) to save disk space, of which
 I am very short on my SSD C: drive (6GB remaining at this time)</p>
</li><li>
<p>I am pretty sure that I've definitely seen the WMI error (related to the "Event filter with query.. ") in the past, long before these issues started, so I doubt that's related.</p>

            <p>Hi Ratandeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already tried twice to install the latest Microsoft Update, as found on this page: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/949104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to update the Windows Update agent to the latest version</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the link you provided had a different file name, so I tried this as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did not help. &nbsp; What I did was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloaded the file WindowsUpdateAgent30-x64.exe that you linked</li><li>Installed it</li><li>Rebooted</li><li>Tested: no change</li><li>Re-registered the Windows Updaate components with:
<ol>
<li>regsvr33 Jscript.dll</li><li>regsvr32 wuapi.dll</li><li>regsvr32 wuaueng.dll</li></ol>
</li><li>Rebooted</li><li>Tested: no change.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the Windows 10 download link. &nbsp;I will use this to get Windows 10 and maybe I will just re-install the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if anyone has any further ideas for fixing my current OS, I still would really appreciate them, as I would rather get this Win 7 install working first and then upgrade in a few weeks, rather than go through the upheaval of a re-installation right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

</p><blockquote>...I do realise that my system sounds pretty screwed, but I can't currently re-install because I do not have any Windows 7 media. &nbsp;(I hoped I could download it from Microsoft, but it seems only Windows 8 is still available for download.)&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>I've just gone through some Windows Update pain (after reinstall of W7 Home Premium SP1) and so symphasise with your troubles!&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ensure data/locally stored email is backed up obviously)</p>
<p>You should be able to get a generic Win7 ISO quite easily (assuming you have a valid license key).</p>
<p>Does this not work?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows7"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Either do an in place upgrade (start the install WITHIN windows and perform an upgrade install to keep all your existing stuff; obviously needs a bit of spare disk space) or start from scratch (good luck with getting Windows Update going here!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I'd tempted to to a W10 upgrade (from ISO). Do the upgrade first (you must do an upgrade first). It's not as painful as you might think. And can revert back to your W7 in 1month.&nbsp; Then, in your own time, you can do a clean install if required.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately no, Microsoft won't let me use that site:</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed7ec769-1d05-422f-b377-b4432da2f530" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The manufacturer I bought my PC from, five years ago, is no longer in business. &nbsp;So that's not much help. &nbsp; &nbsp;And a pretty unnecessary restriction on Microsoft's part, in my view. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Win10, yeah I guess I will have to do it. &nbsp;The thing is I really don't want to do an in-place upgrade. &nbsp;For one thing, I (stupidly) put my C: drive on a 64GB SSD drive - it was a particularly fast SSD and I, naively, thought that I could just install
 most apps/data on other drives. &nbsp;Of course that doesn't work well on Windows, where far too much is hardcoded to write to C:. &nbsp;Many Microsoft apps, even if chosen to install to another drive, install multiple gigabytes of data to C as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never have more than 6GB free, which I am sure is nowhere near enough for an upgrade. &nbsp;I might be able to free up more by basically uninstalling everything. &nbsp;But naturally I do not want to repeat the same mistake next time, I plan to re-install on a much
 larger C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So an in-place upgrade is going to require removing a whole bunch of stuff, if I'm able to - I can't, for example, uninstall Microsoft Office, it just hangs during the uninstallation process, probably for the same reasons as Windows Upgrade and other things
 are broken. &nbsp;Assuming I can remove enough to make space on my tiny C: drive I'll then do an in-place upgrade, only to immediately delete it all to re-install from fresh media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping there's a way to avoid all that. &nbsp;The site that Ratandeep just linked me said I could use the tool to download media then burn it to DVD, so I'm hoping that will allow a fresh install? &nbsp;Though that relies on Win10 accepting my Win7 key when I
 install it? &nbsp;I don't fully know how the whole free upgrade thing works exactly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway you can see why I'd much rather just get this Win7 install working, or at least working&nbsp;<em>enough</em>, for now, so I can do all of that Win10 hassle when I've got more time.</p>

<p>The W10 download link works very well (just have to pick the right version). I didn't read your reply fully (too many words!) but ...idea... image your 64GB SSD to your old hard drive (assuming its not broken and not used as a backup!).&nbsp; May be slow but
 gives you more options...</p>
<p>What version of W7 do you have?&nbsp; And do you have its key?&nbsp; The ISOs are around.&nbsp; At a risk to myself have a look at getintopc (valid, non torrent ISOs, all which need license keys to activate;&nbsp; I supply this info at your risk; blah blah blah).</p>
