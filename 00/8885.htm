    <title>Microsoft and excel keeps freezing with Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft and excel keeps freezing with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Good evening</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I must stress at this stage that I am not IT literate at all so will endeavour to explain as clearly as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had problems with my PC for a couple of months randomly freezing and unable to sort it unless forcing turning it off and on again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in the last week or so, it now freezes after just a few minutes on outlook (365), excel and on occasion, &nbsp;even when I am on the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found I have to work as quickly as possible before the computer freezes, &nbsp;in which I have to switch off and switch on again. It's extremely frustrating, &nbsp;expecially when the advent computer is only 12 months old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help gratefully received</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks Marie☺</p>

 and installed, but now it's looking for parts of both Outlook 2000 &amp; 2010. &nbsp;How do I uninstall Outlook 2000 without the original disc?

<h2>            IE 11 and Ebay won&#39;t let you log in.</h2>
                    <p>Why oh why do I have so much grief with IE11.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Log in to ebay and it goes to ebays home page click my ebay and it asks you to log in again so log in again and it just loops to log in log in continuously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try log in on the wifes phone it works first time if I try log in on the wifes laptop using IE 10 it works perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have loads of trouble with IE11 this being the main one which is making me reconsider Microsoft products as they all fail to do what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have spoken to ebay who said it is a browser problem&nbsp;after trying every trick in the book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reset IE11 I have deleted it and reinstalled it nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can Microsoft come up with a solution or is it going to be sack off Microsoft and use a different brand?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't won't to downgrade to ie10 as I can't find it unless I use some other site I don't trust. I tried Firefox easy to download and as clear as mud when you first come to use it, I tried and clicked on everything available on firefox&nbsp; to just get a homepage
 to search from it was impossible so I deleted it. Chrome seems to have half the bits I need missing again I can't find half the stuff I use like a simple home page button yak hated chrome.&nbsp;&nbsp; So come on Microsoft sort this IE11 out as it is driving me crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No offence but I will donate money to a charity if I get a reply and a working solution from Microsoft as the other 70+ emails I have sent them over anything have been ignored.</p>

            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>I had tried a soft reset to no avail, but now I have at least temporarily solved the problem. I think that the issue is the tiny memory of the Lumia 640; it is easily filled to capacity. I have an SD card and had my settings set to download new apps (and
 all else) to the card. I think when some update occurred, neither the Weather Channel nor Messenger could access enough memory OR be downloaded to the SD card. To fix, I uninstalled, the apps, deleted everything I could from the device's memory (which wasn't
 a lot), then set to download new apps to device, re-installed the apps and then restarted the device. &nbsp;The apps now work again and I have reset to download new apps to SD card. There may be problems with future updates of apps that insist upon using the internal
 storage, but things work for now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note, I wish the phone had better internal memory or that everything would load w/o trouble to the SD card. My Sibley's Guide to the Birds takes up a lot of space on the device, but cannot be moved to the SD card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Silverlight Update Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mycroft-holmes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Silverlight Update Bug</h2>
                    <p>Silverlight brings up an Interactive Services Detection window.</p>
<p>When I select View the message it takes over my displays and tells me there's an update available for Silverlight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately my mouse disappears and it is impossible to navigate with the keyboard to make an entry (tab doesn't work or alt-tab, or any other key combination including space and enter to select the default option)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes it impossible to use.</p>

<p>
</p><p>"impossible" or just challenging? &nbsp; E.g. try using Narrator to see where it would take you in your UI.&nbsp; Note that when Narrator selects something it puts a blue box around it; so even if your Tab isn't showing you something with keyboard focus Narrator's
 might.&nbsp; Also, Narrator can show you a description of everything that it sees in some context by using Caps Lock + Shift + Enter.&nbsp; Note that Caps Lock is only needed if you don't have Narrator's "Narrator key" locked (the default).&nbsp; You can toggle that lock
 with Z; e.g. to set it press Caps Lock Z.</p>

<h2>            Help....Playlists and Unlock in WM6</h2>
                    I've just recently started a switch from a Palm OS Treo 680 to a Treo 750 with WM6.&nbsp; Two things that are driving me CRAZY!<br />
<br />
- In the Windows Media Player...how do I create a playlist of songs located on my SD card?<br />
- I continue to get asked for an "unlock" code.&nbsp; How do I turn this Locking feature OFF?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

 this error code incorrectly when blocking a message due to triggering a filter such as a URL in the message being found in a domain black list. To properly address your concern, we'd like to know more information. Kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using a company provided email service?</li><li>Are you sending to a recipient within the same email domain?</li><li>does your email contains attachments?</li></ul>

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same issue...Spectrum Customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Started about 2 weeks ago receiving "5.2.0 ESMTP server not available AUP#O-1450" message code.&nbsp; Currently using Spectrum Business Class with Office Outlook on both Mac &amp; PC to forward email messages that has original message embedded into the message with
 no attachment. Only able to forward when every part of original email message is removed except person's name and phone number.&nbsp; Please note: The size is not an issue and the file type worked previously on other emails sent from same companies.&nbsp; The one consistency
 for our issue is that the message always has an embedded message with clients company contact information and website address.&nbsp; Sometimes there is a photo embedded...but not always.&nbsp; Troubleshooting consisted of forwarding original email messsage to email
 address with same domain and various email addresses with different servers.&nbsp; Also, tried directly forwarding using Spectrum's webmail and unable to send within that mailbox also. Contacted Spectrum last Friday (6 days ago) &amp; as of yesterday was told the issue
 had been elevated to a higher level of tech in the morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Sam,<br />
<br />
There are few reasons why you might be getting that error message when applying the email server settings on for your Outlook to be able to get it to run like the email server settings needs to be reconfigured or it could maintenance is done on your email server.
 That being said, we advise you to have your issue raised through <strong><a href="http://forums.timewarnercable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Spectrum's Online Forum</a></strong>. This is so concern's such as the error message that you receive would
 be looked into as this is already related to the email settings that needs further investigation with their support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other questions or concerns in the future, we're just a click away.</p>

<p>I have further narrowed it down to the recipient's email address being located in the body of the email. If I am replying to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then i just need to delete the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** from the body of the message and it will go. Spectrum will say if it works
 in web mail and fails in Outlook then it's not our problem.</p>
<p>Also if i reply to someone else and i place the email address of the person i can't reply to in this message it will fail.</p>

<h2>            Completely Removing Trojan &#40;Win32.Cryptor&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so after years of being very careful and performing virus scans with different software almost daily, I've been struck with a Trojan Horse. I think it was called Win32.Cryptor by AVG&nbsp;and on Microsoft's Virus Database, it states that it redirects or hijacks
 search results from Morzilla and IE--I was really stupid and did not copy down the name in Malwarebytes after scan and just deleted the logs.</p>
<p>Anyway, I first noticed the virus after seeing losts of rundlls running in Task Manager and RAM usage going right up to 2GB on windows 7 64 bit idle. I opened "Processes", selected "Command Line" column, and saw that they were all originating from &lt;username&gt;/appdata/local/&lt;random
 folder name&gt;/&lt;random file name.dll&gt;. Since the dll had no description, digital signature and was supposedly a part of a office suite I've never installed (it was called MouseOffice.dll or something along those lines), I quickly ran an MSE Scan.</p>
<p>MSE detected some Java expilot trojan in the Java folder (had many of these in the past) and sucessfully removed them, but i don't think it detected this weird dll file in my appdata).</p>
<p>I then proceeded to upload this&nbsp;strange dll from my appdata folder&nbsp;to Jotti and VirusTotal, and they reported a trojan (all I remember was AVG calling it Win32.Cryptor). I typed the name in, and I saw that it had many other names and the MSE database said
 that it hijacked/redirected search results from IE/Morzilla.</p>
<p>So fearing the worst, because I access many sensitive business email accounts from this computer, I ran Malwarebytes Free Edition, all updated, and it detected 4 threats, 2 files, 1 memory module running, and 1 registry key, and I quarntined and removed
 them. Out of stupidity, I deleted the logs and didn't bother to jot the infection, name down. So, I then proceeded to boot into same mode, and do the scans again (Malwarebytes full scan and MSE), they both detected nothing.</p>
<p>I checked MSCONFIG after these scans, and everything seemed to be normal, in the Services Tab, there were 2 non-Microsoft Servics running at boot (AMD Driver stuff), and in startup, I have hpsysdrv (HP driver), MSE, and AMD Catalyst Control-- All the usual
 stuff. </p>
<p>I also observe that on a normal boot, I have 43-45 processes running in the first few minutes, then dropping down to 40-41 after that time on idle...before the antivirus scans, I had upwards of 50, but now, they seem to go back to normal. RAM usage at idle
 is around 1.2 GB, which seems normal...no abnormal network activity on idle with no internet apps running</p>
<p>I checked the appdata folders (local and roaming), and deleted the folder which the trojan was (named QuickCertServ), as although malwarebytes deleted the trojan, it did not remove the empty folder that it has resided in. I then checked all other folders
 in appdata, and they were fine (genuine installed software). </p>
<p>So after doing all this, I rebooted again and am now running a MSE Full Scan, afterwards which I plan to run Malwarebytes full scan again to make sure that the trojan is definitely gone...just as a precaution.</p>
<p>If these scans turn out fine, can I be called Virus Free?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. I know to be truely virus-free guarenteed, I have to reformat, but that is out of the question, because of all the data that has to be reinstalled, apps, etc...</p>
<p>I just want to be sure that there are no keyloggers/rootkits hiding and waiting for me to enter sensitive data or automatically redownload the virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also don't feel safe running all the other apps recommended such as Spybot, SuperAntiSpyware, Hitman, Combofix, because they do not really have reliable reputations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, can I say that I have oblierated the virus and that my computer is secure once again? Thanks!</p>
<p>Edit: The timestamp on this trojan dll was January 5, 10:30PM, at which time I was on Youtube, and I had just downloaded a FSX addon from UKScenery2000 (which I trust as I had downloaded many other files from them over the years, but maybe this one got screwed
 up?). Earlier that night, I was on the internet when a java applet loaded in the background for no reason and&nbsp;I saw no java app on the screen&nbsp;(maybe that infected me)?</p>

            <p>I would run <strong>SAS Portable</strong> and run the <strong>Defender OffLine Beta</strong> recommended by NSILMike.</p>
<p>If both of those also came up clean I'd breathe a sigh of relief, hope for the best and resume using my computer.&nbsp; And I'd steer a wide berth from any site that I thought might have contributed to this issue.</p>
<p>You mentioned seeing a strange Java applet.&nbsp; Be sure you don't have any old versions of Java still in Control Panel...if so you need to remove them and have only the current version.&nbsp;

            <p>My appologies guys, I believe that you have misunderstood me. I have only completed full scans with MSE and Malwarebytes FREE Edition. The AVG results I mentioned was the result of submitting the suspcious dll file to Jotti (an online file checking service)
 to confirm, and not because I had it installed on my system. Sorry for the miscommunication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That aside, now that I have conducted 4 full MSE scans and 4 full Malwarebyte scans (with reboot in between), as well as ESET Online Scanner, can I assume that my computer is safe, and start entering passwords on it again?</p>

<p>Hi fastfr3,</p>
<p>Your field code appears to be missing the mergefield! Depending on how you want the results to appear upon completion of the merge, you need to use coding along the lines of:<br />
{INCLUDEPICTURE "C:\\users\\fred\\desktop\\icons\\«Image»" \d}<br />
or:<br />
{INCLUDEPICTURE {IF TRUE "C:\\users\\fred\\desktop\\icons\\«Image»"} \d}<br />
or:<br />
{IF {INCLUDEPICTURE {IF TRUE "C:\users\\fred\desktop\icons\«Image»"} \d} {INCLUDEPICTURE {IF TRUE "C:\users\fred\desktop\icons\«Image»"} \d}}</p>
<p>The first construction will require you to manually update the field display (Ctrl-A then F9) after the merge has executed and, if you don't want the images permanently linked to the files on your system, to then manually unlink them (Ctrl-A then Ctrl-Shift-F11).</p>
<p>The&nbsp;second construction automatically updates the field display when the merge has executes but, if you don't want the images permanently linked to the files on your system, you'll still have to manually unlink them (Ctrl-A then Ctrl-Shift-F11).</p>
<p>The&nbsp;third construction automatically updates the field display and unlinks the images when the merge has executes.</p>

                    <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/166a62ad-a6ff-4705-829f-bceb7573c5d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/166a62ad-a6ff-4705-829f-bceb7573c5d5?upload=true" /></a>After
 updating to Windows 10 a white horizontal line appears on front camera of my Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM. I tried every possible troubleshooting method. I got the latest update for Lumia selfie, reinstalled it, downloaded another selfie apps and checked if
 they had the same problem( Yes), reset the phone and afterall moved back to Windows 8.1 using Windows device recovery tool. But still the line appears. Any solutions?

</p><p>It appears that the issue is with the screen of your phone presuming that you are also seeing the line when not using the Camera app. If this is not the case, please use the Windows Device Recovery Tool again. This tool should restore your phone back to
 its factory settings, therefore, removing the trace that you have upgraded it to Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are also seeing the line when not using the Camera app, it only means that the screen is defective. If you would like to have the defective screen repaired or replaced, please get in touch with

            The line appears only when using the selfie camera app. It doesn't appear when using the rear camera. It doesn't seem to be an issue with the screen. I' ll try using the Windows device recovery tool again.

            Thank you for letting us know that the issue is only present when you are using the selfie camera. It is possible that the issue is caused by the selfie camera app that you are using. It could be that you just need to make changes to the settings.<br />

If you are not using any third-party apps when using the selfie camera, please use the aforementioned tool to restore your phone.<br />

Please let us know what happens after restoring your phone again using the Windows Device Recovery Tool.

<p>I'm not using third-party apps for selfie camera. It's the default Lumia Selfie. So I again performed a hard reset but it didn't help. So I restored my phone using Windows device recovery tool for the second time. The line is still present. Afterall it seems
 windows 10 update has permanently damaged my phone. I'm disappointed. Thanks for your concern anyways.</p>

    <title>Some excel files can be &#34;opened&#34; , but Excel does not open a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merel 469  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some excel files can be &#34;opened&#34; , but Excel does not open a window to show them.</h2>
                    Windows XP Professional <br />
MS Office 2010 Professional Plus<br />
<br />
To explain my issue I assume following terminology convention : Excel 2010 does [open] some of my recent files as any other file. BUT those recent files
<b>do NOT APPEAR on screen in a new window</b>. This condition will be described as [open] or [opened] between brackets
<br />
<br />
Explanation :<br />
<br />
I can see that a file has been <b>[opened]</b> in the sense that each time the temporary file "<b>~$filename.xlsx</b>" is being created by Excel (or Windows XP?)<br />
In such case , the temporary file will only be closed + removed from the current directory, by closing Excel 2010 itself.<br />
<br />
Once <b>[opened]</b> ,&nbsp; if asking via the <b>View</b> menu, to show all opened windows together on screen side by side, there is never any window showing the [opened] file. It just does not exists<br />
<br />
I made a little test creating a new Excel2010 file, which could opened normally , afterwards. Many files can be opened&nbsp; normally and show up in their respective windows. It looks as if only during the last session (yesterday) created files cannot be opened
 normally.<br />
I hope all of the older files will remain ok. This is a bit reassuring.<br />
<br />
But what is the problem with those files which are NOT OPENED IN A WINDOW by Excel 2010 ? The process stops after creating a temporary folder.
<br />
<br />
The issue is NOT caused by a wrong associated file extentension. Double clicking such file in Explorer opens the program Excel 2010.<br />
But launching in this way gives the same result : there is no window ;&nbsp; just an empty grey surface. No error message at all.<br />
<br />
I don't know yet how many files are affected by this issue, but of course I fear that this issue might be spreading further to more files becoming impossible to be viewed or edited.<br />
<br />
I had several previous experiences with MS-Office's files (which could not be opened) which were a piece of cake for Open Office to open them.<br />
So I will try to have those files rescued by using open source software... unless this issue receives the solution explained.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help. <br />

            Thank you very much Hans. <br />
<br />
I was not even aware that a workbook could be open and at the same time be hidden !<br />
I have been clicking in the close neighborhood of the button for 'hide' function (which by the way is one of the 6 icon-buttons missing a description, at least in this Dutch version and probably in all versions)<br />
<br />
I was lucky that I didn't loose data , but the "issue" scared me, because when one opens Excel later on, and then opens this workbook (only), but doesn't see anything at all on screen, that looks as if the file has been corrupted. Once hidden it stays hidden
 for the following Excel session.<br />

            <p>In Dutch, the caption of the button is "Zichtbaar maken".</p>
<p>Whether this caption is displayed depends on the width of the Excel application window - the narrower the window, the fewer captions are displayed.</p>
<p>You can hover the mouse pointer over each button - even if no caption is displayed, you should see a popup description of the function of the button.</p>

            Thank again Hans, <br />
Of course, immediately after reading your first instructions... that's what I did, checking that specific button's function... with the helping pop-up.<br />
<br />
By the way :<br />
I bought first the English version&nbsp; (because I always work in English on computers)<br />
But I had that much misery (after a normal installation without problems) with Word and Outlook&nbsp; running without all sorts of irritating problems, that I got a free Dutch version as a courtesy gift of the vendor, just to see if it could run any better !<br />
<br />
It made no difference.<br />
But after a very long painful period, I got it working right so I kept my Dutch version running.<br />
Believe it or not ... after&nbsp; MS "Search" program had been installed on my PC, ALL problems in MS Office 2010 were gone !!&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            Suddenly lost all contacts</h2>
                    <p>I have a lumia 930 phone with WP10 on it. Suddenly all of my contacts (phone numbers and names) are disappeared. The "phonebook" is completely empty. I tried&nbsp;<a href="https://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://people.live.com/</a>&nbsp;its
 empty too (I added a single contact and I can see that single one but not the other few dozens...).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weirdest off all is when somebody calls me (who supposed to be in the phonebook) my phone displays the persons name as it should. If I go to phone history, I can see the names there too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There were a lot of valuable contacts on my list, and now they are all gone. I hope you can offer some kind of solution to get back my connections.</p>

            If you an see contact names during calls,it means your contacts are still there.Try a soft reset or&nbsp; go to people's app&gt;filter contact list&gt;if outlook is unticked,tick it and save.

            <p>I tried both methods, neither helped. Outlook is ticked, but as I said, my contacts are gone in Outlook too.
</p>
<p>I don't know if it matters, but I manually tiped in the names and phone numbers when I got the phone (and with a fresh SIM card), and manually tiped them in one by one. There were no problems for the first few weeks., then suddenly all contacts disappeared.
</p>
<p>It'sreally, really annoying when somebody calls me and the phone displays his/her name, so the contacts are in the phone somewhere but I cant find them anywhere.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Office Professional Plus 2013 is a Windows-only edition of Office and will not run "natively" on a Mac, so the answer to your question is "no."&nbsp; But there are workarounds:&nbsp; you could run it in a virtual machine (eg, Parallels) running in the Mac OS,&nbsp;a Windows
 emulator (are these even around anymore in the Mac world?), or create a Windows installation on your Mac with Bootcamp and run it within that Windows installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2011 for Mac&nbsp;was the current&nbsp;"traditionally installed"&nbsp;installed edition of Office for Macs up until very recently.&nbsp; MS recently&nbsp;released of Office 2016 for Mac as the successor to Office 2011 for Mac.&nbsp;

<h2>            Clicking links in conversation take very long to open -- how to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I recently got a new computer and with it, Skype for Windows 10. I was used to using Skype for Windows Desktop, but since this computer already had the Windows 10 version, I decided to roll with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Chrome as my browser, and this happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever there´s a link in a conversation (with or without preview), if I click on it, it takes a good time until it actually opens Chrome with it. This might be somewhere between 5 seconds and 10-20 seconds. The application is still responsive during that
 wait, so I can keep moving around conversations, writing, clicking other links, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched around and every answer seems to focus on setting Chrome as the default browser, which I have already done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, <strong>is there any way to get rid of that delay?</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried opening links from other desktop applications and they open immediately.<br />
</p>
<p>Skype version 11.19.856.0</p>

<h3> sg0824  say:</h3>
<h2>            Query running slowly with criteria</h2>
                    
<p>I have a query that runs extremely slowly...about 2-3 minutes even if there are no records to return.&nbsp; I have the following SQL:</p>
<p>SELECT test2.cust_num, test2.company, test2.csz, test2.phone, test2.contact, test2.accred_date, test2.State, test2.[Site ID], test2.[Method Analyte Company ID], test2.[PT Date], test2.Status, test2.[PT ID], test2.[Method id], test2.[Analyte ID]<br />
FROM test2<br />
WHERE (((test2.[PT ID]) In (SELECT TOP 3 [PT ID] FROM [test2] AS D&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE D.[Method Analyte Company id] = [test2].[method analyte company id]&nbsp;&nbsp; ORDER BY D.[PT Date] DESC, D.[PT ID] DESC)))<br />
ORDER BY test2.company, test2.[PT Date];</p>
<p>This query is actually part of several queries that run to produce results for a report, which also runs very slowly.&nbsp; After running each query separately, I determined that the query written above is what actually is slow, and also determined that the criteria
 in the where clause is what is slowing it down - if I take it out, the query runs immediately.&nbsp; I have to have the criteria - its the whole reason for the query and ultimately the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas on another way to get the query to run faster?&nbsp; I have indexes on the criteria field in the table.&nbsp; Other than that, I don't know what else to do.&nbsp; I can get you more information if necessary.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<div>&gt;I have a query that runs extremely slowly...about 2-3 minutes even if there</div>
<div>&gt;are no records to return.&nbsp; I have the following SQL:</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; SELECT test2.cust_num, test2.company, test2.csz, test2.phone, </div>
<div>&gt; test2.contact, test2.accred_date, test2.State, test2.[Site ID], </div>
<div>&gt; test2.[Method Analyte Company ID], test2.[PT Date], test2.Status, </div>
<div>&gt; test2.[PT ID], test2.[Method id], test2.[Analyte ID]</div>
<div>&gt; FROM test2</div>
<div>&gt; WHERE (((test2.[PT ID]) In (SELECT TOP 3 [PT ID] FROM [test2] AS D&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE</div>
<div>&gt; D.[Method Analyte Company id] = [test2].[method analyte company id] </div>
<div>&gt; ORDER BY D.[PT Date] DESC, D.[PT ID] DESC)))</div>
<div>&gt; ORDER BY test2.company, test2.[PT Date];</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; This query is actually part of several queries that run to produce results</div>
<div>&gt; for a report, which also runs very slowly.&nbsp; After running each query</div>
<div>&gt; separately, I determined that the query written above is what actually is</div>
<div>&gt; slow, and also determined that the criteria in the where clause is what is</div>
<div>&gt; slowing it down - if I take it out, the query runs immediately.&nbsp; I have to</div>
<div>&gt; have the criteria - its the whole reason for the query and ultimately the</div>
<div>&gt; report.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; Any ideas on another way to get the query to run faster?&nbsp; I have indexes</div>
<div>&gt; on the criteria field in the table.&nbsp; Other than that, I don't know what</div>
<div>&gt; else to do.&nbsp; I can get you more information if necessary.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do you also have indexes on the fields [PT Date] and [PT ID]?&nbsp; That might</div>
<div>make a difference, since you are sorting on those fields. </div>

<div>&nbsp;It's the classic "Top N by Group" query, and you already have the classic</div>
<div>solution, so I don't have an immediate answer.&nbsp; Google shows a number of</div>
<div>articles on optimizing this sort of query, but a quick scan of them suggests</div>
<div>that the first set at least are directed at SQL Server, and based on SQL </div>
<div>Server features that are not available in Access.&nbsp; Still you might have a</div>
<div>look at them for ideas.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One possibility would be to create a temporary table to hold the desired </div>
<div>output, and loop through a recordset (opened on a sorted query) to populate </div>
<div>it.&nbsp; Usually, recordset processing is much slower than straight-SQL </div>
<div>implementations, but maybe in this case it would be faster.&nbsp; I don't know.</div>
<div>The idea would be to have an input and an output recordset open, and loop </div>
<div>through the input recordset, copying only the first three records for each </div>
<div>[Method Analyte Company id] to the output recordset.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As I said, that may well be slower than what you have now, but you might </div>
<div>give it a try to find out. </div>

<p>Is there any way you can pre-filter the Test2 records?&nbsp;&nbsp; If your other queries are filtering their results are any of the criteria relevant to the Test2 query?&nbsp; If so, you might try creating a query to filters the records as far as possible AND THEN use
 that query as a means to get the top 3 per [Method Analyte Company id].</p>
<p>For instance, if your report is only for companies whose names start with A, you might have something like</p>
<p>SELECT Test2.*<br />
FROM Test2 INNER JOIN CompaniesTable<br />
ON Test2.[Method Analyte Company id] = CompaniesTable.CompanyID<br />
WHERE CompaniesTable.CompanyName Like "A*"</p>
<p>Now using that as the source for your TOP N query should be much faster.</p>

<p>John,</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion.&nbsp; I had tried that before, but did it as additional criteria in the SQL I originally posted.&nbsp; Instead, I took your suggestion and put criteria in the Test2 query.&nbsp; I will only be running the query on one client at a time, and
 it will be from a button on a form, so I added that in.&nbsp; It does run a little more quickly, but still not as quickly as I need to/am used to.&nbsp; I am searching through several records, but not so many that I would expect to see Access return results this slowly.</p>
