<h2>            Word 2016 - browse&#47;jump sections</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was recently upgraded to Microsoft Office 2016 at work, and a lot of the features that I was recently using in Office 2010 are no longer in the places they used to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one I'm currently looking for, and unable to find, is how to jump from section to section in Word 2016. &nbsp;There used to be little arrows down at the bottom right corner of the screen, near the scroll bar. &nbsp;I don't see them anywhere now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that if I put the page and section number on the bottom toolbar, that if I click on the section number, I can get an overlay window to pop up and hit previous/next on there, but is there an easier way to go between sections/pages like I was previously
 using? &nbsp;I jump between sections frequently for a few documents and opening and closing a window every time doesn't seem practical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching on Google and on here, but I couldn't seem to find an answer directly related to what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>The arrow buttons you referred to were removed in Word 2013 and 2016. There is no direct replacement for jumping by section. The Navigation pane lets you choose to jump by Graphics, Tables, Equations, Footnotes/Endnotes, or Comments, but not sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can assign keyboard shortcuts to the commands, which don't have shortcuts by default.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Options dialog and go to the Customize Ribbon page.</li><li>Click the Keyboard Shortcuts Customize button.</li><li>Scroll the Categories list and click on All Commands.</li><li>Scroll the Commands list and click on GoToNextSection.</li><li>Click in the "Press new shortcut key" and press the keys you want to use for a shortcut. Then click the Assign button.</li><li>Repeat the previous two steps for the GoToPreviousSection command.</li><li>Close both dialog boxes.</li></ul>

<h2>            Asha 311 broke down</h2>
                    I bought an Asha 311 about one month back. just a few moments back, i was trying to update the software to the new v5.09 or something, through Ovi Suite. But just as the installing process was starting, the phone restarted by itself (btw, this phone restarts
 alot!), and then, kaputz! switched off again. after that, i can't turn it on anymore. Can anyone tell me what's gone wrong?????.

<p><span>Please note that the delivery data in the message trace will always be on the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), it will not show the date that you specify in the time zone. So it is the expected

<h2>            E52 and phone memory</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>problem is that phone memory is almost full (4 MB only is free) but I don't store basicaly anything into phone memory - as much is possible I have stored in Memory card.</p>
<p>I looked that from used 58 MB is 23 MB used by SIS application and 33 MB used by other files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to deep into memory and delet unused files but don't find folder or file where those SIS applications or other files can be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have anyone else also had problem with memory? How you have resolved it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone give some hint where and how to find those SIS applications and/or other files?</p>

<p>If you have email configured on this phone and 'your messaging memory is set to phone memory'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Delete your email setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Change messaging memory to memorycard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Then you can configure your email again on MC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will free up some of the other files memory used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case of SIS apps please recheck what apps you have installed on the phone memory.</p>
<p>Controll Panel&gt;App Manager&gt;Installed apps</p>
<p>Look for ones without the MC card icon next to them. Those are the ones onphone memory.</p>

<p>Now I deleted all messages and e-mail accounts and changed messaging to memory card. Result - used memory 56 MB, free memory 5 MB</p>
<p>SIS applications 23 MB</p>
<p>Other files 33 MB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So not so big change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS! I use for internet browsing Opera and it is installed into memory card.</p>

<p>Something is better than nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I mentioned in the above post please also do give a list of apps you have installed on your phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also clear your built in web browser cache. I know that you use opera but no harm is trying.</p>
<p>Browser&gt;Options&gt;Clear Privacy data&gt; All.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And did you restart your phone after deleting the mailboxes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am gonna figure this out for you:) &nbsp;Had the same issue and hate to hard reset.</p>

<p>Clearing browsing history freed 5 MB, so seams that I have used browser and history was in phone.</p>
<p>Still 10 MB free, 51 MB used - 23 MB with SIS applications and 28 with other files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About apps - I have Traveler but can't delete it (don't know why) and ovi sync.</p>
<p>No more additionally installed apps to phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes I restarted phone after deleting mailboxes :)</p>

            I don't completely understand your POP3 comment, but have a bad feeling about this problem... :(<br />
<br />
So 1) you are certain that no stray email or SMS messages are left on the phone, from the last time you changed the Messaging setting "Memory in use" from phone to memory card, and 2) you are sure Application Manager -&gt; Installed Apps doesn't show any unexpected
 apps installed to the phone, and 3) you are reasonably sure no stray files (photos, videos, downloads) are installed to C:\Data or elsewhere on the phone?

<p>No more apps!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great then this has to be it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Did you update ovi maps?? the stock version is 3.03. If you are on 3.04 it has taken around 10mbs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) The traveller update also uses a SUBSTANTIAL amount of space. I dnt know how much for sure but if you tell me what version your traveller is on we will know if you have updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding plugins to traveller also takes up some phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi maps&gt;Support&gt;About&gt; very first line is version.. something like v3.03 10wk b01 blah blah..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traveller&gt;About&gt;version will be right there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Confirm this and n we'll see wat more can be done. I'm pretty sure i'm missing one more thing.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>finally I had yesterday time to deal with my phone again.</p>
<p>Under Control Panel - Application manager - Installed applications I deleted some applications (like ovi contacts, Nokia maps) and voila over 30 MB memory was free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But one intresting thing - under software update phone offers me to install update for ovi maps. After installing it, this file will get name Nokia maps and will be stored in phone memory. Same time Ovi maps as application is installed into memory card (looked
 it from application manager). Unfortunatelly there isn't possibility to change installation place also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still have problems with Traveller (version 1.6(1)) - I want to uninstall it but under Applications I can to it - phone said Removing failed - and from Application manager I don't see this program at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as I mentioned, main issue is solved for now.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your help.</p>

<p>I am sad to say that for some unknown reason I just cannot find that email with the product code. I have looked on both my home computers and my work computer. I have looked everywhere&nbsp;I can think of for a printout of the&nbsp;product code. &nbsp;Normally I am careful
 of such things, but at least a dozen searches with all sorts of criteria just don't come up with anything.

<p>I feel kinda dumb, but that is what happened.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>A quick question before we proceed.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>What is the type of account? Is it a POP, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync or Exchange account?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s perform Send and Receive and check if you get any error message.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Outlook, Click on Send/ Receive tab on the navigation pane.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on Send/Receive All folders.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Wait till the time it get synchronized, check if the issue persist.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Meanwhile, let’s start Outlook in safe mode following steps mentioned below, then try working in Outlook
</span><span>and verify the result</span></span></span><span><span>.<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press <strong>
Enter</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Outlook /safe </strong><br />
<br />
Note: There is a space between Outlook and ‘/’.<br />
<br />
If Outlook works as expected in safe mode, disable the add-ins by following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in.<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Enable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hope it helps. Try the suggestions and let us know the result at your earliest convenience.</span></span></p>

            <p>I did the send/receive all folders but nothing came thru to my Inboxes. However, I notice at the bottom it's saying that it's synchronizing thru folders.....first it processed the "All Mail" and then a "Spam" folder and then a "Junk E-mail" folder and then
 it started another "All Mail" and so on......so I believe it synchronized everything but my Inboxes?? &nbsp;(Each one of my gmail Email accounts have an Inbox, sent E-mail, trash &amp; a gmail tab on the left side and when I expand the gmail tab - it shows me an "All
 Mail", Important mail, unwanted mail, spam mail, trash, drafts, starred folders....so it gets extremely confusing now.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I go thru with the disabling the add-ins now?</p>

    <title>reset after phone update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carson.john  say:</h3>
<h2>            reset after phone update</h2>
                    
<p>I've a 925 running O2 UK firmware and preview for developers. In the few months I've owned it its went from WP8 to 8.1 to 8.1 update 1 and just recently Cyan. There have also been multiple mini updates inbetween those and lots of apps installed/uninstalled
 (As you do)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've read that it's good practice to hard reset the phone after an OS upgrade. As my phone can be a little juddery at times (scrolling&nbsp; up and down twitter/facebook, even going from an app back to start screen) this is why I'm considering it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll make sure everything (Including photos/videos to my PC) is backed up first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions.</p>
<p>1/ I'm assuming that after a reset I'll maintain Cyan and 8.1, but possibly lose 8.1.1 which contains Cortana and folders. I'd want folders so would have to run PFD again to get them which may defeat the purpose of the reset in the first place?</p>
<p>2/ As a 925 has no memory card will photos/videos be deleted from phone?</p>
<p>3/ Is resetting the phone likely to be worthwhile in terms of improved OS performance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Just one thing, you quoted this question but didn't actually answer it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Is resetting the phone likely to be worthwhile in terms of improved OS performance?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I'd add especially since after the reset I'd be updating to 8.1.1 with PFD.</p>

<p>Thanks Abi99, I didn't see the link you provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just read it but tbh it refers to running the Nokia Software Recovery tool which unless its absolutely necessary is something I'd rather avoid doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I used the term 'hard reset' incorrectly in my original post, I meant using the reset option in settings&nbsp; &gt;about &gt; reset your phone. Would using this reset option have any beneficial effects?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have any major issues (Like in the linked thread) Just that my 925 judders a little more than I thought it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi there, tullyhubbert.<br />
<br />
To verify, your phone has the official Lumia Cyan software right now, is that correct? Using the Nokia Software Recovery Tool can help you reset and recover the software of your phone in any case that you're having software related or software udpate problems.
<br />
<br />
If you have the official Lumia Cyan software, make sure that your system apps are also up-to-date. To do that, go to the Store &gt; ... &gt; downloads.
<br />
<br />
We'll wait for your response.</p>

    <title>Email Account Recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rhyscarswell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email Account Recovery</h2>
                    <p>Good Day Everyone</p>
<p>I am having a problem trying to recover a email account. I used to use two accounts , one for personal emails an the other for professional emails.</p>
<p>I was able to access both from my phone so I never needed to put in my password but when I tried to recover a old account on the Pokemon Go app I needed to use my personal email only to find it was asking me for a password which I could no longer remember.</p>
<p>Its a pain because it was connected to my Facebook, Steam, Pokemon Go and many others so I have not only lost access to £100's of games on steam but also hundreds of hours lost on pokemon go.&nbsp; This is because even through I know my steam password I have
 just got a new PC and it recognizes it as a new device and has sent a code to my email to verify that its still me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to recover the account but the phone number attached to the account is about 6 years old so of course I no longer use it.&nbsp; Then I tried the security questions. I answered as many as I could Skype account, Xbox 360 account, Xbox 360 Number, recently
 sent emails (I dont remember sending much from it only receiving). Alas no matter what I do I receive a email to my professional account saying Microsoft were unable to verify the account ownership.</p>
<p>I have tried this multiple times. Is there a help line I can call to get some help?</p>

<p>Hello RhysCarswell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to recover your account is filling-up the <strong>
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account Recovery form</a></strong>. This form will help you retrieve your account by providing additional information so that Microsoft can be sure that only you can gain access to your account. It’s not going to be walk
 in the park, but we encourage you to remember every accurate information as much as you can and if you fail, you can keep trying twice per day.&nbsp;If you need more information about recovering your Microsoft account click on this&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/email-account-recovery/5ef68cc0-a1dc-4c06-9172-e8e6aa1798c6">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it’s still a no go, you can contact our <strong><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/outlook.com/billing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Support Team</a></strong> so that you can be assisted real time. Please take note
 that Customer Advocates can’t make changes on your account details or send password reset links. In the end, if you really can’t recover your account, we strongly suggest creating a new one and this time keeping a backup of your personal information such as
 passwords or old email addresses can be a good idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have other concerns.</p>

    <title>WP Phone Book VS Peoples Hub&#63; What in the world is Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russellstamey  say:</h3>
<h2>            WP Phone Book VS Peoples Hub&#63; What in the world is Microsoft thinking&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    WP has ruined my contacts list. I cannot wrap my mind around why they want to merge social networking with my personal phone book.<br />
<br />
I get it, some people don't mind having 500 contacts from Facebook and craigslist (can only assume it was brought in from gmail) in their phone book.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But why can I not have the option to just have my phonebook separated from the peoples hub (social networking) &nbsp;????<br />
<br />
When hit the phone app and press the little phone book icon, I dont want to see people from Facebook and Google. The only way to get rid of this is to completely stop communication between Facebook and google, but that breaks the peoples hub experience.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there not a way to completely disconnect the phone book from the peoples hub??

</p><p>When in the People Hub and you only want phone contacts, you can simply change the setting by looking at the top of the list, tap next to "Showing" and then select those contacts you want to see and/or select "Hide contacts without phone numbers." Either
 way should give you the desired results you seek.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As designed, the People Hub is your place to find "all your people," whether you have phone contacts or social networking contacts or both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, your personal phonebook is not merged physically, you only see a "complete" list of contacts when you select to see everything at the same time. You still have total control as to what you see or don't see.<br />
</p>
<p>Your personal phonebook is nothing more than a contact list from your primary email addresses. The notion of a separate phonebook no longer exists in the modern world of smartphones (still exists for "feature" phones). For better or for worse, pretty much
 everyone does it this way nowadays. At least Microsoft gives you more control over it and doesn't totally force you into something you don't want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!<br />
David</p>

            <p>I dont understand, b/c on my galaxy S4, my phonebook was just that, a phonebook.... It was not dependent on any outside source. I had the option to include facebook and gmail, but I chose to not do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on this phone, I have unchecked Facebook and Gmail form the filter list under the Peoples Hub settings. The people no longer show up in the Hub, but they still show up in my phonebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have found to get rid of the unwanted contacts in my phonebook is to go into Facebook and turn the sync settings off, but this breaks the UI experience inside the Peoples Hub.... This makes no sense</p>

            <p>Windows phone does not have a phonebook natively. This may have been added by your carrier.</p>
<p>You have the contacts you have setup in the People Hub.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If I remember correctly AT&amp;T added an address book app, don't know what you are seeing as a phonebook.</p>

            <p>This is a Benjamin Button experience for those who were Synthetic Human and are now "defenestrated"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes phone contacts could solely exist on my Gal and fortunately for me the factory reset happened after my move to Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>GMAIL not Outlook is my Email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to have a contact list I had to back up my phone contacts to Gmail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially my Outlook contacts are an exact copy of my Gmail and I now update both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is I need NOT have created an Outlook Contacts, &nbsp;ALL &nbsp;I needed to do is sync Gmail contacts to Lumia</p>
<p>
</p><p>David Scammell has addressed filtering &nbsp;contacts, you need a contact list on the phone if you access Facebook, you don't need BOTH Google and Outlook phone contacts, the opposite is in having moved from Gmail to Outlook say.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Contacts remain in your phone book because of the sync, being in your phone book allows you to update them on your phone. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you have turned off the sync you now have to "enter" Facebook make the changes &nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't at first appear to 'make sense' as so used to Google, &nbsp;only when you realise that the database you update is primarily held in Outlook or Gmail and not on the phone itself until after..</p>

                    I mean real spam like gibberish stuff and stuff for drugs and stuff and what not. They go directly into the junk folder though.

            <p>I am getting on average about 90 of the most disgusting, filthy emails on a daily basis, not to mention the&nbsp;Viagra, ****&nbsp;and other Pharm. stuff, along with these "Your account has been breached" stuff that could scare some people into clicking on these
 scams if they don't know any better.&nbsp; Thankfully, I do.&nbsp; &nbsp; I suppose I should be grateful that these are showing up in my Junk folder and not my inbox, and I am, BUT I don't want to see them in my junk folder either.&nbsp; They are disgusting!&nbsp; I was recently upgraded
 (and I use that term loosely) from Outlook.com to the "new" Outlook Mail and that is when I started getting these massive amounts of these filthy emails in my junk folder.&nbsp; I didn't have this problem when I had Outlook.com, only when I was upgraded to Outlook
 Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reported these as junk,&nbsp;phishing scams, I've blocked them and that does absolutely no good whatsoever.&nbsp; I have my Junk folder set to exclusive and it doesn't matter. I've written rules but these spammers keep changing the words in the body or subject
 lines, filling the subject lines with a&nbsp;massive&nbsp;listing of numbers, changing their email addresses daily, etc. it is absolutely impossible to keep up...there aren't enough hours in a day when you receive 100's of these a day.&nbsp; Who has time to combat that on
 a daily basis?&nbsp; Prior to writing this response I had cleared out 281 of these spam emails, and I just checked and I already have 7 more in my junk filter!!!&nbsp; It is ridiculous!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even this week, I started noticing that these filthy emails now have a new message marked in yellow stating "This message&nbsp;was identified&nbsp;as spam. It is not spam. I Show blocked content."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WOW! Please tell me Microsoft isn't telling me this crap is acceptable???&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to start doing something about these disgusting, filthy spammers inundating people's email accounts with this filth or I may be driven to close my account and look for other email alternatives.&nbsp; I am so fed up with this mess!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to have to close an account I've had for over 2 decades, but that is looking like the only option I have.&nbsp; Does anyone have a solution?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I didn't have this problem when I had Outlook.com on the web, only started seeing this&nbsp;mess after I was upgraded to Outlook Mail a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am currently using the Anniversary Update for&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;and since my Microsoft account is the same as my
 Outlook Mail email address (that I've had for over 20 yrs)&nbsp;I see&nbsp;these same&nbsp;filthy emails in my Junk&nbsp;folder in the Windows 10 Mail and Calendar core app also. There is no way to even block or identify these emails as spam, junk or phishing emails&nbsp;in the Windows
 10 Mail and Calendar app either, which only adds to my frustration.&nbsp; It is bad enough to see them in one place, no more less two!&nbsp; If I delete them in Outlook Mail it will delete them in the&nbsp;W10 Mail and Calendar app though.&nbsp; That has been my one saving grace
 because believe me it is time consuming enough to have to deal with this mess in one place, but&nbsp;if I had to do it twice I would just delete both email accounts!&nbsp; I wanted to add Outlook Mail to my Android device, but I will not now as I don't want to have
 to deal with this mess on another device!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have tried to block them and it doesn't work!&nbsp;&nbsp; I see that most of these filthy spam emails come from a common address<strong> after
</strong>the @ symbol starting off with 185.0xcd.0, or some form of 185.0...with combos of letters or numbers that change with each one of the filthy spam emails.&nbsp; Blocking these emails does absolutely no good because the stuff like @185.0xcd.0 or any combination
 doesn't show up in the blocked list, only that long string of numbers and letters
<strong>before</strong> the @ symbol show up as blocked so it does no good. I've even tried to add the stuff that comes after the "@" symbol&nbsp;on my blocked list but it will not accept them.&nbsp; Even if the blocked list did accept them it is a futile exercise because
 after they send you one of these filthy junk emails, they will send out the same email but will change the lettering and numbering information after the "@" symbol&nbsp;on the next one...so there is no way to keep up with it!&nbsp; So frustrated!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another 17 of those filthy messages in my Junk folder about 15 mins. after I cleared out 281 out last night. Today, there are another 44 sitting in my junk folder!&nbsp; I am so sick of this mess! I am at my wits end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have to check my Junk folder often for "regular" emails that get put there for folks I receive emails from that I haven't yet added to my contacts or safe senders list, I have to go through all these filthy emails in my Junk folder and don't want
 to see that mess even in my Junk folder. It is disgusting. Rules don't work on the Junk folder any longer, having your Junk folder set to exclusive&nbsp;(as my is set to exclusive and always has been)&nbsp;does no good, and blocking is absolutely not working on this
 filthy mess&nbsp;either.&nbsp;I have identified hundreds of these filthy emails as junk, phishing and spam and that also seems to have no effect at all.&nbsp; I don't understand how so many have leveled complaints on these types of emails and they still continue to proliferate
 customers email accounts.&nbsp; It is ridiculous!!!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If a solution to this mess isn't reached asap I will be forced to close my Microsoft account, as I am not going to tolerate being exposed to this filthy junk email nonsense any longer.&nbsp; It is too frustrating, time consuming,&nbsp;and risky if some of this filth
 contains malware or ransomeware as I suspect some of them could.&nbsp; Frankly, this is something that shouldn't even be an issue if Microsoft would do its job in the first place with handling these spammers rather than putting the onus on the consumer user to
 handle it.</p>

            <p>I've recently been experiencing the same issue and it is driving me mad. The only difference for me is that I haven't made any changes to my Hotmail account......</p>
<p>
</p><p>These emails are disgusting and degrading and as you have stated you cannot block the address...the numbers just keep on growing. What happens if they were hitting a child's email address - its sickening!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even tried to "unsubscribe" and that failed...I do not see why I should be subjected to emails of this nature and I definitely have no interest in hook-ups, foreign brides or anything related - it might also be helpful if they recognised that these
 emails are coming to a woman!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want a solution to block/prevent/stop these emails, likewise without having to change my email address which I have had for over 15 years....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be interested in any options on this asap please!!!!</p>

I am so over these filthy, disgusting emails showing up in my junk folder.  I just provided my description earlier to the feedback app in Windows 10 and am letting them monitor the situation in hopes that they will see this situation and come up with a solution.  Maybe if they see where these emails are coming from and how they operate they can do something.  That is how desperate I have become.  Not getting my hope up though, sadly. 



You are so right in that if this filth was coming to a child's email account it is even more disgusting as I would think it would be in violation of Child **** laws!  I had reported what I received yesterday as phishing and deleted them and I now have 45 new ones. This is just ridiculous!

<p>
</p><p>The
 reason that it doesn't work to block them, is that they always change something in it, you'll never get two of them the same. &nbsp;This one is fresh in my inbox right now. &nbsp;One thing that all of these domains have in common is that there is always more than one
 dot in the domain name. &nbsp;If we could create a rule blocking all domains with more than one dot, that would stop them. &nbsp;Can we do that?</p>

<h2>            Reporting on Office Licence Usage</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there, apologies if this has been answered elsewhere but I cannot find it. as the Company Office 365 admin I wish to see how many licences of of Office all my users have installed. We have Small Business Premium and each user
 is entitled to 5 copies of Office. I know you can check it individually if you log in as that user. But I wish to do it globally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any help would be gratefully appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi jayralston1926,</p>
<p>if you want to check how many devices your users have office apps installed on, you can view each user individually via the steps below:</p>
<p>login to office 365 portal &gt; admin &gt; users &gt; active users &gt; check the box for the name of the user &gt; click edit under office installations section.<br />

Also it would still mean I have

<p>Hi Jayralston1926,<br />
<br />
There is no PowerShell Command to achieve this. Here is <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/odsupport/archive/2015/06/22/office-365-proplus-user-activations-management.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a blog</a> for your reference.<br />
<br />
Moreover, given to the screenshot, did you purchase your tenant from Microsoft or a 3rd party provider? If it's from a 3rd party provider, you may contact them to check if you can get the installation status from your Office 365 admin center.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

            <p>I have not heard of this problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using a dual monitor system for years now, in Win Vista, Win 7 and Win 8 using Office 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 (but not 2016 yet).&nbsp; I have not encountered the problem before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually sounds like a video driver issue between Windows and Office 2016.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious thing to do with driver issues is check to see if you have the most current video driver from the video card maker (if you have a separate video card).&nbsp; The DirectX diagnostic tool is the best way to get your current information:</p>
<div>
<strong>DirectX Diagnostic Tool - Display Basic Hardware, Win, Audio Driver and Video driver information - export Report - Win 7 / 8 / 10</strong>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there anything about the image of the second arrow that is unusual?&nbsp; Is it the same arrow, just larger, or is it a different arrow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of other questions with loosely similar problems that my gut suggests are all related.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people with Office 2016 (and if I remember correctly Windows 10) are having mouse problems in the Styles Pane. The pointer is not clicking on the correct/ desired style.&nbsp; (no fix for it yet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another group of people have had issues with office apps not "scaling" properly when moving from one screen to another. (there is a fix for this one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a diagnostic test, have you tried changing the screen resolution on the problem monitor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing you can test is rotating the portrait monitor to landscape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do either of these tests help with the problem? The idea of these tests is simply to test the span of the problem.

<h2>            Help with speaker automatically turned on when recieve call</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
I am currently using HTC Touch Diamond with Windows Mobile 6 on it.<br />
It was fine before but for a few days now, every time I received the phone call the speaker turned on automatically.<br />
I haven't installed any new application or update anything since when it's still not having this problem<br />
I have check for installed program if there is any of them causing this problem but so far I have no luck.<br />
Is there any setting I am missing, or I should check?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much

<p>Thank you for the inquiry. We know how important it is to create a poll with multiple questions. I agree that we can have multiple answer poll for one question. However, by the design, poll questions created at Yammer is set to only one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dwightli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome and thank you for posting your question in our forum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, if you buy your first app in Microsoft Store on July 25, then your account billing date is the 25th of this month. Moreover, if you sign up for a monthly subscription on September 1, then it will recur on Octure 2 and will be charged to your payment
 option on your account billing date, October. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For details, please see: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/10640/microsoft-account-recurring-billing-dates-for-your-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recurring billing dates for your Microsoft subscription</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope above information helps. If you are not in this scenario, please let me know and provide us specific information about your concerns so we can assist you more efficiently.</p>

            In the Home ribbon and in the Font block you should see the Fill and Font color icons with drop down arrows attached. The Font color icon has a letter "A" on it and the fill (background) icon has what looks like a paint pot.

            Not quite. I neglected to say that I am using VB code to change the color.<br />
<br />
In a working program, I can use:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Interior.ColorIndex = 45&nbsp; <br />
to change the location clicked to a burnt orange.<br />
and,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Interior.Pattern = xlLightDown&nbsp; <br />
to give me a cross hatch pattern for the cell clicked.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I had this same problem trying to get that spread sheet working until someone told me to click somewhere and change a setting.&nbsp; I now need that setting changed for this new spread sheet.<br />

<h2>            Data Validation List - font</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guy's,</p>
<p>I have a worksheet where the contents of certain cells is restricted by using data validation.</p>
<p>The validation is taken from a list. A* A** B* B** etc.</p>
<p>However, using normal * makes it appears too small, so I've been using á and changing the font to Wingdings 2. This makes it much more readable.</p>
<p>The problem is that while this looks fine in the list on the worksheet, the dropdown values in the data validation along with the cell value when an item is selected display á</p>
<p>Is there anyway to retain the font difference?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi, don't look at the vba, if you go to Data Validation Font Size, it start talking about a workaround using combo box and there is&nbsp; a link saying instructions here (third paragraph form the beginnig), it takes you to how to set up the combo box , at the
 end you can change the font

<h3> hawk318  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does one suggest improvements to the Word &#40;have a major suggestion for novel authors&#41;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm an 'indie' writer and do all my books woth Word (Office 2010)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I set all my options. But the bad things about Word is that it does not "remember" my book prefs from the last time I worked on it.</p>
<p>By remembering I mean...</p>
<p>Using the "F7" hot key WOrd checks grammer, spelling, punctuation, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Writers use varied punctuation, poor grammer, etc for various characters... So during the "F7" check.. I select the "skip", "ignore' (whatever) the first time through.</p>
<p>By not remembering the doc, Word will repeat this every time you open the doc and hit the F7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally I do not want to have to go over all my choices each time I work on my book and have to use the F7 command for one purpose...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;MS, How about adding an option to the 'floating F7 window" to "Correct and stop" So F7 will make the one correction and close before going to the next correction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it is now if I make the one correction, F7 might jump anywhere from 1 page to 100 pages to the next correction,&nbsp;which means a lot of wasted time going back to where I left off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Word needs to work on it's corrections of the English language. (ok I know Word isn't perfect) I wrote the sentence:</p>
<p>"Hello... are you all right miss?"</p>
<p>Word tried to correct it to: "Hello... is you all right miss." Lol, I half expect Word to try and change the reply to; "Why yes, I is alright, thank you." ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow I've tried to find some place to suggest improvements and after nearly a half hour of srufing/ searching... I've found no "suggest improvements" yet. :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            You can make suggestions, but don't hold your breah. MS is so big, and gets so many suggestions you rarely see any action. It takes a LOT of people asking for a fix to get it on the schedule<br />
<br />
<div>
<b><span>Your satisfaction Matters! Let us know your thoughts about your Microsoft experience.</span></b>
<p><span><a href="https://secure.opinionlab.com/ccc01/o.asp?id=yDnqREvN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.opinionlab.com/ccc01/o.asp?id=yDnqREvN</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>MS has a very large audience, so if you want your suggestion to be acted upon you need many people to make the same suggestion. So ask your friends, fiends &lt;grin&gt;, enemies, relatives, co-workers, strangers
 on the street also submit your suggestion to all of the following locations.</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>Here is proof<span>&nbsp; </span>that once in a blue moon MS does actually listen to user input about some of it’s “stupid” design decisions:
</span><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/05/09/visual_studio_11_grey_no_more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/05/09/visual_studio_11_grey_no_more/</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>So “.. yes Virginia …”, it is worth complaining about the stupid ribbon, or other pet peeve, they sometimes pay attention.</span></p>
<p>
<span>But then again, when I looked at the “before” and “after” I don’t see much improvement!<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m afraid this is a fore-runner for a “metrofied” Office 15.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Well, we’ll see. </span></p>
<p>
<span>Another example of MS sometimes listening is found in Outlook. In 2010 MS removed the “Unread” messages view from Outlook.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In 2013 the “Unread” view is returned.</span></p>
