    <title>WIn-10 can get internet. Win-7 cannot. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe oppelt  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIn-10 can get internet.  Win-7 cannot.</h2>
                    <p>I have an **** modem/router, and comcast service.&nbsp; All wireless devices can get to the internet.&nbsp; But my two desktops (which don't have wireless) cannot LAN to the internet through the router.&nbsp; I can take the same wire from the desktop and hook it to my
 laptop, (and turn off wireless on the laptop), and that connects just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called **** support.&nbsp; The router is fine.&nbsp; All settings on the router are correct.&nbsp; The one identifiable difference between the desktop and the laptop is that the laptop is Win-10, and the desktop is Win-7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the poking around that I did with **** Support, we can see from IPCONFIG that the desktop's IPv4 Address is 169.254.101.254, which, apparently is not a good IP.&nbsp; IPV properties show that it should be obtaining an IP address automatically, and obtain
 DNS server address automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**** support suggested that I contact Window Support to see why I'm getting 169.xxx IP address.<br />
<br />
For the record, this was all working fine 4 days ago.&nbsp; I'm hoping to get some guidance for things to look at.</p>

            <p>Hi bud!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you already tried to set static IP address on all of the computers with Win7 in which you are having this issue? Make sure to check what is the IP that your laptop with Windows 10 is getting in order to use the same nomenclature for the
 numbers, for example if the IP that you got in your laptop starts with 192.168.XX.XX then try to use the same but changing the last digits, and remember, if any of your computers with Win7 isn't getting the same kind of IP address than your Win10 computer,
 then the router is not assigning the right IP address for those computers.</p>

            <p>Mauricioz -- <br />
<br />
As noted in my reply to Fredrick, My IP address is: &nbsp; 169.254.101.254<br />
</p>
<p>Any other device (that works) has an IL like 192.168....&nbsp; the laptop I'm using right now (win-10) has 192.168.0.7, for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arris Support poked around in all these with me.&nbsp; They said that Windows, not the router, is supplying this IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I set a static IP, I assume I would do it under the properties for IPv4 under my Local Area Connection properties.&nbsp; BTW, on the first screen for this, it shows a list of connections under the heading:&nbsp; "This connection uses the following items:"&nbsp; Seven
 items, and all are checked.&nbsp; Should they all be checked?&nbsp; (Client for MSFT Networks; QoS Packet; File and Printer sharing...; IPv6; IPv4; LinkLayer ... Mpper; Link-Layer... Responder)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But yes, if I click on IPv4 and click Properties, right now it's set to automatic for IP and DNS.&nbsp; I assume this is where I would enter a static IP, correct?</p>

You mentioned that your <strong>laptop</strong> connects fine. What you report above does not agree with this statement. Please try again.

            <p>OK, much better. With cases like yours you mostly deal with one of these problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defective hardware (e.g. network adapter, CAT5 cable, switch port)</li><li>Inability to obtain an IP address from the DHCP server</li></ul>
<p>To home in on the problem you select fixed IP addresses for your two desktops, then try to ping your router on 192.168.0.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IPv4 Address: 192.168.0.107 (for desktop PC 1)</p>
<p>IPv4 Address: 192.168.0.108 (for desktop PC 2)</p>

<p>IPv4 DNS Server 2: 192.168.0.1</p>
<p>

            <p>When you say, "Ping the router", what does that mean?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I still can't get to the internet, even after reboot.&nbsp; (Settings remained in place after reboot.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned the cable.&nbsp; That's OK.&nbsp; I can take the cable out of the desktop and plug it into the laptop and get a connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network adapter?&nbsp; I can buy that being the case for desktop #2.&nbsp; It's an old one, and there is an after-market adapter in there.&nbsp; But desktop #1 is about 6 weeks old.&nbsp; Hard to imagine that one being bad already.&nbsp; (But, you never know...)&nbsp; Short of swapping
 it out, what testing could I do?&nbsp; I guess maybe I could get a USB-connected port and test it that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switch port...&nbsp; No switch port.&nbsp; Well, there are 4 ports in the router, but, like the wire, I can get to the laptop using the same port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, since this desktop is new, it's under warranty.&nbsp; But it would involve shipping it back to the vendor.&nbsp; Pain in the ****.&nbsp; I want to make sure that's the right thing before going through all that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I also have a printer hooked to the router through a port.&nbsp; Wireless devices can print on it.&nbsp; That's working OK.&nbsp; (The desktops cannot print to it.)</p>

<br />
1.&nbsp; Do you have an analog phone system ("plain old telephone service" or POTS)?&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold">
Answer should be Yes.</span><br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Are you using the thephone cord that was supplied with the printer?&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold">
Answer should be Yes.</span><br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; If you connect a standard telephone to the wall jack instead of the printer, do you hear a dial tone when you pick up the phone?&nbsp;
<br />
4.&nbsp; Is there anything else connected between the printer and the wall jack (e.g., are you using a DSL filter or a splitter)?
<br />
5.&nbsp; Is there anything (other than a blank plug that may have been supplied with the printer) in 2-EXT?
<br />
If your answers are not as indicated in bold, call HP support.&nbsp; Also note that if you are in certain non-U.S. countries, your telephone system may not support anything connected to the 2-EXT connector.<br />
<br />
With respect to Q. 1, the alternatives to an analog phone system are VoIP telephone service (e.g., through your cable company or other ISP) or a digital phone system (commonly found in businesses, e.g., a PBX).&nbsp; If you have a digital system, you can't use the
 fax.&nbsp; If you have VoIP you may (or may not) be able to use the fax, depending on your ISP.<br />
<br />

    <title>I have an issue with the product key not being valid on Windows 8. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I have an issue with the product key not being valid on Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>Original title : What do I do about my product key not being valid after install and update to Pro 8?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed Pro 8 on a desktop after reading that you can "only install on your personal computers" while installing on my laptop. So even though I have purchased 2 keys already (one for my son), they are now requesting a third key. I could have came up
 with $40 at the time, but now it is at $199 to get this third key. <br />
<br />
Should I roll back or is this something that has happened by mistake. I swear they had something about adding to another computer "if yours" was ok and now I am denied after all the time setting up AND the price went up to $199! Let me calm down and see what
 others have to say before looking at options like Ubuntu. <br />
<br />
It is normal to charge for a product and 8 is a good one, but these tactics are unfair to the consumer and 8's reputation at a time when competition is heating up.<br />

            <p>If you purchased two separate (unique) keys, they both should be valid to upgrade two computers running qualifying versions of Windows (XP, Vista or Windows 7). Remember, you can't install the upgrade on a blank hard disk, a qualifying version must be installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have problems activating, try using phone activation:</p>
<p>1. Press <b>Windows key + X</b> then click<b>Run</b>, then type: <b>slui.exe 4</b></p>
<p>2. Next press the 'ENTER' key</p>
<p>3. Select your 'Country' from the list.</p>
<p>4. Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.</p>
<p>5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</p>
<p>6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person.</p>

            No, 2 keys and 3 computers. <b>My sons computer (1)</b> has valid key and <b>
my laptop (2)</b> has a valid key. When I used a download of Windows 8 from Microsoft as upgrade to my
<b>Windows 7 Desktop</b> (3) it allowed me to use the key from <b>my laptop (2).</b><br />
<br />
Obviously it is one key per computer now that I am told this. But this was not made apparent at the time, allowing the key, updates and migration from my established Windows 7 environment without any warning that this is an issue. It was not until the $40 deal
 was over and a price tag of $199 came into play that I was informed my account is no good.<br />
<br />
Hope that is clear. That they accepted my key, then removed its validity. And note, it has been normal for years that software is for up to three computers. Is there somewhere I can request a ticket or help on this matter? Maybe an offer to resolve this issue.<br />

            <p>Sorry old chap, this does not work at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a start, when I type "troubleshooting" into the search bar bottom left, I do not get the "view all" option that you mentioned, so cannot go further down that path. If I go into control panel, I get various offers of checking my video or sound adaptors,
 but as usual with Windows, users are unable to find their way around.</p>

<p>Hi Mohan,</p>
<p>Well, after running the Compatibility Troubleshooting Program that comes with Lotus Symphony numerous times and getting nowhere, I decided to raise the white flag of surrender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased MS Office Home and Student version for $114 and downloaded it, installed it, and it was up and running in 15 minutes max.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Farewell Lotus Symphony, you dug your own grave !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Mohan for your quick and sincere reply ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely .... RGF</p>

<h2>            No Windows 10 low battery warning</h2>
                    <p>Just open your</p>
<p>"<strong>control panel"</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then "<strong>power option</strong>" then&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<strong>change advance power settings</strong>"</p>
<p>there select &nbsp;the profile you want to active( power saver ,high performance etc.)</p>
<p>Then scroll down to "<strong>battery</strong>" expand it and find "<strong>low battery notification</strong>" and turn &nbsp;"<strong>on"</strong>&nbsp;for both "<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;<strong>battery</strong>" and&nbsp;<strong>"plugged in</strong>" &nbsp;and you will done.</p>
<p>Note :- not necessary to turn it on for "<strong>plugged in</strong>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I just copied and pasted the above from another forum - if that doesn't fix your problem, continue reading below - this solution was also was from another writer, but I started a new discussion because I got tired of reading things that didn't work over
 and over again and this worked for me and I was so happy about it I wanted to share it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above does not work, because it is already "on", try going to the "critical battery action" (top of the list in the same menu) &nbsp;and change the battery option from "hibernate" to "shut down" - this worked for me - then you can change it back to hibernate
 and it will stay working - it did for me anyway.</p>

    <title>Start Menu and Cortana fails after Edge use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orcol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Menu and Cortana fails after Edge use</h2>
                    <p>I have found that Start Menu, Cortana and Task Bar stop working after I use Edge Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tryed to reboot my computer but I only got a message about "Critical error: Start menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you sing in". I decided to execute: sfc /scannow and reboot: It didn't works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have to restore the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's happening? I found the same problem with another driver: printer driver of Nero Reader 3, after a few pdf conversions, the start menu, cortana and task bar stop working. So I had to use the default windows to pdf option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Start Menu, Cortana and Task Bar are a disaster, they fail and corrupt very easy, and a simple reboot doesn't work to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it means I can't use Microsoft Edge? Just Unbelievable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I decide to disable Microsoft Defender Because I already have Norton 360.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description start menu and cortana stop working after the use of Microsoft Edge on your newly upgraded Windows 10 computer. The issue could be if&nbsp;some system files or some settings get&nbsp;corrupted. &nbsp;So, try to follow the steps provided below
 and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Try to run the below mentioned command.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open the Task manager.&nbsp; Here’s a tip:&nbsp; Press CTRL+Shift+ESC.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If issue persists, try to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong><span>System File Checker (SFC)</span></strong> tool.</span></p>

<p>Well, I started to have also problems with Skype Application, always afer login to my account the applications showed me an error: You are already signed in this computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I fixed it disabling the Fast Startup. I'm not sure, but after that I used another win10 App (I think a movie player), then when I closed the App I got again the Critical Error: Start Menu and Cortana, but his time I just reebooted my computer and
 now the computer restarted without the critical error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point: is possible that de Fast Startup is not helping the OS to clear the critical error and also is introducing errors in other applications like Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have the cortana ans start menu error again (because I decided to don't use Edge app, and the new movie player app) because I decided to use all my old Windows 7 Applications for movies, pictures and internet navigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I bealive WIN 10 is nice but is a troublemaker OS for old computers like mine (I upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 because it's free =P).&nbsp;<br />

            <p>This isn't helpful at all. None of the methods helped me, I had to use my old win7 application to navigate, to view pictures, to see movies to don't generate the critical error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I decide also to disable the Fast Startup, because is the only way the critical error was cleared after a reboot without repair the OS or do a OS restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is nice, but a trouble maker for old computers with windows 7 like mine.</p>

            <p>I spoke too soon. </p>
<p>Following an overnight shutdown the same message appeared again</p>
<p><strong><em>'Cortana and Start Menu aren't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in. Sign out now'.</em></strong></p>
<p>I checked my Windows updates and the ones I had uninstalled had not been reinstalled - so they cannot have been responsible.</p>
<p>After a system <em><strong>Restart, </strong></em>everything had gone back to normal - I suspect that after the uninstallation process it was the restart that eliminated the problem. At the moment I am using my laptop after hibernation for a while, so I
 can work without fear of losing the Start Panel. However, Windows Live Mail cannot currently be opened!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft can identify and eliminate the loss of Start Panel - the symptom appears to be triggered randomly.</p>

<p>The instructions are not useful because</p>
<p>1) They can't be done by the ordinary person </p>
<p>2) They do not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a blocking bug.</p>

            I have been having the same problem as the other poster.&nbsp; This is on a brand new HP pavillion 550-150 PC with Windows 10 pre-installed.&nbsp; Essentially, I am forced to reboot my computer at least 3 times a day because all of a sudden EDGE and Cortana get
 hung and just stop working.....not responsive at all.&nbsp; I have no idea what causes it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can one of the Microsoft moderators here just be honest and tell us what the heck is going on.

            You need to install Windows XP (or another version) and Train Simulator inside DOSBox  as it is separate computer. Unfortunately the license is needed.

            Hi Odell
<br />
<br />Windows 10 already comes built in Adobe Flash Player in both web browsers: Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.
<br />
<br />Since this is not specifically a Windows 10 issue, you should get in touch with Vudu support to find out what are their browser and bandwidth requirements to use their service:

<h2>            Please enter your user name and password for the following server</h2>
                    I have been trying for days to solve this problem to no avail, and quite frankly don't know what else to do. &nbsp;All of a sudden the above message box appeared when I tried to send/receive mail, I have repeatedly applied the user name and password confirmed
 to me by my service provider, but this box still comes back. &nbsp;My service provider's assistant also tried to help and after&nbsp;nearly an hour told me to contact windows live. &nbsp;I have also tried looking on the internet for answers but as I am not that savvy in
 this it does get confusing to say the least. &nbsp;I have aslo tried to restore to a point where I was receiving mail, that did't work, also checked "my server erquires authentication", didn't work.&nbsp;

That is the most helpful error message you're ever likely to see in Windows Live Mail. The only thing it doesn't tell you is which option to choose: you want

            I believe you need to upgrade Itunes to version 9 in order for win7 to run it.

            I just installed the newest version after the upgrade.&nbsp; The Steam client also will not work.&nbsp; The funny thing is, earlier today out of the blue everything started working fine and now it has stopped again.&nbsp; I noticed the steam icon was on my task bar when
 things were working right and now it has disappeared.&nbsp; Also having trouble opening downloaded wmv files.

            I have downloaded iTunes 9 onto a brand new Win 7 Ultimate 64 Bit PC and it does NOT run. It tries, but no music appears. Just an empty screen despite importing Library etc. A few hours later I made the identical download onto my old xP Dell, and it worked
 perfectly, my library of music appearing without so much as a password from me. The Apple forum contains many similar complaints about Windows but no answers. Perhaps Apple reason that as their new version works on their own&nbsp;hardware, and upon MS' old hardware,
 that it falls to Microsoft to sort this out.

            Same issue here.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if you have the newest version of Itunes (I upgraded from 64-bit Vista Home to Window 7 Home) on a Gateway PC.&nbsp; Itunes installs just fine, but then when you try to run it, nothing happens.&nbsp; Windows knows the process is
 running (Task Manager shows itunes and ItunesHelper.exe) but itunes never runs.&nbsp; Occasionally itunes will randomly start after an hour or so, but it is prone to crashing and this phenomena appears to be completely random.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Using a partition vs another HDD does tend to be more problematic when dual booting. When using another</p>
<p>HDD/SSD you can select a specific drive in BIOS, so there is no defaulting to whichever OS is on C:\&nbsp; partition.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Interesting. I wouldn't think that doing a RAM test would fix hotmail, etc. though.

            <p>beeb busy so hence delay.</p>
<p>I have two HDD one for windows XP which I need for some items that will not work on Windows 7.</p>
<p>I have as said two progrs on second HDD with a partition used prior to windows 10 download
</p>
<p>So I have windows 7 prof and windows 10 in hdd two. Sometimes it gives me the choice to actuate either Win 7 of Win 10, but once I have used win 10 it goes into auto win10 each time thereafter. cheers.</p>

            <p>I have also a dual-boot system on a SSD.</p>
<p>XP-32 on the&nbsp;active partition and W10-64 on another one. A third partition is dedicated to data and games, almost empty at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an additional drive&nbsp;(HDD) with only data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, W7 =&gt; W10 upgrading didn't break my dual-boot menu. I can choose between both even if I rarely choose XP now.</p>

<h2>            How do i make a complaint against technician who will not listen and has harrased me and taken everything off my pc</h2>
                    <div>this can take a while but i would like someone from Australia to call me back - this problem started d 3rd May and is still going today May 15th 2017 - &nbsp;i dealt with a S*** and C******** T before having the unfortunate experience of having to deal with
 S******S**** who has taken over my pc this morning- without warning or notification.</div>
<div>
<p>I was working on a document last&nbsp;Wednesday on my HP laptop- using Win 10 a Microsoft Bluetooth keyboard and Microsoft Bluetooth mouse when all of a sudden my keyboard stopped working. I replaced batteries as I thought maybe that was the problem - I have
 never had an issue before with any of these items - it can take me a while to type all this out - i have vision and hearing issues and would like someone from Australia to call me back please- i have been quite upset at the treatment i have experienced with
 S***** and we have had words - my computer has been stripped of everything and he is now trying to load win 7 - he has left me for periods of between 2 and 4 hours without saying when he would be back and i told him this when i was chatting to the disability
 tech when he cut us off - hence the second support number.</p>
<p>I have 2 support id numbers but so far have been unable to talk with anyone as when I put my reference number id in this tech sends me a schedule time he will follow up with but he never does or he will call me 6-8 times in a row - he has even written in
 red on my screen using the pen facility &nbsp;"<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">r u there?"</span></strong>&nbsp; on my pc. I cannot use my computer at present as he has left the remote access program on it.</p>
<p>If I try to call the Melbourne or Sydney Australia office it reconnects outside of Australia to anywhere - Please can anyone offer any suggestions</p>

<p>Hi Kim Tiw</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have used this link - the moment I put the reference number in - it goes back to the same tech as it has already been through the first contact techs (I don't know their correct term) and was raised to the next level and this is where I am having
 major issues - I just don't want anything to do with this tech and would like to speak to someone not from his area and that was why I wanted someone from Australia - I am more than happy to take my pc-keyboard and mouse and information of my experience to
 the Melbourne office (unless it is just a virtual office for show).</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you show me how to put through as a complaint as there is nothing there in the drop down box thankyou</p>

            <p>Have you tried doing a system restore before you installed the software?</p>
<p>Using Windows 7 or Vista System Restore - How-To Geek<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a></p>
<p><br />
If the software refuses to uninstall, use Revouninstaller.</p>
<p>open the Microsoft System Configuration Utility, click Start, type: msconfig then hit Enter on your board.</p>
<p>Under the General tab, select Selective startup then click Apply and OK</p>
<p>Restart your computer. Once in Selective Startup mode, proceed to uninstall the program, go back to msconfig and select Normal startup so Windows will load normally.</p>
<p>Suppose Diagnostic mode fails to uninstall the troublesome program? Here is another solution? This will require that install a freeware utility called Revouninstaller, there is also a paid version, but the free version should be enough for most users needs.
 Revouninstaller is very detailed and provides insightful details about the program it is attempting to uninstall, including things like registry entries and where the program places files on your hard disk.</p>
<p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com</a> (freeware). Here’s a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and
 registry items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.</p>
<p>After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.</p>
<p>The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.
