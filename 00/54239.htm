    <title>Unable to cast to Samsung TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emjayo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to cast to Samsung TV</h2>
                    <p>Just installed Windows 10 on a new PC and purchased a Microsoft Video Adaptor thinking I could project my desktop image to the TV (to enable me to see on my TV whatever is playing on my PC).&nbsp; PC is in the basement and TV is one level above.&nbsp; The two&nbsp;appliances
 are virtually 6' (vertically) apart, with a wood floor separating them.&nbsp; When I try to connect from the PC to the Microsoft Video Adaptor through notifications/connect, I get this message "Your PC or Mobile device doesn't support Miracast, so it doesn't project
 wirelessly".&nbsp; I know that the fault is not with the Microsoft Video Adaptor because it connects with my smart phone easily.&nbsp; Do I need to buy some sort of transmitter for my new PC?&nbsp; The PC does have a wireless adaptor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a related matter, I happened to find the Option "cast media to device" and wondered if I could use this option to connect PC to TV.&nbsp; I we encourage when I could actually see my TV in the connect window, but when my TV is selected, I get vague error message
 (error, connection failed for unknown reasons).&nbsp; Not helpful.&nbsp; Any help on this?</p>

            Unfortunately, Raymond Ave,&nbsp;your suggestion was unhelpful.&nbsp; If you review my first sentence you will see I said, "...and purchased a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter", so yes, I did realize I need a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.&nbsp; Reading further,
 you will see I attempted to connect my PC to the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter but received the message, "Your PC or Mobile device doesn't support Miracast, so it doesn't project wirelessly", which is why I asked for help here.&nbsp; I suspect that, somehow&nbsp;I
 must activate my PC's ability to "support Miracast" (or maybe buy some add-on) but don't know how/what.

            Yes, custom built = built by retailer but I chose parts (W10, ASUS Z170 MB, 1070 GPU, i56600K CPU, 16GB RAM, in a desktop).&nbsp; Yes, key to this is whether or not my PC supports Miracast.&nbsp; Tried the "mouse in lower right corner, move mouse pointer up" but
 no menu appeared for me to select "devices".&nbsp; The "lower right" isn't the notifications area is it?&nbsp; Tried there too.&nbsp; Anyway, still no go...

            Do you have any other desktop or devices that you can connect to the wireless display? If it's working with a smartphone then it could be that the custom build computer is not compatible with

Yes that seems to be the case (not Miracast compatible) but I would like to know for sure.&nbsp; Is there a way to tell for certain?

<h2>            no audio device detected by windows, but still can play sound from rear and front output while using some application but not while using other applicaton</h2>
                    <p>hello guys (and girls), i might have a problem with my audio on my desktop</p>
<p>i currently using a Altec Lansing speaker for my rear output and a Marshall headphone for my front output, only using one at a time and working fine when plugged in to my laptop and phone</p>
<p>the motherboard is ASRock H77M, already installed the audio driver when first built and re-installed before posting this question just in case</p>
<p>using Windows 8 64bit</p>
<p>was working fine for several years until audio problem appear yesterday</p>
<p>
</p><p>my problem is windows cannot detect any plugged in output audio device, both front or rear (and TV's speaker plugged with HDMI cable also have the same problem)</p>
<p>what weird is that my audio device still can make sound from some of my software (VLC, GTA V, DOTA 2) work fine as if they recognize i have audio output plugged in (just like a normal and properly working computer) while other (MPC, Smite, Adobe Premier)
 does not recognize audio device just like my Windows said</p>
<p>
</p><p>the following is the screenshot i can show you all. already tried to re-install driver, software, codec, scan for virus, any normal procedure any computer owner would do for their loved one is not working</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Apologies for the delayed response.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to check if the devices are disabled under playback devices. If yes, enable and set as default. Follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click Speaker near clock.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Playback Devices.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click in the box area - check Show disabled<span>&nbsp;</span></span>and disconnected devices.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click Properties and click on Enable and click on Set as Default.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check if issue persists.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>If issue still persists, </span><span>I suggest you to <strong>
Perform </strong></span></span><strong><span>a System Restore</span></strong><span>. To perform a System Restore, you may refer to the article below and refer the section “</span><strong><span>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time</span></strong><span>”:</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> The System Restore restores the computer back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers and

            I had an issue seeing the project to a wireless display using the new Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.&nbsp; In order for me to fix it, I uninstalled the Marvel wireless network driver and removed my wireless location.&nbsp; I then also removed the Citrix SSL
 vpn connection i had.&nbsp; I am pretty sure citrix binds things to the network card.&nbsp; I then rebooted and let Windows reinstall the wireless driver.&nbsp; I then re-added my hidden wireless network and when prompted hit yes to allow the device to search for hidden
 networks going forward.&nbsp; After that, I could see and connect to the dispaly adapter.&nbsp; I searched several fourums&nbsp;for several hours.&nbsp; But I now have it working.&nbsp; I didnt reinstall the ssl vpn at this point.&nbsp; Hopefully this helps someone.&nbsp; I&nbsp;added&nbsp;my comments
 here becasue I couldnt find the other posts that talk about the network card.&nbsp; Pretty sure Barb was&nbsp;in charge of the other post as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&

            <p>Finally, I got a solution to this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I delete all the network profiles (both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz network).&nbsp; Create a new one (with the same settings as before), and the Miracast function reappears in the Projection function with 5Ghz network.&nbsp; Then I
 checked it works with both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz networks.&nbsp; The driver I use is 15.68.3055.107.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite strange why this works.&nbsp; Miracast is P2P connection which has nothing to do with network connections.&nbsp; Even no router connection Miracast should works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply but this is not exactly what I am looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Mac, I press the search keyboard shortcut and start typing. Let's say I type the name 'John'. I will see all emails from John and all files on my entire computer that mention the word John in them. This happens instantly as I am typing the search.
 I will probably find the mail I am looking for before I have even finished typing the full name 'John'!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to do this on Windows? I don't want to have to open my mail app and do a search only in my mail. I want to search ALL my files of every kind and I want to do that quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, even if I type the something into the search box of an explorer window showing my C drive, I will not see any results from my email.</p>

            When I do a search using <strong>mail: </strong>I can now get a tiny amount of results but it it's not working properly. It seems that I now have FIVE emails indexed but no more! One email from yesterday, one from last year and a few more from years ago.
 Strange! Also, when I click on any of these search results, I am taken to a web browser page, NOT to my email app.

<p>Can it really be that Microsoft only allows me to search my email by sending info across the internet but I cannot simply search the same emails that are sitting on my hard drive? This seems absurd!</p>

<h2>            Flickering on Saving Video .mp4 from Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    Recently I upgraded to Windows 10. During the install, I lost Media Player but after some help in the forum I got it back. When I was able to re-install it, I was able to then run windows movie Maker. When I render the video to be able to upload it to
 the internet, it plays fine in Movie Maker, but playback online (such as youtube) or playback via Media Player results in flickering. I've spent hours trying to search for similar problems and cannot find a solution. I have updated all my drivers and software,
 and my system shows up to date.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIMyO9cqpbk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Example of Choppy or Flickering Video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/EIMyO9cqpbk?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/EIMyO9cqpbk?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>

            <p>I have the same problem. &nbsp;The videos flicker exactly the same as noted by Sallen 1 in their sample video posted. &nbsp;This is something new and I believe has only started since I upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;The videos do not flicker in their original format or
 as a WIMP project file. &nbsp;The flickering only occurs after I save them in the Movie Maker program to an MPEG or other similar file. &nbsp;Prior to upgrading to Windows 10 I never had a problem the the final saved files turned out in excellent condition. &nbsp;Really
 would love it if you can resolve this problem.</p>

<h2>            Backing up games on windows 10</h2>
                    So im considering buying quantum break for windows 10, and possibly killer instinct as well. These games are large. MY question is if I buy and download these games. Is there any way to back the files up so I never have to download them again. Like steams
 backup restore feature? I contacted tech support and they couldn't seem to comprehend the question.

</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Simply copy the games complete install folder to your backup HDD.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- With Good old Games you download an installer, so you can keep your installers for future use,

<p>or&nbsp; copy those games to an external HDD. </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Like steams backup restore feature? "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm, I was not aware of this feature (maybe Origin and UPlay have something similar).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Just copy the games install folder to an external HDD.</p>
<p>You can copy the whole SteamApps folder if you have never backed up yet.</p>
<p>The relevant&nbsp; <em>appmanifest</em>&nbsp; file, and the <em>Userdata</em> (the saves are kept here) folder can also be copied.</p>
<p>- Your Steam 'username' folder holds any Valve games you may have ( HL2, etc )</p>
<p>- You can find most games Steam ID number by doing a search, or 'open' the appmanifest&nbsp; files</p>
<p>with notepad or notepad++ .</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you install games to non-default locations keep track of the drive letter the game was installed to</p>
<p>so you can copy the games back to the same location (and keep the file path intact) should you
</p>
<p>add new HDD's&nbsp; or partitions in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saves:</p>
<p>- Origin keeps saves in C:\Program Data\Origin\Local Content.</p>
<p>- Ubisoft in C:\Program Data\Ubisoft .</p>
<p>- Saves for most non Steam/Origin/UPlay games can be found in your </p>
<p>User\Documents,&nbsp; or AppData folders.</p>
<p>- Older games often store the saves in the games install folder.</p>

<h3> aldo villa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suddently Windows 7 Pro isn&#39;t genuine any longer and MIcrosoft Genuine Advantage Diagnostic tool does not offer any output&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody, I don't know if I'm being right, but I'm posting my problem here out of desperation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My story can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;I’m the unlucky user of a Toshiba Satellite Pro T130-15G, which was purchased by a friend of mine, here in Italy, on June 26 2010.&nbsp; Needless to say, this PC came with Windows
 7 Pro x64 pre-installed and, since the beginning, it has always had the same OEM license code.&nbsp; Last year, because of a malware attack, I had to disassemble and reassemble the machine, going through a complete formatting of the hard disk and reshaping the
 partitions at my will. &nbsp;I struggled with the lack of an ISO file, but, after bypassing this hurdle, when I was done I entered the codes that I had saved in a file, and everything went OK. &nbsp;I would like to add that I didn’t perform neither add-ins, nor removals,
 of any piece of hardware (not even a RAM expansion) and that this PC has run, since then, with its own OEM, Toshiba provided, Windows 7 license and with no problem whatsoever. Frankly, when I had to activate the re-mounted Windows 7 Pro x64, I had to struggle
 a bit with license codes.&nbsp; In the beginnings, I couldn't manage the OS activation, as I was using the license key that I had previously found in the control panel, but everything went right when I understood that I had to use the activation-key that I found
 on the COA sticker on the PC bottom. Everything worked perfectly fine for almost 8 months since rebuilding the system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, a few days ago, I started receiving pop-up messages meant to inform me that my Windows 7 license could be counterfeited, that it is spoofed, that it isn’t genuine and so
 and so forth; together with some of these messages, there are also invitations to contact Microsoft to resolve the problem; which I did, of course.&nbsp; I ended talking with a Microsoft assistant that, after having been provided with all the info that he had requested,
 concluded that the problem has to do with the <strong>product ID</strong> because,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> “<em><strong>it shouldn’t be this one</strong></em>”!</span>&nbsp; Needless to say, I replied that the product ID of the machine is the one
 provided by Toshiba and that it never changed and that it had been working without any hassle since the beginning.&nbsp; Eventually, he stated that he was convinced of what I had just told him, but that this product ID had been blocked by Toshiba for some unknown
 reason and, flatly, he concluded: “<em>Toshiba has blocked it; however, Toshiba can unlock it as well.&nbsp; I can’t do anything for you: You have to address this problem to your PC manufacturer</em>!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Needless to say I was desperate out of frustration, at that point having already spent&nbsp; a lot of time and efforts trying to solve a problem that
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">should NOT exist</span>.&nbsp; Moreover, customer support by Toshiba, here in my country, is, u</span><span>nfortunately,
</span><span>worse than nothing: If someone spends time and patience looking for a telephone number, he/she can find one, or 2 of them, in the end. &nbsp;However, it’s impossible to talk to
 anyone. It’s always an answering machine that answers the call; most of the times, the answering machine wastes some of the caller time, inviting to push 1 for this, 2 for that, but, then, the result is always the referral to a web page, or the referral to
 another number.&nbsp; If the ill-fated caller abides to one of these invitations, he/she has, then, always to find out that the number does not exists and/or that the URL provided is useless! &nbsp;All this not to mention a digital/virtual assistant with a Japanese
 name: it never understands an iota and it’s a good example of Toshiba disrespect for its customers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is why, after touring the web back and forth looking for help, I ended writing to an email address of
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Toshiba support in Germany!&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; After explaining some of the above, I wrote,...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>So said:&nbsp; German friends, I apologize for the intrusion. I dare to write here asking for help, because the problem isn’t a technical problem
 that necessitates time and expertise to solve</span></span><span>.&nbsp;
<strong>No, my problem has to do with something that Toshiba did and it shouldn’t have done,… Let me explain,…</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>.................................</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>.................................</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>I believe that the above explains why I’m here to disturb you.&nbsp; Someone who knows the inner workings of Toshiba, should kindly inform whomever could remove this spurious, ridiculous,
 block, of a machine that never had given me such a problem, since almost six years from its purchase</em>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After a couple of days, I got the following reply:</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p><em><span>I'm sorry to hear about your problems with the support. I will forward your mail to the responsible persons.</span></em></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Not having any intention to perform again a long and exhausting full system restore, and also considering that I did reinstall windows using a regular Win 7 Pro 64 bits version,
 today, May 27, I spent all day trying any possible solution whose suggestion I was able to find on line; but every effort failed. I almost always stumbled upon error code
</span></p>
<p><span>0xC004F063 and interesting enough, may be, when I followed the procedure suggested in this YouTube video</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irhlx7KJ8Ic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irhlx7KJ8Ic</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Irhlx7KJ8Ic?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Irhlx7KJ8Ic?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>
</span></p>
<p><span>I couldn't follow the whole procedure because the
<em>slmgr –rearm</em> command was met by a response stating that there had already been too many rearms!<span>&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, exactly as it happens in that video-demo, when my attempts to validate the license key were rejected, most often than not, the system complained of a not valid license that, however, wasn’t the one that I had entered<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">!<span>&nbsp;
</span>In other words, it looks like the system is rejecting the license that it “sees” which isn’t, however the one provided!!!
</span></em>What a mess!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, when I tried to use Microsoft Validation tool, it wasn’t able to provide an output file and it left me in the dark about the nature of the whole problem!<span>&nbsp;
</span>Could you imagine a worse nightmare?</span></p>
<p>
<span>Last, but not least: I can’t deny that I’m very upset.&nbsp; I really don’t understand whom should I “thank” for the terrible hassles I’m going through, considering that no one ever performed
<span>Last, but not least: I can’t deny that I’m very upset.&nbsp; I really don’t understand whom should I “thank” for the terrible hassles I’m going through, considering that no one ever performed
 anything wrong with this PC and that the price that I’m paying for no fault&nbsp;</span><span>is,</span><span> according
 to my meter, skyrocketing high and overwhelming. </span>
</p><p><span>And I’m impatient to understand if there is anyone capable to remove this absurd block, or if I should just go to eBay and purchase a Windows 7 Pro x64 ESD license!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your attempt to help me out of this nightmare, but this orgiastic delirium of absurdities continues to go on.
</p>
<p>I clicked on the link that you provided me and I started from there. I had to download and install a first piece of software (from Microsoft website). The software run, but it stopped right away complaining that it couldn't complete its job and offering
 two possible solutions.&nbsp; The fist option required to change browser's setting in order that it could run JavaScript and accept third parties cookies.&nbsp; Continuing to follow the directions, I ended rebooting my PC twice, installing another piece of software
 from Microsoft,... I did everything twice, because I wanted to check if what didn't work with Firefox might have been working with IE.&nbsp; The only difference was that with Firefox the program went on requesting those 2 settings change, whilst this didn't happen
 with I.E.&nbsp; In any case, those 2 requested changes were absurd, because my Firefox was already set that way before.&nbsp; In any case, in the end I obtained many times the same result; I got there through different paths and I was able to see two slightly different
 way of communicating the same message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But the meaning of the messages have always been the same: A big, title-shaped first part of the message stated:<strong> "Impossible to validate Windows software as origina</strong><strong>l</strong>", whilst the small character part of the message explained:
<em>"The validation service was not able to establish if windows running on your PC is authentic" (</em> Il servizio di convalida non è stato in grado di stabilire se la copia di Windows eseguita sul tuo computer è autentica)&nbsp; And all this while lots of messages
 on my desktop keep informing me that my Windows isn't a valid/genuine copy of this software.&nbsp; It would be fun if it wasn't tragic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It's impossible for my Windows not to be origina</strong>l. It is an OEM license that belonged to this machine since its beginning, as it is a factory installed one.&nbsp; This machine has always been used by two people only: the purchaser and myself.&nbsp;
 No piece of hardware whatsoever has ever been changed and nobody messed-up with licenses.&nbsp; If it hadn't been for a malware attack, I wouldn't have done anything at the software level either.&nbsp; When this event was suffered, the machine was already around 5 years
 old and it had been running with the same license with no problems whatsoever for all that time.&nbsp; When Windows had to be reinstalled, I activated it using the key that I could still read from the authenticity sticker on the bottom of the machine. Since then,
 the machine has been running for approximately 8 months and nothing happened.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Then, suddenly, my copy of windows isn't good any longer</strong>! A Microsoft customer assistant told me that it's Toshiba fault of blocking my machine ID-number.&nbsp; But Toshiba told/wrote me that, even if they wanted to do that, they wouldn't have
 the possibility.&nbsp; And now these validation softwares declare themselves unable to decide what way things are.&nbsp; Not even they are capable of understanding what's going on in this orgy of absurdities.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this is typical of Microsoft products.&nbsp; I
 had many time isomorphic problems; it didn't just occur me to have one with licenses: Not until now at least!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again: Aldo</p>

            <p>There should be product key sticker (25 characters XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX) on your Desktop or Laptop (for a&nbsp;laptop check the bottom of the laptop or inside the battery case, you may need to remove the battery).</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------&nbsp; Product key Letters and numbers ------------------</p>
<p><br />
Do not confused the letter B with the number 8, the letter Q with the letter O.<br />

Not used letters: A, E, I, O U and L S U Z&nbsp; Numbers not used: 0 1 and 5</p>
<p>
</p><p>

1) Click the Start Button on the Desktop.<br />
2) Right click on 'Computer'.<br />
3) Click on the 'Properties' option.<br />
4) At the bottom of the window click on the Change product key link and enter&nbsp;the Product Key on the sticker I mentioned.</p>
<p><br />
Alternate method:<br />

            <p>Thank again for your efforts and patience.&nbsp; First let me inform you about what I did in between this communication and the previous one. I did two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first one was to try to activate by telephone. I tried in many ways, not just through the method that you suggested (slui.exe 4).&nbsp; But I could never reach the point where I should have been offered&nbsp; the option "<em>Activate through different methods</em>".&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Therefore, I couldn't reach any telephone operator to talk to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, following a suggestion from one of <em>The Seven Forums</em> blogs. I rerun the Validation program using again the file MGADiag.exe; but I did that only after following the procedure described here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/233153-win-7-premium-activation-error-code-0xc004f063.html
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and rebooting the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if the results have been different from the previous one, but, in any case, I'm pasting them here for you to check:</p>

<p>Finally, I can tell you that I had already also tried all of your latest suggestions, but I repeated the last one of this cluster (i.e., the one where the DOS command "slmgr" has to be used).&nbsp;&nbsp; I entered the activation key that stands on the Microsoft sticker
 on the bottom of my PC which, BTW, is also the same one that I had used to reactivate Windows after last fall complete system restore and which "worked" until 10 days ago approximately, when this problem begun.&nbsp; Also this time, the KEY was rejected as non-valid,
 but what changed has been the provision of an error code: 0xC004F050.&nbsp; I googled it and I gave a very fast look at the results.&nbsp; If I wasn't mistaken, this error code should apply to those situations where the KEY had expired; however, it never occurred to
 me to know that OEM licenses expire!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before leaving you, let me tell you something more.&nbsp; I googled many times with research keys , more or less, similar to this one: "<em>error code 0xc004f063 windows 7 Pro x64 build 7601</em>".&nbsp; I didn't a review, but the impression that I had&nbsp; is that this
 problem of mine is really widespread.&nbsp; A lot of people seem to have run into this sudden message telling them that their Windows OS isn't a valid copy, isn't genuine, could be non valid, etc.&nbsp; For many of them, the situation has been very similar, if not identical
 to mine.&nbsp; From those who answered them, the prevalent hint was to use the Activation Key from their PC COA stickers. And for many of them the problem was that they couldn't find that sticker any longer, or that it was so worn-out to have become unreadable.
 I have also read that this problem can be triggered when one, or more, drivers aren't up to date, or when even the BIOS wasn't updated.&nbsp; None of the above is shared by my situation.&nbsp; but, despite this, my problem appears to be almost impossible to solve</p>
<p><strong>In any case, these events shouldn't occu</strong>r: When someone acts lawfully and carefully and has always done everything and anything that he/she is supposed to do, he/she shouldn't be harassed&nbsp; by problems hard to solve also by professional experts.&nbsp;
 The fact that a software house, such as Microsoft, show to be unable to distinguish between honest customers and pirates, forcing the first ones into technical nightmares, throws a very bad light onto the high-tech world.</p>

<p>Why is no one else thinking about this another way, instead of COMPLAINING about the system, and going to PS4, why not, oh I don't know, BOYCOTT Microsoft until they CHANGE the system to what WE THE GAMERS want...personally, that's what I would do if I had
 a group of people on my side, but nope, all my friends are throwing fits and acting like 12 year olds :/ But I plan to boycott none the less, so Microsoft, until you CHANGE the system to what WE THE GAMERS WANT, you have lost a valued costumer on the xbox
 'one'</p>

<p>The Reveal was aimed at a broad audience. &nbsp;E3 will be for gamers. &nbsp;Did you stick around for the Architecture Panel after the show? &nbsp;It's really quite an amazing system. &nbsp;It's okay to be scared of the future my fellow gamer and I know there are unanswered
 questions, but I urge you to wait until the facts are known. &nbsp; Larry Hyrb said the console will allow you to buy and sell used games and that the specifics haven't been worked out yet. &nbsp; It's funny how Microsoft doesn't have a policy yet but the media can
 already tell you what it is. &nbsp; Don't blindly trust what you hear.</p>

<p>Or you could be constructive and voice your concerns in a well mannered way and hope that Microsoft changes things, if they don't and you (as well as my self if things don't change) don't like the final product then don't buy it.</p>
<p>calling a boycott now is pointless. things can still be affected and changed (hopefully) for the better.</p>

<p>Boycotting?? &nbsp;I'm not buying, period. &nbsp;I read up on the confirmed info for the Xbox One and not only am I not impressed, I'm flat out not happy. &nbsp;This is my last run on xbox live and maybe my last console for a long time. &nbsp;I'll get to save money by sticking

<p>Honestly, so far Sony are getting my money. I'd decided this prior to the Xbox One reveal, because so far I've liked the cut of Sony's jib. I was probably going to get an Xbox One right up until that reveal. You can see the strategic direction Microsoft
 want to take, and so far I'll not be going along for the ride. I'm not boycotting the system, I'm just exercising my rights as a consumer not to purchase it. If Microsoft change their minds on their strategic direction and offer me compelling games I might
 consider it. But right now, I'm happy with owning my gaming rig for all the techie nonsense us nerds like and my PS4 for console gaming. Microsoft can win me round, but boy will they have to work hard.</p>

<p>E3 will probably decide it for me. &nbsp;If there are no "must have" games, I'll pass. &nbsp;And considering how lacklustre the industry has become of late, I'm not holding my breath. &nbsp;The bottom line is simple: give me a game-based reason to buy this thing and I
 may be willing to forgive all the other "rumored" issues. &nbsp;Otherwise, I'm sticking with my 360 and maybe try a PS4.</p>

<p>Going off of what's been confirmed, I'm not touching the damned thing. &nbsp;This thing isn't for people that game, if you want to do that, move to the PS4 at this point. &nbsp;You won't even be able to take used games into gamestop and get money for it, you'll have
 to sell it online to somebody else. &nbsp;You won't be able to trade your system in if you still want to play old games (GTA V won't be playable on the new Xbox, just remember that). &nbsp;Mircrosoft will also be killing lots of jobs at Gamestop and other mom and pop
 stores that sell used games since they make most of their profits off of used games. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously people, put your money where you mouth is and don't give them your money for this overpriced piece of crap that's made to do nothing more than to eff you over.</p>

<p>I really don't understand the people that are saying "wait for E3"!! &nbsp; Why?? &nbsp;You think that somehow M$ is gonna change their minds on the crap requirements and features of this console between now and then???? &nbsp;Not a chance. &nbsp;This Console was not designed
 with us the Gamer in mind. &nbsp; &nbsp;My Internet is terrible where I live and often goes out for days and sometimes weeks on end. &nbsp;So what good will a game system that has to at the very least connect with its servers every 24 hrs be to me?? &nbsp;I call it a brick. &nbsp;Charge
 me to play used games??? &nbsp;Nope, not gonna happen. &nbsp;I'm done. &nbsp;I'm not renewing my xbox live and I certainly won't be buying this overpriced cable box.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I agree with you that if there is a folder with a weird name then it might be a virus/malware. So, I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to run a full scan using
<strong><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></strong> (MSS) to make sure that the Computer is virus free.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The
<strong><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></strong> is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing
 antivirus software.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(46, 116, 181, 1)"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">There might be a chance that there is some system file corruption. So, I would suggest you to run
<strong><span>SFC scan </span></strong>and see if it&nbsp;brings any difference.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption. The sfc /scannow command (System File Check)

<p><strong><span>I am using Vista Business SP2 32 bit and have been successfully using Windows Mobile 6.1.6965 to sync my iPAQ. Over the Christmas period this stopped working and

    <title>Canon VIXIA HV40 Firewire Connection Issues... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> banditkeith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon VIXIA HV40 Firewire Connection Issues...</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I'm currently running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-edition, on a HP Pavillion P6000. I bought a I/O rest PCI Express IEEE 1394A Card (Firewire 400), and I have my Canon VIXIA HV40 connected to it.<br />
<br />
Now, here's my issue: I installed the card, and windows recognized it, and installed successfully. Then I connected the camera, Windows recognized it, and installed successfully. Now, when I try to capture footage from my camera to my hard drive through the
 video editing software I have, in capture mode, the software knows it's there, I can preview what's on the tape in the program, but when I go to capture it, it doesn't capture anything. Yes, the tape is playing while I'm capturing. It could be an issue with
 the camera, but I would like to know if this could be a problem with the computer.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions and/or help would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Best Regards, John<br />

            <p><strong>Canon HV40</strong></p>
<p>I too am having the same issues with Windows 10 not recognising the Canon HV40 camcorder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The camera has two playback modes: HDV/DV and DV LOCKED modes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I believe is this: Whilst connected to the IEEE1394 Firewire port...</p>
<p>
</p><p>SD LOCKED mode, computer uses "<strong>msdv.inf</strong>" file and is listed in device manager as an "imaging device".</p>
<p>HDV/DV mode, computer uses "<strong>mstape.inf</strong>" file and is listed as a "sound, video and games controller".<br />
<br />
msdv.inf specifically lists the camcorder by name but has no configuration for the camera while in HDV mode, this code is missing. Therefore, mstape is used instead. which incorrectly places the device in sound video and games controllers, thus making it inaccessible
 for programs such as Windows Movie Maker. And because of this miss-identification, no other video editing software recognises the camera in HDV mode either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to copy and paste specific references to the Canon Camcorder from msdv.inf to mstape.inf without success, as apparently these are system protected files, even when using notepad in "open as admin" role. So, I am at a loss. If Microsoft
 could provide an updated msdv.inf file which will identify the camcorder whilst it is set to HDV playback mode, that would completely fix the problem. There is no hardware problem or firmware problem with the camera or firewire configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to a response and download link for the amended msdv.inf file with great anticipation.</p>

            <p>Canon support has already been contacted. After explaining in full, the information regarding said msdv and mstape inf and sys files, their response was, and I quote: "<span><strong>As
 the issue you are experiencing&nbsp;is beyond our support boundaries, &nbsp;we&nbsp;can not assist you on this.</strong>" Since MS precedes both dv and tape on the files mentioned, the inability of Windows' to recognise the same camera while in different modes, and falsely
 reporting it as a games controller/audio device would, in my opinion, fall squarely on the shoulders of Microsoft. Since this problem has been reported, not just with Canon products, but with a wide variety of other HDV digital camcorders, one has to assume
 they cannot all have the same problem, but again, it would be the inability of the operating system to recognise these devices while set to HDV playback mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have personally examined the content of both Windows 10, Vista &nbsp;and XP versions of the msdv.inf file and I can assure you, there are several lines of code missing
 from the Windows 10 related file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>I am no programmer by any means, and my attempts to overwrite msdv.inf with earlier code, or to swap it entirely for the XP version have failed, due to system protection and incorrect
 digital signatures. Therefore, the code needs adjusting and an update to these files needs to be made available for the possible millions of HD camera owners now stuck&nbsp;</span><span>down-streaming</span><span>&nbsp;in
 standard&nbsp;definition mode.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />

            Thanks Mary. This problem has been reported over and over again (you only have to search Google for this problem) since windows 7, and in some cases even Vista, although I personally had no problems running vista. So I believe I would only be repeating
 what countless others have said. I've decided to remove my Firewire card and replace it with a HDMI capture card, even though the hardware is not at fault. I really, really hope that Windows 10 actually recognises the capture card as one, not as some sort
 of joystick or tape backup device.

    <title>Options for devmgmt.msc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhnbuzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Options for devmgmt.msc</h2>
                    As I have several programs that I need to verify the com port assigned to a USB-Serial adapter. I created a shortcut to devmgmt.msc so I can quickly open Device manager. But now I have a couple of questions related to Device Manager. I'm running Win7Pro
 32bit on a Dell Latitude.<br />
<br />
1) Is there a way to set Device Manager to open without the "Network Adapters" or "Bluetooth Radios" branch expanded?<br />
2) Can I specify, via a command line switch, to expand the ports branch?<br />
3) How can I change the size of the window that does open. I always have to drag the bottom down to see all the branches. Though I would not need to if I can do #1 above.<br />
