    <title>THIS WILL NOT WORK ON A MAC &#58;Typing in a full stop after a word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pennypen  say:</h3>
<h2>            THIS WILL NOT WORK ON A MAC &#58;Typing in a full stop after a word that VBA recognises presents you with a list of other words you can use to finish the sentence.</h2>
                    <p>I was advised to buy Office 365 home premium for MAC by a sales adviser at Microsoft after I had explained to him that I need to be able to use the Visual Basic for [Office] Applications coding, i.e., that I needed to be able to write macros in Excel VBA
 rather than just record them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have paid for it and downloaded it (a few months ago) I happened today to try and use the functionality in VBA where I could type a word (i.e. the name of a method or collection or object and then follow that word with a full stop. &nbsp;When I used VBA
 in windows the selection of words that belonged to said object / collection / method would pop up and so I could select my choice of word and proceed with coding. &nbsp;THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN ON A MAC. &nbsp;I spoke with technical support - it took me 5 hours to get through
 to someone, and 4 different attempts at phoning up and being passed from pillar to post on average 7 times each call. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I speak to an advisor who says Microsoft do not support that functionality in Excel on a Mac, even if I were to buy the full version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He said there are third-party applications that have a work-around for this problem but he could not advise them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm totally totally amazed at this complete lack of functionality and that Microsoft are seemingly unwilling to address it, and from todays calls, it seemed they were unwilling to admit it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have 2 questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can anyone out there recommend such a third party app by its name so I can find it - please I am in desperate need...., and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Is there anyone at Microsoft who can advise if they will be addressing this HUGE issue, because otherwise I can probably just do without it.</p>

            <p>'m not much of a VBA guy so maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're asking for. If you're referring to the autocomplete list of Properties, Methods, etc. as you can see from this screen shot the VBE in Mac Office does, in fact, provide it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e88e0c6b-6a0f-4ab6-bfe9-c1fc6540d8c6" /></p>
<p>If that <em>isn't</em> what you meant, PMFJI, but if it <em>is</em> please provide a more accurate &amp; complete description of what you believe is 'missing', what specific steps you're taking, etc. Also, please specify your present update level of Office 2011
 as well as what version of OS X you're using.</p>

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you&nbsp; have with the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might have caused due to the incompatibility of joystick with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to Run the driver software for the game pad in compatibility mode and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now, to install in Compatibility Mode, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Locate or download&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong><span>executable</span></strong>&nbsp;file (.exe file) for the driver installation program from the cd provided or from the manufacturers Website.<br />
b. Right-click the file, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>.<br />
c. In the&nbsp;<strong><span>Package Name</span></strong>&nbsp;<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Compatibility</span></strong>&nbsp;tab.<br />
d. Click to select the&nbsp;<strong><span>Run this program in compatibility mode for</span></strong>&nbsp;check box, click&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows 8&nbsp;</span></strong>with which it is compatible with in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.<br />
e.&nbsp;<strong><span>Double-click</span></strong>&nbsp;the executable file to start the installation program.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks and sorry it has taken a while for me to get back to you. tried your suggestion but it did not work. Thrust master does have a windows 10 driver so this joy stick not game pad is compatible I would hope so being it is about 6 months old now. Also
 it does work once I come off preview</p>
<p>any other suggestions?</p>

            This is an error coming from your ISP informing you that your mailbox is currently locked. If restarting Outlook doesn't solve it, you can contact your ISP to verify the current status of your mailbox.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VPN remenbers your username and prefills it&nbsp;after the&nbsp;first time. When using Cisco</p>
<p>Pre-shared key with Xauth authentication there is also&nbsp;a feature to support</p>
<p>password caching.&nbsp;You can just add line:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>USE_CACHE: TRUE</p>
<p>right after the</p>
<p>USE_XAUTH: TRUE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the .pol file, repack the .vpn and install it.&nbsp; It then remembers your password after the first&nbsp;time&nbsp;and does not ask anything. You can find the paramer also in NCT tool in Advanced</p>
<p>Settings section.</p>
<p>IT IS NATURALLY A SECURITY RISK TO USE IT, SINCE ANYBODY CAN</p>
<p>THEN CONNECT TO YOUR VPN ACCOUNT WITH YOUR PHONE, SO</p>
<p>USE IT ONLY IF YOU ARE SURE THAT IT IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR YOU.</p>
<p>You can consider activating device lock to mitigate the risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at more details of the VPN Policy&nbsp;parameters in the Policy spec:</p>

            <p>Hi Aleva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please forgive me for scolding Mohan in response to your question. I am a volunteer moderator and we don't have a direct channel to the Microsoft support folks. I don't even have a way to send an email to Mohan. Mohan has been very active in Mac forums lately
 and his answers often make no sense whatsoever, as is the case with your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to give you a straightforward, honest answer to your question. <strong>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">how can i set outlook 2016 for mac to open with the message selected being either the last message i was viewing, or the newest,
 most recent email?</span>"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer is easy. You can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously you wish you could. To accommodate wishes, Microsoft has a web site where you can express your wishes and vote on wishes. It's here:</p>
<p><a href="http://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac</a></p>
<p>That said, expressing your wish doesn't mean it will ever come true, so it is only an expression of hope for the future.</p>

            <p>mohan,</p>
<p>thanks for taking the time to reply, however, step 3 is not possible. &nbsp;clicking on Microsoft Outlook simply launches the program. &nbsp; right-clicking through Show Pkg Contents does not reveal any Microsoft Database Utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>every time i launch, or even switch back to Outlook, a different old inbox message is randomly selected and shown in the preview pane. &nbsp;it's never a message i had recently viewed and it's often many years old. &nbsp;i then have to scroll back to the top to see
 recent/new message. &nbsp; this happens EVERY TIME. &nbsp;it's VERY ANNOYING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you please escalate this and search for a solution? &nbsp;i bought Microsoft Office for Mac 2015 outright with limited funds for my small business, and would love some effective support.</p>
<p>

<h3> sunithatumkur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Swollen battery and repeated heating up, rebooting and switiching off of the 950XL</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I have been a user of Nokia phone since 2013 ( Lumia 820). It is still in working condition without any issues. My current mobile (Lumia 950 XL) has been such a disaster. It&nbsp;suddenly&nbsp;reboots, heats up,&nbsp;and then makes
 continuous sound as if it is going to blast anytime. When I called up the customer care team, which takes ages to get connected and offers support only in Hindi, suggested that I take the phone to the service centre. The customer care guy suggested that I
 keep the phone and the battery separate as the phone might blast anytime. I switched the phone and took out the battery. The day I went to the service centre, my phone battery had swollen and I was told that they cannot help me as the warranty for the battery
 is only for 6 months and that they do not have the battery in circulation and that the batteries have&nbsp;been withdrawn by the company. Although my phone is under warranty, the battery is out of warranty is what I was told.
</span><span>Is it not that the phone battery got swollen because of the phone itself?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is sad that a company like Microsoft is manufacturing such faulty devices, saying it is the battery, withdrawing the batteries from circulation. The customer is at the receiving end as they have blocked all the doors to
 resolution. If this is the way Microsoft manufactures faulty devices and provides customer service, it too may have to shutdown like Nokia! It is hard to believe that my investment of 35K on the phone is filled with so many hassles and headaches!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my handset to be replaced or refund the money I spent on it.&nbsp;I will never buy any Microsoft product ever again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the Microsoft personal who will reply to this issue: Please do not share this link as a resolution: "https://support.b2x.com/articles/23628296". It is useless and trash!!</p>

            I know how you feel. Same happened to me, they told me that, unless I attempted a full factory restore with Win 10 Phone Recovery Tool, they would not be able to accept my phone for assistance. I did try to restore it to original firmware and reapply all
 updates. The battery exploded before I could finish the procedure. Now they tell me that neither the battery, nor the device , can be dealt with under warranty.

You can insert a link to the text in one document from other documents, then if you modify the text in the document to which the link is pointing, when you open the other documents, you can update the links or there is a setting under File&gt;Options&gt;Advanced&gt;General
 to have the links updated automatically when one of the other documents is opened.

                    Good day everybody<br />
<br />
A friend of mine wants more freedom from office and he thoud to buy Nokia E90 + bluetooth printer (maybe also a document scanner if there is one with bluetooth and E90 support).<br />
<br />
Has anyboy ever used a E90 with bluetooth printer (it may also be smaller office printer with bluetooth - also bluetooth printing module for USB). And is there any bluetooth document scanner on the market?<br />
<br />
I am thankful for any help or comment.

            If your friend can afford to carry a bulky printer and a scanner, why not use a Laptop Computer for them ? Nokia E90 will never be able to perform just as good as a Laptop, and he will end-up getting upset with the system and blame it on E90...

            Thats what i also told him. There are already laptops with 10" screens and a laptop is better suitable for this kind of task.

<h2>            6300 - how do I set a song as a ringtone&#63;  &#38;quot&#59;Not allowed by activation key&#38;quot&#59;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I downloaded a song to use as a ringtone on my 6300, it came as an mp4 file and plays no problem when I open it. However when I try and set it as the ringtone I get a message "Not allowed by activation key".<br />
<br />
If I go into the track there is the option to "Activate Tone" but if I select this it takes me to a German music download site!<br />
<br />
Can anyone advise what I can to to allow it to be set as a ringtone?<br />
<br />
Many thanks!<br />

            This is happening because you are trying to set a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DRM protected</a> music file as a ringtone.<br />
<br />
You need to use unprotected files for ringtones or a file that is licensed for use as a ringtone.

<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to register a Skype Number on the do not call registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype Numbers are rented number which is technically not registered to any user. Your Skype Number stays on your account while your subscription is active and can be assigned to other users when subscription&nbsp;expires or is no longer in use.</p>

<h2>            T-Mo wing won&#39;t sync over bluetooth</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchesed the new t-mobile Wing and since my computer is usually kept in my office and my phone in my bedroom next to me, i wanted to set up active sync via bluetooth. when I create the partnership beween the two, the&nbsp;phone dosn't list any services
 the PC offers. (including Sync over bluetooth!) I talked to t-moble and the first young lady was confused by what bluetooth was to begin with, she kept reading me information about setting up with my exchange server lol. but after that I soke with a true geek
 who actually could undertand me. He asked one of his feild guys, and there response was that it was a known issue, and that microsoft was working on it. I just want to know where? where on microsoft's site can I read about this problem and be kept up to date
 on the progress. </p>
<p>If anyone has any more information that may help me that would be geat...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Mike,&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; What O/S are you using for this?&nbsp; With XP it will use ActiveSync, but Vista moves to a new integrated form of ActiveSync - WMDC (Windows Mobile Device Center) that ships with the O/S.&nbsp; I ask, because there are different menus and settings to enable bluetooth
 synch via each of these.&nbsp; It is possible to do, though.&nbsp; You have to of course have a PC which has bluetooth (generally desktops don't and laptops might), which might mean buying a bluetooth transciever for the PC.&nbsp; Once this&nbsp;is done, they have to be paired
 up with each other using discovery mode.&nbsp; After this is complete, you should be able to activate the type of perferred sync using the menus on both the phone's sync screen (set to use Bluetooth there) as well as within either ActiveSync or WMDC.</p>

<h2>            Why Edge can&#39;t show previous URL</h2>
                    <p>In IE you can right click on the go back arrow to get a list of previous sites in reverse order visited&gt; In Edge you can't. You need the IE feature because some sites prevent you from backing out. The IE feature lets you get back to a previous site; Edge
 doesn't. So the only way to back out in Edge is to close EDge and start over, This makes Edge unrewarding to use in such a situation. Why?</p>

            <p>On a certain build during the Preview phase, I had to drop back to 8.1 but eventually got the RTM build to work. Since then, I've stuck with the auto update process, not the Insider releases.&nbsp;Having used Windows ever since it first came out, I'm finding
 it strange with Win 10 to be using a work in progress, not a thoroughly prototyped &amp;&nbsp;tested build. Even with auto&nbsp;updates to the retail build, it's like walking in quicksand. At least, thanks to your help, I know not to use Edge until&nbsp; Build 11102, 1000 or
 later.</p>

    <title>Why is OneNote online so unbelievably slow&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is OneNote online so unbelievably slow&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>let me tell you that last year I was really looking forward to try OneNote. I was reading various articles about note taking apps and I was quite happy when you made OneNote free and also available for the Android phones! I liked to compare various apps
 and software and came to conclusion that OneNote looks like the best and also better then EverNote (because of certain features) so I really was planning that this will be a center of my notes. I have been using it for about half a year and sadly my enthusiasm
 faded.</p>
<p>Tell me Microsoft, why the heck did you make the web browser version so friking slow to load? How is it possible that a few hundred bytes of text sometimes takes 20seconds to load? I feel like back in the days of 14kbps modemsI thought you have your great
 Azure cloud which should handle this kind of "load" without any problems. Of course I understand... you encourage people to use the desktop app. But please... do you really need to use such methods to persuade people to buy MS Office? :( BTW I don't have windows
 on all the pcs I use and of course I would want to sometimes use OneNote on a friends computer so it would be a web version anyway. But lately I am so upset that switching between pages takes so long that I really consider using something else :(</p>
<p>Funny enough - the android app is performing MUCH better then a web version. Probably because it has the content cached so switching between pages and sections is immediate. Please fix that, otherwise I am probably moving my data to somebody else's cloud...</p>

            <p>Well, thank you for your generic answer... I am really surprised nobody else confirms this unbelievable situation though.</p>
<p>You named some obvious factors which can influence the speed of web apps. Of course, everything can influence anything... So let me tell&nbsp;you on how many systems and different browsers I have been testing (suffering) OneNote online for the past 9months:<br />
Windows 8 - Google Chrome and FireFox&nbsp;<br />
Ubuntu linux - Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox (and both incognite and inPrivate browsing modes)</p>
<p>Windows 10 - Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox, Microsoft Edge (oh yes this one is no better)<br />
Android phone app - much faster and actually the only usable option due to caching!<br />
</p>
<p>On top of it I use various ISPs: at home, at work or some public wifis<br />
Except Android it is always the same without any noticable difference in any of the configs!<br />
<br />
In my OneNote I have one section which I named Journal and loading of anything in it became super slow. I measured it and opening any&nbsp;page takes 25-60seconds! It is strange that other top level sections are much faster and the page in these load in around 3-5seconds&nbsp;(10times
 faster but still pretty bad IMHO). I believe something either got corrupted in that Journal section or there is a problem in an&nbsp;algorithm which makes sections with more then 200 pages unusable. Can that be a case? The other faster sections have less pages.<br />
<br />
I just tested the speed of google drive and must tell you that loading of folder contents or opening any document is noticably faster.&nbsp;Allright, so one would say google has just faster servers or better server side scripts. That would make sense, BUT tell me
 why opening&nbsp;of complex emails in outlook.com full of pictures and formatting can be almost instantenous! Even Word online is noticably faster then&nbsp;OneNote online and opening documents takes 1-2seconds. I suggest you to take a look at it and find the bottleneck,
 otherwise it seems&nbsp;you deliberately force people to use anything else but OneNote online... I will now find a way to export all my OneNote data and move it&nbsp;to google drive. Good bye OneNote...</p>

            UPDATE: I am actually now using EverNote. I gotta say that's how it should be! The client is comparable to OneNote, but the web interface is lightning fast! Now it finally looks like I am actually displaying little notes and not downloading megabytes of
 whatever OneNote probably does :) Opening of notes takes under one second! And I can now finally copy a link to a specific note which is not possible in OneNote. Microsoft you might want to check how it is done and just copy it. Please ;)

            <p>I have been using four different note taking options on various Chromebooks and they are all very usable - except OneNote. I really like the look of OneNote but is has to be about the slowest web application I have ever used. It takes seconds for a note
 to pop up and it has no offline ability on Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a plan to speed up the web version of OneNote or is this really just meant to only be used as the full Windows application? It is unfortunate because we are trying to standardize the note taking software at the school district across all devices
 so the web based version would need to run considerably faster to be a viable option. (We would need to use Chrome since that is the one web browser this can be used on all student devices - Chrome OS, iOS, Android, Ubuntu, Windows and OS X.)</p>

<h2>            nokia 6300 - Page freezes on push to talk&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been having problems with the above phone for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, everytime I turn it on, it transfers itself to what I <em>think</em> is the 'Push-to-Talk' contact add screen (I never bothered using this facility on my phone). After that it's frozen on that screen and pushing the menu buttons - 'Options', 'Mark'
 &amp; 'Exit' - does nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can <em>sometimes</em> kickstart the phone back into life by mashing the buttons, however this is temporary and within a couple of minutes it returns to the push-to-talk screen again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This basically means that I can't make any calls or send any texts (the only two things I really use the phone for). I can still receive calls as when someone rings it kind of overides this screen but can't read any texts since I obviously can't get to my
 inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took this to a Nokia Care Centre when it first started and they told me it was a software issue and updated it for me. However this hasn't worked. I've also just tried myself a couple of times to reinstall the most up-to-date software, and whilst it says
 it's completed, there are still files on my phone (photos etc) that I thought would have been deleted had the update worked correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a look for similar problems on here and saw a few suggestions that it might be a sim card problem, however I don't think it can be this since I replaced my o2 sim with a T-Mobile contract over the weekend and the problem is still persisting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine, this is quite frustrating. I've called Nokia Care but they put me on hold then cut me off and since as I'm not exactly a whizzkid when it comes to technical issues I thought I'd throw it out here in the vain help that someone
 might be able to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan</p>

On my ASUS laptop I got rid of&nbsp;same notification&nbsp;"insider preview build setting needs attention" by doing several clean boots.

            Here I go again, I was reluctant to install this latest update because I had to reinstall Windows 10 along with everything else on my Desktop. &nbsp;I need to know something, My graphics are coming up white again with no way to know what you are clicking on.
 In other words, is it possible that these updates are not compatible with the graphics card that is in my system? &nbsp;I can not read anything when I click on the Start Menu and my Apps come up. Settings, Etc. &nbsp; Can I back out of this new build without having
 to start from scratch again? &nbsp;I still have the backup of my files and other stuff, up until the build download from last night. Please give me some sort of idea on how to fix this problem. &nbsp;Thanks, Mitch

</p><p>the thing is , the message&nbsp;reads: INSIDER PREVIEW BUILD settings, not:&nbsp;SECURITY settings.&nbsp; Somehow the settings are apparently messed up, but I do not experience much difference in the functioning, apart from maybe more hang-ups, that disappear when I reboot.
 This message just keeps coming up very frequently.&nbsp; The settings of my account seem ok, also insiders track is still fast, and not greyed out or so. So what is the setting that needs attention??? (a Little later:) in the meantime build 14955 has arrived and
 is installed. So I am wondering if anything is changed since this upgrade. I will keep you informed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>( next day)</p>
<p>The message still keeps coming up , every couple of hours or so, so the new build brought no change in this respect. What is going on ????</p>

<h2>            N82 Text Problems</h2>
                    Please.. can anyone help me turn off those damned "suggestions" for letters the phone gives me when I want to enter a text?<br />
<br />
When I press "A" I want an "A" and not "AND" or another suggestion, I want a plain A! How can I make my phone understand this?<br />
<br />
I can't write a single thing on my phone because of this, I can't even write the names of my contacts...!<br />
<br />
This is very annoying and I am sorry if this has an easy solution - I have tried searching for help with the text but I am not a native english speaker so I might not be searching for the right terms..<br />
<br />
H..E..L..P.. !!

            Whilst you are in any feature that uses predictive text (such as writing an SMS message), the # key can be used to cycle through Caps lock, Caps off etc. This also switched the prediction on and off - look at the pencil logo in the top right next to the
 ABC indicator - if it has two lines under the tip of the pencil the prediction is switched on - just keep pressing the # key until you have the desired setting (Abc, ABC or abc for your 'Caps' mode) without the lines under the pencil and prediction will be
 off so you can type as normal.<br />
