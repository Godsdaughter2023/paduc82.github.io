<h2>            Size of MSN online games window got too small</h2>
                    <p>I have played MSN online games for years but suddenly the play window has got too small to sensibly play the games.&nbsp; The rest of the site is normal - it's just when I click the Play On Line button.&nbsp; How do I rectify this?</p>

    <title>Firewall rule doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> armin zingler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Firewall rule doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my default setting for the firewall is to block all traffic. Exceptions are added if necessary. This strategy will not be changed for there is no clarity regarding all the traffic going on. For instance, two exceptions enable DNS and DHCP. This works well.
 Another one is svchost, service="Cryptographic services" (CryptSvc). The latter does
<em>not</em> work. This means, the firewall still blocks these packets. I have verified my rule multiple times, even removed it and added it again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the normal firewall log file isn't speaking enough, I have enabled logging of dropped packets in the event log via group policies. I wrote a little program for live observation of these log entries. Thereby, I am able to lookup the services from the logged
 process ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f399ea64-c0f3-4d3c-b8bc-55f1ecb193c9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f399ea64-c0f3-4d3c-b8bc-55f1ecb193c9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The firewall rule exactly matches this case. Consequently, the packet should not be blocked. The rule is: Allow, Outgoing, program=svchost, service=CryptSvc, all profiles, all local ports, all IPs, protocol TCP, remote ports 80 and 443.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is: Why does the firewall block packets even if a rule allows them? (There is no other rule denying it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 x64 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I've tried method 2 but it hasn't fixed the problem.&nbsp; When I re-add the account it works fine but if I run 'repair account' I get an 'error connecting to network' message.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that even in emails I can send (replies to received mail) some characters, for example the apostrophe, are corrupted.</p>

<p>Hi, I installed Windows 7 64-bit on my MacBook Pro via BootCamp.&nbsp; I used PCmover to transfer stuff from my Parallels virtual machine.&nbsp; After a while, a BootCamp driver install, and a bunch of other stuff, everything worked fine, except there was one item
 in the trash on the Mac side that I couldn't delete.&nbsp; I repaired the disk with Disk Utility and the Paragon NTFS driver.&nbsp; It deleted the file and "repaired" a lot of other things that I didn't know were broken.&nbsp; Windows started fine, but windows update, windows
 troubleshooter, installing a printer, and several other things failed.&nbsp; I ran chkdsk with only fix filesystem errors selected, It began fixing a few things, then it started doing something really slow and I forced shutdown.&nbsp; I restarted into Windows again,
 skipping the chkdsk that had already been scheduled, and I got a black screen with a movable mouse.&nbsp; I couldn't do anything past that.&nbsp; Then, I ran startup repair, which ran chkdsk and added the recovery console to the startup items.&nbsp; Chkdsk apparently did
 a lot of stuff, but it didn't help.&nbsp; I restarted into safe mode and I still got the black screen with the mouse.&nbsp; I have Windows backed up onto my Time Machine through Mac in this state, but I really don't want to reinstall Windows, as it's a pain in the butt
 to get all your files, settings, programs, etc. back into their appropriate places.&nbsp; If somebody could help me out with this problem, I would be so happy.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for responding to my post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already tried the system restore, but it said there were no restore points. It must be wrong, because I personally made sure it was creating these restore points and when Windows was still working (right before the<strong> Final and Fatal Restart</strong>
 ) I checked and there were several restore points.</p>
<p>As for the sfc scan, I did what you said, but it told me there was already another system repair scheduled.&nbsp; I realized that it must have been referring to the chkdsk that I scheduled before the<strong> FaFR</strong> , then never completed before going to
 the startup recovery.&nbsp; I rebooted into safemode and let the scheduled chkdsk run all night long.&nbsp; I backed up to Time Machine again, and now I'm about to reboot and do the sfc scan.&nbsp; Wish me luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. Do ownership and permissions matter to this process?&nbsp; I set myself as the owner of everything and gave Everyone full access.&nbsp; If this does matter, would there be any way to lift the restrictions from the original preferences?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Brycey92,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s try these steps &amp; check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Method 1<br />
</strong><br />
If you have any external device connected to the computer, unplug them &amp; check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2<br />
</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>a. You may also run chkdsk from Windows Recovery Environment.<span>&nbsp;</span>Follow the steps in this link to boot into Windows Recovery Environment and open command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous
 state, programs and updates you installed are removed. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps from this link to boot into Windows Recovery Environment and open the command prompt. For more information, follow the section ‘<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>To
 open the System Recovery Options menu on your computer</span></a></strong>’ from this link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. In the command prompt window, type in the commands listed below i.e. (/f, /r , /i, /c).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the command prompt, type chkdsk or chkdsk C: followed by one or a combination of switches listed below<span>&nbsp;</span>and press
 Enter. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Type One of these Commands to Run Chkdsk:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>i.&nbsp;/f = The /f switch is the most common of the chkdsk switches. It tells chkdsk to try and fix any errors it finds.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>ii. /r = The /r switch tells chkdsk to attempt to recover any bad sectors of the hard drive if any are found. A bad sector is a spot on the hard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 drive that cannot hold saved data anymore. (See screenshot below)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>iii. /i = The /i switch tells chkdsk to perform a less detailed but faster disk check. (See screenshot below)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>iv.&nbsp;/c = The /c switch tells chkdsk to skip the checking of cycles within a folder structure which reduces the scan time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;Note:</span></strong><span> During the restart process, Windows checks the disk for errors, and
 then Windows starts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Brycey92,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you try using the Last known good configuration. It is a<span>Windows</span> startup option that uses the most recent system settings
 that worked correctly. Every time you turn your computer off and<span>Windows</span> shuts down successfully, important system settings are saved in the registry. So it starts<span>Windows</span> with the last registry and driver configuration that worked
 successfully.</span></span></p>

    <title>How can I remove duplicate e-mails in Windows Live Mail&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spalc967  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I remove duplicate e-mails in Windows Live Mail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows Live Mail receiving e-mail from a POP3 server. A few times over the past years I have had all of my e-mails re-download from the POP3 server creating duplicates in Windows Live Mail. Removing e-mails from the server is not an option for business
 reasons (I run a small business and need to be able to access previous e-mails from anywhere using my e-mail provider's webmail service in case of emergency). &nbsp;My account is listed only one time in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past I was able to remove duplicate e-mails within Windows Live Mail/Outlook Express easily. I can't figure out how to do it now. I currently have 3 copies of every e-mail I received before July 8th in Windows Live Mail and only one of e-mails received
 since then. How do I remove the two duplicates of every e-mail from before July 8th?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Live mail is version 2011 (Build 15.4.3555.0308).</p>

 goes wrong with a download, the protocol just starts again from the&nbsp;beginning, to make sure that every message is downloaded.
<br />
<br />
Apart from that, and this seems likely in your case, there will be maintenance carried out at the server every so often. This might mean that the flag on a message that says it's been downloaded is reset - so it gets downloaded again. This doesn't matter much
 if there are only a few days' worth of messages in the inbox, but if there are thousands of messages there, you have a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Because each downloaded message is stored as an individual file, it's not easy to determine whether any two messages are identical. They will have different file names and different
<em>Date created</em> and <em>Date modified, </em>while many other properties will be the same. But messages with the same
<em>Subject:</em>, <em>From:</em> and <em>To:</em> properties might well be different messages in the same conversation. It would take a reasonably complicated algorithm to determine whether two files in fact represented the same message.</p>

            <p>The message pops up but just ignore it.&nbsp; It will eventually go away.&nbsp; For some reason, the updates for the RT models are not coming across.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Store and swipe from the right side of the screen to open the Charms Bar menu and click on "App updates" and you will see that there are no updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, go to PC Settings after closing the Store app and go to "Update and Recovery" and tell it to "check for updates" under "Windows Update".&nbsp; You may find the machine continuously checking for updates and not finding anything - in fact, it will just keep
 running "checking for updates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent feedback on this and my RT is currently been running for hours and is still "checking for updates" and it is starting to appear that more people encountering this problem as well.&nbsp; It is possible that Microsoft shut off the updates for the RT models.</p>

<p>is your RT a 32 or 64 GB model and what is the available free space? If you are interested, we can try to get this resolved (or at least investigated) by opening and IT Support case (won't cost YOU anything..)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>theory is that these low space RT devices are choking on the amount of available updates..

            <p>Space wise, the machine has plenty. &nbsp;In fact, I did notice that Windows Defender "did" update in the background. &nbsp;It is the main system updater that is either not finding anything on the server, server is stalled out, or maybe, Microsoft pulled the plug
 on the system updates for the RT models.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent feedback via the Windows Insider Feedback Hub because Build 14986 had also stalled out for about 45 minutes and then suddenly started to download on my Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had also checked the update history and everything had installed in the past with no issue. &nbsp;In fact, I have no problems with the machine whatsoever other than Windows Update does not grab onto anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to wait to see if there is any action from the feedback I gave. &nbsp;I could simply be network congestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use the RT anymore and just play around with it mostly. &nbsp;In fact, according to the update history, the last time I used the machine was May 9th of this year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's wait and see. &nbsp;Also, I just read that Microsoft is looking into getting Windows 10 onto ARM computers. &nbsp;I don't think that will be a future for the RT models but they did prove that the ARM class processor is a bit better than expected. &nbsp;In fact, it
 was proven on a Snapdragon equipped smartphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey, who knows. &nbsp;Maybe my Raspberry PI 3 will get an "upgrade"!</p>

 app and launch Store myself and search the word weather, and click on weather in the suggestions, It gives me a whole bunch of weather apps.&nbsp; One of them is "The Weather App" that we are talking about, and none of them will take me to their page at the Store.&nbsp;
 I click on any and get a highlight box around it but nothing happens.&nbsp; It is also only a single row of apps displayed rather than the usual two stacked horizontal rows.&nbsp; Really strange.&nbsp; I hope they fix it because during this Winter Storm in Michigan, I have
 no idea what to do without the app.&nbsp; I might even have to go outside.&nbsp; :)

            <p>The weather app on the machine is the "MSN weather app" and it is already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Store app and slide from the ride side of the screen and click on "Settings" and then select "App updates".&nbsp; You will find that there is no update for it.&nbsp; That message will vanish eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that Windows Defender and the Store apps "will" update but the main system updates will not come across for the RT models.&nbsp; All it does is "Checking for updates..." and will stay that way forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, nothing is wrong with the weather app, just a glitch in the app updater for that particular app.&nbsp; On mine, it showed that message about five times and then quite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I am considering that the RT is now "unsecure" and will no longer be using mine.&nbsp; I think Microsoft pulled the plug on the main updates for I attempted to run updates on it again today and the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to order the Asus T102 128GB model to replace the RT as a backup machine and give away the RCA tablets that I had just gotten (those are functional junk, don't waste any money on something like those0.&nbsp; My RT will be permanently stored in its box
 as a collector item and will no longer be used.</p>

            <p>Interesting.&nbsp; Thanks for pointing out my name error.&nbsp; I got it from simply looking at the loading screen.&nbsp; Microsoft should make them change it to something else.&nbsp; Looks the same as MSN's, like this...</p>

<p>
</p><p>I figure if the app update communication is buggy, then the app definitely has something wrong, whether we call it the updater or not.&nbsp; It isn't supposed to be having the update banner across it that we have to click away four times or so.&nbsp; I think it's
 also possible that whatever server Weather contacts about updates, could be telling the app there really is an update.&nbsp; And there really might be.&nbsp; (Of course there might not) But it's possible the mistake is that Microsoft Store doesn't know about, or have
 the update available through human or tech error.&nbsp; So I conclude&nbsp;we actually don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Updates seem to be working great for me, if you're talking about Windows Update in the Control Panels.&nbsp; It doesn't ever get stuck on "Checking for updates."&nbsp;

</p><p>I ran Windows Update last night and in less than two minutes it returned saying "No updates available" since I was&nbsp;up to date.&nbsp; Ran it again a few minutes ago and it gave me a new Definition for Defender pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Very curious to know if you can get these above updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface RTs remain my go to machines for reliability, now that Microsoft has made it so much more secure over the past year.&nbsp; Also because they are small and lightweight and come with Office.&nbsp; Really enjoying it, except I feel like my updates from Dec
 9 messed up Weather and Skype since that is about when they quit working properly.&nbsp; Skype will no longer let me send&nbsp;a video message or a file.&nbsp; All else is good.&nbsp; I contacted Skype support last night and they said a new version of Skype&nbsp;for Surface RT will
 be out next year.&nbsp; The way my life goes, I have to say "Hurray for Surface RT!!"</p>

            <p>In regards to the weather app; you already have it installed and do not try to remove or re-install it.&nbsp; Like on mine, that message vanished eventually on its own and is simply a glitch.&nbsp; The weather app itself should display the current weather and forecast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RT models where a good concept and looks like there will be a future for ARM based devices but most likely that future will not include the Surface RT and Surface 2.&nbsp; The later ARM processors will be supported with what I have been seeing on the future
 of "Windows 10" and that is "one operating system, on all devices".&nbsp; The RT models are an experiment to prove that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can look at them now as what I call a "canned system" to where you rely on what is on it for use.&nbsp; The office suite is updated to maintain file compatibility with Office 365 and it will also open ODF formats as well (Open Document Format) for which is
 what LibreOffice/OpenOffice uses and is a standard, world wide format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, since the main system updates will not come across, that means that Adobe Flashmedia Player will not be updated and eventually, web media will not play and also generates a security risk as well.&nbsp; The RT models cannot get a virus but they can
 transport one and the same goes with Linux machines as well (you can add macOS and iOS in that picture as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RT is a great little machine and if you get a working copy of one, they could last forever.&nbsp; Mine works perfect with the exception that the main system updates decided to take a vacation.&nbsp; In appearance, it is acting like the server is turned on but
 nothing is on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Asus T102 will be here tomorrow and it will be its replacement and I have Office 365 and will download my subscription onto it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, do not do anything and just ignore that message.&nbsp; There is nothing really wrong.&nbsp; Mine displayed the same thing and the message eventually went away on its own.</p>

            <p>Yeah huh James!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be fun or helpful to you to have your RT working properly as a backup device to use or play with, even though you're switching to Asus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When security things were bad for me on my first RT a couple years ago, some of my hacks forced me to wipe and start over, as&nbsp; Microsoft&nbsp; instructed me.&nbsp; If you're Surface RT is registered, go to this link below, and when you click "sign in" in the upper
 right, and get signed in, it pulls up your serial number so you don't have to get out the magnifying glass.&nbsp; Then set your particulars and download to USB flash drive as the instructions advise.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage</a></p>
<p><br />
Of course, before you wipe and reset, drag any data you want to keep to USB backup drive since whole drive will get formatted, if you choose the proper settings.&nbsp; Once backup is complete, then these instructions below should get you through the complete wipe
 and reset process.&nbsp; Haven't done it for a while, but every time there is an option to completely wipe and get rid of all data, choose that option.&nbsp; Somewhere it should let you choose to format and partition your SSD.&nbsp; If you decide to try this and have trouble
 let us know.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you know, you really should be getting system updates and I figure this should fix what is wrong.&nbsp; I'm also having success getting my Flash security updates and so forth as you brought up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Barb is still able to open that ticket she mentioned, I wonder if she meant the ticket for James' eternal "checking for updates" problem, or for the original question of Artcyn's&nbsp; Weather app update problem.&nbsp; I don't want the update banner hanging around
 and I suppose Artycyn doesn't either.&nbsp; Mine isn't going away until I click it four times and I find&nbsp;it annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If James is interested, my last security update for Flash was 11/9/2016, here below is how my update history looks more recently...</p>

            <p>In my case, I don't really care about the machine anymore but I am hearing from others in my area of slow and sluggish Internet connections with some sites (shopping) and I think that my "never ending update search" will probably come to an end after the
 holidays.&nbsp; Even with fiber optic lines, they can still get plugged up with mass net traffic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my updates with the exception of Windows Defender and the Metro UI apps (Store apps) are dated 5/9/2016 for which was the last time I ran the machine.&nbsp; The system updates may not catch but Windows Defender and the Metro UI apps "DO" update and I watched
 a couple of them do that when I launched the Store and checked for app updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My particular problem is not critical and the machine is not going to be 'thrown away'.&nbsp; It is going to sit in its bag until sometime mid January when I will run it again and chances are, it update without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the updates my machine ever received where all "successful".&nbsp; No failures and in fact, the only time I ever had a problem with it was during the first five months of use with a Bluetooth/WiFi problem which was fixed with two firmware updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Asus will probably end up being a lemon (with a pen) but who knows.&nbsp; I have about fifteen computers and it won't be that I will be lacking in capabilities.&nbsp; In fact, I am on a Mac mini right now which I wiped out and put LinuxMint 18 on it and is now
 working twice as fast as it did with that flaky, flowerpot macOS system it had (it was going slow and the drive was only half full).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I will also say that Microsoft's servers are a total disaster!&nbsp; Right now, people are having issues in downloading Microsoft Office 365 and other software from their online store (Download Center) and this has always been a repeat problem with them.&nbsp;
 They want to do 'cloud' computing and they can't handle it.&nbsp; Windows Update is only one part of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to find a solution on "bandwidth" even though the servers themselves can handle the load; the phone lines can't.</p>

            <p>@@@ UPDATE @@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that the RT "was" updating but not showing on the panel. &nbsp;After running for four days straight, I did a manual shut down and on the shut down panel, it showed "Update and Restart".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was a corrupted log file (wasn't) and did a Disk Cleanup and only half the storage is used up and it had plenty of space. &nbsp;It was just the fact that it wasn't ran for several months and it had a whole slew of updates to grab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Store" and Windows Defender both updating instantly; I knew something was wrong and it was not local.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it will 'retire' updated. &nbsp;My Asus is out for delivery right now and will have a new backup machine.</p>

    <title>After using a third party partition manager program to expand my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcdc57  say:</h3>
<h2>            After using a third party partition manager program to expand my Windows 8 partition, the Windows 8 system boot to a black screen, and drive letter for Windows 8 partition changed</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title : Windows 8 Problems</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have both Windows 7 (32-bit) and Windows 8 (64-bit) installed in a dual boot. I tried expanding the Windows 8 partition with a third-party partition manager. Afterwards, I restarted after being told so.
<br />
<br />
Later the first thing I saw was that the lock screen picture is replaced by a blue color. The user pictures are also missing. After logging in, it took a long time for windows to prepare everything, and I end up stuck in a black screen with the mouse pointer.<br />
<br />
I entered Safe Mode and found out that the drive letter for Windows 8 was changed (C:=Windows 7; D:=recovery partition; E:=Windows 8, new drive letter; F:=Windows 8, old drive letter) I tried changing the drive letter, but it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
The Windows 7 partition works fine (it is what I am currently using to post this problem), and I can access data from the Windows 8 partition. I tried different repair methods to no avail (such as chkdsk and sfc /scannow).<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help me with this? Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<h2>            In Game Chat Text Not Visible To Others On Windows 10 Minecraft Lifeboat Network</h2>
                    <p>Hello Forum Community, </p><p>It seems my in game chat text is not visible to other players when playing Minecraft (For Windows 10) on the lifeboat network. I have checked with Microsoft support that the chat filter is not blocking my text. They reported that my account was 'healthy' and without restriction and have subsequently directed me here to this forum for additional support to hopefully solve the issue. </p><p><br />Chat always used to work fine on the Lifeboat Network, but now it seems that other players in-game cannot see what I type in chat. It is problematic at best for me to verify this on my end, and my text does seem to appear in my chat feed, just not other players. Friends have also asked me why the cannot see my chat text in-game, so I can only assume it is not working as expected.</p><p><br />Any help for this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>{o_o}</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Microsoft Windows and Windows-compatible software rely on a collection of .dll files, also called Dynamic Link Library files. These files contain instructions that all Windows
 components can use to carry out requested actions. Iertutil.dll is a file designed to work specifically with Microsoft Internet Explorer 7. If this file has been accidentally deleted or corrupted, you may notice error messages, experience problems with Windows.
<br />

    <title>Can I use Windows 7 Pro Key to upgrade my Windows 10 Home to Pro&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I use Windows 7 Pro Key to upgrade my Windows 10 Home to Pro&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought a new laptop with Windows 10 Home Edition. However, I have an unused Windows 7 Professional&nbsp;Key that I haven't used yet, and I was wondering if I could use that to upgrade my Windows 10 to Pro. Just to clarify, this is not talking about a
 clean installation of Windows 10 and using the key to activate it, this is asking if you can use the Windows 7 Pro key to change my existing Windows 10 Home product key and upgrade.

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur in any particular application?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
3. Are you using wired or wireless keyboard?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to use on screen keyboard and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Type without using the keyboard (On-Screen Keyboard)<br />

<p>yes you can watch netflix on both devices at the same time using the same netflix account. yes I do believe you do need xbox live in order to use netflix since thats the only way to go online. he wont be able to play your games if they are digital copys
 cause they are under your xbox live account.</p>

            Hi  Dark_Shadow10 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />netsh int ip reset
<br />
<br />Hit Enter 
<br />Exit the prompt then restart
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Network adapters
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If not, press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.
<br />
<br />also try:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom then click Network reset.
<br />
<br />Disable Energy Efficient Ethernet in "Client for Microsoft Networks"
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager, expand Network Adapters, right-click the adapter &gt; Properties &gt; Power Management, and then clear the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power check box.
<br />
<br />If you don't have that option, see other ways to disable it:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2013/10/22/do-you-have-a-sleepy-nic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/20...</a>
<br />
<br />If the network connection is slow or lagging, check if Windows 10 is downloading Windows Update or the Microsoft Store is downloading updates. These can sometimes affect the performance your network connection.
<br />
<br />If you have a VPN enabled, disable it.
<br />
<br />Disable the Windows Firewall then try connecting.
<br />
<br />If the connection is slow, remove any special bundled software that came with the motherboard.

    <title>Start Menu Font Too Small - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom kunzo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Menu Font Too Small</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>There are two things that I hope Microsoft will rectify.</p>
<p>Firstly, it's he Start Menu font. </p>
<p>When I right click on the Start button, a menu is shown but the font is way too small so that even with my reading glasses on, I still find it difficult to read the texts.</p>
<p>I hope that Microsoft will make the texts in this area customisable.</p>
<p>Perhaps fonts in other areas having the same problem should be looked at too.</p>
<p>Secondly, the system tray clock is still the same old, same old.</p>
<p>I think that it is just better than not having a system tray clock.</p>
<p>I wonder why Microsoft still treat this as a non issue as it is one of the greatest weak spot in its operating system.</p>
<p>I have downloaded a taskbar add-on clock from Firefox 41.0.1 and it's exactly the type that should be in the system tray of Windows 10.</p>
<p>The software is called Simple Timer which, besides being a timer, is also a digital clock **** calendar.</p>
<p>I think that Microsoft should develop a system tray digital clock with calendar similar to it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Comparatively, start menu icons are smaller than the other icons or texts within the Start screen.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Ex:</strong><span> Items on the right side of the Start menu as compared to the ones on the left.</span></span></span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type settings in the search box on taskbar, and select the same.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on System.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Now there's a slider on this page that you can use to change the size of text, apps and other items.</span></p>

<li>Go to <strong>Start</strong> , enter the phrase <strong>Windows Feedback</strong>, then select Windows Feedback.</li><li>See if someone else has given similar feedback by entering the topic, such as Microsoft Music.</li><li>If you find similar feedback, select it, add any details, and then select <strong>
Me too.</strong></li><li>To narrow your search to a specific category, pick the category that most closely matches your feedback (so it gets to the right people quickly). For example, for feedback about the Music app, select Apps &gt; Music.</li><li>If you don’t find any similar feedback, select <strong>New feedback</strong>, and choose a topic from
<strong>Select a category</strong> and then Select a subcategory. </li><li>Enter your feedback (the more details the better!), add a screenshot if you can, and you're done.</li></ol>

            <p>Suggesting to&nbsp; change the Screen resolution is not a fix, just a very poor workaround for the lack of this feature in Windows 10.</p>
<p>It's a shame that MS does not even recognize it as a desperately needed feature.</p>
<p>Gosh...</p>

<h2>            HP Laptop &#34;Plugged in, not Charging&#34; problem.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an HP laptop (Pavilion Dv5-2134us), and whenever I plug it in, it turns on, but it does not charge. The battery level is at 0 percent. I have tried uninstalling the Compliant Control Method Battery; that does not work. I tested the battery,
 and it passed the test. I have replaced the battery for this computer in the past because I got an alert that it no longer works. I replaced it, and replacing the battery is not the problem because I am not receiving an alert to replace the battery. I contacted
 Microsoft Answer Desk about this problem, and they told me that my charger could be the problem. But I don't want to go to the store, purchase a charger, and discover that that wasn't the problem. I want to know how I can fix the problem myself&nbsp;(If I can)
 so my battery can charge. Yes, it works when it's plugged in on AC, but that makes me believe that the charger isn't the problem. If you can help me with my problem, I would appreciate it. My computer runs Windows 7 x64.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Thanks a lot.</p>
