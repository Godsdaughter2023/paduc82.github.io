<h2>            Freeze on save in Skyrim and can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t even get past the loading screen in GTA V</h2>
                    
<p>As for Skyrim, it doesn't matter if it's a manual or auto save, the game just freezes. If it doesn't freeze right away during the save it will freeze in the few seconds after it saved. I can play it just fine aside from that... but it's not worth much if
 I can't save my progress. I got the game only three days ago and played nearly all day yesterday without any problems. But not even an hour in today it just froze during the loading screen (the one you get when you go into a house) and I had to turn my xbox
 off. After googling around for what might be causing the freezes I've turned off the auto save (apparently that was a known problem) and cleared the game and system cache a couple of times, cleaned the disk and installed and reinstalled the game onto my hard
 drive but all to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the first time I played the game and was asked to download the update it gave me this error code:&nbsp;40A3-0000-D080-0200-D000-0185, kept doing that until I changed the storage device, does anybody know what that code means because I haven't been able
 to find anything about it aside from that the last few numbers apparently meant something was wrong with the storage device...?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for GTA V, I just can't play it. It'll freeze in the loading screen, I've tried absolutely everything I could find to fix it so I've kind of given up hope for that, but who knows one of you knows some innovative way to fix it anyway? (This started when
 I wanted to replay a mission, I've deleted everything and just restarted the entire game but that didn't work either)</p>
<p>Anybody, help? Please?</p>

<p>If GTA V is indeed downloaded from the marketplace and not a disc, try this.</p>
<p>Delete GTA V and clear your cache 3 times.</p>
<p>Restart your console.</p>
<p>Download 16 GB of demos (this is how big GTA V will be in the end)</p>
<p>Once those have finished download all the GTA V files from your download history (GTA V, Installation Packs 1-4)</p>
<p>After you've done that, feel free to delete the demos.</p>
<p>This worked for me, hopefully it works for you too!</p>

<p>Neither is from the marketplace and both are installed onto the console. Both have also been deleted at least once and reinstalled, caches have been cleared in both games, both the game and system ones. I'll try what you said though. Thanks for replying!</p>
<p>Also for Skyrim it works fine with just one save now, but seeing as apparently the auto save/multiple saves thing seemed to be a known problem I don't suppose anybody found out a way to fix it yet...?</p>

<h2>            What is the best email client for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Sorry about this question because I know it is a matter of opinion -- BUT I AM SO CONFUSED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did the free upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 -- and I must congratulate Microsoft on that upgrade.&nbsp; It only took a few hours and&nbsp;it went smoothly, perfectly and everything was intact at the end of the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to use the latest compatible software, so I immediately tried to upgrade to the new Windows 10 mail app -- and that DID NOT go smoothly (what a mess I created).&nbsp; Anyway, I managed to back it out -- and as my Windows Live Mail (WLM) client from Windows
 7 was still intact, after quite a few gyrations, I got all of my mail back into my WLM client (had lost a bunch in the Windows 10 Mail app conversion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am back searching for the best email client to use with Windows 10.&nbsp; I know there is:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;Outlook.com (is that a web-based / browser interface)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Outlook Express (not sure that is still around)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Live Mail (what I was using, but how much longer is that going to be around)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 10 Mail app (good reviews in MS Community, bad reviews elsewhere)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Outlook Office (this isn't even a mail client, is it)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Lots of 3rd party mail clients</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using WLM for the past 4 years, ever since I purchased my Windows 7 machine, so I have lots of archival mail and lots of folders -- and my preference/desire is to retain all of my old emails or have immediate access to them (preferably migrate
 everything to the new mail client on Windows 10)..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will mention that I do have a gmail account that I access through&nbsp;a Chrome browser, although I still prefer IE -- and don't have enough experience with Edge to make an informed opinion yet, but my experience with Edge has not been the best (i.e. missing
 a lot of IE features that I like).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this may not be the best place to post this question since it is an email question, but there are several email forums and I would expect all biased towards their email client, so I didn't feel I would get an unbiased response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I would like some help in sorting out all of the various options and help me pick one that will serve me for the next few years.</p>
<p>

            <p>Team ZigZag-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to be late in getting back to you. &nbsp;I am/was all set to take your advise, but when I look at a lot of the conversations involving WLM, I get very worried. &nbsp;In my case, WLM (2012) was running very nicely (or so I thought) after my Windows 7 to Windows
 10 upgrade. &nbsp;The upgrade went perfectly and the WLM client on my machine survived very nicely and was working perfectly (or so I thought until yesterday and last night).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I found about 20 bad emails in my WLM Inbox that came back with a "Message cannot be found" error when I clicked on the email entry. &nbsp;The problem associated with that is that "every one" of the "Message cannot be found" emails had already been
 received by me and I had either deleted them (in Deleted folder) or had filed them in one of my other Mail folders ("all 20 of them"). &nbsp;My machine had been re-started overnight (part of the Windows auto-fix downloades, I guess) -- so that may have had something
 to do with it, but too early to tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the WLM problem, I am seeing a lot of comments about WLM not installing or working on Windows 10 and most disturbing is a note that Microsoft sent out saying that they were going to be making some changes shortly that would fix it so the WLM will
 no longer run in Windows 10 -- and suggested that people begin moving their email to the new Windows 10 Mail app. &nbsp;This makes me very nervous. &nbsp;I could probably handle the changes, but I have a new Christmas present laptop for my wife sitting in a corner waiting
 for resolution of this issue -- and she would not do well with problems like this (like having to convert to a new Mail client). &nbsp;I don't know if the issue is different if you did a Windows 10 upgrade (no new WLM installs) versus installing WLM on a new system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your have any other comments or insights, I would appreciate it. &nbsp;I am also going to research and probably open up another question on the WLM community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the detailed response and help. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ron in round rock</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to your following comment:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Since WLM is still supported and since you have data in it I would stay with WLM and when your account is moved to Preview upgrade WLM and configure it for IMAP</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;I didn't understand the Preview upgrade WLM reference -- I don't know what that is -- don't recall seeing it mentioned elsewhere (by Microsoft).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) &nbsp;OK, I have been looking and trying to understand this IMAP and POP3 business -- and I believe I have a pretty good high level understanding of the differences between the two:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- POP3 - email deleted from the server after being read by the WLM client (either immediately or after some delay, ours being set for 15 days)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- IMAP - email left on the server and the folder structure on the server being duplicated on the client (with folder management being performed on the server)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have never used IMAP, I would have a learning curve, like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- the email is also downloaded to the client, isn't it, or is it, or is it optional</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;(sorry, downloading doesn't make sense since the advertised benefit is email on your smartphone)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- can email be retained on the client while being deleted on the server</p>
<p>&nbsp;- OR is there a way email (and folders) can be retained on the client while being deleted on the server</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (a way to handle my archival problem/issue/needs)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- the performance of direct access of email on the server via a browser (as Webmail) is absolutely awful</p>
<p>&nbsp; (so would the performance improve if the email was accessed via an IMAP interface</p>
<p>&nbsp;- it looks like you can have two clients accessing the server at the same time</p>
<p>&nbsp;- is the server or the client(s) equal or is the server the master</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (i.e. if email is deleted on the client (or clients), is it also deleted on the server</p>
<p>&nbsp;- are you stuck with keeping the email on the server forever (so to speak)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (or can it be somehow archived (and accessed) in the client)</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I won't keep going -- and I guess most of these questions can easily be answered, particularly if I would just configure the client via a IMAP interface/protocol, but if I do that, am I at risk of losing (or leaving in limbo) current email while playing
 around with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Side Note: &nbsp;Yes, when I tried using/configuring the Windows 10 Mail app, it got configured as IMAP and I ended up with over 700 emails in the Windows 10 Mail app Inbox -- something I am referring to as a big mess, since I didn't know what I was getting
 into at the time - and I immediately deleted it all and went back to WLM -- so I have no real experience with IMAP.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Zigzag, back to your original question, since I have used it for 4 years (since getting Windows 7 machines) I would prefer to keep using WLM on Windows 10 -- but the comments of WLM on Windows 10 is not particularly good AND/OR if I have to switch to
 IMAP, I might as well try to figure out if WLM is what to use since I would be switching to a new email client (as far as I can see) since the operations would be completely different.</p>

            <p>OK, I am finally getting it, I think. &nbsp;It seems simple now (well, sort-of) -- and I don't know why this couldn't have been made simpler in one article explaining all of the differences between these different email support apps. &nbsp;Yes, there are many comparison
 articles, but none of them are really, really thorough. &nbsp;So let me see if I really got it as I think I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I have read many articles AND ONLY ONE mentioned that you have to get a new email address for some of these services -- like Outlook.com. &nbsp;Maybe that is so obvious that nobody thought it necessary to mention it, but it has really slowed down
 my understanding of the various email services (i.e. Outlook.com being referred to as an email client really threw me off).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook - this appears to be a Microsoft Office product designed to be used with Microsoft mail servers, mainly in business areas and applications and not much use to home users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com - is a Web-based email product (the Hotmail follow-on/upgrade/etc) which you have to get a new email address for (although it looks like it supports several MS email domains) similar to Gmail or yahoo mail, and was originally designed (at least
 one place I read) to compete with Google's Gmail -- and is very similar in operation to Gmail (yeah, I do have a Gmail account) -- and I should have picked up its operation when it was referred to as the Hotmail follow-on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WLM - is an email client that can be used "with any" email service provider, like Gmail, Outlook.com or in my case a Time Warner Cable (TWC) ISP email account. &nbsp;I suppose it is very similar to Thunderbird, eM Client Pegasus and a couple of dozen others.
 &nbsp;Most support POP and IMAP interfaces, as do most of the email service providers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is the above fairly close to what is going on. &nbsp;I think I mentioned that this is really a search for email support for my wife when we get her new Windows 10 laptop operational (and retire the Windows 7 laptop). &nbsp;So guess my next step (actually 2 steps)
 is:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;Get my wife to decide what email service will work for her (she is adamantly against changing her email address)</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;Do some more research on the POP and IMAP interfaces</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I see Outlook.com (for instance, as I mentioned above) referred to as an email client -- and is the main source of most of my confusion. &nbsp;It really isn't a client, is it -- or the fact that it is actually the front end of the outlook.com back
 end makes it an app that people refer to it as a client. &nbsp;[To me, a client is an app that runs locally in/on your computer and access email service providers -- whereas I consider providers accessed via a browser as Webmail interfaces.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I access my TWC email account via one of my browsers, it is IMPOSSIBLY SLOW AND FEATURLESS -- making it impossible to be used in a Webmail mode. &nbsp;OK, I won't get started on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some other comments and opinions, but I have gone on too long here. &nbsp;Still hoping for some feedback to see/know if I am on the right track.</p>

            <p>I'm also trying to figure out the best desktop email client to use that will be just as comparable as Vista Windows Mail (replaced OE, and&nbsp;does&nbsp;work in Windows 7 &amp; 8 if you know how to enable it).&nbsp; I've been using it since I upgraded to Windows 7&nbsp;in late
 2009.&nbsp; I hated Windows Live Mail as it corrupted many of my folders and emails.&nbsp; It is so aggravating that as popular as OE and Windows Mail were, Microsoft feels the need to provide a less than adequate email client with each new OS upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;And why do they
 always have to change the file extension for emails?&nbsp; With OE is was .dbx, Windows Mail is .eml, and Outlook is .msg so you can't open&nbsp;or import these&nbsp;emails between programs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had installed Windows 10, for one day, when it was first released and when I couldn't figure out how to get Vista's Windows Mail to work (an article I found said all I had to do was copy the Msidcrl30.dll from Windows 7 to the system 32 folder), I restored
 Windows 7.&nbsp; After 5 months,&nbsp;I was hoping that by now someone would have found a way to get Vista's Windows Mail to work; unfortunately, I've yet to find anything new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want my emails being stored on the web; I want them downloaded to my hard drive, and I want to be able to compose an email without using a web based program (Outlook.com).&nbsp; It was no big deal to me when Microsoft did away with Hotmail, and went to
 Outlook.com and POP3 &amp; SMTP, I just set up my Hotmail account using the POP3 &amp; SMTP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess Microsoft Office Outlook is my only option.&nbsp; I will not use anything relating to Google, and I tried Thunderbird once and didn't like it.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to thank everybody for responding - your comments have helped. &nbsp;I have made a decision on my wife's email. &nbsp;It was enough of a challenge to get her moved from Windows 7 to Windows 10 that I am going to have to stick with the WLM 2012 with her
 new computer, for now. &nbsp;It was the only way to easily retain all of her emails, left intact with the same folder structure and operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me, I am still on the fence. &nbsp;As I understand more about what is going on, I think I may want to do some experimenting with the IMAP protocol-configured mail program (I have never used an IMAP mail program). &nbsp;If anything, from my research, it seems that
 Microsoft's Outlook is one of the best around. &nbsp;It appears similar to WLM in appearance and operation, so I wouldn't have a big learning curve. &nbsp;Except the problem there is you have to pay for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, one of the 3rd party mail programs sounds interesting (there are a lot out there, aren't there). &nbsp;I haven't ever steered outside Microsoft products before -- until recently, if you consider Gmail and Chrome steering outside MS products.
 &nbsp;I have seen a lot of pretty good comments about Thunderbird, em Client, Pegasus, etc and it might do me good to get outside the Microsoft box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I am looking for longevity -- looking for a product I can stick with for 5-or-10 years, or something like that -- so I don't have to relearn something every few years. &nbsp;I also really hate switching products every few years, and have all your
 work go down the drain because of the incompatibility between the products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[LIKE WHAT MICROSOFT "MAY" HAVE DONE WITH PHOTO GALLERY -- WHICH DOESN'T SEEM TO STILL BE AROUND WITH WINDOWS 10 -- STILL INVESTIGATING -- BUT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF YEARS OF TAGGING THOUSANDS OF PICTURES MAY HAVE GONE DOWN THE DRAIN -- I REALLY REALLY
 HATE THAT. &nbsp;Anyway, don't get me started on that - still looking into it.]<br />
</p>
<p>Another for instance, it appears that WLM may not be long for this world -- like WLM 2012 appears to be the end of the line there also and from what I have read, the Windows 10 Mail app is not a good replacement at this time. &nbsp;So maybe the problem is with
 "free" products. &nbsp;Back to my longevity comment and the Pay-for comment on Microsoft Outlook -- maybe paid is the way to go because the vendor is more likely to provide migrations paths and options to save their old mail in order to retain their paying clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, still thinking. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ron in round rock</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I think I now understand that I can use IMAP or POP3 with Outlook. &nbsp;My comment about IMAP was that I have never used the IMAP protocol before and I thought it might be a good experience for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you or anyone had experience with using both IMAP and POP3, maybe at the same time, switching back and forth. &nbsp;For instance, does POP3 get its input "ONLY" from the ISP's Inbox. &nbsp;Like, if I configured the ISP Inbox with a bunch of folders and I used
 IMAP -- and I changed the interface back to POP3, would I only get the email from the Inbox downloaded into my machine. &nbsp;Most of the email control (keeping track of email downloaded, preventing duplicates, etc.) is controlled by the email client, isn't it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or even leaving IMAP out of the picture, supposed I went onto my ISP and moved a bunch of email out of the Inbox, into a bunch of folders -- and then logged in with my POP3 mail client -- would the mail client even know about the messages in the folders
 or would just the messages in the ISP Inbox get downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I am leaning towards Outlook, particularly right now because with the new laptop just purchased, I got a free 1-year subscription to Microsoft Office-365, which I think includes Outlook. &nbsp;Don't know how much Outlook costs standalone, but I would
 have it for at least a year, free -- and maybe that is a program that Microsoft with keep around instead of jacking around with all of their free email clients.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update1 - Explorer.exe non stop crashing &#40;removed faulty DDLs and still crashing&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>just updated to Windows 8.1 pro (32bit/x86) Update1. My system booted OK and then the taskbar keeps crashing non stop, i.e. explorer.exe just cycles :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not barely type because every time the explorer is killed you cannot access the PC. Anyway - managed to start eventviewer and had errors with dropbox/google drive which I have removed but the error still keeps crashing my box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: explorer.exe, version: 6.3.9600.17039, time stamp: 0x5315626f<br />

<p>
</p><p>Tried to run in Safe Mode - but the error is still the same - i.e. the whole desktop is respanwed every 10 seconds :( I have uninstalled the update and it works like a charm... Install the update again - and bam - crashing non stop. Tried to dump explorer.exe
 but it creates 400 mb dumps, cant open them with notepad++...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst part is that the error is unknown:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Freezes on Login</h2>
                    <p>About 70% of the time when I login to Windows 10, it shows my desktop and then freezes the moment I try to do anything. Sometimes I think it may be because I try to interact with the computer too quickly, and sometimes I think that's just superstition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never happened to me in windows 7, and since the new system adds zero functionality for me, it's extremely annoying.</p>

            <p>I'm having exactly the same problem. I was delighted when several days back Money Plus Sunset started to work on Windows 10 so I re-installed Windows 10 on my second desktop pc (which I had previously rolled back to Windows 7 so I could use MS Money)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All seemed to be ok as I could open/close Money - great - until I tried to enter a new payee - then it just hangs with the error message you mention!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reluctantly, my second pc has again been rolled back to Windows 7!!</p>

<h2>            Does the Xbox One X support HDR at 1080p&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I use my Xbox one X hooked up to a monitor however I am getting a new monitor which is not 4K due to my PC not handling 4K games and down scaling on a 4K monitor to 1080p looks garbage so my question is does the Xbox One X support HDR at 1080p since the
 monitor I am looking at supports HDR10 and another question being it is a 1080p monitor will I have any improvements in non Xbox One X enhanced games even if my monitor is 1080p?</p>

<h2>            Acer Tablet no sound or camera after instlling Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1 all was working fine, Installed Windows 10 and have lost both cameras and all sound on my Acer Iconia W4 Tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Love the look and feel of 10 but need these features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>1) Running app troubleshooting</p>
<p>2) Disable Proxy Connections</p>
<p>3) Check time and Date</p>
<p>4) Check Region setting</p>
<p>5) Reset store Cache</p>
<p>
</p><p>With no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance appreciated</p>

<p>This was surprisingly what I needed. I could&nbsp;not find a solution to this error anywhere!</p>
<p>I had problems only with the camera, yet the installer fixed it.</p>
<p>Microsoft people should note this and fix it in their next update. All their replies to the posts in forums said the same check for driver thing, which wasn't helpful at all.</p>

<p>All other solutions suggested by Microsoft do not fix it as it seems that the error is not a result of only the camera drivers.</p>

<p>After struggling with this for almost two days, going backwards and forwards between Windows 10 and 8.1 I found that the Windows 8.1 32-bit drivers installed and fixed this issue on Windows 10. Shame on Acer for not listing them under the Windows 10 information!
 (Note I've not tried the camera as I'm not bothered about it for now - but Acer do have some sort of patch under the Windows 10 32-bit dropdown.)</p>
<p>

<p>I have tried to download Incredimail 2.0 and get this error. They say it's a problem with the operating system. They also say it could be a problem uninstalling McAfee so I installed it again and still have the same problem. I have tried most of the fixes
 and nothing has worked.</p>

<p>Hello Nyoka,</p>
<p>If Incredimail is the only program you cannot install and you can install other programs on your computer, then it doesn't seem to be an operating system issue.<br />
<br />
Create a manual system restore point. Name it Before uninstall of Incredimail in case we need to restore:<br />
Right-click on the Computer icon in the Desktop, and choose Properties<br />
In the left pane, click System Protection<br />
Alternately, to access the System Protection tab directly, click Start and type SystemPropertiesProtection.exe.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
Click the System Protection tab, and then click Create.<br />
In the System Protection dialog box, type a description, and then click Create.<br />
<br />
Next, uninstall Incredimail. Download the most current version and reinstall. Are you able to successfully install Incredimail?</p>
<p>Please reply back with an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <div>Hi Cristina, what operating system are you using?</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>First try this,&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Switch on your pc and you'll get some white text appearing, and begin pressing
<b>F8</b> on your keyboard (before the windows logo appears).</li><li>You'll get a list of options, select <b>Safe Mode</b></li><li>Then windows will load in safe mode, you will be able to select the Administrator account from here. If you assigned it a password, type it in, otherwise leave it blank.</li><li>Once you're into the account, go into the account options, select your account from the list and change account type to
<b>Administrator</b></li><li>Delete any other account you don't need.</li></ul>
<div>Then restart your pc and log back in again as usual.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Method 2</b></div>
<div>I made an assumption you have Windows XP and found something that might be useful to you...</div>
<div>(<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/lost-administrator-account-on-windows-7/62a99dcc-b976-4ad1-9ac5-e7bf803eab83">See this if you have Windows 7 or Vista</a>)</div>

Giving a Windows XP account administrator rights </b>
<p>Note: In order for you to have the rights to assign another account to the administrator group, you must be logged in as administrator or an account with administrative rights.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Recommended method</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/controlp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Control Panel</a>.</li><li>Double-click the User Accounts icon.</li><li>Click the user account you wish to grant administrative rights to.</li><li>Click "Change the account type"</li><li>Select Computer administrator and then the Change Account Type button.</li></ol>
<p>Alternative method</p>
<ol>
<li>From the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/desktop.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Desktop</a>&nbsp;right-click on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/mycomput.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Computer</a>.</li><li>Click Manage, which should open the Computer Management Window as shown below.<br />

Note: If you cannot access this section it's likely you do not have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/root.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">administrator</a>&nbsp;rights to the computer.</li><li>Click Users and in the right pane you should see all user accounts setup on your computer.</li><li>Double-click the account you wish to view the rights of.</li><li>Click the Member Of tab.</li><li>If the user is a Member of "Administrators" that account already has administrative rights. If this group is not listed click the Add button.</li><li>Type "administrators" and then the Check Names button. If successfully found you should get your computer name followed by \administrators and have it underlined. For example,<u>HOPE\Administrators.</u></li><li>Click Ok.</li></o
<p>After following the above steps, that account will be part of the administrators group and have administrative rights on that computer.</p>

                    I was told to install this by Microsoft as my email provider has a pop server. &nbsp;I did so yesterday when it seemed to work fine. &nbsp;While it's still working today, emails I received yesterday cannot be found as in Message Cannot be Found - the contents of
 this message cannot be found. &nbsp;Please help or should I just buy and install Outlook.

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We apologize for the untimely reply. Let us help you on your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're having trouble reading emails using Windows Live Mail. You'll not lose emails if you uninstall Windows Live Mail as the emails are both saved in the PC and in your online email account.
 You can go ahead and safely try the steps above. Let us know if you encounter any issues doing so.</p>

<h2>            c&#58;&#92;windows&#92;system32&#92;config&#92;systemprofile&#92;desktop</h2>
                    I have had problems over the last few weeks with inconsistent behavior in Windows.&nbsp; Internet Explorer would spontaneously redirect when I clicked on a link resulting from a search.&nbsp; Thinking I had Malware issues, I downloaded Microsoft Malicious Software
 Removal Tool, but received an error message on installation.&nbsp; I believe there were references to :&nbsp; KB978338 and ox800272efe, as I have these numbers jotted down.&nbsp; The redirects stopped and all was closer to normal except that&nbsp; appearance of toolbars, etc.
 all changed to a basic gray, sometimes while in use. Now, I get the&nbsp;error "c:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\desktop is not accessible. &nbsp;Access is denied" when I try to boot up, and my desktop background with recycle bin only. I also get a popup event
 planner error message from oneof my software programs,&nbsp;even though I never have used the event planner.&nbsp; I can only start in safemode.&nbsp;I am currently using Vista Home Premium

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span><span>You aren't logging into you user profile and getting a temporary one (and even that seems to have errors).&nbsp; There are a lot of dffernet problems, so let's do a general troubleshootiig
 to try to find them all and then resolve them (or do both at the same time).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer –
 or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span>
 and Avast at:</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your user profile may be corrupt.&nbsp;<span>To fix this use</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If that is the only available Administrator Profile (you need to be an administrator to fix this), enable the Hidden Administrator Account (HAA) using</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html</span></span></span></a><span><span>
 (which may not work depending on how bad your administrator account is functioning) or</span></span><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9001970/How_to_access_the_true_Administrator_account_in_Windows_Vista?taxonomyId=17&amp;pageNumber=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9001970/How_to_access_the_true_Administrator_account_in_Windows_Vista?taxonomyId=17&amp;pageNumber=1</span></span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>If
 you can't remember the password (and it requests one – it may not), try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since
 people often try to hack into systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager
 and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting
 tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you shoud do any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic
 driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp; If it fails, test
 each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></span></p>

<p>If I use the Vista Installation disk or Recovery disk, will I lose all files previously on my pc--documents, pictures, email, etc.&nbsp;?&nbsp; I would like to preserve as many of my files as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is a lot of info here, which I will have to go through little by little, so I will post results as I can. At present, I can boot up in safe mode with networking, but cannot print or email, so I will have to pull up the instructions on a different
 pc and print to be able to follow the steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you suggest I start at the first thing you mentioned and proceed in order?</p>
<p>This is a bit overwhelming, and I want to make sure I follow steps in the proper order for the best results.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>I suggest you do things in the order presented (though a bit of variance will do no harm).&nbsp; I've found that order seems to work best at finding and resolving the problems - but if you jump ahead a bit and then come back no harm will be done.</p>
<p>I did not provide any procedures which would place your data, settings, or programs at risk.&nbsp; The one re-installation option I listed requires a Vista Installation Disk (it can't be done with a recovery didk) and if you follow the directions carefully it
 will simply repair/upgrade your system files (though you will have to re-install all the updates and service packs).</p>
<p>If you discover the problem as you proceed, stop there and post the results and what you found.&nbsp; There's no need to do steps which are no longer necessary (though some may still be required to&nbsp;make sure your system is in good shape).</p>
<p>Take it one step at a time and take as long as you need to do it.&nbsp; It's up to you how much you do in one sitting.&nbsp; The reason there are so many steps is that the problem is undefined and we need to identify it and find the cause before we can even begin
 to&nbsp;come up with a solution.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Went through many of the steps you suggested. Still have some issues.</p>
<p><strong>After running sfc/scannow</strong> got following message:&nbsp; "Windows Resource Protection found some corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.log Windir\logs\CBS\CBS.log For example c:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log"
 followed by C:\Windows\System32 prompt, but I could not find a way to connect to the referenced CBS.log.&nbsp; If I typed that in after the prompt, I only got the prompt again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also got the pop-up window: "Host process for Windows Services stoped working and was closed. A problem caused the application to stop working correctly. Windows will notify you if a solution is available" and "Host process for Windows Services was closed.&nbsp;
 To help protect your computer, Data Execution Prevention has closed Host Process for Windows Services."</p>
<p><strong>After chkdsk/f/r</strong> - took out Vista resinstallation disk, restarted, and my full desktop was restored and working.</p>
<p>Then, I started checking<strong> security</strong> as you suggested, I uninstalled AVG Free 9.0 with no problem.&nbsp; Updated Malwarebytes and and full scan.&nbsp; No threats were detected.&nbsp; Wanted to uninstall to install the Panda tiral, but it will not uninstall
 through control panel.&nbsp; Nothing happens when I select it and click unintall.&nbsp; I get an error message: "An error occurred while trying to uninstall.&nbsp; It may have already been uninstalled.&nbsp; Would you like to remove from Program and Features list?"&nbsp; When I choose
 "YES" , nothing happens--and Malwarebytes still shows in the Program listing.&nbsp;<em> Can I still install Panda trial and run??</em></p>
<p>Internet Explorer still had a very basic, almost "skeletal" look to it.&nbsp; The light that flashes on the CPU when drive is in use was flashing A LOT, and then I could not connect to internet at all.&nbsp; Restarting computer got me back to the same black screen
 with recyle bin.&nbsp;&nbsp; I restarted in Safe Mode, and got "Failed to connect to User Profile" error message, when I clicked Start/All Programs/Accessories, command prompt was not offered as a choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Went back through first process--changed BIOS (which I had not done the first time, and went through steps you outlined.&nbsp;<strong>System Recovery tools startup repair</strong> found nothing to repair.</p>
<p><strong>Event Viewer log summary showed Application errors as below</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><em>The COM+ Event System detected a bad return code during its internal processing. HRESULT was 8007043c from line 45 of d:\longhorn\com\complus\src\events\tier1\eventsystemobj.cpp. Please contact Miscrosoft Product Support SErvices to report this
 error."&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>WMI-TargetInstanceISA "Win32_Processor" AND TargetInstance.LoadPercent&gt;99" could not be reacticvated in namespcae "//./root.CIMV2" because of error 0x80041003. Events cannot be delivered through this filter until problem is corrected.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>9009: Desktop Windows Manager exited with code 0x4001004</em></strong></p>
<p>Restarted computer with Resinstallation disk, and got desktop&nbsp; restored, and operable internet explorer again, but am running without AVG, and am unsure now of status of Malwarebytes.&nbsp; Am sending this now, as all is operable, but have not yet restarted wtih
 VISTA reinstallation disk in drive.</p>
<p>Did not try the "Clean boot" step because am unsure if I will lose files if I do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you suggest as a next step?</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; I also get, and have been getting for weeks, a message at startup, " Some start menu items cannot be displayed" with a suggestion that I try a lower resolution.&nbsp; I have not added anything to start menu that I know of.&nbsp; Is this signigicant?&nbsp; How can I find
 out what is on the start menu and adjust so I no longer get this message?</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help you can give....seems like I'm at least on the way to a solution.&nbsp; Appreciate your help in getting me this far!</p>

<p>Further update:</p>
<p>After I sent the above&nbsp;messge, I took out the reinstallation DVD and restarted.&nbsp;(BIOS is still set&nbsp;to boot disk drive first). &nbsp;Once again, there was no Windows "chime", just a single, loud beep, a black screen )plain black--before was my desktop background)
 and 2 messages:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Failed to connect to a Windows Service.&nbsp; Windows could not connect to the User Profile Service service.&nbsp; This problem prevents limited users from logging onto the system.&nbsp; As an administrative use, you can review the system event log for details
 about why the service didn't resopnd&nbsp;AND.....</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. &nbsp;C:\\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\desktop is not accessible.&nbsp; Access is denied.</strong></p>
<p>The messages stay on the screen, and I can hear the drive chugging away for quite a while.</p>
<p>I inserted the reinstallation drive and restarted, and got the same response, only with my desktop background and the recycle bin....so I am back to where I started.&nbsp;Even with the resintallation disk inserted, I do not get&nbsp;sent to the Installation screen....</p>
<p>&nbsp;ANY IDEAS????</p>

<p>January 22,2011 I am also having this issue infact the same issue exactly. It started after a windows update and at first windows error would pop up at the beginning Host Process for Windows Services stopped working and was closed .....A problem caused the
 application to stop working correctly. Windows will notify you if a solution is available .....when i click close it pulls up a Problem Reports and Solutions page and to check for updates then I click on windows update and it checks for updates and says windows
 is up to date .... I have run adware programs and malicious software removal tools ......I have tried the command prompt ....nothing is working ......this is too strange since it started around 2 weeks ago after an update. The exact date microsoft installed
 the update was on Jan 12,2011. This does not appear to be a malware or spyware issue but a microsoft update issue. I run Norton's the other person AVG. Both our issues are the same and the only commonality is microsoft updates. Hummmmm hopefully they can come
 up with an update that will fix the problem they have caused! I had this happen before after an update they did and had use Run and fix , goodness perhaps they should not release updates that cause more problems until the updates have been well tested first.
 So perhaps the Microsoft techies can give a better explaination to this problem caused by Microsoft updates ......I am waiting patiently for a response....but I won't hold my breath. Let me know when yous come up with a fix for Vista problem yous have created.
 Almost seems like a ploy to get more of us to upgrade to Windows 7. No thank you this is a recession you know. Perhaps some suggestions and a truthful answer instead of blaming on spyware or adware would be more helpful.</p>
<p>Frustrated at microsoft for this......Me!!!</p>

<h2>            Removing Keepvid folders and files</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this may not be the right forum for this, but.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently downloaded Keepvid having used it online before with no problems. Then I read it contains some kind of malicious script so I tried to uninstall it. There are 2 keepvid folders still in my programs 86 folder which i cannot remove - it always says
 the program is open somewhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google search brings up lots of hits saying it contains lots of 'bad stuff' and the only way to remove it is by paying for a removal program, which i am hesitant to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have the technical ability to do it manually by going through all the registry stuff that I have read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas or similar experience?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            360 slim says it has no wireless adaptor</h2>
                    
<p>I switched my 360 slim on this evening and it no longer believes it has a built in wireless adaptor, and is instead asking me to plug one in. I've been using this slim since launch day on wireless, what gives MS?</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in? UK<br />
&nbsp;Modem brand &amp; model number:&nbsp; Irrelevant<br />
&nbsp;Router brand &amp; model number: Irrelevant<br />
Network Connection Type:&nbsp;None, my 360 has forgotten it has a built in wireless adaptor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Wireless, what type of encryption
 are you using? None, i have no wireless adaptor according to the 360<br />
&nbsp;Things you have tried:&nbsp;Posting here<br />
&nbsp;Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown Irrelevant<br />
&nbsp;Is NAT Type Open? Irrelevant<br />
&nbsp;Any Error Codes you encounter:&nbsp; None<br />
&nbsp;What type of internet do you have? Cable/DSL/T1/3G? Cable<br />
&nbsp;Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? Virgin media<br />
&nbsp;When you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" what is the exact message shown on screen? My 360 says i have no wireless adaptor, testing the live connection would be pointless</p>

<p>Are you still experiencing this issue? If so, can you please try the console on a different power strip or wall outlet (and make sure it's not plugged in through a surge protector), to see if you then have the option to select a wireless connection?<br />
<br />
If that doesn't do the trick, please try again with the HDD removed (if you have the 250 GB HDD, that is).<br />
<br />
If neither of these steps do the trick, then your console will need a repair. You can check your warranty status and set one up

    <title>Microsoft has the worst support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> never gonna let you down  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft has the worst support</h2>
                    <p>So recently ever since I've upgraded to windows 10, I've been experiencing constant random crashing with the error "video tdr failure". So after a week of this, I got tired of the crashing and I contacted microsoft support. After an hour of waiting, a I
 finally get to talk to the guy and he was a nice guy and took some time to really try to solve my problem. However, he did not solve the problem. When he asked me if there was anything else I needed help with I told him I did. I have a problem with an update
 that is not installing and is stuck. He tells me that its nothing and I shouldnt worry about it. So I decided to just not pay attention to the update and contacted support once again. I tell him my problem and then he asks for my phone number and name in case
 we get disconnected. And you know what happened next? He disconnected the call. 1 minute into the conversation and he just ended it. I waited an hour for that guy and he just leaves? Are you kidding me?And you know what's ironic? He didn't even call me back.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 decided to contact support once again hoping that this time the person actually answers me.&nbsp;Another hour passes and I get in contact with someone. So once again I tell this person my problem. At first everything seemed find. She seemed like she knew what she
 was doing. She asked me if I had any updates queued and I said yes. I told her that there were updates that were stuck but a previous support told me that they were nothing and I shouldn't worry about it. But I guess she had other thoughts in mind because
 she told me that I should revert back to windows 7 and upgrade to windows 10 again. She had no other solution and she didn't seem like she tried. How lazy can you be? I waited an hour for this person and a 5 minute discussion leads to the solution of reinstalling
 windows 10? &nbsp;And so because I had nothing else I could try, I decided to revert to windows 7 and upgrade to windows 10 again. When I downgraded to windows 7, I decided to stay a little bit to see if I crashed, and sure enough, it didn't. Then I upgraded back
 to windows 10 and once again, I crashed with the same error as before. Hours wasted trying this lazy solution. So I decided to contact support one last time. If this didn't work, then I would have to downgrade to windows 7 until they fixed it. An hour passed
 and I get into contact. I do the usual telling him my problem and my attempts with the other supports. This guy tells me that I need to check with a local technician because my graphics card may not be compatible. I've been using this graphics card for a little
 over a year now with no problems before. I told him that It worked perfectly fine before but when I upgraded, it kept crashing. This support was pretty stubborn because he kept telling me that It shouldn't do that and it should work for windows 10 if it worked
 on windows 7. I DON'T CARE IF IT "SHOULD" WORK. IT WAS FINE BEFORE, BUT IT ISN'T NOW SO COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME. These are the last words I'm typing on windows 10. Until this issue is recognized and fixed, I'm not coming back to windows 10.</p>

    <title>Cannot install Windows updates no matter what - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shikiraclare  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install Windows updates no matter what</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Laptop and I uninstalled the pre-installed ANTIVIRUS programme because I could not alter settings to download Android Sync files - I wanted to upload my pictures on the laptop but my smart=phone cannot install essential drivers: Sync-droid and
 other alternatives won't install device drivers - had this same issue before on my desktop computer with a windows 7 OS but eventually got around it but don't recall how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my laptop which runs a windows 8.1 OS is unable to download and install automatic updates since I uninstalled the antivirus - have tried troubleshooting and independently downloading updates to no avail.&nbsp; The free MCAFEE antivirus that was pre-installed
 did not have any use to me as I already have windows defender/security package&nbsp;in place that I scan my laptop quite frequently and is a terrific anti-virus&nbsp;-&nbsp;should not&nbsp;prevent windows automatic updates because they ran superbly well on my windows 7 computer
 before buying the new 8.1 windows laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is wrong with my new OS and why doesn't windows update run or install automatic updates?.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled McAfee via my computer's uninstall feature as was not aware there being a specific uninstall tool to remove the antivirus software.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the continued problems installing windows updates in my windows 8.1 operating system, I reset
 the computer back to factory default to undo any changes - tried refreshing system first but did not resolve the update issue and why I set it back to factory default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have reset it back to factory default, McAfee free trial has reinstalled automatically alongside it and windows updating services still not functioning with a message saying 'there was a problem updating updates'.&nbsp; I have run the Microsoft recommended
 trouble-shooter for this issue several times and nothing is resolving the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot&nbsp;run any hotfix for this issue either because the (windows 8.1installed readiness tool) is an invalid programme according to my computer and a common error type that windows has no recommended action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could you advise me further on what I should do here and if I should remove the free trial McAfee software once again with an uninstall tool - hopeful that this might resolve the issue but not banking on it either.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Laptop was purchased 2 weeks ago 26/27 June 2015 and came pre-installed with windows 8.1 - I did not have to install anything just the automatic updates that occurred a week ago, although some updates did not install whilst others did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then uninstalled the (pre-installed McAfee) just a few days ago 07/07/2015 because it kept blocking any safe download of android sync to upload pictures from my phone to computer and smart-screen filtering disabled as</p>
<p>it is okay to&nbsp;do this if safe downloads get blocked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sync ware did install yet no driver for my phone could be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I could not get updates to install on my windows 8.1 system on 07-08/2015, and the McAfee no longer on my system, I did a 'system refresh'&nbsp;an option on my computer if you don't want a factory reset.&nbsp; The system refresh did not resolve the windows
 update issue and why I then did a factory reset - on the dates 07-8/07/2015, which did (again) not resolve the automatic update problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other technical problems I am experiencing with the new laptop, not just with windows updates - hotfix from Microsoft do not work and neither does any safe Microsoft recommended products I have so far tried - never use any unsafe or un-recommended
 programmes to perform maintenance tasks and I am tech savvy enough to know what is safe and unsafe to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to keep it brief here, so my apologies if I haven't.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>A) First ran the Windows update trouble-shooter upon discovering problem'</p>
<p>B) Then ran McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool that did not fix issue.</p>
<p>C) Downloaded trusted Microsoft Hot-Fix for update recovery - problem still there.</p>

<p>E) Uninstalled McAfee via uninstall programs in control panel - also did not fix issue.</p>
<p>F) Reset system back to factory default - problem still remains unresolved with windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted PC World where I purchased the brand new ASUS Laptop who are wanting me to contact the</p>
<p>ASUS software company to resolve the issues, yet may charge me for their services - I am writing a letter of complaint to PC-World as the operating system should be fit for its intended purposes and is not up to the consumer to arrange for software re-install
 if goods are faulty in the first instance.&nbsp; I also cannot run the One drive that should detect drivers of some devices, and very slow connection speeds - my Internet USB dongle is perfectly fine and worked at super-fast speed on my old desktop computer I have
 since sold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had not made any changes to my system upon receipt of the goods that significantly altered any pre-installed software, and literally followed the recommended and safe steps above.&nbsp;
