<h2>            Dead Space Ignition</h2>
                    <p>I own Dead Space Ignition and have played it on my Xbox 360. Now since it has become backwards compatible, I am unable to download it and the store is wanting me to buy it again. I do own this game and purchased it years ago, so why do I have to buy it again to play it?</p>

<h2>            Batman&#58; Return to Arkham - Arkham Asylum Not Installing</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased Batman: Return to Arkham and I am having an issue with Arkham Asylum.&nbsp; If I try installing the game, I immediately get the Ready to Start notification, and notice that the game is no longer in my download queue (as if it's competely
 downloaded).&nbsp; If I go to the Manage Game page, it says all 29.4 GB of the game is installed.&nbsp; However, if I try to play the game, I get the initial splash screen, but the game doesn't actually load.&nbsp; In other words, I think what's happening is something is
 keeping the game from actually downloading/installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times and the issue keeps repeating.&nbsp; I do not have any of these issues with Return to Arkham - Arkham City, only Arkham Asylum.&nbsp; I've also tried uninstalling both games and reinstalling them, which didn't
 work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the WB Games Support forms to ask, but those seem pretty untended and useless.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the game on disc, so offline's not an option, unfortunately.&nbsp; I'm not sure it's an issue with the OS because I'm still able to download and install other games.&nbsp; I think the issue is with Arkham Asylum specifically.&nbsp; Either way, I'll try the
 Soft Reset and see if that helps.</p>

<h2>            W8 showing Standard IDE ATA&#47;ATAPI controllers code 10 in device manager</h2>
                    I am having problems with W8 showing Standard IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers code 10 error - MS troubleshooter fixed the functional problem with the CD drive not starting but the drive error warning in device manager is still showing up. Does anyone have suggested
 about getting rid of drive errors on device manager in W8?&nbsp; In addition, the IDE ATA/ATAPI controller shows 4 ATA channel 0 and 4 ATA channel 1 - both of which have one channel with a flag (showing code 10 - will not start). I have uninstalled and reinstalled
 the drivers and the CD/DVD devices; I have installed the latest chipset software from Intel, but still have the problem.. Any feedback would be appreciated.

    <title>Thermal Clips to return - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Thermal Clips to return</h2>
                    
<p>From Christina Norman's twitter: "we are continuing to use thermal clips in me3, there will be other changes to weapons but no me1-style regenerating ammo"<br />
<br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/truffle/status/71710308086972416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Source</a><br />
<br />
Not really surprised that they will be sticking with thermal clips from ME 2 and not "regenerating ammo" like in ME 1.&nbsp; I personally hate the entire concept of the thermal clips, and would have wished they would make a hybrid system of ME 1's setup with ME
 2's, but doesn't look like that will happen.&nbsp; I'll be interested to see though what other changes to weapons they have in mind, the thermal clip system needs some improvement if they are going to keep it in my opinion.</p>

<p>Which is why I would've preferred that they implement a hybrid system of the two to appease everyone haha.<br />
<br />
I liked ME 1's system much more because I didn't have to spend part of the mission simply picking up "scattered" thermal clips throughout the map making it feel like yet another shooter, yes I know Mass Effect's combat system is built around a TPS, and the
 entire thermal clip process doesn't even coincide with the codex either at least not how it was in ME 1.<br />
<br />
While yes once you got the right upgrades and better weapons you pretty much never had to let go of the trigger and your weapons would never overheat in ME 1 making it seem overpowered, but I didn't find that to be a issue that needed fixing and thus result
 in this thermal clip idea. It took a ways into the game before any of those upgrades/higher tiered weapons could be purchased/found anyhow so logical progression of upgrading and improving your weapons stats followed in line with the RPG aspects ME 1 had whereas
 ME 2 doesn't.<br />
<br />
I know quite a few people didn't have any issues with the thermal clip system, but I also know quite a few people didn't have an issue with ME 1's system either. I think someone else on the old forums had presented a good idea for a hybrid of the two and I
 think it was Schuey? I don't remember but that was the best possible idea of merging both systems together to make ME 3's system superb in function and something that actually falls in line with the codex, a.k.a. the Mass Effect bible lol.

<p>I completely agree with the OP. The thermal clips didn't make much sense to me in terms of the game world's technology.
</p>
<p>A combination of both games would be the best move. </p>
<p>If I run out of thermal clips, I can't shoot anymore. Why? Wouldn't my gun eventually cool down? It's not going to stay overheated forever?
</p>
<p>Why not have a long cooldown on weapons after you run out of thermal clips? Best of both worlds!</p>

            Hi, Warminster
<br />
<br />This issue could have occurred due to conflict between third party antivirus software.
<br />
<br />Step 1: As an initial step, I suggest you to disable the antivirus (third party) software and firewall on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue.
<br />
<br />Disclaimer: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.
<br />
<br />Step 2: I suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if there are any software conflicts.
<br />
<br />A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.
<br />
<br />Refer: How to perform a clean boot in Windows
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<br />Note: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting to boot the computer in normal mode.
<br />
<br />Hope it helps.       
        </p>

            Thanks for the advice. I have dragged #1 and #2 so they are now in the opposite positions. I have also checked the box to make the second monitor the primary one. It is now behaving as if it is the primary monitor but
<strong>it's still called #2</strong>, and to move the mouse between the monitors I still have to move it counter-intuitively (ie to get from the left screen to the right, I have to move the mouse to the left). Which is weird and annoying. If you have any more
 suggestions, I'm very appreciative!

Create a new folder on a convenient local hard drive on your system. Perform the copy/past operation from your flash drive to that folder. Let us know the result.<br />

                    I alway look forward to completing the quest but this month in order to complete ‘Jump in the Fun’ quest you must get a new achievment in ABZU. This is one of the few games I have completed 100% of the achievments. I suppose I am out of luck and can’t
 complete the challenge. Anyone know if there is an exception if the game is already complete? If not MS should consider that as to not exclude/punish people who already maxed a game.

<h2>            sfc &#47;scannow found well over 400 corrupt files that it couldn&#39;t repair</h2>
                    Has Microsoft provided a solution to this dilemma yet?&nbsp; It was easy to fix in Win XP.&nbsp; It should be easier to fix in Windows 7 (Professional) too.&nbsp; It would be impossible to replace all the corrupt files with good ones (there are just too many) and the
 'store' would still have corrupt files in it anyway.&nbsp; Perhaps a reader of this forum has found a solution?&nbsp; Thank you................&nbsp;

            Thank you for the reply!!&nbsp; I am very concerned about performing a repair install because, there are so many ramifications, something might go wrong and I'll be left with a massive repair.&nbsp; I do have backups but am told that a repair install only works
 about 50% of the time.&nbsp; Do you have any more information on this?<br />

</p><p>The quickest and most reliable repair would be to restore a <em>System image </em>
made before the faults occurred.&nbsp; Assuming that you have Windows &amp; its applications on a separate drive to your data, the
<em>System image</em> is likely to take only about 25 minutes to restore.</p>

            <p>What I have is an OEM Windows Installation Disk (not a Recovery disk - but a full installation disk).&nbsp; I've already checked with Dell and they've confirmed that I can use that disk for a complete installation and, if I wanted to, I could use it for a repair
 install (which still makes me nervous).&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I did perform a completely new install (dual boot) on my hard disk with the OEM disk.&nbsp; It works fine and sfc /scannow also works fine on the new installation.&nbsp; But it's not an image disk.&nbsp; Does
 this information help?&nbsp; If my 'store' on my primary installation is corrupt, could I take ownership of the 'store' dll file on my new installation and replace the one on the primary installation - then run sfc again and see if it repairs my corrupted files?&nbsp;
 BTW, most of my data is on a separate disk.&nbsp; However, as you know, some programs insist that the data and settings remain with the Program.&nbsp; Besides, I have many, many Programs installed and, even though I have several backups, I wouldn't always know which
 files to overwrite to regain my data and settings.&nbsp; I suppose I could just overwrite everything with the Programs that I'm concerned about - but that would bother me also.&nbsp; I'm sure it isn't practical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, what is the name of the 'store' dll file?&nbsp; Thank you.................</p>

            <p>Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System images - a possible future strategy for you to consider</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I now appreciate that you have not made any System images.&nbsp; I cannot help with your current problems.&nbsp; When those problems are sorted out or you have given up and installed from scratch again then I suggest you make regular system images as your primary
 repair mechanism - they can avoid a lot of stress.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can learn about system images in Windows Help.&nbsp; They are snapshots of the Windows drive that can be restored to the drive if corruption has occurred.&nbsp; In brief, you can boot the system using your installation disk, connect the external drive that contains
 the System image that you made&nbsp;then restore that image to the system drive.&nbsp; The system drive will then be in the exact state that it was at the moment that you made the image - so any subsequent corruption is bypassed because everything on that drive will
 have been overwritten.&nbsp; Application settings and anything else on the system drive will also be restored to their values when the image was made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A System image is roughly the same size as the amount of space used up on your system drive; it takes me about 25 minutes to make&nbsp;and 25 minutes to restore.&nbsp; You write them onto external drives by starting Windows Backup and then using the link you'll find
 on the left hand side of its opening dialog - <em>Create a System image</em>.&nbsp; It is the only part of Windows Backup that I use but you can, if you wish, use the whole of Windows Backup and get it to make a new system image at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For dual-boot computers, the System image procedure can include both OS drives.&nbsp; The first OS can be imaged on its own.&nbsp; The second OS will probably insist on making an image of both drives.&nbsp; So, in my case:-
</p>
<p>I image my Windows 7 drive on its own.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I image Windows 10, the procedure forces me to image both my Windows 7 and my Windows 10 drives [if I force it to image windows 10 on its own then the image is useless and cannot be restored from].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, I have my data on a separate Data drive.&nbsp; I relocated my&nbsp;C:\Users\<em>MyUserName</em> folders onto my Data drive.&nbsp; I have also relocated my MS Office Outlook pst file onto my Data drive.&nbsp; I don't have any other awkward applications to interfere
 with this system-data split&nbsp;[but I see from your comments that you do so you cannot have a perfect split].</p>

            <p>Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cautious approach to a Repair installation</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are nervous about running a Repair install then make system images&nbsp;before you start.&nbsp; If you have any problems with the Repair install then you can restore&nbsp;the images to get back to where you started [it will be as if you have never run the Repair
 install].&nbsp; If the Repair install succeeds then all well and good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only run a Repair install twice.&nbsp; I did it purely to&nbsp;check the procedure&nbsp;and it worked without any apparent problems.&nbsp; Before I started, I made a System image.&nbsp; As soon as I had finished, I restored the System image just on case there were any non-apparent
 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Repair install procedure</span><span> [<em>a copy of my own procedure notes</em>]</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>For Windows-related problems such as yours [rather than application problems], you can consider a thorough system repair by using a Windows 7 installation disk to run a
</span><em><span>Repair Install</span></em><span> [also called an </span><em><span>In-Place Upgrade</span></em><span>].
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>A Repair install is not a procedure to be taken lightly and you might prefer to delay such a drastic step until you have exhausted all other options.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If, however, SFC continues to report unfixable system files </span>
<span>then you really have no choice but to complete the repairs to your system by running a
</span><em><span>Repair Install</span></em><span>.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3.1</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>A </span><em><span>Repair install</span></em><span>
</span><span><span>should not affect any user files - it should only affect the operation of the system.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>A repair install can disrupt some drivers, some applications &amp; some Windows settings so they might need to be re-installed or reset afterwards.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>You will need to use Windows Update for some quite substantial updates afterwards if you choose not to update the installation at the start of the procedure [see para&nbsp;3.4</span><span> below].</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3.2 </span><em><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><span><span>Note that, if you have updated to SP1 since installation, you ought to use an SP1 installation disk to do
</span></span><span><span>a </span><em><span>Repair Install</span></em><span>.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If you have not updated to SP1 than either an original installation disk or an SP1 installation disk can be used to run a
</span><em><span>Repair install</span></em><span> but using an SP1 installation disk will complete the SP1 update for you.</span><span><span>&nbsp; If you have updated to SP1 but the installation disk is pre-SP1 then&nbsp;the Repair install&nbsp;might refuse to run and you
 are left with no choice but full re-installation followed by endless updates.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3.3</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>To prepare for the </span>
<em><span>Repair install</span></em><span> - </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.3.1</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>As a precaution, backup all user files &amp; downloaded installation files as well as activation keys or other registration information.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.3.2</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>close all applications except your real-time anti-malware utility [</span><em><span>if you have problems running the procedure with your malware protection operational then you might have to temporarily
 disable it but this does risk infection so keep it running if you can</span></em><span>],
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.3.3</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>log in to an Admin account,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.3.4</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>disconnect from any unnecessary networks,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.3.5</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>connect to the internet,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.3.6</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>insert your installation disk.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3.4</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>To run the </span><em><span>Repair install</span></em><span>, use the illustrated procedure* at
</span></span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html?ltr=R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Repair Install - Windows 7 Forums</span></a><span> and also have a look at the MS summary at
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2255099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How to Perform an In-Place Upgrade</span></a><span><span>.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>[*</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>But when the </span><em><span>Repair install</span></em><span> has all but finished &amp; prompts you for your Product Key do not enter it, instead clear the box for
</span><em><span>Automatically activate Windows when I’m online</span></em><span> then click on
</span><em><span>Next</span></em><span>.&nbsp; This is particularly important for preinstalled Windows 7 such as ours.]</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3.5</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>After completing the Repair install, there is some tidying up to do.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.5.1</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Check your activation status at
</span><em><span><span>Control panel, View by - Small icons, System</span></span></em><span><span>.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It is shown as the second-to-last entry near the bottom of the window.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>You will probably find that its status has not been affected by the
</span></span><em><span>Repair install</span></em><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.5.2</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Check drivers, applications &amp; Windows settings as they might need to be re-installed or reset.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.5.3</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Check &amp; adjust settings for your networks.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.5.4</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Re-enable your malware protection if you had to disable it to run
</span><em><span>Repair install</span></em><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.5.5</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Make a new system image.</span></span></p>

            <p>Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just for completeness, I do not know the answers to your questions about dll files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only time I have experimented with the store&nbsp;[the C:\Windows\winsxs folder] was when I deliberately corrupted a file to see how good SFC was at fixing things [it was useless] and I got myself into an awful mess trying to return the store to its original
 state.&nbsp; I had to restore the System image I had made before I started my experiment to get things back to normal.&nbsp; I continued to investigate and I discovered that the store is not what it might seem to be.&nbsp; Some of its contents are real files.&nbsp; Some of its
 contents appear to be real files, but are actually hard-coded links to files elsewhere in the system so altering a file in the store might, in fact, be altering a file in a completely different location.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your explanation.&nbsp; FYI, I now Make images of my OS drive and my Data drive at least once a week.&nbsp; In addition, I have between two and three external drives on which I make incremental backups almost daily.&nbsp; Of course, none of this helps me
 now - although, even though sfc shows I have hundreds of corrupt files, my computer has been running like this for over a year in this state.&nbsp; One note:&nbsp; I wouldn't have known I had corrupt files unless I had run sfc.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, my images wouldn't help because
 I don't run sfc that often (guess I should once I get sorted out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question, though:&nbsp; How do I move my C:\Users folder to my Data drive?&nbsp; I assume the Registry has a pointer of which I am not familiar with.&nbsp; I'll do that immediately.&nbsp; Thank you so much!!!</p>

            Thank you for the information on the Repair Install.&nbsp; I intend to (when I get up the nerve) follow your instructions and hints to the letter.&nbsp; I shouldn't worry because I have so many backups and will have 'immediately before' images.&nbsp; But things can go
 wrong with backups and images too.&nbsp; That's the reason for my concern.&nbsp; Thanks again!!<br />

<h2>            Surface pen top click button not working &#40;surface pro 3&#41;</h2>
                    I tried to google the answer and&nbsp;found similar answers but don't seem to apply to me since the&nbsp;replies were in 2014. I have updated to windows 10 for my brand new pro 3. Top click button was originally working perfectly ie one click to launch one note
 and 2 clicks to launch screenshot. Suddenly it stopped working about 2 weeks ago? Anyone can help?

            Thanks for the reply. But the surface pen is brand new and from the Bluetooth connection I can see that the pen is connected so I doubt it is a battery problem.

            Hey Eagle.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow these illustrated steps to Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Install Now.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Don't forget to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click next to auto-create and format the necessary partitions, begin install -  this makes it foolproof.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Unfortunately you cannot.&nbsp; Only Windows Ultimate edition allows the changing of languages.&nbsp; You'd need to upgrade to Ultimate or purchase the version and language of Windows you need and install it cleanly.</p>

    <title>Win10 Mouse Keyboard not working at startup or lock screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greymole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Mouse Keyboard not working at startup or lock screen</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Win10 from Win7 (on the last day for free) and I thought I did the clean install, but it looks like I did not, all my programs and data came with. &nbsp;So I just went with it. &nbsp;It worked okay for a while. &nbsp;Then there was an upgrade recently, the
 "anniversary update" I think people have been calling it. &nbsp;It restarted and was at the boot up screen with that moving circle icon for an unacceptable amount of time. &nbsp;I let it sit for probably over 10 hours and in the morning the computer desktop came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current Win10 version I have is 1607 and OS build is 14393.187.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running with 16 GB RAM, Intel i7-3700, on a 3 or 4 year old Dell Alienware X51. &nbsp;64 bit OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is at startup and in the lock screen where it shows the nice pictures before logging into the computer, the mouse and keyboard will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clue may lie in the following. &nbsp;I have an "iogear" 4 port USB hub that has a switch so I can connect the hub to 2 different computers. &nbsp;I have a work computer (works just fine) and my home computer (the one with the issue) connected to this hub. &nbsp;The mouse
 and keyboard is Logitech brand with the mouse having "M215" and keybaord "K360" on the bottom of them. &nbsp;They are wireless and they came packaged together and use a single USB part that is connected to the USB hub. &nbsp;I use the work computer far more during the
 day and this computer works just fine. &nbsp;The issue is when I push the switch on the iogear to move the mouse/keyboard over to my Win 10 home computer. &nbsp;Then the mouse and keyboard do not work. &nbsp;I can switch back to the work computer and it works just fine.
 &nbsp;I noticed this issue right after the last update on the Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spare keyboard &amp; mouse that I direct plug into the Win 10 machine via USB. &nbsp;And even when I plug those in they will not work. &nbsp;I have to hold the power button down for the Win 10 to shut down. &nbsp;Then repower the computer, and then the plug in mouse/keyboard
 will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An aside, after this last update, it takes forever for the Win 10 machine to restart. &nbsp;More than 5 minutes (I do not have an SSD) and upwards of maybe 10 or 15 minutes. &nbsp;I walked away after a few so that's a guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The restart time and the mouse probably will push me over the edge to revert back to windows 7. &nbsp;I'm not liking Windows 10 at all. &nbsp;Seems like the quality that Windows used to have is just not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise before I revert back to Win 7 to give Win 10 one more chance?</p>

            <p>There are no drivers for the USB switch. &nbsp;There were some recent Win 10 updates and that seems to have helped a bit with the restart times. &nbsp;For the mouse/keyboard not working, I plugged in a wired set and restarted. &nbsp;Got the computer working, then plugged
 back in the switch. &nbsp;I still have the wired set hooked up, but at least the mouse/keyboard on the switch are working when restarting and when it goes to the lock screen. &nbsp;I'll have to unplug the wired ones and see how it works this week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help all!</p>

<h2>            Why does my Surface Pro give a BSOD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro has been giving BSOD every now and then, not on a daily basis but enough to get on my nerves. I get the Error of 'driver state power failure'. I did a reset and it was fine for about a week but today I just had another one so the problem isn't
 fixed yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a link to the dmp file of today's BSOD</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated :)</p>

            <p>HI there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked intel's website but I was running the latest drivers so that didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't had a blue screen in nearly a week however, I ran the sfc /scannow command and it found a corrupted file which Windows repaired, so I'm thinking that might have helped?</p>
