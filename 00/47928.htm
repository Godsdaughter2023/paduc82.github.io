    <title>Windows 7 Does Not Remember Screen Saver Settings - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Does Not Remember Screen Saver Settings</h2>
                    I have a new hp notebook with Windows 7 home premium.&nbsp; For some reason when you activate a standard Windows screen saver (example rotating text screen saver) the screen saver is saved for a short time only.&nbsp; After rebooting/restart the screen saver defaults
 back to (NONE) no screen saver is activated.&nbsp; It's not remembering the setting you have saved.&nbsp; It may be ok for a while but after a few reboots it resets to no screen saver selected.&nbsp; If you reapply the screen saver again, it saves and again resets to none
 after a restart.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Make sure that your Bluetooth&nbsp;drivers and properly installed on your PC. To do that press
<em>Windows logo key + X </em>on your keyboard. You will see a menu appearing. From that menu click on device manager.
</p>
<p>Then find Bluetooth category and inside that make sure your Bluetooth device is listed.
</p>
<p>You can also update your Bluetooth&nbsp;software by clicking on update driver software from the right click menu to troubleshoot your problem. &nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>Can my internet searches and sites be seen by those on my network if I browse sites InPrivate?</blockquote>
<p><br />
No. InPrivate does not store browsing history.<br />
<br />
Excerpt :<br />
InPrivate Browsing in Internet Explorer 8 helps prevent your browsing history, temporary Internet files, form data, cookies, and usernames and passwords from being retained by the browser, leaving no evidence of your browsing or search history.”<br />

            Although private browsing doesn't store any information as davidhk129 mentioned, if there is network monitoring software installed, or running on the network, the data can still be read. To expand further, if the site supports encryption, using HTTPS to
 connect to it will make it so the data sent to and from a website is not visible - that being said, the DNS can still be logged which will display the website URL (microsoft.com) being accessed.

<h2>            Host process for windows services stopped &#40; svchost.exe_profsvc - faulting module ntdll.dll&#41;</h2>
                    Okay, my once rock solid Windows Vista 64 bit system has developed the dreaded "host process for windows services stopped" disease. I tried to isolate it to see if it was something I was doing, a program that was running, or if a scheduled task that was
 triggered was causing it--but I could turn the machine on and let it boot up and sit there and do nothing and bam! The error will occur eventually.<br />
<br />
I thought maybe my user profile was corrupted. I create a fresh one, logged into that and -- bam! Same error occurred.<br />
<br />
Two things changed. I installed the latest Windows updates from the April round of patching--I have since uninstalled them but still have the same problem. Star Wars: The Old Republic updated to version 2.0, but looking at their forums it seems nobody is having
 this issue.<br />
<br />
It is quite annoying as this takes down a host of other services and then I have to reboot. Any ideas? I'm thinking I don't want to waste too much time on this as this computer is getting pretty old (built in 2008) and I'm thinking I might as well assemble
 a new one and install Windows 7 (which I ordered two years ago but it's just been sitting on a shelf).<br />

<h2>            Graphics driver OpenGL issue</h2>
                    <p>Im using an old laptop with "mobile intel 965 express chipset family"</p>
<p>Im trying to launch a few applications but they are giving me an error about OpenGL extensions and it gives me a warning that my GPU might not support OpenGL apps.</p>
<p>These same apps were running fine on Windows 7 which was the default OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can i manually download OpenGL drivers for my graphics card?</p>
<p>I tried the intel website but there are no Windows 10 compatible drivers according to their filters.</p>
<p>The only win10 download i found was an INF update tool.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            Hi SBellue, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It sounds like your File Explorer has Dark Theme enabled somehow. I'll give you the steps to reverse this change.
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type "choose your accent color"
<br />- Click on the first option.
<br />- Under More Options, select Light instead of Dark.
<br />
<br />You'll notice the change immediately in File Explorer. Please let me know if this doesn't work, and I'll see what else we can do to fix it! Thanks!

            Hi SBellue 
<br />
<br />You have just installed version 1809 of Windows 10, switching between Light and Dark App Mode is universal, Sorry, but Microsoft provides us with no facility to just turn that off in Explorer. In version 1809 . . .

<br />
<br />2. Merging of 2 Skype accounts will not be possible. 
<br />
<br />However, if you want to continue with only one account, you can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your other account so that credits are not wasted and contacts are not lost.

<br />Optionally, if you want to close an account after the required transfer but if this is attached to a Microsoft account, then Microsoft account will also get closed which has its own ramifications.

<p>Yes I'm aware that my old Skype account still exists.&nbsp; The point is that I cannot integrate it with Windows 10 because Microsoft auto-generated a brand new Skype account that I neither wanted nor asked for.&nbsp; There is no way of unlinking the unwanted Skype
 account that I did not ask Microsoft to create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The end result is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows 10 has a Skype icon in the systray that contains none of my existing contacts and is completely useless to me.</p>
<p>2. My 15 year old Skype account with dozens of contacts cannot be linked to Windows 10.&nbsp; I've got to use some completely separate application instead if i want to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How on earth is this a good idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all the animosity that Windows 10 gets from a certain demographic of PC user, it's absolutely staggering that Microsoft would implement Skype into the user experience in such a destructive way.&nbsp; At the very least, this unrequired
 Skype account should be unlinkable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well.&nbsp; I suppose I now add my name to the growing list of users abandoning Skype.&nbsp; Time to figure out how to disable it in Windows 10 altogether so it's not consuming resources and begin exploring other apps.&nbsp; Google Duo, etc.<br />

            That won't work.&nbsp; The unwanted, auto-generated Skype account is permanently linked to the Microsoft account.&nbsp; Whether the credentials are stored on the target computer or not is irrelevant because the Microsoft⟷Skype link was made server side, not client
 side.

<p>Don't talk to me about non-refundable cash reserves that can disappear in an instant. You mentioned the PS3, and I too own a legacy console that is pretty much just&nbsp;a default Blu-ray player now. But there was a time not so long ago - from 2008 until 2014 - when I spent THOUSANDS of non-refundable dollars on PlayStation's&nbsp;social app, PlayStation Home.&nbsp;To borrow a pun, it was my "home away from home" where naturally my first port of call was Xbox (or my own abode, obv.)

<p>No matter which platform you choose, the plain facts of a modern ecosystem mean that money *will* be spent. It's the price you pay to get on board. However, now that you're happily (or unhappily) on board, why isn't YOUR platform performing to expectation? I don't know, because MINE is. I don't have an issue with installation on my Xbox One S (unless it's a digital title and my ISP isn't playing nicely), but pretty much every disc is up and running in&nbsp;short order. Heck, most of the time you can start playing while the rest of the game installs! </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My controller always syncs upon start up, and I have more than enough breathing room on my new 2TB hard drive - so I really can't speak to why you're having an issue with your 4TB&nbsp;expansion. Ditto for why your Xbox One is underperforming. If it's an original or Day 1 console, perhaps its components are wearing down or there's some other unidentifiable issue&nbsp;at fault (is your console well-ventilated?). Finally, as regards the sale offerings from Microsoft: you've just admitted you prefer Games w/Gold over the others, so I really don't see what you're complaining about. I too spend THOUSANDS on my Xbox collection, albeit mostly retail or collector's editions, but nevertheless it's nice to know that as a longstanding Xbox Gold member, I am also given regular&nbsp;discounts in the Microsoft store. It's an incentive, at least, even if I do turn the other cheek.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Web deployment agent service&#34; is using port 80.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,<br />
<br />
<br />
After i de-installed ampps (alternative to Xampp) and re installed it , i get a message that port 80 is being used by another application.<br />
I found out in "Windows task manager" that (NT Kernel &amp; System) was the culprit. After googling further found that "Web deployment agent service" is using port 80.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Program Files\IIS\Microsoft Web Deploy\MsDepSvc.exe" -runService:MsDepSvc</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i did for now was to break "MsDepSvc.exe" by spacing it&nbsp;MsD epSvc.exe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What i would like to know is why did IIS start using port 80. Because ampps did not complain about it before!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And what is the solution. How can i change the port for IIS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank You!</p>

            Is there any diskactivity? If you have a harddisklamp, that under normal use only blinks a bit, then it perhaps now is working hard on it, and the harddisklamp perhaps lights constantly.

<h3> thommygunn79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound Settings in Xbox One not sticking once I turn the system off and use it again later in the day.</h2>
                    
<p>I have to go into the settings, change it from 7.1 to bitstream in order to get Dolby Digital working.&nbsp; I only have a 5.1 system.&nbsp; Once I have DD on it sounds awesome, I get out watch a movie, play a game...AMAZING.&nbsp; Next time I turn on the system, I look
 at my receiver and notice its not on DD anymore.&nbsp; At first I was messing with receiver thinking its missing something, but then I go back into Xbox One sound settings and its back at 7.1, so I have to change it back.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to use my DD do I HAVE to change
 this manually EVERY TIME I turn it on?&nbsp; Anyone else having issues with this?</p>
<p>Is there a fix?&nbsp; Any tips would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; This is how my setup is, so if someone wants to troubleshoot it.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;my xbox one&nbsp;plugged into my receiver via HDMI, then the receiver is going to the TV via HDMI and Optical.&nbsp; Xbox Settings are;
 HDMI Audio = Bitstream out&nbsp; Optical audio = Bitstream out&nbsp; Bitstream format = Dolby Digital I've even used DTS and once the system is turned off and back on, its back to HDMI audio = 7.1 uncompressed and my receiver is only in stereo mode, doesn't recognize
 DTS or Dolby Digital.</p>
<p>Suggestions?</p>
<p>Lastly, just a curious question, do I want Dobly Digital or DTS?&nbsp; Which is better these days?&nbsp; Sorry, its been a while since I've really paid much attention to this.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone</p>

<p>I forget the exact name of the setting, but it's on the same screen (left side). I think it's tv connection or something you have a few choices, one being HDMI (auto-detect) and another bring hdmi. If you are using hdmi (auto-detect), this may be your issue.
 I was having a similar issue where after setting to 7.1 uncompressed it would change to stereo uncompressed after turning system off and on.
</p>
<p>Change the setting I mention to the HDMI option, (do not select auto detect). You may have to set the resolution setting after that back to 1080p or whatever your tv supports. This seemed to have fixed my issue. It's been about a week or so since I changed
 it to HDMI and haven't seen the reset of audio settings since. </p>

<p>One question, why have hdmi from receiver to tv AND an optical to tv as well? Hdmi should carry the audio, so not sure why you would use optical to tv as well.
</p>
<p>If your watching blu ray movies I would stick to uncompressed. Blu ray movies almost always have a lossless track (Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD master audio) which is a clear step up from normal Dolby digital or DTS. Uncompressed should pass the lossless tracks,
 where Dolby digital or DTS will not. Don't worry about the Dolby or DTS light on your receiver. Only reason that they may sounds better is IF you are usb a surround processing mode that only works on a bitstream signal.

<p>I had to disable auto-detect for it to even allow DD to be set yet my TV pass-through to Optical clearly supports it. &nbsp;Try giving what Megatron suggested a try since you know the connection is HDMI and you should know the native resolution of your TV. &nbsp;Once
 the auto-detect is disabled it should stick.</p>

                    I have&nbsp; a brand new computer that has windows 8 running and I keep getting this display driver error.&nbsp; Since the unit is new and I haven't loaded anything onto it other than microsoft office, I know I have a huge amount of memory available, so that can't
 be the problem.&nbsp; The drivers should be new too (at least I think so).&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas about what this error is all about?

            <p><span>Hi Elizabeth,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the description provided, it looks like you are receiving error message "Display driver has stopped
 working" on Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This behavior can occur for one or more of the following reasons:</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to install the latest updates for your display driver.</span></p>
<p><span>Visual effects or too many programs running in the background may be slowing your PC down.</span></p>
<p><span>The GPU is taking more time than permitted to display graphics to your monitor.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the following methods and check.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the ‘Run’ windows type regedit and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Browse to and then click the following registry subkey:</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Control\GraphicsDrivers</span></p>
<p><span>d. On the Edit menu, click new, and then select the following registry value from the drop-down menu specific
 to your version of Windows (32 bit, or 64 bit):</span></p>
<p><span>For 32 bit Windows:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Select DWORD (32-bit) value.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type TdrDelay as the Name and click Enter.
</span></p>
<p><span>c. Double-click TdrDelay and add 8 for the Value data and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>For 64 bit Windows:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Select QWORD (64-bit) value.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type TdrDelay as the Name and click Enter.
</span></p>
<p><span>c .Double-click TdrDelay and add 8 for the Value data and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Close the registry editor and then restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Note: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry
 incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to install the latest display drives and update the chipset drive from the manufactures’ website
 and test.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3:
<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>You can also adjust your PC for better performance by disabling some of the visual effects. Here’s how to adjust all visual effects for best performance:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press Windows Key + X key and click Control Panel.3</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>In the search box, type
<span>Performance Information and Tools</span>, and then, in the list of results, click
<span>Performance Information and Tools</span>.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Click <span>
Adjust visual effects</span>, if you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Click the <span>
Visual Effects</span> tab, click <span>Adjust for best performance</span>, and then click
<span>OK</span>. <br />
<span>Note:</span> For a less drastic option, select <span>Let Windows choose what’s best for my computer</span>.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information provided is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you need any other information about Windows, feel free to post your questions and we will be glad to help.</span></p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm having the same problem while I'm playing on my notebook and, after I've created the TdrDelay registry, my computer have a new error displayed on the notification bar:</div>
<div>"<b>application has been blocked from accessing Graphics hardware</b>"</div>
<div><br />
<div>All the drivers are up to date and, actually, I'm using the same drive (NVIDIA Graphics Driver 331.82) since november (2013) and the problem surged just yesterday.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When the error occurs, only the game is opened, and normally I can use another programs while I'm playing, so I don't think that it's caused by too many programs running in the background. My computer is already configured to better performance in the
 Visual Effects tab.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've tried to delete the drive and reinstall it, but it doesn't work. I've tried to solve it with System Restore, but it failed too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know what is the cause of this problem, neither how to solve it. I've already had this problem and I've formated the notebook to solve, but it returns.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>My notebook:</div>
<div>Dell Inspiron 14R 3540</div>
<div>Windows 8.1 64-bit</div>
<div>NVIDIA GeForce GT630M</div>
<div>Intel Core i5 3210M @ 2.50GHz</div>

            <p>Visit the manufacturers website, update to the latest graphics driver, and the latest chipset drivers. You can check the latest driver version by going to start &gt;R, in the run box type devmgmt.msc, and navigate to the display adaptor. You can right click
 to check properties and driver version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With some of the new mainboard and processors it would be a good idea to check to see if there is a BIOS upgrade available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check the version of your BIOS currently installed read your manual to find the key to access the BIOS at startup.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem may also be a hardware fault, so contact the manufacturer's support number.</p>

<h2>            Controllers dying with new batteries.</h2>
                    
<p>Its happening to a few of my controllers around the same age, if I tap the battery pack or squeeze with a little extra force, controller just dies. Anybody else ran into this?</p>

<p>Is this the play and charge? If so could be some oxidation on the contact points or the spring loaded contacts in the controller not pressing as hard. You'll notice the regular double AA pack has two coiled metal contacts at the bottom while the play and
 charge pack has six copper contact points with the controller having four spring loaded contacts. Squeezing &nbsp;or tapping the battery pack to where it loses contact for even a blink of &nbsp;an eye will cause the controller will turn off just the same as if you pulled
 the pack off. If you want to clean the contacts a regular pencil eraser works great. Also check the spring loaded contacts in the controller and make sure they press out enough. Have heard of it getting so bad even the rumble can cause the controller to lose
 contact with the battery pack.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If all else fails get some rechargeable AA batteries since it's much easier to stretch the other two controller contacts to maintain a strong connection with the batteries.</p>

<h2>            Clone System Disk Issues</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>I recently purchased a 525 GB SSD to replace my boot drive, to speed up my computer. And have run into a number of issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am running Windows 10 Creators Update. Which my PC upgraded to at the beginning of last week.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My old mechanical drive is a 1.5TB. And had 4 partitions on it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
100Mb System Reserved</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
C: - Was 700GB plus a bit more. Reduced its size in Windows and got it down to 623GB.&nbsp; Was seeing if I could get it less 500GB.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
D: - 200 GB</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
E: - 500 GB</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>My C drive was nearly full so I changed the location of the Windows Pictures and Videos folders to be on my other hard drive. So I am now only using 317 GB on my C: Drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I used Macrium Reflect to create images of the ‘System Reserved’ and C: drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And restored these images onto the SSD. Macrium Reflect supports resizing partitions so is able to fit the 623GB, as I am only using 317 GB.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My plan is to get the SSD drive working, and later use my old mechanical drive for the D: and E: drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(46, 116, 181, 1)">Issue 1:</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>My cloned Windows 10 is failing to start.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I see the Windows 10 logo.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I than get the dreaded Windows 10 black screen with a cursor and blue spinning circle.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I do not see the Windows log on screen. And Ctrl-Alt-Delete does nothing as far as I can tell.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>I do not see the Windows log on screen. And Ctrl-Alt-Delete does nothing as far as I can tell.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The first time I left my PC on for an hour to see if it eventually would become good, which it did not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows seems to think its booting fine. Because if I press the power button, it takes a little while to shut down. Also it never starts up in the Recovery mode, unless I turn the power off twice
 in a row while starting up. So Windows seems to think it is starting okay.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Recovery mode I have tried starting up in Safe Mode. However, I get the same issue. Except the mouse cursor is larger because it is booting in VGA mode. So I can tell I am in safe mode. So whatever
 the issue is, it is taking breaking safe mode also.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried uninstalling my Anti Virus program as that was listed on the web as could cause this issue. And re-imaged and cloning but that did not help. Was using Avira and been thinking of changing to
 Microsoft’s built it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(46, 116, 181, 1)">Issue 2:</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I thought I would see if I could do a repair in place with the Windows 10 Creators Update USB. Which I downloaded from:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, if I boot from this USB with either my old mechanical hard drive or my new SSD connected. I get the following message:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"It looks like you started an upgrade and booted from installation media. If you want to continue with the upgrade, remove the media from your PC and click Yes. If you want to perform a clean installation
 instead, click No."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Clicking on Yes, just tries to boot my Windows 10 again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If I click No or press Escape, this gets you past this message and takes to “Enter your languages and other preferences”.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click next and there is an option for ‘Install Now’ and ‘Repair your computer’. Choosing ‘Repair your computer’</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Gives the following options:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Continue – Exit and continue to Windows 10</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Use a Device – Use a USB drive, network connection, or Windows recovery DVD</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Troubleshoot – System restore points, system image recovery, start-up repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Command prompt</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Choosing Use a Device and clicking on the USB stick makes the computer reboot.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And then you get the message "It looks like you started an upgrade and booted from installation media.” So am stuck in a loop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Searching for this message and I have found other people with this same issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am guessing there is a flag somewhere in Windows saying it still doing an upgrade. Does anybody know how to reset this?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am wondering if this is anything to do with updating to Win 10 Creators Update last week.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(31, 77, 120, 1)">Issue 3:</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I decided to try and reset Windows 10 with keeping my files to see if that would fix the start-up issue with the SSD.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So forced my PC into Recovery mode, by turning off twice during Windows start-up. And choose ‘Reset this PC’ with ‘Keep you files’</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And selected my user account and entered my password.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And got:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>“To reset this pc and keep your files, the users, program files, and windows directories need to be on the same drive. You can choose to reset this PC and remove everything instead, but should back
 up your personal files first.” And there is only a Cancel button. Which takes you back to the main recovery options.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I thought this might be because I moved the Windows ‘Pictures’ and ‘Videos’ folders to my other drive to free up space. So booted back up in my mechanical drive and set the ‘Pictures’
 and ‘Videos’ folders back to C: drive, but left them empty.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Imaged my C Drive and cloned onto SSD again. Started back up on the SSD and then tried ‘Reset this PC’ with ‘Keep you files’. And got the same issue. So cannot attempt to do a ‘Reset this PC’ with
 ‘Keep you files’. Which is annoying.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is a big issue if someone cannot boot their PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As they cannot fix this issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>Luckily I can boot from my old mechanical drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(31, 77, 120, 1)">Back to fixing Windows Booting</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>So I am now back to trying to work out why I am getting the black Windows screen when I should be getting the log on screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>My new theory is there is an application on the D: Drive that Windows wants at start-up. I am a Software Developer and put all my development tools and code on my D Drive. To test this
 I have put my System Reserved and C Drive onto an old 1 TB hard drive I have. So C: is a direct copy and not resized to fit. As this will rule out the copy to the SDD with the C Drive being shrunk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>With this test W</span>indows has failed to start in the same way.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Next step is to add my D: drive partition to this 1TB drive to see it fixes the issue. E: only has a couple of games installed. So I am hoping I do not need that partition.
</span></p>
<p><span>This is a big issue. As it looks like if you have a second hard drive installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As my D Drive could have been a different disk drive.<span>&nbsp; </span>And this drive died. Windows would no longer boot properly. Not even in safe mode. And you cannot reset your PC due to Issue 3.</span></p>

<p>Adding my D: drive to the 1TB partition did not fix the issue.&nbsp; Windows still ends up as a black screen after the Windows logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if it&nbsp;is a disk drive letter issue. The order of the partitions on my old&nbsp;hard drives partitions were:</p>
<p>System Reserved</p>
<p>E: Drive</p>
<p>D: Drive</p>
<p>C: Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my test 1TB harddrive. They are:</p>
<p>System Reserved</p>
<p>C: Drive</p>
<p>D: Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>My boot drive is e: drive&nbsp;in recovery console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the drive letters correct in recovery console? I tried changing them with DiskPart, but they did not change when I next went into the recovery console.</p>

<p>&gt;&nbsp;Are the drive letters correct in recovery console?</p>
<p>Answer to myself. No they are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to get my image to boot from the 1TB hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To work I made the same amount of partitions as on the original drive. With two dummy 100MB partitions. So the boot drive is on the 4th partition like on the original drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my partition's are now:</p>
<p>System Reserved (100MB)</p>
<p>Dummy E: partition (100MB)</p>
<p>Dummy D: partition (100MB)</p>
<p>C: Drive (Full C Drive image size)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where I will not assign drive letters to the dummy partitions within Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeating process on SDD now. Only difference is the C: drive partition will be shrunk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure there is probably a better way to fix this in the System Reserved partition in the Boot Configuration Database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still have the issue 2 above,&nbsp;where my image thinks an update is still in progress which would also be nice to fix.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sequence of the partitions may be the problem.. It is not so much the lettering, but the actual order of the partitions on the drive... The lettering can be changed if necessary once you get the machine to boot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The boot sequence doesn't go by drive letter anyway, I don't think... it goes by location on the drive... Drive&nbsp;0 Partition 2 for instance...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your boot partition is probably the 100mb System Reserved on the original drive with C:\ being the 2nd partition... You need to set up the new drive the same way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... Are those 200GB and 500GB actually GB or are they really MB ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you can do a repair install that keeps everything when booting with the installation media... If you select Install you MIGHT get the option to Keep Files, but I don't remember for sure...</p>

<p>Hi slance310</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; The boot sequence doesn't go by drive letter anyway, I don't think... it goes by location on the drive... Drive&nbsp;0 Partition 2 for instance...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is what I now believe.&nbsp; The drive letters are particular to the OS.&nbsp; Which is why the drive letters in the command prompt within the recovery console are different.&nbsp; And the boot sequence goes by drive and partition reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Your boot partition is probably the 100mb System Reserved on the original drive with C:\ being the 2nd partition...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the active(boot) partition is the 100mb Reserved. However the C: drive was not the 2nd partition on the original drive. Which was the&nbsp;the cause of the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;BTW... Are those 200GB and 500GB actually GB or are they really MB ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my old physical drive the partitions were:</p>
<p>System Reserved (100MB)</p>
<p>E: partition (500GB)</p>
<p>D: partition (200GB)</p>
<p>C: Drive (The rest of the 1.5 TB drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my new SSD drive booting up now with the dummy small partitions.&nbsp; So my SSD looks like:</p>
<p>System Reserved (100MB)</p>
<p>Dummy E: partition (100MB)</p>
<p>Dummy D: partition (100MB)</p>
<p>C: Drive (Rest of the 525GB drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Windows needs to be in the same partition as is it used to be to boot all the way up. Within Windows I have not assigned drive letters to the two dummy partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what used to happen with older versions of Windows when this issue occurred. Is it would say it could not find an operating system. Now the boot loader on the system reserved is being smarter and finding Windows on a different partition, so Windows
 starts to boot.&nbsp; But than Windows is not happy probably because it uses drive and partition internally to find some of its files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also why 'Reset this PC’ with ‘Keep you files’ was probably&nbsp;not working.&nbsp; A bit more feedback here would have been nice.</p>

<p>If you want to keep your SSD drive as your boot drive for Windows 10, we suggest that you don’t clone it. A Solid State Drive works more like a huge chunk of RAM and works well only if your computer has power. When replacing a hard drive with a Solid State
 Drive, it is recommended that you format a drive and perform a clean installation. Click this
