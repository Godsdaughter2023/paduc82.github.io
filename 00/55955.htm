            My advice, to you, now that you know it is the Recovery Partition, is to leave it alone.<br />
<br />
An extra 3Gbs will not make or break you for storage capacity.<br />
<br />
You can not transfer it; and if you could, it would be a silly move, in case of System Failure..<br />
<br />
You don't transfer space to C:<br />
<br />
The space where D: was would have become unallocated space.<br />

<p><span>Hi DJ King,</span></p>
<p><span><span>I think it is always best to leave the d-drive (Recovery Partition) alone. It is there so that in the event of a catastrophic failure, you can
 recover your system. In that case, a system restore is not possible.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Unable to see Meetings in SfB Ios App</h2>
                    <p>Hi - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Skype for Business on my ipad. It is using iOs 12.2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The meetings tab does not display my scheduled meetings. </p>
<p>The desktop version I use shows all scheduled meetings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use Outlook for mail on my iPad, I use the built in Mail app on my device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connect to my business email via Exchange and have my SfB app set to auto-detect server under Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I have set this up incorrectly? Can you confirm how I need to configure my SfB app to show meetings in an IOs environment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I have the Nighthawk R7000. &nbsp;My Nat is open. &nbsp;Are you running the latest version of the firmware? &nbsp;If you are, when you installed it did you did a complete factory reset on the R7000 as explained by the firmware update guide?</p>
<p>I am running my Xbox One with only UPnP and I have an open NAT. &nbsp;I should add, I am wired. &nbsp;Are your wireless? When you set your port forwarding did you make the IP address f or the Xbox One reserved (static)?</p>
<p>Just some thoughts.</p>

<p>Wireless connection, on the 5ghz channel. And yes the firmware is up to date</p>
<p>I tried setting up the xbox with a static IP; however, I wasn't able to find the DNS server IP address for my ISP.</p>
<p>I've never set up a static IP so this is new territory for me.</p>

<p>@Tom, on the router interface page, hit the Advanced Tab, then LAN Setup, Under the Address Reservation area, click Add. &nbsp; A list will come u with IP addresses. &nbsp;Select the one that matched the MAC address of your Xbox. &nbsp;You can find the MAC address on the
 xbox in the xbox at settings&gt;Network&gt; detailed network settings.</p>
<p>Once you match the MAC- be sure to go back to the port forwarding that you set up in the router and make sure its the same IP address in that table- if not you need to change it to the IP address you made in the Address reservation.</p>
<p>Once this is complete check your NAT. &nbsp;If its still not open, I suggest two things: &nbsp;Try unchecking UPnP (lots of contradictory information even on Netgear site about leaving it checked with forwarding also) . &nbsp;If that fails I would go wired, as maybe there
 is something with the firmware and wireless on Xbox One.</p>
<p>Let us know.</p>

<p>have you tried factory reset via the hole in the back of the router </p>
<p>I had the same problem with the strict NAT after updating the firmware &amp; factory reset (via the browser page (10.0.0.1) I still had a Strict NAT connection
</p>
<p>So I thought start from scratch &amp; Factory reset via the hole in the back with a paper clip straightened out a bit wait for the lights to &nbsp;all flash @ once pull clip out then Test I got a open NAT straight up</p>
<p>the firmware must need to be reset to start working the new version</p>
<p>Hope this helps some ppl with this awesome Router cant wait for the new one with the built in modem
</p>
<p>Now that's going to be a beast</p>

<p>I did have a moderate NAT when switching from my One to my 360 and was wondering if that was the initial issue. In order to fix it I turned off UPnP and turned it back on and it opened it up. I don't know if that is the issue or not. Please let me know so
 I can try to help as much as possible.</p>

<p>This happens to me also when I have any internet blink outage.</p>
<p>Try resetting your router router, but also clearing the alternate Mac address on your console.</p>
<p>You can find it in settings - &nbsp;network settings - advanced settings.</p>
<p>When you clear it, console will reboot and you should have an open Nat type.</p>
<p>I hope this will help!</p>

<p>UPnP or Port forwarding, not both. Personally I recommend using DMZ instead.</p>
<p>The following may also help if you are still having problems.</p>
<p>From the xbox forums for this router:</p>
<p>Firewall</p>
<p>1.Login to router by entering <a href="http://routerlogin.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://routerlogin.net</a> &nbsp;in to the address bar or by entering the default gateway IP address.</p>
<p>2.The router will then prompt you to enter the username and password.</p>
<p>the default user name and password are: "admin", "password".</p>
<p>3.Select the Advanced tab from the tabs at the top.</p>
<p>4.Select Setup from the menu on the left.</p>
<p>5.From the submenu &nbsp;select WAN Setup.</p>
<p>6.Check the Disable SIP ALG</p>
<p>7.Change NAT Filtering from secured to Open.</p>
<p>8.Click the Apply button.</p>

    <title>How can I determine the bus speed of RAM&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I determine the bus speed of RAM&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've installed new 4GB RAM replacing the previously installed 3GB RAM. The previous 3GB RAM had 667MHz bus speed (I found it in the user manual). The new 4GB RAM as the seller told me has 800MHz bus speed. Now I want to be sure that the seller didn't cheat
 me and he did provide me the 800MHz bus speed RAM. How can I determine the bus speed of my installed RAM? My system configuration is following:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit</p>
<p>Core2Duo 2.1GHz</p>
<p>4GB DDR2 RAM</p>
<p>Intel GMA 4500MHD</p>
<p>Model: Acer Aspire 5738</p>
<p>I've two DDR2 soDIMM modules, previously I had one 1GB DDR2 667MHz + one 2GB DDR2 667MHz RAM = 3GB DDR2 667MHz RAM (from my system user manual provided by Acer)</p>
<p>Now, after replacing, I have two 2GB DDR2 800MHz RAM = 4GBD DDR2 800MHz RAM (As the seller told me and I saw it written in the packet when he was unpacking and installing it)</p>
<p>How can I determine the bus speed of my RAM and be confirmed that I've really got the 800MHz? Please anyone help me about this. Thanks.</p>

<p>When using CPU-Z, you double the 400Mhz, which would make it 800MHz.</p>
<p>I do see a problem which may create a problem for you though. You have <strong>
mixed</strong> memory of different brands and different settings. One of your sticks is running different timings than the other one is at the same speed. This could create a potential problem.</p>
<p>It's always best to run&nbsp;memory that has matched settings, and same manufacturer if possible.</p>

<p>Four ways I can think of real quick:<br />
1- the label on the RAM (assuming that it's there, and that you truct he didn't change it);<br />
2- install <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z/versions-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CPU-Z</a>.&nbsp; It'll be listed on the Memory tab;<br />
3- install <a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Belarc Advisor</a>.&nbsp; It'll also list that (as well as a whole lot more about the system.)<br />
4- take a look at the POST screen when the system is starting - it <em>should</em> show RAM info.</p>
<p>All of the above, though, assumes that not only is 800MHz RAM installed, but that the system is actually<em>running</em> it at 800MHz.<br />
Here, CPU-Z would be the best choice, as it'll give you the actual manufacturer's part# for the RAM; you can use that to find the manufacturer's specs.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />
Chris</p>

    <title>Windows 8&#40;.1&#41; UAC dialog delay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rainer meier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8&#40;.1&#41; UAC dialog delay</h2>
                    Sometimes when a process asks elevation (or is manually executed with elevation) the UAC dialog pops up very quickly:<br />
<ul>
<li>Screen is darkened</li><li>Dialog "User Account Control" is displayed immediately offering to select another account, smart card, fingerprint or Mircrosoft account</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But sometimes the dialog pops up but displays a progress bar with title "Just a moment" which takes several seconds up to ~half a minute before displaying the account selection.</p>
<p>Does anybody know what is causing these delays and what Windows is waiting for if it keeps me waiting before presenting the options?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am using Windows 8(.1) Professional on a Laptop with fingerprint sensor. But I have seen the same delay issue also on desktop machines and different Laptops. The appearance of this delay seems to be random and not related to type of application (signed/unsigned,
 trusted/non-trusted). For example I can launch regedit.exe and once the UAC dialog shows up immediately while on next attempt it keeps me waiting for ~10 seconds at the "just a moment" progress bar.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anybody experiencing the same issue? Any solution/workaround known?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know it's quite a small issue but it's still annoying. Especially sitting in front of the Laptop having to wait for the UAC dialog to provide the options.</p>
<p>Even worse, I am using a local account without admin privileges and I have registered one of my fingerprints to a local admin account. So when the UAC dialog pops up I just need to swipe my finger across the sensor to grant admin privileges. Now when the
 UAC dialog is on delay and I swipe my finger while the "just a moment" progress bar is displayed, then Windows will actually switch the user account and log on to the local admin account which is registered for this fingerprint (yes, this even happens when
 screen is already darkened and UAC dialog is preparing).</p>
<p>So clicking on an UAC-triggering item and swiping the finger while not carefully watching the screen whether UAC is ready yet will often cause me to do a full logon of the admin account requiring me to switch users again and start over with the UAC action.
 Very annoying.<br />

Unfortunately this answer is totally unrelated to the question. This happens on fresh installations of Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro. I did not claim any problems with the dialog itself or when it pops up or not. My UAC settings are at default level. The
 dialog also comes up properly if an application requests elevation.<br />
<br />
However in some cases the screen turns black and the dialog just displays a progress bar with the title "just a moment" for several seconds before presenting the account selection screen. In some other cases the dialog immediately shows account selection options.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The UAC screen shows different options depending whether you're logged on using a local administrator account or a limited user account. Here I am referring to the dialog opened when logged in with limited user account. In this dialog you need to select
 an account which has local administrator privileges as opposed to the simple yes/continue dialog shown if the account logged on currently is a member of the administrators group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Somehow I get the feeling Microsoft staff anwering here completely got lost in their own technologies. Mixing up things in the most weird way possible and answering with completely unrelated default answers. Also answers regarding SkyDrive issues with roaming
 profiles makes me believe that neither programmers nor supporters at Microsoft do even know what features Windows supports and how they work. Very sad.<br />

            <p>Agree with Rainer's comments. The quality of the answers from Microsoft personnel is abysmal and quite frankly rather scary. These support people are either very poorly trained or incompetent or both. If their own support people can't figure things out,
 where do they think their customers stand? No matter how good a product is, it's only as good as it's weakest link and the support absolutely sucks!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I suspect their development teams are now so far removed from users that they end up building products that are
<strong><u><em>unusable </em></u></strong>by default. &nbsp;It's really really sad though, I still believe Microsoft has
<strong><u><em>potentially</em></u></strong> some of the best products and the best integrated eco system, but they seem to find almost unbelievable ways to screw things up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I work in a 100%&nbsp;Microsoft shop but&nbsp;we are now increasingly looking at alternatives which was unthinkable just a year ago. Sad.</p>

            <p>Hey Guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the same problem, and it's pity that we hear this type of answers from Microsoft. For sure because it's not affecting fair bit of their customers so they don't want to address it now as per not so many users who have Windows 8.1. I tried a workaround
 and it succeeded. First I tried all sort of troubleshooting, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1- I've tried and deleted all the registry keys cached for the machine I was trying to log in to.</p>
<p>2- I've disabled the UAC as the Microsoft Tech asked us to do.</p>
<p>3- I've tried different Credentials.</p>
<p>4- I've tried to log in different computer via the remote desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above worked. The only thing that I've tried and it did work and the windows security screen popup asking for credentials in less than a second was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Add the Ip address or the host name for the machine you want to connect to.</p>
<p>* In the Username field just add the Domain name then the (\) symbol in my case it was like this XX\</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can save it now and try to double click the shortcut and the security screen popup will ask you straight away for your credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: </p>
<p>I think this issue is only related to domain environments, because I've tried to log in to my home computer using the same computer which had the RDP issue and it did work straight away even though I provided my credentials, but if I tried to do the same
 thing and connect to my work environment it doesn't work and windows security popup keep saying "Just a moment". I hope my comment helped. Peace out folks.</p>

            <p>I have been experiencing the same issue.&nbsp; Tonight, it finally got the better of me.&nbsp; I waited more than two minutes after right-clicking a downloaded .exe and clicking Run As Administrator.<br />
Found a fix or work-around for it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I right-clicked the .exe file and clicked Properties.</p>
<p>Noticed a Digital Signatures tab, so clicked that.</p>
<p>Highlighted the digital signature (in this case, QNAP), and clicked Details.</p>
<p>On the Digital Signature Details page, General Tab, clicked View Certificate.</p>
<p>On the Certificate page, General Tab, clicked Install Certificate.</p>
<p>On the Certificate Import Wizard Tab, chose Local Machine (instead of Current User), and clicked Next.</p>
<p>In order to make this change, was prompted to enter admin credentials; this worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>Chose "Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate" and clicked Next.</p>
<p>Windows informed me that the certificate would be placed in the Content store.</p>
<p>Clicked Finish.</p>
<p>Right-clicked the original .exe file and clicked Run As Administrator - was Immediately prompted for credentials instead of being forced to wait several minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone else,</p>

    <title>Blue Screen Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blue Screen Error</h2>
                    <p>Hey, guys hope your all having a good day. The following issue has been happening for some time now and I've decided that I cannot ignore it any longer. It The issue occurs randomly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be using my computer and all of a sudden it would become slow and laggy. If I were playing a game it would become unbearable. Sometimes I would even be on my desktop and it would start to get really slow and stutter a lot. I would have a really hard
 time even attempting to restart my computer. If I did manage to restart my computer the issue would be fixed until it would start to become slow again. However, if I was not able to restart fast enough I would get a blue screen which I will show below. (Sorry
 I don't know how to make it a spoiler tab)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I also ran into your problem,&nbsp;This PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. I talked to a Answer Desk tech guy and he gave me steps to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix blue screen error by updating the display adapter:</p>
<p>1. Please right click on start menu and click on device manager.</p>
<p>2. On the list of devices menu, please choose display adapter.<br />
3. Please click on display adapter then see what are the display devices on the list. (For me, it is:&nbsp;Intel HD Graphics &amp; Microsoft Basic Display Adapter)<br />
4. Please choose Intel HD Graphics then click on next to install it (manual update).</p>
<p>5. It should say installing a success.</p>
<p>6. Please restart your device for the change to take affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least Intel HD Graphics is for my device.</p>
<p>p.s.&nbsp;The blue screen error has something to do with display adapter? Intel graphics driver is the device to make the viewing display work properly. Also, the updates should be able to detect updates, but in many cases, it will not, since the latest driver
 is updated. That is when manually update driver is needed. He told me that he helped people with this type of issue many of times. That should work for others who have the same issues as me. :) Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Does psngames.org offer unlegitimate licenses&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I normally don't do this kind of posts, but my experience with psngames.org is one I would like to share.</p><p>Last Tuesday, I saw CoD WW2 for a bargain at psngames.org. It was priced at €32.5.</p><p>Because I was quite rushed, I did not thoroughly check their site before ordering. So I pressed the buy button and ordered the game.</p><p><br /></p><p>After confirming my purchase on paypal, I was linked to a page that gave me '<a href="https://psngames.org/setup-guide-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">activation instructions</a>'.&nbsp;</p><p>I was expecting a voucher code which I could then redeem to my account, but what I got were credentials to a new microsoft account where the game was purchased on.</p><p><br /></p><p>Since I did not want this, I asked psngames for refund. They told me this was not possible and that nowhere on their site, they say that they give a refund.</p><p>I pointed them to the following line in the activation guide: <br />"and you’re 100%
I see that CoD WW2 is sold out on the website and I still didn't receive a new account
should I be worried?

Suse
No, we just stopped selling new copies and working on delivery of copies that were ordered already

Me
you told me that the delivery deadline is before 30/12
what happens when you guys cannot deliver before this deadline?

Suse
Then it will be delivered later, but i'm sure that it will be delivered before that date

Me
so, the deadline has no real value or meaning?
since there is such a big backlog, isn't it better for both parties to offer a refund?

Suse
Well, in case it won't be delivered within that time - your order 
will be set into high priority, but it shouldn't take that long</pre>









































<p>So, the deadline they provide is quite useless, which is red flag number 2 for me.</p><p><br /></p><p>I then realized that I received the credentials of a microsoft account. There is more to do with it than just logging on on xbox.</p><p>I had a look at the mailbox of the account.</p><p>There was a purchase of the game on Tuesday for €58,09. Purchased with a Visa card (**0620).</p><p>But also a refund has been asked for the game, 16 hours later (26/12 6:31 pm). This was before I even logged in on the account.</p><p>This is clearly red flag 3 to me.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>A few days later, I received credentials for a new account.</p><p>This time, the account had the game installed. When I looked in the account's mailbox, I saw that the game has been ordered again for €58.09 with a Visa card (**7815). Which is red flag 4. How can a legitimate company buy something for €58.09 and then sell it for €32.5?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyway, I contacted xbox support meanwhile to inform them about this. T
</p><pre><p>Suse<br />Hello. How may I help you?

Me<br />Hi Suse<br />I just had a quick chat with xbox support about my issues with this service<br />they told me the following<br />Thank you for that information. It does not seem like a legit service from the sound of everything. Most of those sites do usually get shut down and looked into over time since it does have something against the Terms of Use as well. One thing I would do is make a forum post on the Xbox.com site as most of that information is looked at through there and is monitored. So it has an increased chance of seeing it there!<br />Why is this?

Suse<br />Let me check your case please<br />I'm not exactly understand what is your question, sorry, we confirmed that problem is on our side and set your order into replacement site, we will provide you working details as soon as it will be possible

Me<br />the issue is this service. I logged in into the hotmail mailbox and I saw that a legit order was made which has then been refunded. I asked microsoft about this and they gave me the answer I just gave you. Why is Microsoft saying that this service is not genuine? Why can't I have a refund?

Suse<br />Our suppliers is investigating the problem with this account and the problem is on their side, as soon as we will be able to resolve this situation - new details will be delivered to your email instantly after that. We're not able to provide a refund for the order that has been taken into the process due to agreement with out payment supplier

Me<br />What is the ultimate thing you can do to proof that psngames.org is not a scam site?

Suse<br />Well, what exactly would proof you that its not a scam site/

Me<br />a refund or vendor details perhaps

Suse<br />I'm afraid we don't provide such details in support chat, he we're only providing support for orders and answering the questions about our site

Me<br />I see that the game has been bought on the account for €58.09. How is psngames.org able to resell this game for €32,49?

Suse<br />Probably that was a mistake that our suppliers made and get the refund back because of that, i'm not exactly sure, sorry

Me<br />I'll make a story on the official xbox forum and reddit about psngames that this is complete scam. You have one more chance to prove me wrong.

Suse<br />If you wish i can open a ticket for my supervisor and you can ask for such information from him

Me<br />Sure, I'll wait one more day. Tell him everything and make him email me.

Suse<br />Sure

Me<br />Good, you have 24 hours!
</p></pre><p><br /> </p><p>The next morning, I did receive a reply from their 'supervisor':</p><blockquote><blockquote>Hello, our website is legit and we are in this business for 5 years already and we were not shut down. We use trusted suppliers but it looks likes there is a problem with new xbox supplier. I will investigate in your case and check why is that happening. I'm really sorry for that to happen.</blockquote></blockquote><p>So yeah, no proof of authenticity.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyway, I think it's good to inform people and Xbox about this vendor. I really doubt they are doing legitimate stuff and everyone should avoid them in my opinion.<br /></p>

<h2>            Списали средства, а доступа нет &#91;Edit - Translation&#93; - Written off funds, but no access</h2>
                    <p>Добрый день!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Приобрел 14 дневную версию Xbox Game Pass. Для этого указал данные кредитной карты. После получения услуги, карту удалять не стал.</p>
<p>По окончании периода(14 дней), система попыталась снять средства 599 рублей. Ничего не получилось, т.к. на карте не было денег и услугу Xbox Game Pass заблокировали(игры не доступны). Когда на карте появились деньги, списали 599 рублей, но услуга не активна
 и нет информации в личном кабинете. Звонил на горячую линию Xbox в России, по номеру 8(10) 800-20-581-044, никто не взял трубку(звонил в рабочее время). В личном кабинете не могу убрать карту, т.к. требую оплатить Xbox Game Pass,&nbsp; но с меня списали деньги
 и почему мне нужно оплачивать еще? Почему не восстанавливают доступ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Прикладываю смс и скриншот личного кабинета:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Mod Removed Personal Information]: </strong>Oplata 599.00 RUB;Microsoft*Store;18.02.2019 16:25,dostupno XXXXXX RUB</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Edit - Translation] - Good day!</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Acquired the 14 day version of the Xbox Game Pass. For this indicated credit card details. After receiving the service, the card did not delete.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>At the end of the period (14 days), the system attempted to withdraw 599 rubles. Nothing happened because there was no money on the card and the Xbox Game Pass service was blocked (games are not available). When money appeared on the card, they wrote
 off 599 rubles, but the service is not active and there is no information in the personal account. I called the Xbox hotline in Russia, at 8 (10) 800-20-581-044, no one picked up the phone (called during business hours). I cannot remove the card in my account,
 because I demand to pay for the Xbox Game Pass, but I have been charged money. Why do I need to pay more? Why not restore access?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I attach sms and screenshot of personal account:</strong><br />

<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Customer Support</a></p>
<p>If you haven't already, try cancelling your reoccurring billing from that same website you have in your screenshot.</p>

<div>Привет, вы проверили под Xbox службы принадлежат и посмотреть, если он показывает на фактической консоли?, также вы можете проверить выставление счетов и платежей для всех услуг подписки, которые в настоящее время активны, но если ваша карта обыкновение
 удалить это, потому что он требует вторичного метода т.е. PayPal или другой кредитной карты, прежде чем вы можете удалить его из системы у меня была такая же проблема, я прошу прощения за любые расстройства, вызванные этой ситуацией.</div>

<p>Спасибо <br />

<p>Hi, have you checked under the Xbox services belong and see if it shows on the actual console?, also you can check the billing and payment for all subscription services that are currently active, but if your card wont delete This because it requires a secondary
 method i.e. PayPal or another credit card before you can remove it from the system I had the same problem, I apologize for any frustration caused by this situation.</p>
<p>Thank you Alec&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi, I have very similar problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to have a separate Skype account (until its integration with Microsoft ID). Then, once it happened that all application (on all mobile devices and windows) got updated and during the log in the system requested to an email. At the moment I already
 had a Microsoft ID (the one I am using now - *** <em>Email removed for Privacy </em>
***) and hence the system would never take it to record as a primary alias for the account. So, after trying really many times, I have entered a wrong one. Now, I cannot change primary alias because naturally because of the typo in it, I do not have access
 to the email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, after searching through the community, it was recommended that one creates a new (which I am very reluctant to do given the number of connections / contacts I have on my old account) - but my mobile phone number is also linked to the Microsoft
 ID, which means I cannot use it to create new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate your support in getting access to my old account and potentially merging old skype id with my existing Microsoft ID, if possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrii</p>

<p>Dear Mark,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your support. I had a chat with the Live Support yesterday night and unfortunately we did not manage to resolve the situation in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have gone through all the possible steps trying to add a new alias, which (as I mentioned above is not possible from the user perspective, as it was already changed once and not confirmed, hence second change is impossible without confirming the initially
 (and wrongly) entered email address) did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was recommended to go through the account recovery process, which I did successfully this morning. This has allowed me to change my password. However, this does not resolve the issue with changing primary alias to the email address I have access to. The
 primary alias remains the same, I do not have access to the email address to confirm it to be able to change it to something else. I would appreciate your support on this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Andrii</p>

<h3> david_debates  say:</h3>
<h2>            radeon hd 7600 driver error in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Each time my newly updated Windows 10 machine restarts I get a INTERNAL POWER ERROR after about 3 minutes.</p>
<p>I went into safe mode and uninstalled the Radeon HD 7600 Video Driver.</p>
<p>This resolved the error from returning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I than update my AMD Radeon drivers with the current version which is supposed to be compatible.</p>
<p>After restarting in normal mode I get the same error.&nbsp; So the only way for the computer to operate is with the onboard Intel Video Driver which of course stink if you want to play any games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are this driver errors being address with the manufacturers or is there any resolution coming via an update.</p>

<h3> bigmykul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playing games, videos lag,jerks,freezes.  Sound skipping and stuttering</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire 5515.&nbsp; It has an AMD Athlon processor 2650e 1.6GHz.&nbsp; 3G RAM.&nbsp; It is running VISTA Home Basic.&nbsp; it has an ATI Radeon x1200 video card.&nbsp; i have directx10.<br />
<br />
The games and movies that I had been playing with no problems started to lag.&nbsp; At first it was very brieg, maybe a second.&nbsp; Then it started getting worse.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first game that got bad was Left 4 Dead.&nbsp; I downloaded an add-on scenerio and started to play.&nbsp;
 The game started to freeze up.&nbsp; The play and control was sluggish and choppy.&nbsp; The sound became stuttered,&nbsp; sometimes the same sound being repeated multiple times, like echos.&nbsp; This would last for about 30-60 sec.&nbsp; Then the game would start playing normally.&nbsp;
 I uninstalled the entire game and reinstalled it without the add-on.&nbsp; I then tried to play with same results.&nbsp; I have restored my computer twice to factory specs.&nbsp; Same results.&nbsp; This happens whether I play online or single player.&nbsp; The movies&nbsp;and videos&nbsp;(AVI,
 MPG...etc) that I watch also started to have this same problem.&nbsp; They will play fine for some time, then the video and audio lose sync.&nbsp; The sound will come out first, and when the mouths move it is not the same a the words heard.&nbsp; Sometimes this will last
 at least a minute.&nbsp; Then the movie will sync back for a bit and do the same.&nbsp; I tried an older game (AOE2).&nbsp; It has smooth play for some time, then it will have a brief freeze up lasting about 5 sec.&nbsp; I have tried adjusting the video, audio and other settings
 with no discernable improvement.&nbsp; I disabled my anti-virus, adaware and spybot.&nbsp; No noticable changes.&nbsp; My internet explorer does not seem to be affected.&nbsp; What can be the problem.&nbsp; It seemed to start when I downloaded the add-on.&nbsp; Could there have been malware
 inside of there?&nbsp; My antivirus has not detected any.

<p><span>Hi BigMykul,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue here seems to be with the missing code pack for Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>A codec is software that is used to compress or decompress a digital media file, such as a song or video.
 When you play a digital media file, Windows Media Player uses a codec to decompress the file. Codecs are used to create and play nearly all music or video files on your computer or on Web sites.</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Codec Installation pack from the link below and install it on the computer and restart the computer
 once: <br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/format/codecdownload.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/format/codecdownload.aspx</span></span></a></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>I will also suggest you to install the latest driver for the video card by downloading it from the manufacturer’s
 website for game related issues and also check the sound settings of the games.</span></p>

 the printers heading, but it is grayed out and has a yellow exclamation mark that was not able to be fixed or diagnosed with a troubleshoot.&nbsp; The printer is connected locally.&nbsp; I'm not sure exactly what the ssue is but any advice would be appreciated.

            <p>I have a question. &nbsp;My printer has always been fine, then I moved home and now it only photocopies. &nbsp;I uninstalled, reinstalled using correct actual driver (updates are ok), and it keeps saying 'needs to troubleshoot, not recognising printer'. &nbsp;But troubleshoot
 says its ok. &nbsp;Done all checks and tested settings, all are just how they always were. &nbsp;It is driving me crazy. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Printer is not wireless, just a standard 3 in one. &nbsp;Nothing has changed andprinter is working, test page works and it photocopies. &nbsp;What can I do? &nbsp;Please advise if you can. &nbsp; Thank you</p>

<h2>            Alt codes not working properly</h2>
                    Hi, some time ago my keyboard switched from English to Spanish (My version of windows is in spanish, my keyboard is in spanish layout BUT im used to english keyboard layouts so I keep it on english), when i tried to turn that back alt codes stopped working,
 they will just not type anything, then I changed my system locale from (i dont know why it was set this way) Japanese (Japan) to English (United States). Now alt codes are only recognizing the last keystroke, typing alt+164 will do the same as alt+4, so on
 so forth, anyone know what might be the problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p>You're never going to get this question answered.&nbsp; This problem is the result of a conspiracy and you and I are victims of said conspiracy.&nbsp; This is why no one answers the question and the only "solutions" are irrelevant to your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your alt codes stop working entirely, Microsoft is probably punishing you on behalf of the NSA for not being a shill to the whims of the state.</p>
