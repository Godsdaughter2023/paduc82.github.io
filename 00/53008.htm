    <title>Task manager does not start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> key84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task manager does not start</h2>
                    When I try to start the task manager by right clicking the activity bar and selecting start task manager I get an error saying the taskmgr.exe file can not be found. The path suggesteed is C:\Windows\system32\taskmgr.exe. When looking in that folder the
 file is there.<br />
<br />
If I do ctrl-alt-delete and select to start it from there I get returned to the previous screen without task manager or error.<br />
<br />
Ctrl-shift-esc has no effect.<br />
<br />
I've tried running a copy of the taskmgr.exe that worked on another computer running 64-bit Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I am running a 64-bit Windows 7 on Intel Core2 Quad (Q8300)<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            I still recommend giving Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware a run (it is free) if nothing else solves your problem.<br />
<br />
You might like to try right-clicking on&nbsp;taskmgr.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you tried copying the taskmgr.exe from System32 and placing it either on your Desktop, or in your Documents folder, and try running it from there?&nbsp; While you have it in those last two locations, if it does not run, try changing the name of taskmgr.exe
 to somethingelse.exe.&nbsp; <br />
Do you have mention of taskmgr.exe anywhere in this Registry Key, probably not, but if you do try removing it (taskmgr.exe)?<br />
<br />

Did you try the System restore, or the System File Checker?<br />
<br />
<br />
This program can be used to see what is happening, in the background, when you launch Task Manager.<br />

    <title>Audio stutter after 1803 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael broderick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio stutter after 1803</h2>
                    I have a Bose Mini II SoundLink. The Bluetooth audio now stutters after installing 1803. This problem was resolved a long time ago by disabling the Handsfree Telephony service. But now the problem is back even with that disabled. Anyone else have this
 problem?

            First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level

            As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

    <title>Windows 8 missing winload.efi error with recovery disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scion1969  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 missing winload.efi error with recovery disk</h2>
                    I came home from work today and my computer was working fine.&nbsp; I went out for a little while with some friends and when I returned, the screen was blank and the hard disk drive was spinning.&nbsp; I couldn't get any response from the computer and had to just
 do a hard shut down.&nbsp; When I restarted the computer, it tried to boot up, but then stated it was starting the system repair process.<br />
<br />
It came to a blue screen with a few options, that I can't remember at the moment.<br />
<br />
The error code that was given was 0xc0000185.&nbsp; I hit the enter button as it told me and it tried again.&nbsp; It returned to that blue screen, but there was an additional piece of information, that the winload.efi file was apparently the issue.<br />
<br />
After buying the computer, I was instructed to make a recovery thing, which I did using a 32 GB USB flash drive.&nbsp; After much messing about, I think I figured out how to get the system to look at that drive.&nbsp; I had to go into the boot order options and set the
 USB port as the first one.&nbsp; Having done that, I figured I had it worked out, since this was the supposed recovery disk and it should have been able to fix the problem.&nbsp; Au contraire, mon frere.&nbsp; Unfortunately.<br />
<br />
The computer did seem to recognize the USB flash drive.&nbsp; And it seemed to recognize that something to make it go was there.&nbsp; It didn't go back to that blue screen.&nbsp; However, after going through the initial screen stating the name of the manufacturer, it then
 cycled into a black screen.&nbsp; The indicator light for the hard drive (I assume that is what the light was for) then just went into a blink for some minutes before a new blue screen appeared for a few seconds saying something about the system encountering an
 error and it was going to restart for me.&nbsp; Then it cycled through that series of steps again, ad infinitum.<br />
<br />
So the recovery disk isn't.&nbsp; And now I am stuck.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I have some files I have been working with on the computer that I haven't backed up in a while.&nbsp; I have a lot of work in them and I would hate to lose them.&nbsp; But I don't think I have
 the capability to reformat on my own anyway.<br />
<br />
In addition, I bought the computer in Canada earlier this year, but I am now living and working in Korea.&nbsp; They have fairly sophisticated systems for repair here, but I don't know that I can communicate the issue well enough to be able to access any useful
 help.<br />
<br />
Help!<br />

            <p>​Hi Scion,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>usually this issue occur if there is system/setup file is missing in the recovery disk. I would like to know some information about the Recovery issue so that we could assist you further.<br />
1. What is the make and model number of the computer?<br />
2. What is the exact error message that you get?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have a recovery disk, then I would suggest you to create Windows 8 Installation Media from a different Windows 8 computer and then try to perform Automatic repair and check if it works for you.</p>
<p>Refer to the following Microsoft Help article to create an installation Media.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2780338/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2780338/en-us</a><br />

            Hello Basith,<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for taking time to try and help me.&nbsp; I will try to give you the information you need.&nbsp; I hope I can give you enough information for you to be able to make some kind of determination.<br />
<br />
First you wish to know the make and model of the computer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am not exactly sure which model this is.&nbsp; Acer seems to have a number of models that are fairly close to the same and have most of the same instructions, so the instructions that came
 with the computer have three different models.&nbsp; They are Aspire E1-521, E1-531, and E1-571.&nbsp; It is the one with the Intel Core i5 chip, if that helps.<br />
<br />
I get these a couple of error messages.<br />
<br />
When I turn on the computer without the recovery USB stick inserted, I get the Acer logo for a few seconds, then a message stating that the system is "Preparing Automatic Repair."<br />
<br />
Then a blue screen comes up.&nbsp; At the top is the title "Recovery"<br />
<br />
Then it says:<br />
<br />
Your PC needs to be repaired.<br />
<br />
A required device isn't connected or can't be accessed.<br />
<br />
Error code:&nbsp; 0xc0000185<br />
<br />
You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media.&nbsp; If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your system adminstrator or PC manufacturer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Press Enter to try again<br />
Press F8 for Startup Settings<br />
Press Esc for UEFI Firmware Settings<br />
<br />
<br />
Pressing Enter or F8 only results in the screen going black for a few seconds and the blue screen reappearing with most of the same stuff, but a couple of additional lines.<br />
<br />
<br />
The application or operating system couldn't be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.<br />
<br />
File: \Windows\system32\winload.efi<br />
Error code:&nbsp; 0xc0000185<br />
<br />
You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media.&nbsp; If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your system adminstrator or PC manufacturer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Press Enter to try again<br />
Press F8 for Startup Settings<br />
Press Esc for UEFI Firmware Settings<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pressing Esc leads to a screen labeled InsydeH20 SetupUtility (where I have just noticed the model is the Acer E1-571)&nbsp; I can find a bunch of information about the computer including the boot order for devices which I had to change to put the USB first so I
 could try to boot from there.&nbsp; I hope that was the right move.<br />
<br />
Once I did that and it appeared the computer was booting from the USB stick (or rather trying to, as it didn't ending up starting the computer), it acted differently.&nbsp; It did seem to recognize that the USB stick was there and in place.&nbsp; It seemed to be trying
 to do something from the USB stick and recovery media.&nbsp; The Acer logo appeared as before, but it didn't tell me it was "Preparing Automatic Recovery."<br />
<br />
The "I'm working" light on the computer flashed, as did the lights on the USB stick indicating it was being accessed.&nbsp; This continued for a few seconds and then stopped.&nbsp; The "I'm working" light on the computer then began a rhythmic on and off flashing of a
 couple of seconds on and then a couple of seconds off.&nbsp; This continues for a few minutes and then a different blue screen comes up for a couple of seconds.<br />
<br />
It starts with an unhappy face emoticon (&nbsp; :(&nbsp; )<br />
<br />
Then it says:<br />
<br />
Your computer ran into a problem and needs to restart.&nbsp; We're just collecting some error data and then we'll restart for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then it goes back to the start screen and goes through that again until I stop the process by turning the computer off.<br />
<br />

            A bit more information:&nbsp; I do have rescue media.&nbsp; I created it on a USB stick when Windows 8 told me to do that after beginning to use the computer.&nbsp; Now perhaps I am misusing the&nbsp; USB stick and rescue files.&nbsp; Perhaps I am doing something else incorrectly.&nbsp;
 Perhaps there is some problem with the rescue files themselves, for some reason.&nbsp; And perhaps there is some other problem with the computer that makes the rescue files immaterial.&nbsp; Perhaps you have enough information to make some kind of determination.<br />
<br />
Should I attempt to get a different copy of the rescue media?<br />
<br />
Should I be trying a copy of the installation disc?&nbsp; Can I do that on a non-Windows 8 machine (I have a Windows XP netbook)?<br />
<br />
Have I done something wrong to get the computer to read off the USB stick?&nbsp; Can you describe the steps (in language that isn't too technical) how to go about doing that?<br />
<br />
I am really hoping that I can recover some files that I have just finished creating on the computer, but have not backed up.&nbsp; And I have photos for the past couple of months on there that are also not yet backed up.<br />
<br />
If I can get those, then I would be all right with formatting and re-installing.&nbsp; It would be even better, of course, to just somehow recover the whole system and not have to re-install all the programs and applications that I have installed since I bought
 it.<br />

            Oh, and I don't think it has anything to do with anything I have done to the computer.&nbsp; I haven't installed anything in the past couple of months.&nbsp; There was an update from Microsoft a few days ago, but it was working fine for a couple of days before this
 happened, so I also doubt it would have anything to do with that update.&nbsp; But then, I am not an expert in this, so maybe I am mistaken.&nbsp; Again, you would know far better than I.<br />

            Yes, I found a solution.  I was extremely suspicious about the timing of it all.  The Windows 8.1 update had been applied and I believe it was a trigger of some sort.  But the ultimate problem was that the hard disk packed it in (Samsung is ****), and I had to replace it.  Then I was able to use the recovery usb that Windows had had me create to reinstall the system to its original specs.  I lost a bunch of data, but that will teach me. 



I hope you find a less drastic solution.  Good luck.

<h2>            Skype Translator</h2>
                    I am forced now to use Skype for Windows 10 in order to use the translator BUT IT DOES NOT WORK. I have clicked the icon I wish to call, clicked profile, Clicked start translator and it tells me it is ready to translate my calls , so I make the video call
 and start chatting but the translator doesn't work. The same happens in revers from my friend. They are using&nbsp; Skype 8.14 is this a problem? I am using 12. something or other. I have clicked our icons during a call and a box opens with the option to start
 translator but clicking it does absolutely not If this thing is working properly and Skype status maintains all is well then there needs to be some detailed instructions to cover such problems rather than the cryptic " click it and it should work mentality.
 Please can someone solve this problem. I need to use the translator every day and never had a problem with 7.40 but of course in their wisdom Micrososft have "improved" on that??

<h2>            Assign Drive Letter by Batch File</h2>
                    <p>I have been having some problems with an external Sata hard drive on my Windows 7 PC. When I reboot, the drive does not maintain its letter. The drive is new, but I also had the same problem with another drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this problem can’t be fixed, I would like to create a batch file to assign the drive a letter quickly and automatically rather than doing it manually through ‘Computer Management’.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know the wording, which I should use in the batch file? Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 commands with Long path name are not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.112)<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried following to enable long path name support on my windows 10 system -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Set the registry key at&nbsp;<br />
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem LongPathsEnabled (Type: REG_DWORD)<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Enabled&nbsp;<br />
Group Policy at Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System &gt; Filesystem &gt;&nbsp;Enable Win32 long paths</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted the system after setting registry and enabling group policy but I still can not use long path name with windows commands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please suggest what else needs to be done to enable long path name on windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hello Yogesh,<br />
<br />
<br />
By enabling Win32 long paths via Local Group Policy or Registry Editor will allow manifested win32 applications and Windows Store applications to access paths beyond the normal 260 characters limit per node on file systems that support it. In line with your
 concern, I'd like to verify if your trying to create a program that needs to access long paths. If so, I'd like to inform you that this concern is best facilitated on our
<em><strong>MSDN forums</strong></em>. The community includes developers that would be able to share their expertise in relation to your concern. To visit the site, click on this

            Not even Windows Explorer in&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Windows 10 insider, the build 17741.rs5_ release.180814-1430 works with long filenames anymore...<br />
<br />
Its just plain of BROKEN...<br />
<br />
I can open the files I already have, MAde by different software, and also moved around with earlier versions of Windows Explorer...<br />
<br />
But today after updating to this version, I can no longer create long filenames in any software when saving.<br />
I can neither create a filename in a folder with a path over 260 characters in total, and if I create a file in a folder with a total path of i.e. 250 character, the filename is cut to 10 characters...<br />
<br />
and this is in Windows Explorer, Windows own file handler !!!<br />
<br />
Just fix it, don't try to talk around the problem, its BROKEN ! The Feature is BROKEN !!!</span>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry been a bit slack ...I thought I had an infringement on the community and was locked out? Only new to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have scanned using the wonderful HP system--No errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it has mainly something to do with the Microsoft SQL server Compact edition (ENU) 3.1.000</p>
<p>Unfortunately I uninstalled it by mistake (on advice) have reinstalled it but a different date.. 12/8/2016 off the web.</p>
<p>I did notice that the same program on my Tosiba is dated 26/7/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Home 2016 on HP</p>
<p>&nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2015 on Toshiba&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Toshiba laptop is all working fine so I can load photos resize them and email them etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny thing Photos from old computor are still on an external hard drive...Have not brought them in yet until I get this thing going.</p>
<p>But if I connect the external drive to USB and open Documents All the photo files appear.When I click on a specific file&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thumb nail photos all appear it flicks into picture tools for the opening --then clicking on a specific photo it opens under picture tools full screen size photo gallery takes over and up the top there is a photo email prompt clicking on this it goes
 to resize selection it attaches -live mail appears and the photo can be emailed as an attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not installed the anniverary update on either computors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry its so lengthy but hope I have given you some clues??</p>

<p>I doubt 4J Studios or Mojang will add Tekkit. I don't think 4J Studios have rights to take it from the creators of Tekkit even though the Tekkit creators simply modded Minecraft. Maybe we will see if there are any texture packs first then we will see if
 Mojang will allow and put up mods for a substantial amount of Microsoftpoints.</p>

<h2>            Lost password to unlock laptop with Windows 10</h2>
                    My brother in law passed away and we are locked out of his computer. We used his login to try and access his password, but he didn't set up a device here. I used his Microsoft Login and PW to access this account in hopes of finding his local access password.
 Is there any way to open his locked laptop without resetting it and losing all his data? Can we just re-install Windows 10?&nbsp;

            Hi James,<br />
<br />
Microsoft accounts, the Windows operating system, and other Microsoft products include passwords for security. Microsoft support engineers cannot help you retrieve or circumvent passwords that are lost or forgotten. What you can do is to reset your computer
 or perform a clean install to be able to use the device. You can check this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/keeping-passwords-secure-microsoft-policy-on/39f56ef0-5d68-41ad-9daa-6e6019c25d37">

Should you have further queries, feel free to post it.

            &nbsp;Hi Mentorman,<br />
<p><span><br />
Thank you for taking the time to post on Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>From the research we have done we do not see that DEP can be deleted however it can be disabled. Please see below for how to disable DEP.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Disabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP)</span></b></p>
<p><span>Data Execution Prevention is a security feature that can be a bit of a pain at times. Often things will simply appear not to run at all; hopefully you will notice
 a bubble from the taskbar letting you know that DEP is the cause. If Vista sees that a process is being spawned that "could" be unwanted, DEP shuts it down. This is especially common in some application installations: if a Windows Installer setup (MSI) calls
 an executable in Vista, DEP could very well put a stop to it. If you are trying to run an installation or other executable being stopped by DEP, it could save you some trouble so turn it off while you attempt to give it another shot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run a command prompt as administrator. From the start menu, select "All Programs", then "Accessories" and right-click on the "Command Prompt" shortcut and choose
 "Run As Administrator". From here you can use the following command to disable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) with the following command:</span></p>
<p><span>bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff</span></p>
<p><span>Keeping your command prompt open, run your setup or other process being stopped by DEP. Then, to turn it back on again, do the same and run the following:</span></p>
<p><span>bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOn</span></p>
<p><span>Please post back and let us know if this information helped to resolve your issue or not so that we may further assist you if need be.</span></p>

    <title>Problems with Chess Titans &#40;for Windows 7 Home Premium&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> בת שרה אמנו zari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Chess Titans &#40;for Windows 7 Home Premium&#41;</h2>
                    During my computer's many attempts to fix itself via ChkDsk and other system repairs, somehow some of my games folders got gutted. In particular, Chess Titans. When I first scoped out the situation, only the chess.exe.mui and chess titans.lnk files were
 present. Initially, in Windows Features, all Games boxes were checked. I tried unchecking the Chess box and re-checking it, but it gave me the 'Not all changes were successfully made to features' error. Upon further inspection via Event Viewer, I learned that
 it was missing the necessary files in the Winsxs folders. (I do recall one ChkDsk making extensive deletions in the amd64 folders). Not knowing any better, I used the method on this page (<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/42507-games-explorer-folder-restore-default-games.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/42507-games-explorer-folder-restore-default-games.html</a>)
 and then I imported a full Chess folder to the Program Files folder. On the surface now, Windows recognizes Chess Titans -- however, the .exe still pops up as unknown, and won't run even 'as an Administrator'.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I supply the rest of the missing files, will I be able to install the game via the Windows Features? Or will I just be digging myself deeper?</div>

            One again it is useless and the worst of it is that Microsoft delete when forcing the installation of Windows 10 which I hate thus, I return to Windows 7 and lost the games. I know Microsoft does care....<br />

<h2>            Primary drivers are not functioning on higher versions of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I haven't been updating my Windows for a real long time, but since I've last upgraded it, I've had hard times with my AMD drivers. Every time I opened my Laptop I got a message telling me that this program (driver) couldn't function and that if this
 issue continued I should contact the producers. I wrote about this on AMD Support Forums, and it turns out that the drivers/AMD Device wasn't compatible with my Windows version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I remeber that I had <strong>Windows 10 version 1607 (<em>Redstone 1, Anniversary Update</em>)</strong> so I wonder if there is anyway I can rollback to that version of Windows, I'd be happy to know if there is an official place, or a trusted website
 where I can download the iso file of that version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System info:</strong></p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 version 1809 (Redstone 5, October 2018 Update)</p>
<p>Processor: AMD A10-9600P RADEON R5</p>
<p>System type: 64 bit</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that your HP Pavilion 15-aw006nt is compatible with Windows 10 and you can find the same information from here:
<strong><em><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-pavilion-15-aw000-notebook-pc-series/10862162/model/14646218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">HP Pavilion 15-aw006nt</span></a></em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can choose the <strong>
Operating System</strong> as <strong>Windows</strong> and you can see that Windows 10 is listed as supported and Windows 10 drivers are available for your laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to get clarity on this issue and assist you with appropriate troubleshooting steps, please reply with the answers to the questions below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
What is the entire message that you get when you turn on the laptop?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Which AMD drivers are you facing the issue with?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For a limited time, i.e., 10 days after upgrading to Windows 10, you’ll be able to go back to your previous version of Windows by selecting the Start button, then select Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security
 &gt; Recovery and then selecting Get started under Go back to the previous version of Windows 10. This will keep your personal files, but it'll remove apps and drivers installed after the upgrade, as well as any changes you made to settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To go back, you'll need to:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Keep everything in the windows.old and $windows.~bt folders after the upgrade.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Remove any user accounts you added after the upgrade.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Know the password you used to sign in to Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 (if you used one).</p>
</li><li>

            If you use the same Microsoft Account to log into both then your e-mails, and other account settings (like Calendar) will be synced. If you use One Drive, you can have access to your files from both machines. That would be the only automatic sync unless the 2 machines are connected to the same LAN.

            In terms of email (Outlook) - what gets sync'd depends on the type (Imap, POP3, Outlook.cpm/Exchange) accounts that are configured. POP3 and IMAP do not sync contact/calendar data. In short, Outlook data sync's email accounts, it does not sync between devices. As for other files, you would need to use OneDrive or similar file sharing service (Dropbox)

            Thank you to all who responded. I now have a clear picture of sync possibilities both for settings and data.<br />
<br />
There is one other problem I have with the Surface Pro 4 that I am presently using. A black and white HP LaserJet printer that I have used with a previous PC does not work on the Surface Pro, and I have been told that that is because the Surface is primarily
 a tablet. I have also not found it possible to get a USB CD drive to work with the Surface. I wonder whether that is for the same reason (if it is a valid reason at all), and now with a second Surface in the family likely I wonder whether the Surface Book
 2 I have in mind would not solve these problems because, as I understand it, it is primarily a laptop.<br />
<br />
Indeed there are so many Surfaces available, any assistance in indicating which does what better than the others would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you again to those who responded to my first message.<br />

<p>Tell us which exact printer model and how it is connected. And what do you mean by "does not work"?</p>
<p>

            The printer model is P1102w. It does not show up as an available printer in my Surface Pro 4.<br />
<br />
The Epson Artisan 1430 printer which I had with my former Dell PC works with the Surface Pro 4 without my having to do anything about drivers. Also the Canon LIDE 210 scanner.<br />
<br />
However the P1102w and two USB CD drives which I have tried (one and LG and the other a Sony) - sorry, don't have the model numbers available at the moment - do not show up as available in the Surface Pro 4, even when tried through a powered USB hub.<br />
<br />
The explanation that the HP printer was not available to the Surface Pro 4 because the surface to is primarily a tablet came from HP.<br />
<br />
If someone can point me to a USB CD drive and/or a simple A4 black and white laser printer that will work with the Surface, that would be appreciated.<br />

            Thanks, but as yet no success.<br />
<br />
1. The printer. I believe I had the up-to-date drivers, but in any event downloaded again to be sure. Still when I seek to print a document the HP LaserJet does not appear among the available options, although it is shown through the Control Panel as one of
 the printers on the system. The Print Spooler is running and set at automatic.<br />
<br />
2. The DVD drive. It seems that the particular LG model you refer to is not available here in Australia, but I now have one on order. The LG drive&nbsp;which I had tried unsuccessfully has the model number GP60NB50. LG seem to have a number of apparently similar
 models.<br />

<h3> mrs.sarah  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Not enough memory&#34; when trying to add network printer</h2>
                    I previously had my Lexmark E210 connected to my XP Desktop (hardwired) with a Samsung ML-1200 driver and to my Vista&nbsp;Notebook (wireless/shared printer) with the Samsung ML-1200 driver.&nbsp; My Vista Notebook crashed and I had to restore the computer back
 to factory settings.&nbsp; Now I can't connect to my printer.&nbsp; Every time I try, I get the error message, "Windows cannot connect to the printer.&nbsp; There is not enough memory to complete this operation.&nbsp; Please close some programs and try again."&nbsp; (The printer cannot
 connect directly to the laptop.&nbsp; The printer does not have a USB port and my notebook does not have an old school printer port...don't know the techie term for that.)<br />
<br />
)(*&amp;@(&amp;@)($@.&nbsp; heh...&nbsp; I have spent *HOURS* on this to no avail.&nbsp; I have looked up every solution I can find and NOTHING works!&nbsp; I am getting so frustrated.&nbsp; It worked before my computer crashed no problem.&nbsp; Now?&nbsp; Forget about it.<br />
<br />
Here are some solutions I have tried:<br />

<br />
I don't know what to do at this point.&nbsp; I just started back to school, and I need to be able to print from my notebook.&nbsp; So I have spent the better part of today trying to get it working again instead of doing the school work that is due...heh<br />
<br />
Can someone PLEASE help me?&nbsp; I'm getting desperate and maybe a little crazy...hehe<br />
<br />
Thanks so much!!&nbsp; (Oh, and I use the Samsung drivers because there is no E210 Vista driver.&nbsp; The driver was working great before the crash.&nbsp; Also, on the first link, I can get connected to the printer, but when I print a test sheet, nothing happens.&nbsp; Therefore
 I am assuming that there is no actual information reaching the printer.)

<p><span>Hi Mrs. Sarah,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using the Microsoft Vista Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can you connect to the printer anymore? If you cannot then it is probably a firewall or a security software issue.</span></p>
<p><span>You can try a clean boot to rule that out. Follow the link below and try to connect and print.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/331796</span>
</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Next, neither of the printers is supported under Vista. So I’m sure there is an issue with the drivers too.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you wipe out the print driver and uninstall any printers you’ve tried to install under Vista and reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then follow the instruction on the first link. That is the advise I would give to anyone in your position.</span></p>
<p><span>You’ll have to hope that the XP drivers will work.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m actually surprised that it worked at all considering that neither printer is supported.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not work, your next best option is to look outside of a Microsoft solution.</span></p>
<p><span>After that,,,,it’s buying a new printer.</span></p>

<h2>            How to get windows movie maker 2.1 for windows 7</h2>
                    I have been looking all over on software websites and now have several copies of 2.6 which is not what I want. (I just prefer using 2.1 as I am familiar with it already.) Is there anybody who can provide me with where to get this from, also is there any
 problem with running a version that is designed to run on an older system. If so I would be delighted if anyone can find a way around this.

            <p>Thank you Linney&nbsp;for all your trouble, my friends suggested some alternatives and I downloaded virtualdub and it is a beautiful piece of software, althoiugh the AVI files are taking up A LOT of room I am finding it better than WMM and a whole lot less fuss
 to get for W7,</p>
<p>Dear&nbsp;Microsoft support&nbsp;team,</p>
<p>Put a graphically improved copy of WMM 2.1 into W8 and give it any of the good new features from the other one.</p>

<p>If you want any edition of Windows, you have to buy it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, because Microsoft will no longer support Windows 7 after January2020 -- around 10 months from now -- it is almost impossible to find a legitimate copy of Windows 7 for sale.&nbsp; Beware of sites that sell Windows product keys without providing
 the installation media; such keys are almost certainly not valid.</p>

            Hi Ryan, this is a permissions issue, probably the best option is to take ownership of the User folder inside Windows.old
<br />
<br />Taking ownership is complicated, click the link below to download a reg file form DropBox. Right click that file and choose 'Merge' then confirm the Merge
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ek5gmtjmjf6d49r/InstallTakeOwnership.reg?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/ek5gmtjmjf6d49r/Insta...</a>
<br />
<br />That file will put a new entry on the right click menu in File Explorer - Take Ownership
<br />
<br />Then open Windows File Explorer, navigate to the User Profile folder in the Windows.old folder. 
<br />
<br />Right click the folder and choose 'Take Ownership'
<br />
<br />A command window will open and automate the process of taking ownership of that folder and all sub folders and files, let it run. 
<br />
<br />When the process has completed you should have access to your files . . .       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try taking ownership of the folder:
<br />
<br />
<br />Right-click the file or folder, click Properties, and then click the Security tab.
<br />
<br />Click Advanced, and then click the Owner tab.
<br />
<br />Click Edit, and then do one of the following:
<br />
<br />    To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click Other users and groups and, in Enter the object name to select (examples), type the name of the user or group, and then click OK.
<br />
<br />    To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the Change owner to box, click the new owner.
<br />
<br />(Optional) To change the owner of all subcontainers and objects within the tree, select the Replace owner on subcontainers and objects check box.
