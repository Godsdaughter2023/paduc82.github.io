<p>Same problem for me in Publisher 2016 with a third party font. if you use in my case a font called "Martti font" and writes for example the line "<span>Åääää ööö 1234567890 !!!!!! ;……*******"
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then you change the "Åääää ööö" to bold text the out put is the following. (look att picture).</span></p>

            Found a temporary solution to the problem. If you change value of "Stylistic Set" from default to Individual at least Martti font seems to works as it should.&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Mac v15.18 &#40;160109&#41; - &#8984;-Shift-O doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Outlook Mac v15.18 (160109) I can no longer hit Cmd-Shift-O to filter for Unread mail in my inbox. I can see that the menu item is being triggered, but nothing happens. &nbsp;If I manually pull down the menu and select it, nothing happens either.
 The only way to make it work is by clicking on the little funnel icon and choosing "Unread" from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a regression, it used to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix asap!</p>

            <p>The fact that you can't find Outlook emails confirm that there is an indexing issue. That naturally prevents searches in Outlook and filtering (since they rely on Spotlight).</p>
<p>You'll need to add the&nbsp;~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile folder to the exclusion list in the Spotlight System Preferences, then after a few minutes, remove it to force-reindex.</p>
<p>It WILL take a while. During that time, you won't see any progress bar of any sort (very unfortunately), but with a bit of luck it'll correct the issue.</p>

            <p>OMG, the task list is there now. &nbsp;I deleted and re-entered my account. But it took like 1/2 hour or more to show up. :-/ I don't have that many emails. And, it showed "All folders up to date" at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess if anyone has this problem, wait a while, try shutting down and restarting Outlook, then try deleting and re-entering your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps anyone else.&nbsp;</p>

            I don't mean to be rude, but that is a ridiculous answer. &nbsp;Since the subfolder selection is not working I need to go in and select all 20 plus subfolder to search them? &nbsp;And yes, that is what I am having to do since the subfolder selection is obviously
 not working, I figured that out on my own. But that is a workaround to the problem. &nbsp;So my question is what good is the subfolder check box and how is it any different from selecting to search All since it returns search results from all subfolders.&nbsp;

            <p>If you don't want to be rude, don't use a word like "ridiculous". Pretty simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I don't understand what you mean with "all subfolders". If you select the inbox, all subfolders of the inbox should be included, that is also the subfolders of the subfolders of the inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you maybe forget to uncheck the folder at the very top, that is your mailbox, or your data file?</p>

Does the marketplace client on your phone allow you to browse the available applications at all?

            I pulled out my Samsung i910 (USA CDMA version of the i900) and tried a few things.&nbsp; The only time I could get that error message to come up is when I happened to have walked out of range of my router (it's using WiFi only data right now). I'd imagine
 that you are browsing the marketplace over your providers connection right now.&nbsp; If you have a wireless router available to you can you try to connect your phone to it and see if there's any difference in the behaviour when you try to download an application?

Notify the bank's website about the issue and also why don't you submit it for analysis if possible?</p>

    <title>Right click freezes Office 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kooriboa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Right click freezes Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have Office Professional Plus 2013 on my single desktop computer, all of the office programs freeze when I right click. Not everytime I right click, but only occasionally (I cannot figure out under what occasion). After freezing, I must restart the program
 and lose the data. Otherwise, the program works fine. This has been occurring regularly over a couple months, and I've simply been working around it, but it almost seems to be getting worse. I don't have any knowledge on how to solve this particular issue.
 Any help or suggestions here would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I have attempted to contact the support center for this product, but the Windows support webpage misdirects every time I attempt, on every device or web browser. I have not discovered any other way to contact them, so any help on this would also be nice.</p>

<p>Not a solution.</p>
<p>This does not change the language in Skype, it changes the language across all of Windows10.</p>
<p>Skype used to have this feature. </p>
<p>For an "international" app used across dozens of countries, it baffles me why this language switching would no longer be supported.</p>
<p>Please address.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The one you are using now is the built-in Microsoft Skype for Windows 10 (Skype UWP) application. This application can only be installed from Windows Store. The currently latest
 version is 12.1815.210.0</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The other Skype application is the new Microsoft Skype for Desktop. This Skype version can be downloaded and installed using this link.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Since today, the latest version is 8.27.0.85. However, this release is very recent and for some users the 8.25.0.5 version might still be provided by the above link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<div>NOTE: My credentials are listed under *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>

<div>
<p>I joined the insiders group for Windows 10.&nbsp; Since I received an automatic update on November 24, 2015, I am unable to run DISM to its conclusion.&nbsp; SFC reports that modules are reparable, and DISM (online) ScanHealth reports the same, but when I try to run
 RestoreHealth or AnalizeComponentStore DISM reports that it cannot find the log file.&nbsp; Is this because I’m running an advanced version of the OS?&nbsp; Or should I be worried that there may be an unwanted file in my rootkit?</p>

            <p>I have installed two automatic updates since Nov 24.&nbsp; The last earlier today. (9 Dec 2015).&nbsp; There is nothing wrong or lacking with Windows 10 Pro that I can tell.&nbsp; Mind you, as a desktop user, I don't use a tenth of the&nbsp;apps available, especially those
 dealing with online social media.&nbsp; I use Windows for work and research.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to be safe, I've set a number of Restore Points which have grown to 5 gigabytes of space.&nbsp; If I can run DISM and achieve a favorable result, I'd like to delete the older Restore Points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question again, why doesn't DISM work with Windows 1511?&nbsp; Is this normal for an insider's program?&nbsp; Defender has just run a full scan, so I doubt the problem is a persistent worm or 3rd-party spyware.&nbsp; Hence, there should be no problem running DISM
 to its conclusion...</p>

<h2>            Automatically Backing up Outlook 2013 PST Files</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just signed up for the Office 365 software. &nbsp;I was wondering if there is a way to make sure I always have a backup of PST file on my OneDrive account? - Its just as a backup if my local version ever crashes with Appointments/contacts etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--OR-- is there a way to do exactly the same thing *backup my outlook data with some new fandangled way that Microsoft have developed ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ;)</p>

            Each time you close Outlook, copy the PST to the OneDrive folder on your computer - the one created when you installed the OneDrive application.&nbsp; Anything copied to that folder will sync with OneDrive.&nbsp; You can also create a scheduled task that will perform
 this copying for you during the night while you're asleep or program your backup application to include that file each time it runs.<br />

Since yesterday (2016-07-13) we have found machines cannot redirect between two or our sites due to smartscreen being switched on.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
so Site 1 redirects to Site 2 - the identity server IE or edge then stops</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
if I turn off smartscreen the redirect happens immediately, this has been working fine for over a year with no problems and there is no feedback to the user, the network tab shows the page being returned from site 2 but nothing is displayed with smartscreen
 switched on.&nbsp;</p>

We have a number of clients this could soon be critical for.</p>

<h2>            Support and Replacement of older versions of Microsoft products</h2>
                    <p>I just&nbsp; posted a question concerning the on-line sale of&nbsp; previous versions of Outlook and whether any of them are legal and authentic.&nbsp; Microsoft will not answer this questions directly when previously called them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Microsoft&nbsp; sold previous versions of Outlook&nbsp; and the support that came with it , that product did not come with any expiration date as far as I&nbsp; know.&nbsp; If he purchaser failed to order the CD&nbsp; and only purchased with a download , Microsoft should be
 and probably is legally obligated to provide a replacement at a cost. If they failed to do so that she be breach of contract as it must be assumed absence of an expiration date that that the purchase price includes at least support and replacement for a fee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft fails to provide that they should have no objections to third parties selling authentic replacement software , their answer to the questions of such on-line products are legal, providing that they are not pirated , should be a resounding yest.
 Microsoft can't have their cake and eat it too like any one else.</p>

</p><p>IMHO - perhaps purchasers should also take some responsibility for safe-guarding their purchases just as is applicable for any other kind of product. It's the purchaser's choice not order the CD at which point it really becomes their responsibility to make
 their own copy/backup of the product they just purchased</p>

</p><p>You may want to let other community members know which other vendors of any kind of product are legally obligated to provide any kind of support until the "end of time" for something that the vendor no longer sells. You may also want to extend that to include
 vendors which are "legally obligated" to police the "aftermarket".</p>

            <p>Who at MS did you call?&nbsp; MS phone support?&nbsp; Most of the front line support people you talk to are "script monkeys". They know very little about the various MS programs being supported. They follow a predefined script that takes them down a standard trouble
 shooting decision tree.&nbsp; If you try to ask them something off of the script, most of them are essentially clueless. Instead you have to ask to be transferred to a "supervisor" or "2nd level support". These are more knowledgeable staff. But even then finding
 the right person to answer your specific "non-standard" question is a hit and (mostly) miss affair.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS only sells the most current version of their software.&nbsp; You have to understand, MS depends on users buying new copies of their products. So they do everything they can to "encourage" users to "upgrade".&nbsp; To that point, with Office 2013 MS introduced a
 new license model, "Subscription", (aka various "Office 365" bundles, "365" refers to the fact that you have to pay for it 'every day') where you have to keep paying forever (monthly or yearly) to continue to have the right to use the program.&nbsp; For now, they
 still sell one-time payment licenses, but I expect that to go the way of the dodo very soon, either in the "next" major release of Office or the one after.&nbsp; One of the "features" of the subscription is that it gives you the right to use "new features" in the
 various programs in the bundle as they are released on a monthly schedule.&nbsp; Another feature of the subscription is that you have already paid to "upgrade" to the next major release when it comes out. MS "automagically" upgrades your installation when ever
 MS feels like it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can buy legitimate, legal copies of "old" Office from various sources. Many stores have "old stock" that is perfectly valid for them to continue to sell.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One issue you allude to is "bootlegging".&nbsp; Some online sites illegally, contrary to the software license terms, resell product keys for the Office "volume license". These licenses explicit forbid re-sale of the key to users outside of the company who initially
 bought the license.&nbsp; These licenses eventually stop working, and if MS identifies a key or group of keys as being bootlegged, they will summarily "invalidate" the key(s). They buyer is out of luck, and by that time the vendor has disappeared into the "bit
 bucket".</p>
<p>
</p><p>All MS Software has a support "lifecycle", even if it isn't explicitly referred to on the package or license terms document (I'm not positive about this and too lazy to check ... ).&nbsp; Programs, or "service packs" are released to the public, they have a "mainstream
 support end date" and an "Extended support end date".&nbsp; For example, here is a link to the MS support lifecycle site, filtered for "Office 2007" to show that the "extended support end date" is 2017 Oct 10.&nbsp; This means next year in October MS will stop releasing
 ALL updates for Office 2007, in particular all security updates. The same thing happened to Office 2003 a year ago</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=Microsoft%20Office%202007</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change the filter to search for any MS software product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the best of my knowledge, MS only sells "backup disks" for current versions of software. So if you forgot to get the disk, you better get an online download of the installation file and keep it safe somewhere. Better yet, keep a couple of copies on different
 media ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>So right now you can download the installation files for Office 2007 to 2016. &nbsp; Here are some links to MS download sites:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Up to about a year ago, MS outsourced the online store, and install file online downloads to "Digital River". But they have ended that relationship.

            <p>There is nothing wrong with a company encouraging buying their new product, demanding it or making it purchase a necessity is an entirely other matter. As you may have noticed the consumer drew the line with Windows 10 , see my post on the forced upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You state , "All MS Software has a support "lifecycle", even if it isn't explicitly referred to on the package or license terms document ..... Programs, or "service packs" are released to the public, they have a "mainstream support end date" and an "Extended
 support end date".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think we can both agree that this would not probably hold up in court , too general and open to interpretation, probably the reason why Microsoft has changed its licensing agreement with Office 365 (you can now rent the product!!!), but I am not really
 insisting on support just the re-installation of the product . Unfortunately 2003 is listed under the link you gave fortunately I still have the disk. Another question is Microsoft obligated to provide your your key that you paid for should you lose it , if
 not they should be ,otherwise it would be the same as buying a car whose doors were permanently soldered closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been this software circus since 1999 both as an MCP working&nbsp; tech support ans a home user and I can tell you I so no significant difference between Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007 and both are superior in in every way to Office 365.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you name some of those legitimate stores to purchase from I would prefer to Upgrade to Outlook 2010 , my last upgrade?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will let you in on a secret . Microsoft claims that Outlook 2003 will not work on Windows 10.&nbsp; I had a Windows 10 computer for a month , returned it and had my Windows 7 computer repaired, but not before trying Outlook 2003 on Windows 10. It worked like
 a charm, fast quick and flawless better than on both Windows XP and Windows 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p>#1 - Interesting - is a retailer obligated to provide you with a "sales receipt" in the event you lost yours? Lot's of ways to get the product - one of which is inclusion with a new machine. How do you propose MS knows who "you" are if the packaging (with
 key) is lost? (Rhetorical question - have no real interest in pursuing this since it serves no purpose)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Hate to point something out but that statement is "VERY subjective" at best. Suspect there are probably a few in the 60+ million users out there who might disagree with you (just a wild guess). One difference between '2003 and '2007 would be &lt;Exchange&gt;
 support and the difference between '2007 and '2010 would be the number of EX accounts (Outlook.com accounts anyone) that can configured in single Outlook profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - There's a big difference between the words "not supported" and "doesn't work". Again a counter-productive discussion. Ignoring MS products, no different with ContactGenie products which have an official position of "Not supported when installed on a
 &lt;server&gt; O/S". Reality is that some customers have reported no issues while others encountered no end of problems which we have absolutely no desire/intention to investigate/pursue for all kinds of different reasons.</p>

</p><p>#1 - If you got the key via email - then you would have an account set up from whomever/whereever it was purchased. To extend the logic, the expectation, as described, would be that Office'2003 should continue to be available in the yr '2030 and beyond which
 could lead one to wonder why you didn't point out that the download page for previous versions also didn't include OL'2002(XP), OL'2000 or OL'97. In any case, will agree to disagree rather then beat this to death.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Your words were ".............<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">both are superior in in every way" with the operative words in that statement being "<strong>in every way</strong>". &nbsp;Functionality is an equally integral component
 along side all else. You placed no constraints on what you meant by "in every way" so limiting it now to "speed and stability" is the equivalent of "moving the goal posts" (and even then it would require comparing everything when functioning in an "identical"
 environment to be completely accurate).</span></p>
<p>#3 - Have no idea where you used the word "incompatible" to what I replied to. The exact words used by you were "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft claims that Outlook
 2003 <strong>will not work</strong> on Windows 10". The status of '2003 is that it is "<strong>not supported</strong>" - the focus of my reply. Not aware of where MS (the company - not some individual's post somewhere) has posted/claims that OL'2003 "will
 not work with W10".&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I agree, the force or tricks used to con people into loading Win 10 were often on par with malware attacks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is MS "obligated" to replace keys? Good question for someone with enough money who is willing to try to take MS to court on it. MS will say no.&nbsp; As far as they are concerned the product key is equivalent to a hundred dollar bill (or denomination of your
 choice) or "bearer bond".&nbsp; You are responsible for keeping track of it and if you lose it, it is your responsibility to replace it, by buying another key.&nbsp;&nbsp; The government is doing the same moving from paper currency with serial numbers to generic coins. The
 government is responsible for account for paper money, but not for coins. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It was bad enough with Office 2010 and earlier. At least then with a little knowledge you could recover the product key from your computer. But MS "<em>improved</em>" that in 2013 and we can no longer extract the full key, just the last 5 char.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, MS says that 2003 is not compatible with Win 10. But that is just the official party line.&nbsp; The reality is that many people have been able to install it successfully.&nbsp; Basically, MS says that any version created BEFORE a later version of Windows is
 released is "not compatible".&nbsp; In practice, due to the need to maintain backward compatiblity for other programs those older versions of Office will also work on newer allegedly "unsupported" versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I don't have any specific names of internet stores you can trust other than Amazon. You'll have to go to other sources, ie online reviews of online stores. Here is an example http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/can-still-buy-microsoft-office-2003-online-show/</p>

 altogether such as Office 365 on Win'XP). One example of an MS statement being</p>

            Some apps on store are limited to few countries if your country not included for that app than you can't see those apps on store but you can manually install it but maybe it won't work for you best you should change your phone country from Phone setting
 maybe this tricks works for you.

<h2>            Auto Attendant with Skype for Business PSTN Calling &#40;Cloud PBX&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to figure out how to setup an Auto attendant for Skype for Business.&nbsp; It appears that I can setup the Auto Attendant in Exchange's Unified Messaging section.&nbsp; But I have not been able to figure out how to connect a number (phone number) to the
 UM auto attendant from Skype for Business.&nbsp; Am I on the right track?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want the Auto attendant to have the options, "Press 1 for John Smith, Press 2 for Jane Doe, etc,".&nbsp; I have spent a couple of days trying to figure this out to no avail.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Update: &nbsp;Just spent quite a bit of time with tech support to learn that what I am trying to do can not be done yet. &nbsp;You can not currently connect Skype to Business with the UM auto attendant. &nbsp;This is on the road map, but not sure when it will be available.

<p>This is one of the biggest disappointments with the E5/SfB PSTN rollout. They want SMBs to move to Enterprise Voice, but without a real PBX backbone.
</p>
<p>Have you come across any particularly good third-party PBX vendors that integrate with SfB for the functions you need?</p>

<p>I just found out the same that the auto attendant isn't able to connect with Skype for Business. &nbsp;This is super disappointing. &nbsp;I just spent hours on the phone with support as well and found this to be true. &nbsp;Does anyone know when this may become available?
 &nbsp;Otherwise the PSTN/PBX Cloud setup is useless for most business wanting to go completely into the cloud/office 365.</p>

<p>Well unlike the rest of you, I found a way around the Auto Attendant issue using SfB E5. It looks like I am one of the first few to figure it out. Yep, SfB E5 does not have a full featured Voicemail Server that provides Call Flow or Auto Attendant feature
 set. But that did not stop me from moving forward. I successfully deployed O365 E5 with domestic and international PSTN to my company with over 200 ported numbers in multiple regions of US, not using a hybrid solution. I have a good Call Flow setup and business\after-hour
 announcements. I have to say that it was not an easy road, I still have some minor issues to resolve since my deployment is just days old. These are the issues that we did not encounter during the SfB Preview over the last few months but just started showing
 up this month. Yes, we've been using pretty heavily for the past few months (field testing). It blew most other UCaaS solutions out of the water, even without Auto Attendant. If I was a betting man, I would say Microsoft's SfB E5 will become the leader in
 Gartners review of UCaaS providers in 2016. No one out there can match Microsoft's server footprint in a global landscape for UCaaS.

<p>I can't name companies here, other that Microsoft. So if you want to know which company I used, send me a private message (FYI, I don't work for them).
</p>
<p>Well, we needed eFax (since SfB does not have one) and I used a hosted solution. I looked up other services from that company and created an architecture that would work. I obtained an account with multiple numbers and unlimited minutes, on month to month
 basis. Created Auto Attendant on each one of those numbers from hosted company. Took my main number from SfB E5 forward it to external number at the hosted solution. It has no delay reaching the call flow. Customer hears the Auto Attendant and presses a number.
 Each number is set to SfB Delegated Group or Team Ring Group account so call comes back to SfB Voice. Just needed to make sure, whole setup did not let customer leave voice mail on main number or at Auto Attendant location. They can only leave it at the Delegated
 Group account or Team Call group account which is hosted in SfB. </p>
<p>I used ******.com to build my Auto Attendant setup. Cost for Auto Attendant was peanuts compared to E5 upgrade. Plus, I expect SfB to have their version of Auto Attendant out in February or June 2016. Also hoping to see eFax from SfB in 2016. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of open issues with Microsoft. Two of my ported numbers are not working, still trying to figure it out with them. Also, Delegated Groups use to allow individual ring delay - now it no longer does. I was planning on using Team Call Group as
 - Ring All and Delegated Group as - my Hunt Group replacement. Still working on that. Lucky for me, my offices are closed until January 4th so I have time to solve it.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>We can’t prevent the external users from seeing the sharing details.</p>
<p>Given the situation, we suggest you submit your requirement to UserVoice, which is the best way to influence the product.<br />

<h2>            excel vba delete charts in Power Point Late Binding</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to loop through the shapes on a PPT slide in a presentation already opened using late binding and if they are charts delete them using Late Binding</p>
<p>i am using code as below with obj variables as objects; the issue is i cannot get the .HasChart to work as there are some objects on the slide that are not charts which i do not want to delete.&nbsp; i have tried using .type = 10 but some other objects appear
 to be 10, also i have tried =msoChart but that does not work either.&nbsp; Clearly there is something wrong with my code and i will be grateful if someone will point out the error.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I have just realised that the charts have been pasted in as objects so the msoChart or .HasChart clearly will not work..................</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that on each slide there is one or more items that are not charts but also have been copied in as Objects and the Object number is not consistent; ie, Object 11 could be a chart on one slide and not on the next and so on so i think i will have
 to give up on this and delete manually which is a shame as don't like being beaten on a challenge like this!</p>

<h2>            N73&#58; How do I switch off the &#38;quot&#59;Nokia Tune&#38;quot&#59; welcome&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I switch on my brand new Nokia N73, it plays the last five notes of possibly the most irritating piece of music in the world. I just rang Orange (my service providers) and they told me that it was impossible to switch off this (un)welcome melody.<br />
<br />
I can't quite believe it. Anyone out there know how to override it somehow? It was always possible to switch it off on my older Nokia phones.

            You can't turn it off like you could on older Nokia handsets. However, you'll be pleased to know that you can get rid of it! Change 'warning tones' to OFF. OK you'll lose the low battery audible warning but it's a small price to pay. Alternatively, when
 you boot the phone and the Nokia tone starts if you press the red 'call hang up' button, the tune will cut off and this won't affect your phone turning on.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your custom... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I see from your screen shot that you are using either Active Reports or Crystal Reports in Internet Explorer... these are ActiveX addons in Internet Explorer and are not published or supported by Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I don't think I can give you any advice as to how to immediately fix the issue...
<br />
<br />
I think you will have to contact your company's computer programming team and ask them to investigate the issue. From the screen shot I think they will have to contact the vendor (either ActiveReports or Crystal Reports) and download and deploy the latest versions
 of their software products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is happening only on your computer, you can try</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default"</p>
<p>
</p><p>also</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced tab, uncheck "Do not save encrypted files to disk".</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Manage Addons&gt;Show all Addons&gt; locate either Crystal Reports or Active Reports (they may have different company names) in the list of Addons and make sure that all of their components, ActiveX controls and BHO's (browser helper objects) are enable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(You may be able to obtain more information about the error from... Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Administrative Tools&gt;Report Viewer&gt;Windows Components).</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>Contact your company Help Desk or the programmers who wrote the asp.net application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi ColleenLynn 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>When I click Microsoft Office I get message that app is in process of being uninstalled or changed. When I try to open Excel I still get error message that allows me to click "repair now" then the window disappears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into Task Manager thinking I might see something running there but nothing.</p>
