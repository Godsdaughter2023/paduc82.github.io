            Hi Matias,<br />
<br />
May I know whether you are referring to the Office 365 Distribution Group (DG) or Office 365 Unified Group (OWA group)?
<br />
<br />
For the Office 365 DG, all the members in your organization can join it by default. If you have set it to be “approval for joining”, you can change the original setting back via editing the DG in Exchange Admin Center (EAC)&gt; Recipients&gt; Groups&gt; choose the DG&gt;
 membership approval.<br />
<br />
For the Office 365 Unified Group (OWA group), it can be set to be public/private. For the public one, all the users (whether they are the members of the unified group) can see all the data in the group; for the private one, only the members of the group can
 see the data in it. <br />
<br />
It is not feasible to share/publish the groups (which I mentioned above) to the other users of your organization. If you want others to see the data in the unified group, you can add them to be the members of it (the private unified group).<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            <p>Hello Alan,</p>
<p>I do not want to create a Group, because the emails that are sent to the group arrive to the inbox of the group instead of the inbox of each member.</p>
<p>What I need is that when someone of the organization have to send an email to a team (i.e. Operations) he/she do not have to copy all the members of the team, so he/she can select a simple contact of the Directory.</p>
<p>I believe that what I need is a Distribution List but one that all the members of the organization can see it in the Directory.</p>
<p>Can you help me?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Distribution-groups-e8ba58a8-fab2-4aaf-8aa1-2a304052d2de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
distribution group(DG)</a> can meet your requirement.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Emails sent to a DG will show in each group member’s Inbox.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to hide the DG from the Directory, you can tell your Global admin use Powershell to do it. Then only the owner of the DG can see it in the Directory.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm not sure which of the following or which combination of the following fixed it, but I wanted to close out this thread for others:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My Windows Office was not activated for some reason, but once activated the e-mail still didn't send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I then typed "Windows Update" in the search bar and went to Windows Settings.&nbsp; There were some Windows updates that needed to be run and then I restarted my laptop.&nbsp; However, the e-mail still got stuck in the Outbox</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I read somewhere that in order to use Port 587, no encryption should be selected.&nbsp; So I did that and it said the repair to my account was successful.&nbsp; Then I was able to send an e-mail without it getting stuck in my outbox (my spouse and daughter received
 the test e-mail that I sent).&nbsp; However, when I went back to confirm my settings, and instead of the SMTP Server port being set to 587 with no encryption, it was set to 465 and SSL/TLS encryption was selected as was "Log on using user name and password" with
 that information automatically entered.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Lord only knows why it works now, but I'm not tinkering with it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I don't know if simultaneous to all of this, whether Comcast updated the firmware on my router.</p>

<h3> andreas killer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Specialcells&#47;Find did not work in Workbook_BeforeSave event triggered by a macro&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Juhu. :-))</p>
<p>I have a problem with XL2000 and want to know if other versions has this problem too and/or any suggestions to solve it.</p>
<p>The basic is to find a cell in a sheet with a specific value in the Workbook_BeforeSave event:</p>
<p>Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)<br />
&nbsp; Dim sdDirectory As Range<br />
&nbsp; Set sdDirectory = shtSurfcam.Cells.Find("Directory", LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole)<br />
&nbsp; If sdDirectory Is Nothing Then Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; 'some more code<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Normally this code works great, but if I use a makro to close the workbook FIND always return NOTHING.</p>
<p>The amount of data in sheet shtSurfcam is not so large, I thought I can read the data in an array, do my search inside the array, etc. and I've tried SPECIALCELLS to get the last cell, but SPECIALCELLS did not work in this case!?</p>
<p>For test purposes: Place the code below in the module "ThisWorkBook" in a new workbook and run Sub CloseMe. Answer the first question "save the file?" with Yes and the second with Abort.</p>
<p>In XL2000 Specialcells always returns $1:$65636 and Find did not work.</p>
<p>What does other excel versions show? Any suggestions how to solve this?</p>
<p>BTW, to determine the cell in the macro that close this workbook is no option, because the macro isn't in that workbook, it's in my PERSONL.XLS</p>
<p>Andreas.</p>
<p>Sub CloseMe()<br />
&nbsp; 'Make sure we have some data<br />
&nbsp; Range("D10") = "End"<br />
&nbsp; ThisWorkbook.Close<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)<br />
&nbsp; Dim R As Range<br />
&nbsp; Cancel = True<br />
&nbsp; Set R = Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell)<br />
&nbsp; If R Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "SpecialCells did not work"<br />
&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "SpecialCells " &amp; R.Address<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Set R = Cells.Find("*", SearchDirection:=xlPrevious)<br />
&nbsp; If R Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Find did not work"<br />
&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Find " &amp; R.Address<br />

<p>Did not work if there is more data in that sheet. With this code Specialcells returns D10:E13 in all versions of excel:</p>
<p>Sub CloseMe()<br />
&nbsp; 'Make sure we have some data<br />
&nbsp; Range("D10:E13") = "End"<br />

&nbsp; Cancel = True<br />
&nbsp; Set R = Sheets(1).UsedRange.Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeLastCell)<br />

&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; MsgBox "Find " &amp; R.Address<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>But it seems that FIND works in XL2002 and all later versions.</p>
<p>And for XL2000 I can use<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set R = Sheets(1).UsedRange<br />
&nbsp; Set R = R.Cells(R.Cells.Count)</p>
<p>to get the last cell, read the data in an array and search my cell in there. Not nice, but works.</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion.</p>

    <title>Residue from old versions of Office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dh65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Residue from old versions of Office</h2>
                    <p>Over the years, I've had Office 2004, Office 2008, Office 2011, and now Office 2016. Each version of Office created a variety of new folders and files when installed/first used. For example, files and folders in /Library/Application Support/Microsoft, in
 /Library/LaunchDaemons, in ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/, in ~/Library/Preferences, and in ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data. I am not certain but I believe that there has been some overlap, meaning that Office 2008 created its own files and
 folders but also used some of the files or folders that Office 2004 had used, or added items to some of those folders. And likewise with Office 2011, creating some files/folders from scratch while either using or adding to some that Office 2004 or 2008 had
 created. (Actually, I'm pretty sure this has been the case because I believe I had custom dictionaries and templates that transferred from one version of Office to the next without having to be recreated, though it's possible I'm misremembering and actually
 copied and pasted from old folders into new.) I have the feeling, but I'm not sure, that Office 2016 does less of this and relies either mostly or entirely on brand new files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's my question: Is there a reliable list of files/folders that Office 2004 and/or Office 2008 created that Office 2011 never used? In other words, things that could be deleted entirely without having any impact on Office 2011. I'd like to get rid
 of everything that isn't needed or used at all by Office 2011. (For now, I'm still keeping Office 2011 installed as a fall-back because I'm risk-averse and have had issues with Office 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach to the same issue: Are there lists for Office 2004, 2008, 2011, and 2016 of every file/folder that each version created and/or used? If so, I could just delete everything from the first list that doesn't appear on the second list, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Movies &#38; TV error 0xc00d11cd &#40;0x80004005&#41;</h2>
                    So I am trying to download some movies from Movies &amp; TV for use on a trip. I have a Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10. Every time I click "download" I get the following error: 0xc00d11cd (0x80004005). I can stream it, but not download it. Also, I tested
 it on an old Surface Pro 2 (which I am giving to my son) and Windows Phone and movies downloaded fine. I talked to Xbox support and they suggested I contact Surface tech support. Any ideas on how to fix this problem?&nbsp;

    <title>Insert symbol for italic font - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c.d. stephens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insert symbol for italic font</h2>
                    <p>Using Adobe Garamond Pro as an example (but I'm sure the same is true for many other fonts), using Insert&gt;Symbol I can find and insert any character from the roman, but not the italic, since the italic font does not appear on the font list. The italic contains
 alternate (swash) characters, along with the accented versions, but there is no way to find and insert them without using third-party software, or just guessing at the Unicode until I find one that works. For example, I can select a small cap M (F76D) or a
 titling M (E035), but there's no way to find the swash M from the italic font (E033) since only the roman is displayed. This is probably incredibly simple, but I've searched extensively and can't find anything.</p>

    <title>Incorrect user status&#47;presence on New Skype - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barrybolton1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect user status&#47;presence on New Skype - offline&#47;online&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OK, my father lives in the UK, I live in the USA. I call him every weekend, Skype to Skype video as he is almost 90 and not in good health. His laptop, running Windows 7, automatically updated to the new Microsoft Skype. he was unable to contact me on Skype
 since then, last Monday. I updated my laptop, also Windows 7,&nbsp;with the Microsoft Skype this morning&nbsp;, 8/11/2018. Despite both of us being online, neither of us is shown as online on the others Skype dashboard and when we try calling each other we are shown
 as Not Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tired uninstalling and reinstalling Skype, no help at all. I understand from the forums that Widows 7 is supposed to be compatible. I cannot contact him anymore on my cell phone either as I understand that Microsoft Skype is not compatable with iOS 11.4</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried contacting Skype support chat from my laptop and was unable to connect with them also. Any answers from the community?</p>

</p><p>I apologize to know about your experience using the new Skype. You can try to revert your Skype version to classic as we will be extending it for some time. You can download the classic version using this link:

<p>The issue persists. My brother in the UK installed the new skype on my fathers computer for him. they tested it and my father was able to skype with both my brother and his wife on their phones and laptops. I reinstalled skype classic and when my father
 logs into skype he sees me as offline and I see him as offline. I tried installing the new version again and still see him as offline despite him being online. My sister in law is shown as away, so it must be some glitch somewhere. I don't know what to do.</p>

 of them were custom, so if they're gone again I'll have to reload them all. </p>

            to be on the safe side, i would check with a NEW sim card from your network carrier, as bad condition / poorly cut SIM cards can cause problems with devices.

<p>I dont know why people are constantly saying "check your sim it is faulty, get a new one". If the sim worked in the old phone, then the sim is fine.</p>

<p>How many sims is one supposed to get??!</p>

            we're not evading, the simple fact of the matter is that a SIM card may work in one phone and not work in another, i've seen it first-hand before.<br />
<br />
we are simply trying to help you, so please understand that. if you don't wish to follow our troubleshooting advice, then get your phone fixed or not fixed elsewhere. so please try it before getting irate with us.

<p>No wonder your sales are appalingly down with that kind of attitude!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many sim cards is one suppose to try?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You simply saying the issue is with the network (sim card) and not the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a sim works in more than one phone to me that sim is fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same 02 sim card for years and changed 4 or 5 phones and the sim always worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your excuses are pathetic. You should be ashamed of yourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is more than one thread on this issue and all you reply with is bloody change your sims? And in one of the threads the person says he knows other people who had this issue too! So they all got sim issues yet your phones are perfect?!</p>

            look mate, it has been proven countless times about the SIM card, we are simply suggesting that you TRY this suggestion, in order to either identify / cross-out the SIM card as the cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
If you don't like that advice, then as i've said and others will back me up on this, go elsewhere. You are wasting my (and other users here) time in arguing your point, which is down to pure arrogance and stubbornness on your part to try and solve your phone
 problem. Stop trolling.<br />

<p>Others on different said they have done this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet YOU insist "get a new sim card" so whose showing the arrogance&nbsp; now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cant help others I suggest YOU get off! Pointless you being here and spamming with every message you post "if I helped you click this **bleep** star" when its obvious you aint helped with your rude manners and arrogance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your just passing the blame on to others. These devices were released when? A few monthsback in other parts ofthe world and last month for the UK, and you think there cant be a faulty batch ?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously get your head out of your **bleep** pal. At the end of the day your name is Adrian so dont expect you to be an angel.</p>

<h2>            Excel VBA code to copy a tab to another file</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see below for the macro (which is working fine but needs to be refine):</p>
<p>Sub Cons_Fulfillment_SQB()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workbooks.Open Filename:= _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "K:\Pi-mf-accounting\Mutual Fund P&amp;A\" &amp; Range("J1").Value &amp; " Monthly Close\Functional Files\Consolidated Fulfillment\" &amp; Range("J1").Value &amp; " " &amp; Range("J2").Value &amp; " Consolidated Fulfillment AvB.xlsx"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workbooks("My Macro V3.xlsm").Activate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workbooks.Open Filename:= _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "K:\Pi-mf-accounting\Mutual Fund P&amp;A\" &amp; Range("J1").Value &amp; " Monthly Close\Functional Files\SQB's\Consolidated Fulfillment SQB.xlsx"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Consolidated Fulfillment SQB").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Consolidated Fulfillment SQB").Copy Before:=Workbooks( _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>"2018 January Consolidated Fulfillment AvB.xlsx").Sheets(1)</strong></span><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workbooks("Consolidated Fulfillment SQB.xlsx").Close SaveChanges:=False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 files. One is called "2018 January Consolidated Fulfillment AvB.xlsx" and the other is "Consolidated Fulfillment SQB". The problem is that every month the file name changes every month. For example, it'll be 2018 February Consolidated Fulfillment
 AvB and so on. Please refer to the bold part of the code. I need this to reference to cells J1(which is 2018) and J2(the month) in the My Macro V3 excel macro file where my code is housed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have noticed that same issue and given feedback about it. Now I am using Windows Live Calendar (part of Windows Live Mail), it shows all events I have since y.&nbsp;2006. But this&nbsp;does not solve the issue, why must be installed Windows Live Mail to only&nbsp;see
 old events&nbsp;of calendar? But let's be patient, maybe some day we have the calendar what we want.</p>

<h2>            Messaging &#43; Skype not linking contacts</h2>
                    <p>SMS and Skype messages are no longer linking, and selecting a skype message within the Messaging + Skype app and trying to respond says:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't send</p>
<p>
</p><p>One or more of your recipients is invalid. Check for typos and errors, then try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried signing out of skype (which removes skype messages) and signing back in, but it does the same thing. Also, when trying to send a new message, it does not show Skype contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this problem once before, and the only way I fixed it was by resetting the phone back to OOBE and setting everything back up again, I'd like to avoid this if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Update*</p>
<p>I decided to go ahead and reset my phone and do a restore. Once I did this Messaging + Skype worked as it should.</p>

            <p>Hey, no that did not fix it. I think it is account related. I wiped the phone and had someone else sign into the phone and their account worked just fine. What could be wrong with my account that would stop the app from working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition on desktop my computer cannot download the skype and messaging app from the store. It gives an error. Is there some possibility my account is blocked on skype?</p>

<h2>            Getting Office 365 mail through a Mac mail client</h2>
                    <p>I have tried numerous times to get Office 365 through POP or IMAP to my MAC Mail. &nbsp;My mac is running v 10.10.5 and the mail client is up to date. &nbsp;I have followed instructions to get the client added and it goes through the process but then mail keeps prompting
 for the password. When I add the password it asks me for it again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office options available to download in Office 365 are Office 2016 based. &nbsp;I believe from internet search that only the Outlook client in 2011 is compatible with Mac. &nbsp;I certainly can't get Outlook 2016 to connect to Office 365. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding the Office 365 mail to my iPhone Outlook client was an absolute doddle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Phil,<br />
Firstly, I’d like to tell you that both Outlook 2016 for Mac and Outlook 2011 for Mac are compatible with Mac.
<br />
<br />
Secondly, from your description, my understanding is that you want to add (configure) your Office 365 account in Outlook 2016 for Mac via IMAP or POP. Please clarify it if your situation is misunderstood. You may also upload a screenshot about Outlook 2016
 asks for your password while adding your Office 365 account.<br />
<br />
If it is that case, I’d like to say we don’t recommend our customers configure Office 365 account via IMAP or POP. We commonly set up an Office 365 account in Outlook for Mac via “Exchange” (while adding the Office 365 account, we click “+”&gt; Exchange&gt; Type
 the account’s username and password. So, can you re-confirm this?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            I prefer to use:<br />
<br />
Docmd.Close acform, "formname", acSaveNo<br />
<br />
The acSaveNo prevents design and property changes. Specifically sorts and filters. If a user applies a filter and the form is saved on close, the next user will open the form with that filter in place. So you don't want those properties to be saved.

    <title>Error messages freeze IE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g. david  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error messages freeze IE</h2>
                    Anyone seen these error messages? When I boot my system (XP), I get a window titled "Internet Redirection" with the text "You are about to be redirected to a new internet site. Any information you exchanged with the current site could be retransmitted
 to a new internet site you are about to connect with. Do you wish to continue? . . ." on my desktop before I've even clicked on a browser icon. My default browser is IE 9. When I do open and try to log onto IE, I get another error message titled "Microsoft
 Visual C++ Runtime Library" with the wording "Runtime Error! Program: C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe &nbsp;This application has requested the Runtime to terminate in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support team for more information."
 Logging onto Google presents no such error, but if I try to redirect to another website, the message appears again and prevents any other command responses until "OK" in clicked. When that is done, the connection terminates.

            If you installed any application before problem get started please uninstall them. You could use system restore and restore back to the time before problem start. Having two real-time protection Anti-Virus (McAfee and Microsoft Security Essentials) would
 cause problem in performance and other issues, please uninstall one of them and only use one Anti-Virus.

<p>This must be the most frustrating issue and discussed by many users. Why can this not be resolved via self service?&nbsp; Why can the nokia support folks not just publish some advice for users? I am sure this is one of their top support issues and yet they are
 not trying to make it easier for us, thier customers and 2ndly for themselves?&nbsp; They are depreciating their brand and are wasting their own resources time by not trying to resolve this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting these messages both on my phone and pc....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive started using these interactive services on my secondary device and have given up trying to use the OVI store....&nbsp; Terrible and really frustrating that Nokia does not care for their customers....</p>

<h2>            Mac version of office missing tons of features</h2>
                    <p>The Office 2016 feature list on windows and mac is quite different and I do not think this really is for technical reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few of the missing features I observed recently:</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Word : Digital (certificate) based document signing is not possible =&gt; use other software&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel : not able to use multiple processors =&gt; slow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook : can not import a list of calendar events from a csv or excel file</p>
<p>
</p><p>The online versions of office do not offer these features either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm certain the list of key items that are available under Windows, but not on the Mac version will grow if this post gets older and collects more replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found non-Microsoft based workarounds for all the above.. and in the end MS will loose clients if they keep selling the Mac version at the same price as the windows version.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Pgoe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing with us your feedback. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand Office Online and Office for Mac may don’t have all features which are available in Office for Windows. It will be more convenient if some features can also be used in Office Online and Office for Mac.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the differences between Office Online and desktop applications, below are some articles for your reference:</p>

<h2>            Cannot open mail 365 page in Edge.</h2>
                    <p>Can't Open MSO Mail 365 Page Hangs Opening- Original Title</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear MS Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using my colleges email address they gave me since first week in Feb this year.</p>
<p>The address is a MSO Mail 365 and last night I installed the free MSO 365 2016 package given to me but I also already have MSO 365&nbsp;2016 as a subscription, so I presumed I just add my account and have access to both accounts, well 3 accounts I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Win10 Edge Browser has just started hanging and not opening.</p>
<p>I now have to use my IE11 browser instead, but I would prefer to use my Win10 Edge because I find it much slower and the constant "Recovery Webpage" is a pest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me, what should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know my system depends on a 2GB RAM, which I am going to ramp up to 16GB if possible, but I don't think it is the RAM that's causing this browser to have changed like this.</p>
<p>Pity I cannot take a video to add here, but here is a picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I forgot to mention, I had also installed MS Azure/plus Remote and MS Web Matrix through MSO Dreamspark and since installing these apps.</p>
<p>I have been asking for help with my DVD RW in another thread, where it keeps disappearing has come back to stay in the "This PC" folder, though still not tested, it seems that it is staying put.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi KoKa-DiDa, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. We understand that your deleted email messages on Outlook.com is not also deleted on your mobile device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For clarification, do you want your deleted emails on&nbsp;Outlook.com be also deleted on your phone? If yes, your sync issue might be due to your account that&nbsp;went out of sync with the phone, or the mail server settings were not configured properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can resolve this by removing and re-adding your account from the phone. Check out this link for the steps:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook-to-go#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mobile Outlook.com.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, ensure that the mail server settings are properly configured. Refer to this link for the values:

            If you have the Outlook Hotmail Connector installed on the PC, you connect to your Outlook.com mailbox using the Hotmail Connector, and you are using an Exchange ActiveSync account on your Note 2, then anything one device does should get synched with the
 second device. &nbsp;Messages you delete on the PC should get removed from the Note 2 and vice versa.

            The only free way I know to sync Office Outlook 2010 and your Note 2 is by using Outlook.com/Hotmail as the intermediary service.&nbsp; You can purchase sync tools otherwise.

            <p>I have a very similar problem with a Microsoft Live account (hotmail) and the inability for the built-in gmail client on my Android (Samsung Galaxy S4) to remove deleted messages from the Inbox on the Samsung device (messages I have deleted form the Inbox
 in Gmail client in the browser and have refreshed from the server etc etc)...</p>
<p>I was really hoping someone here had an answer as the person above seems to be experiencing my exact issue, but replies are very disappointing, basically saying "it should work" WHAT? What is the point of having a forum like this if we get answers like "it
 should work"? that is like saying "we don't know" - an unacceptable answer in the world of technology IMHO</p>

            <p>I use the built-in Email app on an Android 4.1.1 device and all of the folders, including the one holding deleted messages, sync just fine with my Outlook.com account. &nbsp;I say "it should work" because it should and does for me and there's nothing particularly
 different for my account. &nbsp;It's just an ordinary Outlook.com account I've had for nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can say "I don't know" when the process doesn't work and the typical methods of addressing it don't help, since I don't work for Microsoft and have no inside knowledge on the process internals. &nbsp;The only thing I have others might not is fairly extensive
 experience using an Android device with Outlook.com. &nbsp;I've also installed the new Outlook for Android app Microsoft introduced on January 27 and it, too, works, although I don't see any particular advantages it has over either the previous Outlook.com app
 or the built-in Email app.</p>

<h3> aitchie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xperia transfer Mobile</h2>
                    <p>I have been given a used Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Tablet in almost new condition.<br />
<br />
I want to transfer my contacts and other info from my Microsoft Lumia 640 phone, using Xperia Transfer Mobile.<br />
<br />
I've loaded this app on both devices successfully, however when I trey to upload the data to the cloud, the following happens.<br />
<br />
Sign In to Google account: &nbsp;Successful<br />
"Know your age range and language" and "View your basic profile info": &nbsp;Allow<br />
My phone goes through 3 processes: Connecting; &nbsp;Preparing; &nbsp;Select Content.<br />
<br />
The program then terminates and takes me back to the Lumia Home Screen.<br />
<br />
I've tried this a number of times with the same result.<br />
<br />
The following data refers to my phone<br />
<br />
Model: &nbsp;RM-1075 Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE Dual SIM<br />
Software: Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2<br />
OS Version: 8.10.15148.160<br />
Firmware Version Number: 02177.00000.15184.36003<br />
Hardware Revision Number: 2.1.9.2<br />
Radio Software Version: &nbsp;401c3.00009.0001<br />
Chip SOC Version: &nbsp;8926<br />
<br />
Please can you suggest a solution to this problem.<br />
<br />
Thankyou.<br />
<br />
Regards</p>

</p><p>Hi Aitchie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your desire to transfer contact details and other files on your Lumia to your new tablet, we recommend that you contact the application developer of the app that you are using to migrate data from your old phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try using OneDrive when transferring files from your Lumia to your new tablet since there is an available OneDrive app on the platform of your new tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further help on migrating your contact details and the like.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Billy Med</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">This App,&nbsp;<strong>Xperia™ Transfer Mobile</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">,&nbsp;</span>since it has a trademark stamp, is presumably made by Sony, and as
 such I sent them a similar request, for which I await a reply.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">A subscriber to the Sony Community suggested that I try asking Microsoft, hence my query.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I had already tried loading MS OneDrive onto the tablet, but when I open it, it says
<strong>Welcome to OneDrive</strong>, and then just hangs. &nbsp;I've just tried again with the same result.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've had to resort to transferring the contacts one-by-one with bluetooth, a laborious process, so a faster method would certainly be better.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Regards,</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Aitchie.</p>

<p>Regarding the Sony Transfer Mobile app, you may have to toggle On 'access for less secure apps' in your
<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Google account security settings</a> down the page.</p>
<p>(Turn it back Off when finished).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Or</em> the contacts can be exported in .CSV format from Manage in the top bar at
<a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/#path=/people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.live.com/owa/#path=/people</a> - to import in the Google account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Or</em> the Microsoft account can be added as an EAS / Activesync account to the Sony, where you can elect to sync the contacts (and calendars).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to temporarily disable two-factor authentication on the Microsoft account if enabled. (The Authenticator apps from Microsoft and Google are compatible for each others accounts and for other services).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this help?</p>
