    <title>Wav file does not play on Windows system &#40;but does on Mac&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wav file does not play on Windows system &#40;but does on Mac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I recently recorded the two 50 minute parts of a concert my wife was playing in. Same recorder (a fairly high quality Zoom H4N), same format, same setting (Wav file), same sampling rate, recorded on the same, new 32GB SD drive. The first half of the concert
 (part1) plays just fine on my Windows system (Dell Inspiron 7000 with Win 10 Home) and different playback software (incl. Music Player and NCH Suite's Wave Pad). The second part does not produce a sound at all in any software and shows a flat line on the Wave
 Pad editor. However, when I play part 2 on the Zoom recorder or on my wife's MacBook Pro, it plays just fine. Just as a test, I re-saved it from the Mac and then attempted to play again on my Windows system. That file shows a flat line for the first 30 or
 so minutes, but then has full sound wave display and sound reproduction is fine.
</p>
<p>I could, of course give up on the Windows system and try to work with just the Mac, but I can't stand working on that machine and would like to make this work on my computer. Any ideas on how to deal with this issues would be greatly appreciated.

            Hey there Holger! This definitely seems like some kind of error, because the voice acting clips I submit are all in .wav and work perfectly.
<br />
<br />This problem occurs if a codec that is required to play the file is not installed on the computer. A codec is software that the Player uses to decompress a file before playing it.
<br />
<br /> Step 1 Run Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Step 2: You may have to download and install the codec: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926373</a>
<br />
<br />You receive a codec error message, or audio plays but video does not play when you play media files in Windows Media Player

            Hi Holger.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try VLC media Player:  <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a>
<br />
<br /> Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br /> 
<br /> If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />  If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Converting macro to VBA fails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emerald77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting macro to VBA fails</h2>
                    <p>I have the following macro tied to a combo box that I would like to convert to VBA:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action:&nbsp; SearchForRecord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Record:&nbsp; First<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Condition:&nbsp; ="[SPRFNumber] = " &amp; "'" &amp; [Screen].[ActiveControl] &amp; "'"<br />
<br />
When I click the "Convert Form's Macros to Visual Basic" button, I get the following error message:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a problem opening the macro '[Embedded Macro]'.&nbsp; Do you want to continue?"<br />
<br />
If I select "Yes", I then get a dialog box saying "Conversion Finished!"&nbsp; However, when I look in the VBA Editor, no code is found.<br />
<br />
After searching the web, it appears that this is a known (and reproduceable) Access 2010 bug, but it doesn't look like Microsoft has fixed it yet.<br />
<br />
Can someone kindly show me the comparable VBA code for the aforementioned macro?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any assistance.</p>

    <title>Excel Solver level load capacity, possible&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> camcafe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Solver level load capacity, possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am given a demand for each part and order# with start date on each order, but it is very uneven demand when broke down to the hours requirement across the start date. Some date total hours requirement is over the available machine capacity.</p>
<p>Is it possible Excel Solver can level load the schedule (shifting orders within the schedule) so the hours demand would not exceed machine capacity?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is sample data.</p>
<p>First row is the start date of the order.</p>
<p>Data is in Hours converted from number of orders schedule on the date.</p>
<p>The machine available capacity is 13 hrs per day. If I average the total hours (last row), it is only 10.2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Criteria could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total hours each cannot exceed avail hours.</li><li>Hours (orders) cannot be move backward, only forward. If PartA on 3/8 is 9.9 can only move to a date before 3/8 and not after.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: 3/3 is have 2.3 hours scheduled, where 3/7, 8 and 11 is over the avail capacity of 10.2 hours.</p>

            <p>Bernard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I am trying to do is to see if there is a way to balance out the requirement so the date where I am over avail capacity can be reduce by moving part(s) to a different date that are way under capacity. In the example, move the job on PartI on 3/7 (5.5
 hrs) date 3/3 where there are only 2.3 hours scheduled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe, Solver is not the right tool to use. I just don't know how to solve this problem with Excel application.</p>

    <title>Windows Mobile 6.5 on HTC Imagio turns into a sliggish brick too often - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Mobile 6.5 on HTC Imagio turns into a sliggish brick too often</h2>
                    
<p>I got an HTC imagio the week they were announced. Over time I noticed that the phone became really sluggish, to the point that the hard buttons wouldn't even respond to touch. It regularly got to the point where the touch screen would not respond at all.
 I would have to pull the battery and restart it to get phone service, and the restart process took what seemed like two minutes.</p>
<p>At first I thought it might be network bandwidth, and felt by enabling wifi I might see a boost, but I did not, so I turned that off to preserve battery life. Next I thought it might be external apps, so I removed all but BING, which is the killer app on
 my phone.</p>
<p>Next I thought it might have to do with the Exchange connectivity, so I disabled that so that the device only syncs to the Exchange server when I tell it to.</p>
<p>Last week it got so bad, I did a full reset to start over. I noticed after the full reset that the phone's responsiveness is much better. I also noticed that the labels for the softkeys are not visible in many cases, or only appear long after the UI has
 already switched to the new mode.</p>
<p>I have two questions</p>
<p>1) do other users of this phone and OS face the same challenges?</p>
<p>2) what about the construction of the code leads to this performance degradation over time?</p>

<p>Removing the battery only performs a soft reset (not a full reset).&nbsp; When you are finished using an application and close it by tapping the X at the top of the screen, most of the time the application is not closed at all...it is minimized and keeps running
 in the background, taking up valuable processing memory. Over time this can degrade performance and even lock up a device.&nbsp; Performing a soft reset flushes out the memory and closed all the running applications.</p>
<p>You can use a third party task manager or the default task manager on the device to review and close applications that are running in the background.&nbsp; You can usually find the default task manager on an HTC device by tapping Start &gt; Settings &gt; All Settings
 &gt; System &gt; Task Manager (or something like that).&nbsp; If you've got some programmable buttons on your device, you could program one of the buttons to bring up the Task Manager quickly to help you manage the running applications on the device.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Oops, something went wrong, please try again.</h2>
                    <p>So I was trying to post a reply to this topic:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_winother-mso_2010/running-spreadsheet/4d1a3297-05dc-48b9-b833-cc5f36a61236</p>
<p>I typed out:</p>

<p><span>Yeah, I think Tom is right, and writing Macros is a rather advanced topic...</span></p>

<p><span>If you are willing to have a "history list" sheet, you could copy the body of the Request form to that tab each time you get a request, and then reference the history
 on your inventory list.&nbsp; Not sure if I'm being clear...</span></p>

<p><span>So your inventory list might have "Staplers," on cell A3.&nbsp; On B3 you might have your current count.&nbsp; On C3 you could have "Requested," which would be a sumif from
 your history list sheet pulling all requested numbers next to "Staplers," on that sheet.&nbsp; On D3 you could have "Remaining," or something which would just be B3-C3.</span></p>

<p><span>Each time you re-count your inventory you delete all the requests that have been filled from your history tab.</span></p>

<p><span>Your history would just be a list of "Item name," "Amount Requested," and optionally "Request ID."&nbsp; The latter would allow you to know which requests have been filled
 and which are still outstanding when you re-count your inventory.</span></p>

<p><span>I do have one other question though, how many people will be using this?&nbsp; It really feels like an Access database problem rather than an Excel problem.&nbsp; I know (from
 painful experience) how hard it is to initially figure out Access, but once you do it would be pretty easy to set this up, and then you could have multiple people enter info in your Request form at the same time.&nbsp; In addition you could lock them out of everything
 but that form, so they couldn't mess with your inventory.&nbsp; If this is for just a few people and only one will be in the file at a time than Excel will still work.</span></p>

<p>Hit post, and got below the text "Oops, something went wrong, please try again."</p>
<p>I hit reply again, and same thing.&nbsp; I exited out, re-opened the topic, hit reply, and pasted in my response, same thing!</p>
<p>This is the second time this has happened, and it seems to permanently&nbsp;lock me out of replying to a particular thread.&nbsp; It also seems to happen if someone else is posting a reply at the same time.</p>
<p>Anyone know how to post to a thread when you are locked out like this?</p>
<p>Also, no idea where to place this category wise, I guess the folks in Microsoft Community believe that their program will never have any bugs or questions?</p>

<p><strong><em>Anyone know how to post to a thread when you are locked out like this?</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irritating isn't it?&nbsp; FWIW my usual "cloning" procedure is to always press Ctrl-k and then Ctrl-F5.&nbsp; Watch to make sure that you are still signed in.&nbsp; One of the causes of this is that you get signed out without being aware of it and without getting a clue
 from even a Ctrl-k.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl-F5 is supposed to request the same page again without referring to any version&nbsp;the browser (IE or Edge)&nbsp;happens to know about in the cache.&nbsp; Fortunately those two things are sufficient in the majority of cases.&nbsp; However, I have had
 another case (happen infrequently but really annoying when it does)--the Ctrl-F5 makes it appear that I am still signed in but I'm not!&nbsp; E.g. when I switch to Edge (from IE) or vice versa, it is clear that the problem was that the site thought I was not signed
 in.&nbsp; As soon as I get signed in I can start the post again and it goes first try.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I should also mention the most obnoxious variant of all--no Oops! and no Sorry, just a greyed locked screen.&nbsp; Then the only way to recover your work would be to go into the Developer Tools and get it for a Paste as child operation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much better to be
 aware of this possibility and be on guard for it by&nbsp;always doing a&nbsp;Ctrl-a, Ctrl-c before clicking Submit.&nbsp; I haven't had to be so vigilant for the possibility of such a loss since when I was using Dial-up!</p>

<p>Yeah, I did finally find a solution for this.&nbsp; I close the window and then delete all microsoft cookies (no loss).</p>
<p>Apparently microsoft is putting me in some odd half-logged in state where I can post new topics but not reply, and if I try to log in it gives me an error because "I'm already logged in."&nbsp; If I try to post a reply I can't because "who are you?"</p>
<p>I guess expecting microsoft programmers to be able to write a web site that works in Internet Exploder is rather foolish of me...</p>

    <title>Only 2 out of 3 email notifications working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Only 2 out of 3 email notifications working</h2>
                    I believe that there should be the possibility for 3 email tiles to show new email counts on the lock screen. I have 3 tiles pinned to the home screen - two with multiple email accounts and one with a single email account. The 1st and 3rd both show new
 email counts on the lock screen - but the 2nd does not (which is one of the multiple email account tiles). I have tried unpining the 2nd and 3rd tiles, then re-pinning...but to no avail - still only the 1st and 3rd show new email counts.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            <p>Hello Rose b:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for responding and adding some clarity to your situation.&nbsp; I think what may be happening is that there is a misunderstanding about the lock screen notifications.&nbsp; It looks like it allows for notifications to 3 emails and not infinite emails put
 into the three slots.&nbsp; This may come down to determining which three accounts you would most like to see the lock screen notifications for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to test if this is what is happening it so first, unlink the Microsoft account and POP3 account that make up slot one.&nbsp; Once you have done this, go to settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold your Microsoft account &gt; select sync.&nbsp; Send an
 email to one of the POP3 accounts that are in slot 2.&nbsp; Do you now get a notification on the lock screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still do not get notifications to tile 2, please unlink the three accounts that make up tile 2 and then sync your account.&nbsp; Again send a test email to the accounts that now make up your three email slots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do need to set the lock screen email slots again, you may need to remove accounts and readd them to the phone.&nbsp; The first slot will be for the Microsoft account.&nbsp; The next two will be associated with next accounts added to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Office 2016- Cannot Discard Draft</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was unable to delete messages until I came across this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016_preview-outlook/imap-inbox-problem-outlook-2016/e533b968-3d05-426d-b04f-e11126707b3b</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still unable to discard draft messages. &nbsp;Also, I cannot get the Outlook app to stay pinned to the start bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Small issues, but very annoying. &nbsp;I kind of regret updating my office. &nbsp;I had a Microsoft support person remotely on my computer for 2.5 hours and could not figure it out. &nbsp;Spoke to someone on the phone whom said I am the only one with this issue. &nbsp;A simple
 search revealed that is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary: How do I discard drafts?</p>
<p>How do I get the App to stay pinned to my task bar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I tested deleting emails. &nbsp;They deleted, but when I go to my deleted folder, they are not there. &nbsp;How do I fix this? &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Word 2011 has insufficient disk space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sallybarrett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2011 has insufficient disk space</h2>
                    I use Word for editing large documents. I use track changes. After about 2 hours of editing a document, I try to save it and all the menus show up as blank, and when I hit to save it, it comes up with a box that says 'Word 2011 has insufficient disk space
 to save this file... do you want to save as a rescued document?'
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I can't seem to work with the rescued document at all, and I lose any changes that I made in the last 10 minutes or so. It has done this every time I've edited this one document, which is a university thesis.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this a problem with my (brand new) iMac, or is it a Microsoft problem? I've never encountered this when working on a PC.</div>

            Hi Sally:
<div><br />
<div>This is a well-known problem with Mac Word 2011.</div>
<div><br />
<div>"Insufficient disk space" is nonsense, it's simply Microsoft's best guess as to why the write to disk would be refused (which it has been). &nbsp;In fact, it's a file server locking issue: the server thinks more than one user is trying to open the document.
 &nbsp;(The "server" in this case, is part of the OS on your computer.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The cause appears to be the number of files Word is trying to hold open. &nbsp;Word has about 20 or 30 different files open while you are editing a document. &nbsp;If you save the document three times to three different locations, that's 60 to 90 files it holds
 open. &nbsp;If you never restart the computer, those files can stay open, until eventually the computer can't open any more and you get this error.</div>
<div><br />
<div>One of the first things to do when you get a "can't save" message is to re-start the computer, to clear all the dead file locks that have collected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, the other thing that will give you a "Can't save" error is Tracked Changes. &nbsp;Word goes to save the document, and notices a few seconds later that nothing got written to disk. &nbsp;The reason is that while you are working, Word loads the file in its
 internal format for speed. &nbsp;When you save, Word first converts &nbsp;that internal format to .docx, then tries to convert the .docx to .doc if you are working in the obsolete format. &nbsp;A .docx can contain a heap of things that a .doc simply cannot store. &nbsp;And Tracked
 Changes can make the internals of the document so complicated that Word can't read it. &nbsp;Either way, one of the conversions fails, so the save fails, so you get the message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sure you are up at Update 14.1.4 (look in Word&gt;About Word for the version number). &nbsp;Microsoft has put out several fixes to try to improve this behaviour.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You have NOT set up an "auto-save"; Word doesn't have one. &nbsp;You have set up a save of "AutoRecovery Data" every five minutes. &nbsp;This feature is not a lot of use: it will restore the document only if Word knows that it has crashed (not hung...) and only
 if it can read the&nbsp;original&nbsp;document. &nbsp;It's not saving the document, it's saving a list of changes to the document, so if it can't read the original, you're hosed. &nbsp;And if you quit Word, it will wipe out the autorecovery store.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A better mechanism is Word&gt;Preferences&gt;Save "Always make backup". &nbsp;That will work only if you MANUALLY save. &nbsp;But it actually saves the previous version of the document, in the same folder, labelled "Backup of..." every time you save.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you save every time you pause to think, you will never loose more than a few minutes worth. &nbsp;You can simply open "Backup of..." it's a complete document, not a list of changes. &nbsp;Save it as a new file name, and off you go again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Compare Document will give you character-for-character markup of the changes you have made: the only thing you lose is the exact time that each edit was made: not a big loss. &nbsp;But your documents are much less likely to fail if you turn off Track Changes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sadly, there's not a lot that Technical Help would be able to do for you. &nbsp;The cause is bugs in the Word program, which are being triggered by the way you work. &nbsp;Microsoft is still working on these issues: but they are very complex, and they may never
 be able to fix them all in the current version of Word. &nbsp;Sorry: but if I told you anything else, I would be misleading you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We can, of course, hope that the next version of Word will have replaced the file writing mechanism so it doesn't do this. &nbsp;We have been hoping this for three versions now...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<h2>            All pdf printouts become blank in OneNote 2016&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some unknown reason, all PDF printouts in my OneNote 2016 desktop do not show. Every page appears as a red x. I've tried to manually sync, and reopen books, but it doesn't help. Drawing something new on a page does not solve the problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the blank pages, I can see my notes. All pages show normally online as well as on my Surface Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has a solution for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really a very bad experience!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jinglei</p>

    <title>shortcut to watermark&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rg_957  say:</h3>
<h2>            shortcut to watermark&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for a keyboard short cut.&nbsp; I want to able to insert a watermark into any Word document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried doing so with macros.&nbsp; In one attempt I tried to create a macro that would go Layout &gt; Watermark &gt; Insert Watermark and then insert the desired word and set the desired formatting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another attempt I created a template with the desired watermark and then tried to create a macro that would open that template.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither macro works.&nbsp; Each macro opens a blank page and stops at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I say, I have the template.&nbsp; I can open it easily enough by pulling down the File menu to “New from Template.”&nbsp; But doing so requires me to take my hand from the keyboard.&nbsp; I will use this watermark very often. &nbsp;I would prefer a keyboard short cut so
 that I can insert the watermark fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally I would prefer to insert the watermark in a document before I print it.&nbsp; That makes for only one trip through the printer.&nbsp; As an alternative, I could live with printing the watermark as a separate document in a second pass through the printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a technique for inserting a specific watermark with a keyboard shortcut?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There's certainly no need for a <em>template</em> to do this. In fact, a template is an awkward way to go about it unless you want to be able to generate
<em>new</em> documents from the template with the watermark already in place. Additionally, I'm having no problem here recording a macro triggered by a keyboard shortcut to insert either a built-in or custom Text Watermark. It also makes no sense to me that
 such a macro would create a new document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try following these steps to see if you have success;</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new blank document</li><li>Go to <strong>Tools&gt; Macro - Record New Macro</strong> <em>or</em> click the <strong>
Record</strong> button on the <strong>Developer</strong> tab</li><li>Name the macro using no punctuation or spaces</li><li>Click the <strong>Keyboard</strong> button</li><li>Press the key combination you want to use, making sure that <strong>[unassigned]</strong> appears beneath the editable field</li><li>Click the <strong>Assign</strong> button</li><li>Confirm that <strong>Normal.dotm</strong> is indicated in the <strong>Save changes in:</strong> list</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong></li><li>Go to <strong>Insert&gt; Watermark..</strong>. or use the <strong>Watermark</strong> button on the
<strong>Layout</strong> tab</li><li>Click the <strong>Text</strong> option</li><li>Select a built-in watermark or type one you prefer</li><li>Set the formatting options</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong></li><li>Go to <strong>Tools&gt; Macro - Stop Recording</strong> or click the <strong>Stop</strong> button on the
<strong>Developer</strong> tab</li></ol>
<p>You can then close the document without saving it. When you create a new document or open any existing one, use the keystroke. You should find that the watermark is applied with no problem.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you're prompted to 'save Normal.dotm' or to 'save the recorded macro' be sure to click the
<strong>Save</strong> button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could also be handled as an AutoText Item but it would be a bit cumbersome &amp; there's no real advantage to doing it that way.</p>

<p>Hi JSL Marine,</p>
<p>To better help you, I'd like to confirm whether you want to disable the Word Online in the app launcher.</p>
<p>If so, to disable it, we need to uncheck the Office Online license. And we don't recommend you uncheck the Office Online license. When you do it, all the Office files in your libraries won't be opened via Office Online. To disable it: Let the global admin
 log into<a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> the portal</a>&gt;Under <strong>USERS</strong>, click
<strong>Active Users</strong>&gt;Select your account and click<strong> Edit</strong> under
<strong>Assigned license</strong>&gt;Expand the subscription and uncheck <strong>Office Online</strong>.</p>
<p>If not, to clarify the situation, I'd like to confirm the following:<br />
1. For "streaming version tries to take over and stops me working", could you provide the detailed information for us?
<br />
2. How did you download and install the Office? And what Office 365 subscription do you have?<br />
3. You may share a screenshot of the symptom. To upload screenshots, you can click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> in the forum and then click the icon of <strong>
Insert/Edit Media</strong>.</p>
<p>Please share updates when you have time.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Felix</p>

            <p>I had this on one of my old PCs, the bar just seemed to stick at about 1/3rd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two things I tried which helped:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1</strong> Manually download and install the latest <em>( and correct for your PC/OS )
</em>version&nbsp; of your definition files from here - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx</a> does that install OK? If so, will it update automatically afterwards?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2</strong> If that does not help, then when MSE is trying to update, check and stop ( if its running ) the Windows Update Service. Then retry MSE, does it update then?</p>
<p>&lt;start&gt; in 'search programs and files' type "services" ( without quotes ). In the program results, click SERVICES, the services window should open. Scroll down and check if Windows Update Service is running, if it is then right-click it and stop it, then
 restart the MSE update check. <em>You may need to be in an ADMIN account to start or stop a service, in which case right-click Services in the program results and click 'Run As Administrator'.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it still doesn't help, it <em>may</em> be something to do with a general update problem ( are Windows Updates being applied correctly ? ), so check through this to see if the required updates are installed -

Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
Usually you will see on the Right hand bottom corner it tells <strong>Windows 10 pro Technical Preview Evolution copy Build 10041</strong>. If you see that you don’t have the latest build, then I would suggest you to download and install latest Build from the
 following link: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso-update-1503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
Let us know the update after you try the above steps.</span>

    <title>Is it possible to revert OneNote&#39;s unwanted and forced underlines - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jklmnoffice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to revert OneNote&#39;s unwanted and forced underlines of ALL custom-colored links and&#47;or URLs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Up until the most recent update, when I did not want the standard blue link with an underline, I would change the link's color and the underlines would disappear. I spent hours upon hours creating a tightly packed but professionally designed Table of Contents
 page that uses 8 different custom colors for links. It is a page I use daily to navigate to not only 1000s of pages but more importantly to all the subTOCs I have created for each section of which there are dozens. These TOC pages was perfectly readable and
 worked awesomely. Now? Not at all. Not only are they nigh unreadable but they are ugly as sin.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Anyhow, is all this underlining due to a OneNote update,* or might something else that may have happened?</strong><br />
</p>
<p>If this is the default going forward, no thank you. I may have to rollback my Mac and Windows to last week's versions and see if I can prevent further updates until either OneNote fixes its stupidity or at least gives back the "no underlines" option to users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, OneNote, this is a dealbreaker. For shame, for shame. While I much prefer Evernote because of its syncing and non-breaking internal links, I came to OneNote for its formatting. However, EN has its doctorate in syncing and links. OneNote is in
 kindergarten on both. While Evernote is limited in its formatting -- call EN in seventh grade and ON in tenth (overall) -- I cannot recall an EN update in over seven years' use that broke form or function. OneNote has just broken both. If I must, I will gladly
 return to Evernote and pay whatever it costs now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>cc: Post a discussion. Kidding, I will hit up the feedback channels to voice my displeasure IF underlines are indeed being forced upon users regardless of link formatting.</p>

            Thank you. The uservoice site wasn't popping up in the upper echelon of Google results. Underlined custom-colored links may be a bug in the recent update(s) due to how OneNote also now mangles formatting when copy'n'pasting a series of links when this
 did not happen last week either. I have a scheduled call Monday to discuss.

<h2>            Windows update making me buy windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonight after a windows update, all my word documents have turned orange and when I click on them it asks me to buy office 10 or try the free month trial. I have been using word 2002 for a while now and Im doing a big project for uni and want to stick with
 that for now. Is there anyway I can stay with word 2002?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why has this update happened? Is it normal to try to update the type of office version we are using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

            No, it is not normal.<br />
<br />
Today's batch of Patch Tuesday updates includes several with nasty problems. It would probably be best to uninstall today's patches and wait a week to find out what's been going wrong.<br />
<br />
Open the Windows Update window and click the Installed Updates link in the bottom left. When the list is complete, scroll down the the section for Microsoft Office 2007. Click each line that shows today's date in the Installed On column, and click Uninstall
 in the bar at the top of the list. <br />
<br />
You may also need to run a System Restore to a point before those updates, to undo changes in the registry if the uninstallation doesn't do it properly. That's in Control Panel &gt; Recovery.<br />

            Yes you should be able to continue running Word 2002, but it is no longer supported by MS.<br />
<br />
There is no "Windows 10".&nbsp; Do you mean Office 2010? There is absolutely no reason for a legitimate Windows Update to be prompting you to buy Office 2010. MS is only selling 2013.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that your computer came with a "free trial" of Office 2010 that you have some how triggered. Go into Programs and Features and see if You have Office 2010 installed as well as your copy of Office 2002.&nbsp; If you do have an Office 2010 trial, then
 unisntall it and do an Office Repair of 2002.<br />

            <p>Thanks a lot for the replies. I have uninstalled the update and done a system repair and that has solved the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think I got this update as part of the bad 'patch update'? I also see I have been getting updates for office 2007 as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They definitely look like legitimate windows updates as they are in that part of the computer and have the reference code etc. At work when this happened, my colleagues computer (also windows 7) was going through updates at exactly the same time but his
 word was unaffected, although he was using a more modern version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I be worried about this? Could it have been a security breach? Thanks again

<b><span>Update Offers Updates for Programs you do not have installed</span></b>

</b></p>
<p>Windows Update often offers updates for programs that you think you do not have installed. The link above gives 3 reasons why this happens and some possible solutions. Another reason is that the updates are often not only for the single
 product in the description. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updates are often bundled for more than just the app identified in the label. More than one program or bundle may be using the same component.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, the short answer is, just let Update "do its thing” because it has better insight into the deep details of your system than you do. The only control I sometimes exert is limiting the number of update I let it apply at one time.
 For example, when installing Windows or an application Update may find very many updates so I limit it to 5-10 at a time.
