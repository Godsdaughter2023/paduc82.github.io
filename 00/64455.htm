<p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Brad and I am an Independent Advisor for Microsoft products and I will do my best to assist you with the trouble you are having. I attempted to answer your question previously but it disappeared from the site temporarily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to advise if you are using On-premise/hybrid Skype For Business or Office 365 in your environment? The behaviour of Skype For Business will depend on how you are set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using it in on-premise or hybrid I can attest to not being able to be unable to access a conversation on the computer after talking via mobile or vice versa unless I log out on the one device and log in on the other device. Then I am able to continue
 the running conversation if someone sends a message, but I am still unable to see the chat history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Skype for Business Online you can see the conversations you had on by clicking&nbsp;<span>Find Previous Conversations
</span>on your computer. If you are looking to see conversations on the PC on mobile I believe you can only see them in Outlook for mobile by going to the conversation history. But you should be able to continue group conversations if the conversation continues
 when you are available on the other device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.&nbsp;</p>

            go to Windows Update, install anything available. And whether or not updates are there, restart twice and report if working or not.

    <title>Mouse pointer in vertical dots or microchip form occassionaly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregetz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse pointer in vertical dots or microchip form occassionaly</h2>
                    Got problems with mouse pointer. From time to time, the arrow turns into 9 vertically spread dots, or, if I try to reach for a frame of a document in turns into microchip sign. That stuff lasts from a couple of minutes to half an hour, after which, the
 whole picture starts to vibrate for a second or two, and then turns into a normal mouse pointer. I use dual screen, and on a second screen, during this malfunction, i can hardly see the mouse pointer (dots) if at all. Using USB optical mouse (have cheked out
 the driver, mouse pointer setting etc, but no success). Cannot find that trouble on forums eithr. Pls help..

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the computer after which the issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and troubleshoot the issue and check if it helps. You can start Windows Vista or
 Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

(Step 1: Perform a clean boot)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></strong></a></span></p>

<br />How much time is it stuck on the boot screen?
<br />
<br />Reboot the PC three times during the boot screen and do a System Restore if a point exists:

<br />If it is in Safe Mode (or even better for you would be Safe Mode with Networking ) then it will be labeled that on the Desktop.

<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

    <title>Kids disabling Family Safety on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jb2041  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kids disabling Family Safety on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 PC's that are used by my 2 kids, both are identical machines running the latest version of Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both have been setup with Admin accounts (with my MS login) and they both have Child (MS) accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've enabled family safety and am able to manage their screen time and other functionality from a web browser. All good so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that they have discovered how to disable family safety via the Task Manager, which is obviously not ideal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to overcome this problem (disable the Task Manager maybe ?) so that I can get back to managing their activity through Family Safety as normal ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>JB</p>

</p><p>Hi JB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You stated that that both kiddos are set up as Standard users - that's the problem.&nbsp; Log into the PC and change the user types to Child (i.e. not standard or administrator), and they won't have the ability to&nbsp;disable the feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>For Windows 8.1 here&nbsp;are the steps from <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-child-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> page:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap <span>
Settings</span>, and then tap <span>Change PC settings</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, click
<span>Settings</span>, and then click <span>Change PC settings</span>.)</span></li><li>Tap or click <span>Accounts</span>, and then tap or click <span>
Other accounts</span>.&nbsp; </li><li>Select the account you want, and then tap or click <span>Edit</span>.</li><li>In the <span>Account type list, select </span><span>Child</span> and then tap or click
<span>OK</span></li></ul>
</li><li>Once the account on the PC is set correctly, you'll also want to click on the "manage family safety settings online" in that same window.&nbsp; That will get your WIndows 8.1 PC connected properly to the service.&nbsp; Clicking on the link will&nbsp;send you on the Microsoft
 family website on account.microsoft.com/family.&nbsp; </li><li>Once there, look for the account profile that shows your child's name and the PC name (i.e. not the one that shows the MSA - even though your child may use that to log into Windows, the settings changes you make there will *only* be applied to Windows 10
 and Windows Phone devices only).&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Each device that isn't running Windows 10 is managed as a separate profile on this page</span>.&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<p>One thing you should also know though -&nbsp;as long as they are able to get around it,&nbsp;their activities won't&nbsp;show on the activity report, and&nbsp;they can&nbsp;turn safesearch OFF, so can get to far more content than they probably should.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be
 a good idea to switch it back when you can.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(and just FYI, child users&nbsp;*cannot* have admin privileges!).</p>

<p>Hi, you could try resetting the display settings on the console.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Remove any disc from the console drive, power the console off, power the console on using the guide button on your controller ( the large button in the centre of the controller ) as the console starts up press and hold both Y and the right trigger, the console
 should restart and the display settings are reset.</p>

<p>Hey there, so it's working on the TV in your car but not any of the TVs in the beach house? &nbsp;It sounds like they may not be set to the right input. &nbsp;Can you check the remote for a button labeled "Input" or maybe "Source." &nbsp;There should be some white text
 by the ports on the TV that tells you which Input you're using.</p>

                    <p>I have recently upgraded to windows 10. After, I lost all but two display resolutions. On the developer's preview, this happened after and update, but I just rolled back the driver and it was fine. Currently, I can't roll back the driver, and it says the
 driver is current. Here are my laptop stats:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer Aspire 5532</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home 64bit</p>
<p>AMD Athlon TF-20 1.6 GHz</p>
<p>3 GB RAM</p>

            <p>Hi Jeremy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since, you have already rolled back to earlier version of drivers you cannot again rollback and the option of rollback will be greyed out. So, you have to update the driver software to use the latest version of display resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>you can update the graphics card drivers/display drivers from manufacturer website and check if it resolves the issue.</span></span></p>

            First of all, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; This is because the MS Answers forums does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked. Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Second of all, it is generally not wise to accept any kind of driver updates offered by the Microsoft Update page - they are probably not going to be the ones you need.&nbsp; It
<br />
Let start with some basic information and see what you have for drivers right now:<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
Exactly when do you see this message and what are you doing when it happens?<br />
<br />
Can yo make it happen anytime you want?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Now provide a few more details about your drivers:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
For audio driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now provide information about the BSODs you have been seeing:<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>The next time your system crashes, provide more information about what you see.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that information too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</div>
<div><br />
Download BlueScreenView from here:
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Unzip and run it (BSV installs nothing) and let it finish scanning all your crash dump files. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you double click on of the dumps, you will get some information about it (including the&nbsp;Caused By Driver field) and you may be able to spot the problem right away - especially if&nbsp;you see a pattern in the dumps where the Caused by Driver field is the
 same (start with that&nbsp;driver).</div>
<div><br />
<div>BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should also look in the lower pane, that display
 all drivers/modules found in the stack.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Select (highlight) one or more of the most recent dump files by clicking them and holding&nbsp;down the Ctrl key to select multiples files. &nbsp;Try to select just the most recent ones that&nbsp;relate to your issue (maybe five or so dump files to get started).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click File, Save Selected Items and save the information from the dumps to a text file on&nbsp;your desktop called BSOD.txt.
<br />
<br />
Open BSOD.txt with a text editor Notepad, WordPad, etc.), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and paste the text from the clipboard (Ctrl-V) back here in your next reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is an example of the BSV report from a single BSOD that I initiated on purpose that&nbsp;shows the cause of the crash as the i8042prt.sys driver belonging to Microsoft Corporation:</div>

                    I am getting malicious pop-ups stating that I should call an 800 number, sometimes my hard drive will be cleaned. sometimes it just keeps going and I must re-boot. Am I the only one getting these pop-ups? It all started when I went to windows 10.

            <p>It shouldn't be anything to do with Windows 10. It sounds like you have some malware on your PC. I would download, install and scan with Malwarebytes from
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let it scan and select to clean anything it finds. Select to use the free version.</p>

            I have Defender from Microsoft.&nbsp; I have scanned with&nbsp; Malwarebytes many times, at the end it shows a Trojan and removes it but it keeps coming back.&nbsp; Even today I have had&nbsp; the same pop-ups. I can't get away from them.

            Ok, I would suggest going into safemode&nbsp;and then scanning again with Malwarebytes. This is only my opinion but I would consider another virus scanner for protection other than defender. I use the free version of Avast, defender will only offer basic protection.

            I am now using the 14 day trial of Malwarebytes, this is getting some but not all of the pop-ups. Yesterday, I went into a new story and got music on and off until I just got out of the story. I still get some when I go to the PA lottery site. Malwarebytes
 helps but doesn't stop the pop-ups. I will try the safe mode though and see if this works. tks for the interest in my problem.

<h2>            window 8 upgrade assistant not working</h2>
                    I am running on XP SP3. I tried running the upgrade assistant but nothing happened. I checked with task manager, the program did run briefly and then kills itself after 2 sec.. why?
                </div>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi Strikex, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From your description, I understand that you are not able to install Window 8 upgrade assistant.</div>
<div><br />
Please don’t worry; I’ll try my best to help you</div>
<div><br />
.<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Right click the upgrade assistant and click Run as administrator.</div>
<div>Other things you can try;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 1: Disable security software before attempting to upgrade.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>You may place your computer in clean boot state and try running windows 8 upgrade assistant and check
<div><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong></div>
<div><br />
Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state</div>
<div>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.1.Click Start, and then click Run.</div>
<div><br />
2. Type msconfig, and then click OK.<br />
The System Configuration Utility dialog box is displayed.</div>
<div><br />
3. Click the General tab, click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.</div>
<div><br />
4 .When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Please perform these recommended steps, review the additional information provided and post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with additional options available that you can utilize to get this issue resolved.<br />

            I tried all 3 methods, the problem is still persist.<br />
<br />
Method 1: I do not see a specific "Run as Administrator" option in right click, just "Run as". So i tried it and run as my account. (I am the administrator)<br />
<br />
Method 2: the only security program i have is Microsoft security essential. (I tried shut it down, it still doesnt work)<br />
<br />
Method 3: Clean boot doesn't work. ( I tried to load all services, doesn't work either)<br />

            I've tried everything listed here, even deleted the anti-virus programme and disabled the windows firewall. &nbsp;I've tried sfc / scannow but this does not cure it.
<div><br />
<div>When using msconfig I do get a spurious message about access denied to a particular item and you might want to log on as an administrator which is odd because I am the only one on this computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also when I do a "run as.." it comes up with a message about cannot unpack to this folder. &nbsp;I've checked the folder both before and after doing this and the process makes the folder "read only". &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I check properties on the downloaded file it says this file is blocked as it comes from another computer but when I unblock this it still won't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Apologies for putting all these oddities on a posting but all I get is a momentary eggtimer then nothing, whatever I seem to do.</div>

If you have a stubborn file, download the program unlocker to unlock the file. Its a useful small program.. (just search unlocker)<br />

<h2>            music library and different file formats</h2>
                    I am transferring my music files from my old computer into a external HD and into my new laptop with windows 8, and I am very disappointed to realize that all my music has been recorded in several different formats. Between ITunes (sorry folks, my iPod
 will only work with it...), and Media player, I have M4A, MP3, and WMA. Is there a way to make it all uniform, so there isn't so much confusion on the library when it loads it up? Which format is better, as far as space usage on hard drive, quality of sound
 reproduction, keeping of original data ripped from the cds? Is there a trusted program that could go through the whole data and make it more uniform? Thank you!

            M4A, MP3 and WMA are all standard formats supported by the media players found on Windows (well, except for WMA in iTunes). An attempt to convert any of them would actually result in degraded audio quality of the file. The absolute best is the uncompressed
 audio from the CD, but that would literally take 700MB or more of space per CD.<br />
<br />
Between these three file formats, there really isn't a need to be "uniform". The best thing I can recommend for any music library is to ensure the music is properly tagged with album and artist info so it looks correct in players such as Zune, iTunes, Winamp,
 the Music app, etc. In terms of these three file formats, you would lose much more time and quality trying to convert them just so the file types are the same.<br />
<br />
As to which of these three formats are the best between each other, I leave that to an audiophile. I simply do not know.<br />

<h2>            Skype on Android&#58; how to remove call overlay when Skype is not the active app</h2>
                    Suddenly today when in a Skype call, I switched to another app but Skype left an overlay up. I could move it, but not get rid of it. I can't find anything in the settings to remove this overlay. Happens in video or voice-only calls. How do I remove this?

<p>I found this thread looking for a solution but I've since found one myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the 'Chats' tab,</p>
<p>Tap your profile picture in the middle of the top bar,</p>
<p>Tap the gear icon at the top right (or scroll down),</p>
<p>Tap 'Calling',</p>
<p>Tap 'Show call window when Skype is in the background' to toggle it on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Skype feels counterintuitive, while at the same time these things seem to hide in plain sight!</p>

    <title>New laptop gets hot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New laptop gets hot</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought an asus N550JK-DS602H. Writing this is literally one of the first things i do with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that the laptop grows suspicously hot. Very light usage will make the computer warm to the touch (my old computer always felt like room temperature unless pushed by gaming), and as long as i've monitered the CPU, i've never seen it go below
 40 degrees celsius. When i was updating windows (and doing nothing else) the temperature was 60-70 degrees. The fan is on the back of the laptop, blowing in to the hinge (isn't this like really, really stupid design?), which seems like something that would
 decrease cooling.</p>
<p>So i'm wondering if there's anything wrong with the laptop? Should i send it in for reperations? Will this heat have any effects on the durability of the laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the power plan keeps changing (i'm keeping it at low consumption to decrease heat, but it just jumps up to high performance) without my consent. That is pretty weird</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>- Jeppe</p>

</span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Please follow the steps to run the system maintenance troubleshooter:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a) Press<strong> Windows

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 2: </strong>
</span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Let’s change the power plan settings to use minimum processor state to prevent overheating.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Reducing the maximum processor state for your laptop (both when it is on battery or when the power cable is plugged in), reduces the processor’s performance a notch (depending on your settings) and
 prevents it from being used at optimum potential by an application or game, which will reduce thermal heating. For example, if you are playing a game that is consuming 100% of your processor’s capacity, then it may also result in heating up your system, whereas
 reducing the battery power state to, say 80%, can resolve this problem, and also result in battery power conservation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the steps to do so:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a) Press <strong>Windows and X</strong> key together and select
<strong>Power options</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b) Click on <strong>
Change plan settings</strong> for the power plan that you have set on the laptop.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>c) Go to <strong>Processor power management</strong>. Expand the icon and expand
<strong>maximum processor state.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>d) Reduce the processor state (for both
<strong>Plugged-in</strong> as well as <strong>On battery</strong>) to a certain level to verify if it makes any difference.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>e) Click on<strong> Apply</strong> and then
<strong>OK.</strong></span></span></span></p>

            <p>Laptops can become significantly hotter when running certain applications. For example, my own machine gets pretty hot running Skype even if I'm not actually communicating through it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But just typing messages on this forum using Firefox and it's as cool as a cucumber.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As regards the power plan, I use the default "Balanced" plan which is sufficient for my own needs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from the performance page of this review of your machine, the processor is a higher end type which can run a lot hotter than other types so there's no need to be concerned:
