<h2>            Local security Policy to restrict clearing Cache Windows 7 IE11</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple workgroup computer that uses a token to manage users work time. It's a clock that they use to clock in and out at the start of work and end of work day. The problem is the local users can clear the cache and this removes the token thereby
 rendering the URL useless. Can anyone give me a step by step instruction to restrict clearing the cache in Windows 7 for standard users. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Nokia 6300 Poor Signal Strength - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 6300 Poor Signal Strength</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have just bought a new black Nokia 6300 and most of the time I'm failing to get a signal or sometimes just 1 signal bar.<br />
<br />
If I put my chip back into my old Motorola I get 2 or more signal bars.<br />
<br />
Is this a problem with the Nokia 6300? Do I need to change a setting on the phone to increase the signal?<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jas

            Phone designers have to find a delicate balance between phone reception and radiation (SAR levels) when designing handsets.<br />
<br />
There is also the frequency. The 6300 being a tri-band phone connects on multiple frequencies. The lower frequencies have better penetration. It is possible that your older phones are connecting on the lower 900mhz frequency while your 6300 is connecting on
 the newer 1800mhz frequency.<br />
<br />
Either way, it is no good to you if you can't use your phone in your house. There is no way of boosting the signal on your phone. Only thing you can do is try another phone.

    <title>IE11 intermittently not loading pages for one website - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elonka dunin  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 intermittently not loading pages for one website</h2>
                    Hi, I'm asking this question as a site administrator: &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Many (but not all) of our users are reporting that they are getting a blank page when using IE11 to access one of our websites. Sometimes they don't even get a blank
 page, the browser just stays on the last page visited. These users can access other domains (such as google.com) without a problem. The problems are always related to IE11 while it is in protected mode. &nbsp;If the users use Firefox or Chrome, the site works fine.
 &nbsp;But we also have many other users who are using IE11 in Protected mode, and our site works fine for them, no problem!</span>
<div><font color="#000000"><span><br />
</span></font>
<p>For those IE11 users whose browsers are failing, if those users disable Protected Mode in IE, then they can again access our site, but this isn't a good solution because we have thousands of users and we can't go telling each of them to reconfigure their
 browsers, not to mention that we're completely losing the business of those potential customers who just surf by, see a blank page, and then keep on going without filing an error report.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We are running the site (play.net) off of IIS7. Other sites such as dragonsofelanthia.com which are run off the same server work fine, no problems, it's just the one particular site that is having the problem, and it's intermittent, affecting some computers
 and not others. One thing that's consistent though is that those computers that are failing, stay in a failing state, they don't swap back and forth from failing to fixed. Ditto with the "working" computers, if they're working, they stay working, they don't
 suddenly start failing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There must be something I can do on my side in the server or network settings to keep this problem from happening, but I'm baffled as to what it might be. When I look at the network traffic on a browser that's failing, the GET request is just being aborted
 with no explanation. When looking at the traffic with Wireshark, I see no errors, and no errors are showing up in the IIS logs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also perplexing: We can reproduce the problem on our development server, with the same pattern of which computers "work" and which don't. We tried turning off the webserver, and the problem stayed consistent, we'd still get a blank page error! This tells
 us that the problem isn't being caused by something in our page content, there's something else very bizarre going on. For a benchmark, I've run tests on 9 computers on our office network: 5 worked, 4 failed. We're all baffled. :/</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            Hi Ramesh, thanks for the reply.
<div><br />
<div>For your first question: The computers are on multiple networks, both in and outside of our office. We're also getting a steady series of complaints from customers all over the world, to which our only reply right now is, "Don't use Internet Explorer,
 try Firefox or Chrome instead." &nbsp;:/ &nbsp;But we'd really like to be able to actually fix the problem on our server side so that IE11 will work with it. We just don't know what to fix!</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for technet, yes, I've posted on the technet forum weeks ago:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/en-US/67d0cec1-91a4-44a1-b41e-25731505bee1/bug-ie11-windows-81-enhanced-protected-mode-prevents-pages-from-loading-slow-browsing-experiece?forum=ieitprocurrentver#1ea35a30-35c7-4ac1-9959-66a299570134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/en-US/67d0cec1-91a4-44a1-b41e-25731505bee1/bug-ie11-windows-81-enhanced-protected-mode-prevents-pages-from-loading-slow-browsing-experiece?forum=ieitprocurrentver#1ea35a30-35c7-4ac1-9959-66a299570134</a></div>

<div><br />
<div>However, we haven't gotten any useful replies, and the problem is still occurring. &nbsp;Any suggestions on what to do next, to try and figure out a fix?</div>

<p>I disabled all the COM add-ins, it works for only one time after a reboot. When you then close Excel, reopen and try again the same double screen issue appears.</p>
<p>One thing I found was that if the Excel window is NOT maximized, you can move it between monitors easily without any issues, but if you Maximize the window, the problem is there again??</p>

<p>Ok i've been having this problem for a while. Repaired office a couple times and no luck. But in a couple quick tests it seems to be limited to this 1 file that i have in my ODFB sharepoint sync'd library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i drag a copy of it back to my machine, i can open/display with no issues. but if i work with the file from the sync'd library...it's doing that ghost template thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh wait, i just opened a CSV locally and it had the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck.</p>

 be probably around 30 records for each of the four rotations. Our production Manager would use the form to input all the tasks into the table. Then, the engineers, as they completed tasks are to update those tasks by marking them complete and inputting information
 about potential faults etc etc. So I was thinking I would have a Table kind of like this:</p>

            <p>You should have multiple tables. The first table I would create would be for tasks, one record per task with the TaskID, Task, and possibly other fields related only to the task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another table would have one record per employee and store an EmployeeID, title or position, first name, last name, and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A third table would store the schedule with fields:</p>
<p>

<p>TaskID &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;link to tblTasks.TaskID</p>
<p>EmployeeID &nbsp;who performed or is scheduled to perform task</p>
<p>Rotation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm not sure what this would be but suggests there might be a table of rotations</p>
<p>ScheduleDate &nbsp; when is this scheduled (might also need an Actual date)</p>
<p>Status &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would allow for more than just yes/no completed. Maybe delayed or deleted</p>
<p>Results &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm not sure if you will have more than one fault. If this is the case you should create a separate</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; faults/results table related by ScheduleID</p>

            <p>Hi Duane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to answer my question. I really appreciate the help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds perfect for me. Would there be a way that I could display the actual task from the first table in the third table that you've laid out for me? I know you're not meant to have duplicate records but the man who asked me to create this would like
 it there for easy reference. Would there be a way to link in the TaskID so that would autofill? You see the users of this database aren't versed at all in Access and want some way of storing the completed tasks information (that third table) probably by exporting
 to Excell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I considered a Lookup field but the original field for the task would be Long Text as it's usually something like "Grease Cuber Machine Columns" and Access doesn't seem to want to play ball with Long Text fields where LOOKUP is concerned.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Use of lookup fields on the table level is not recommended ( see&nbsp;<a href="http://access.mvps.org/Access/lookupfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Evils of Lookup fields</a>). Lookups should be done on the form level using list controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you note, redundant data is not good design. Your client should NOT be dictating table design. That's your job. he shouldn't even be seeing the table design. He can dictate interface design and your job becomes to fit his interface desires into a properly
 normalized table design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See my blog on Displaying Data from Related Tables to see how to display the information he wants to see on his forms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task names may be long, but there should be an autonumber ID field for the tasks and that should be used as the foreign key so you don't repeat the long names in other tables.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Good Morning Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had actually come across your blog while I was doing my due-diligence. &nbsp;I have a question or two about the subform wizard. I've been trying to do it this morning but I can only find the Form Wizard and while that does allow subforms it's making the Schedule
 Table (Table 3) the subform and the Task Table (Table 1) the main form. Does that matter? Also will the engineers be able to change records in the both tables if they're displayed on the form? I'd really rather they couldn't do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, thank you for responding!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Nevermind! I figured it out. Thank you so much. This is exactly what I was looking for!</p>
        </p>

            The subform wizard is on the Controls toolbar when in Design mode. Generally I create my subforms as tabular forms using the Form Wizard, then embed the existing form onto my main form.

            <p>I had this problem myself and read a few threads recommending deleting and recreating Outlook profiles. That seemed a bit extreme to me especially as I've only recently re-installed and set up my Office 365 installation again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did to fix this was right click on my email account and select IMAP folders and click the Query button. I then chose to unsubscribe from the re-appearing folder names and clicked OK. Once I had done this I manually deleted the folders as I had done
 before but this time they did not re-appear. I restarted Outlook (don't know if this was necessary) checked the subscribed folder list again in IMAP folders and the ones I had deleted were no longer listed there.

<h3> stevefalatko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Connect to the Server</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with one of my family’s email accounts on outlook.com. My setup – I have a custom domain that I’ve used for some time and have four accounts (one for each family member). I apologize for the somewhat long post but have tried a lot of different
 configurations and am completely stumped.</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the accounts can no longer be accessed from native clients on iOS or Mac OSX (this one isn’t used on a Windows PC).&nbsp; The error is always “unable to contact the server”.&nbsp; This started becoming a problem about two days ago.</li><li>We connect to all of these accounts from iPhones, Macs, and PCs via native clients and web browsers.</li><li>This one account is the only one that has moved to the new Office365 infrastructure – at least it is the only one that has the new Office365 web interface when logging in at mail.live.com.</li><li>This problem account can be accessed via web browser (at mail.live.com) on iOS and Mac OSX.</li><li>I have tried to delete and setup this account as a Outlook.com account and a generic IMAP account on iOS and both fail to connect to the server.</li><li>I have tried both imap-mail.outlook.com and imap-mail.live.com as the server address and both fail. (imap-mail.outlook.com works for all other accounts and imap-mail.live.com is what I see in the settings s
 the web).</li><li>When I am going through the setup process for the problem account as an outlook.com account on iOS after I enter the account details the account is "verified" and all entries are checked off - the account is confirmed. &nbsp;Shortly there after I get an error
 and no email is received.</li><li>I have tried to setup the problem account as an exchange account using s.outlook.com and it gets the same “unable to contact the server error”.</li><li>I can add any of the other accounts to the problem account family member's iOS device but cannot add the problem account to any other device.</li><li>If I use the outlook iOS app the problem account works fine.</li></ol>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It took a few moments to figure out how to setup an alias but the process is fairly simple.&nbsp; First login to the problem email account via a web browser.&nbsp; Once logged in click on the “avatar” in the upper right corner – you will get a drop down menu – and
 select “View account” which will open a new browser tab for the associated Microsoft account.&nbsp; From the menu bar select “Your info”.&nbsp; On the next screen select “Manage your sign-in email or phone number”.&nbsp; At the next screen (at least for me) I get a Microsoft
 Account confirmation screen from which you can send a code to verify your account to an email address or phone number.&nbsp; Enter the code on the next screen – you will get another screen asking if you want to setup a code generator app on your phone – you can
 select “Later” for now.&nbsp; The next screen will be for managing your account aliases.&nbsp; Select “Add email”.&nbsp; At the next screen you have two choices – “Create a new email address and add it as an alias” or “Add an existing email address as a Microsoft account
 alias”.&nbsp; I selected the first option which guides you in creating an email address with an @outlook.com domain.&nbsp; This address will only be used to login to your existing outlook.com account using your existing password.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how I add an @outlook com alias.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First login to the problem email account via a web browser.</p>
<p>Click the Cog icon.</p>
<p>Click Options.</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;Create an Outlook.com alias.</p>
<p>...Microsoft Account confirmation screen from which you can send a code to verify your account to an email address or phone number.</p>
<p>Enter the received code.</p>
<p>Using this route, you will only be able to create an @outlook.com alias address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: after being switched to Outlook Mail (Preview), use the alias address to setup an IMAP account in email programs.&nbsp; The automatic setup will use the outlook.com servers which no longer work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited note: after being switched to Outlook Mail (Preview), use the alias address instead of the custom domain address to setup the account in a device or app.&nbsp; Also use the alias address&nbsp;as the&nbsp;login address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note 2: it may take 48-72 hours for the alias address to become fully active.</p>

    <title>Start Menu App &#38; Layout sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordontwatts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Menu App &#38; Layout sync</h2>
                    <p>As has been mentioned, the sync of the layout and apps installed is not in Windows RTM. Since I've been forced to blow away my user account and re-create it multiple times due to a mail bug, I've really felt the lack of this feature. I have no idea where
 this is on the feature priority list, but, I'd like it to be higher. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>As long as a recommended debugging step is "delete your user account from another account, and then re-create it", there needs to be some feature that gets the account back as close as possible. A lot of&nbsp;care can go into laying out the start menu, especially
 on tablets. My start menu on my tablet now just is the default, with a few extra things, which is sad. But I have to blow it away too often to invest any real time in personalizing it.</li><li>It is often much easier to find websites, etc., that require real searching on a large machine with full keyboard. Some of these I want to keep around so I pin them to the start menu. I then have to repeat the search process on the smaller tablet since
 the start menu no longer sync's.</li><li>Installing an app on one machine pulls it to the other - was a feature I really liked. I understand the reasons not to do it, but perhaps that is a problem to be solved, not a reason to totally removed the feature (OneDrive place holders, cough! cough!).</li></ul>
<p>I'm sure there are other reasons. I'm pretty comfortable with computers. If I wanted to design this feature I'd put in plenty of flexibility. Perhaps too much to make it simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sync is by groups on the start menu. So I can create a "Physics" group and have it walk across all my devices. However the "Working now" group would not. I could change the configuration at any time. When I consider being able to do this across to the phone
 as well, my mouth really starts watering. :-)</li><li>Layout would be archived by machine. When I logged in the first time (or perhaps anytime) I could reset my layout to match another machine that was stored on OneDrive. So if I had to blow away the account on "MyTablet", when I logged back in I could tell
 it to pick that layout up again. Or perhaps since the machine name is the same, it would. Also, you could have "Factory Default" as a layout option.</li><li>Get to the point where when I hit "reset my pc" and log back in with the same user account I was using, I can get back to a working environment very quickly. W8 was fantastic for that. "Reset my pc" became something I did "often" when a particularly pernicious
 problem showed up. After about an hour or two, with a good internet connection, I was basically back to where I was on my small tablets (that didn't have much in the way of windows programs installed). Given that one can now sandbox Win10 apps in the store,
 perhaps we can get even closer to complete wipe and restore with minimal fuss. As things stand now, since I loose real data and work when I reset even a tablet, I'm either not going to take advantage of that personalization or I'm going to be very reluctant
 to use refresh, which is a great debugging tool.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; Cheers,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gordon.</p>

            This can get complicated really quickly...but Outlook for Windows uses something called
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/exchangefaqs/archive/2008/01/14/mapi-faqs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MAPI </a>to connect to Exchange. MAPI provides full Exchange features and is commonly how Exchange users access their mail.
<div><br />
<div>This differs from Outlook for Mac which uses <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/exchangefaqs/archive/2008/01/23/exchange-web-service-ews.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EWS </a>to connect to Exchange. EWS provides many Exchange features and is better suited for multi-platform clients.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for your issue, you'll want to contact whoever manages your Exchange server for help on this one. While I don't know exactly what needs to be changed on the server, I can say confidently that there is no setting in Outlook for Mac concerning maximum
 attachment size.</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t get Insider Builds &#40;stuck on build 10240&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edufsribeiro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get Insider Builds &#40;stuck on build 10240&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm a Insider member since Oct 2014, get all the builds till the official launch of Windows 10 last July.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A few days before the official launch my Windows 10 TP (build 10240) had a boot problem and gave me a UEFI boot error, since the Insider Program was locked and I can't get any Insider Preview build to work I had format my PC and install my Windows 8 Pro and
 follow the upgrade path to Windows 10. (Reserve a copy, wait for the update and install the Windows 10 (Pro) and activate with my valid Windows 8 Key, no hassles there.<br />
<br />
After success upgrade I went to <strong>Security and Updates</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> and hit the <span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">
&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Get Insider builds</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Get
 Started</span> button, <strong>restart </strong>my PC and check if <strong>Fast Ring</strong> was selected and<strong> it was</strong>. Last month it came out Build 10525 and later on Build 10532 and I didn't receive any of those.<br />
<br />
I tried to force the download by hitting constantly the Check update button on Windows Update, but the only thing my Windows Update download is Windows Defender definitions. So, I tried the following: in Advanced Option, I hit the
<strong>Stop receive preview builds</strong>, restart PC and go there again I hit the button Get Preview Builds, restart again and wait a few days... no luck.<br />
<br />
Since I don't had any luck there I post some questions here (in the Brazilian Forum - which apparently is the one for portuguese language markets) and report the problem, a few days later receive some answers, but none of the those answers worked out and one
 of them seems to me a bit stupid, so the answers:<br />
<br />
First Answer ( a few steps):<br />
<br />
1 - &nbsp;<span>Uninstall any anti-virus. </span><strong><span>(don't have any, so it really doesn't apply to me);<br />
</span></strong><span>2 - &nbsp;Safe Boot with Network <strong>(did that, produce no effect what so ever);</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3 - &nbsp;Selective Startup with all services stopped except Microsoft services
<strong>(same as above, produced no effect, still didn't get any update via Windows Update)</strong>;<br />
4 - &nbsp;Create a new Administrator account and run the Windows Update from the new account
<strong>(although might work I found this solution a bit awkward, I mean, I have to create a new account with Administrator privileges and then subscribe to Insider Preview Program with that account and then make all the process, I did it, no effects also,
 bit I thought that was the dumbest solution ever... )</strong>;&nbsp;<br />
5 - &nbsp;Drivers update - <strong>(All my drivers are up to date, some from the manufactures, others from Microsoft, no hardware problems, so can't anything about that)</strong>;<br />
6 - &nbsp;Reset IP Address - <strong>(Did that, nothing happened)</strong>;</span></p>
<p><span>7 - &nbsp;Windows Update as Trusted Sites&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>(Did that, nothing happened)</strong>;<br />
<span>8 - &nbsp;Change DNS to&nbsp;</span><span>4.2.2.2 and&nbsp;</span><span>4.2.2.4</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>(Did that, nothing happened)</strong>;<br />
<span>8 - &nbsp;Change DNS to&nbsp;</span><span>4.2.2.2 and&nbsp;</span><span>4.2.2.4</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>(Did that, nothing happened)</strong>;<br />
<br />
<span>So in total&nbsp;</span>despair I contact Microsoft Answer Desk by Phone, and after a few minutes trying to explain what is my problem (I'm a portuguese from Portugal and ours Answer Desk is provided by Brazilians which don't quietly understand us - Brazilian
<span>So in total&nbsp;</span>despair I contact Microsoft Answer Desk by Phone, and after a few minutes trying to explain what is my problem (I'm a portuguese from Portugal and ours Answer Desk is provided by Brazilians which don't quietly understand us - Brazilian
 Portuguese &nbsp;is quite different from European Portuguese) the woman gave me this solution:<br />
<br />
<span>Re-install my Windows 8 Pro and from there wait that Windows Update give me the Insider Preview update, and if Windows Update tries to install regular Windows 10 upgrade, she said to stop the upgrade and differ that update and wait for the Insider Update...<br />

<br />
I didn't make this yet because</span>&nbsp;I'm hard to believe that will work. I mean, in Windows 8 I will get the Windows 10 Insider Preview as an update? Last I checked I had to install Windows 10 TP with an ISO and boot from that ISO to get started and the new
 Insider Preview program state that I only have to set Windows Update to Get the Preview Builds (which I did) from a Windows 10 activated install (which I have).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By the way, my Windows 10 is set to USA as location and has the display language set to US English, I had also set a Portuguese keyboard setup, set my region to Portugal and Proofing tools are setup to US English and Portuguese (Portugal). I'm stating this
 since if my display language is not supported by Insider Preview I don't receive any builds (Portuguese currently not supported).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So please help me understand why I'm not getting the Insider builds and I'm still stuck in build 10240...</span></p>

<p>Is this a PC made by a major PC manufacturer? Did it come with other security software -- Norton, McAfee, etc. as a trial? Is that trial software still installed, even if "disabled" and not used? If so, it must be removed using the removal tool that the
 software vendor typically makes available: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/2bcb53f7-7ab4-4ef9-ab3a-6aebfa322f75">

<h3> seonjong.kim  say:</h3>
<h2>            I CANNOT rollback to windows 8.1 from Windows 10 TP Build 10041</h2>
                    <p>I've installed Windows 10 TP build 10041 when it was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10041 was my first installation of windows 10, so there's any other builds in my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't clean install, I started the windows10insider.exe program to activate windows 10 insider preview update on Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took 1 hour to download the update, And it took about 6 hours to update and apply Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I Keep Windows.old folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is HP Envy 15-j104ax with AMD A10-5750M 2.5GHz Quad-Core procceor, and 8G Memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, Windows 10 is too slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be compatibility issue with AMD processors, but whatever, it freezes frequently, and it take about 15 mins to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decide to rollback into win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win10's Settings-Recovery-Rollback to previous version of windows, I clicked it, but it says 'File to recover to previous windows is missing. It can't be recovered'. (I translated it from Korean, so it might be uncertain.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I tried to reboot and tried to boot into windows rollback, but it was failed, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no OS select screen while I boot my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even I set Windows rollback OS to default OS in msconfig, but when I reboot, It says "This computer should be repaired. If you have recover image, try to use it or contact to system administrator or manufacturer." and I cannot recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to find Windows.old Folder, and it exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In C:/Windows.old has 1 folder, 'Windows' Folder, and in 'windows' Folder, there's many files such as regedit, many folders..</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But, I CANNOT ROLL BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot use Windows 10 anymore, because it's too slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an genuine Windows 8.1 Embedded Industry pro Image, but i don't want to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to rollback to windows 8.1 keeping all programs, files, musics, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let me know how to solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>There's your problem. that's not how you install it. You should have downloaded the ISO and installed from a DVD or USB drive. Also you should have installed it on a separate partition and you would have avoided this issue altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can possibly try downloading build 10130 ISO then select Repair Computer instead of install.</p>

<h2>            Onedrive for Business - synchronization of shared folders and documents</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>we have an OneDrive for Business and Office 365 work accounts. The online interface does not offer the option "add to my OneDrive" for sharing files as it is on a personal OneDrive. Therefore we cannot synchronize shared files and folders on PC via a new
 client for Business. Please give me a qualified answer, how do you synchronize&nbsp;<strong>large&nbsp;</strong>shared folders.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi MichalFranc. At present the new OneDrive for Business sync tool (onedrive.exe) can only sync your own OneDrive for Business. It cannot sync another user's OneDrive for Business, nor team site libraries nor shared folders. This is confirmed here:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125202</a></p>
<p>However the support will be coming in the sync tool later Microsoft have stated.</p>
<p>To sync shared folders today you can try using the old sync tool (groove.exe). This can sync another user's OneDrive for Business and it can also sync team site document libraries.</p>
<p>If you have a large number of files that you need to share then you could put those files in a team site document library then have everyone that needs them use the old sync client (groove.exe) to sync the shared files. There is a limitation of 5,000 items
 that the old sync client can sync from a team site document library.</p>

    <title>Figure captioning not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pat_06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Figure captioning not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I am using insert captions to label my figures and tables. I have had no problems with using it until now.</p>
<p>When I go to insert a figure, the preview (in the insert caption window) says "Figure 3-1", which is correct. But when I hit OK, the caption which actually appears says Figure 0-1. The Chapter number is based on the Heading 1 style and I have this selected
 in the caption numbering section. I've included a screenshot of the issue below (I have removed the figure and additional text to make it easier to see).</p>
<p>Thank you for any help you can provide.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can use a pivot table to aggregate the data by date. Click a cell in the data, then go Insert &gt; Pivot Table. In the pivot panel on the right, drag the date field name into the row area and drag the values field name into the value area. Now you see a
 pivot table with each date only one. You may need to adjust the values formula to sum instead of count (click the drop-down arrow of the value field name in the values panel and select "Value Field Settings")</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can now use this table to create an XY Scatter plot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use a Pivot Chart to chart the data. Pivot charts don't support XY Scatter plots, but a line chart with markers and no line, using a date axis, will do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative to a pivot table, you can create a helper table that has all the individual dates in the first column. In the second column you can use a Sumif() function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With your original data in columns A (date) and B (Value) and a helper table in columns D (dates) and E (Sumif() function for values), put the individual, unique dates in column D, and in E2 put this formula and copy down</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIF(A:A,D2,B:B)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then build an XY Scatter chart from that helper table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pivot table is ultimately less work, since it can be configured to update automatically if new data is added to the source table. With the helper table, new dates need to be added manually and the formula copied down.&nbsp;</p>

 as though the update created another user account c:\user\name.name, with none of my files. &nbsp;I cannot access my ms office, word, excell, outlook, documents, dowloand, etc. &nbsp;They are all empty, but I can see them in at the original account. &nbsp;A<span>ny
 help to resolve this issue will be greatly appreciated, contacted Microsoft about the issue, there response was we don't provide support for the Insider builds. &nbsp;So I guess my only hope is the communite.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance for the help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards</span></p>

<p>I have not experienced beforehand that Windows installation using Windows Update created another user account even without asking and logged into that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see if your previous user account is available, please do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open <strong>System Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Settings</strong> in <strong>User Profiles</strong> section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Post a screenshot of the page. Do you see your previous user name here ? &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hope this helps, I think it putting me into the default profile instead of logging me into the actual account.&nbsp; MS had me try to do a system restore, but it told me I need to delete an account, however when I go into user for settings there is only one account
 there.&nbsp; Please keep in mind&nbsp; I'm a newbie, and any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; It took a little to get the pic posted.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Power and logarithmic trendlines not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I was working on a report and while doing a trendline i realized my logarithmic and power functions arent plotting correctly (more specifically they look like they are not being multiplied by negative 1)&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>First, I see no reason to move this discussion to another forum.&nbsp; We deal with such questions here often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, whoever said "a picture is worth a thousand words" was not talking about helping with Excel problems.&nbsp; The image that you posted is useless to me.&nbsp; Perhaps it is useful to someone with sharper (younger) eyes.&nbsp; But generally, the devil is in the details
 that we can only see by looking at an example Excel file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upload an example Excel file to a file-sharing website, then post the public/share URL here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some wild guesses that might be helpful....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Be sure to use a Scatter chart if you want to use the trendline feature.&nbsp; Although I believe trendlines do work with other chart types, they "work" only if it is sufficient for your purposes to treat the x-axis as 1, 2, 3, etc, not the actual x-axis labels
 or values.&nbsp; See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/211967 (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/211967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If you are using a Scatter chart, what makes you think logarithm and power trendlines do not work?&nbsp; (Sorry:&nbsp; it's probably "obvious" if I could read the image.)&nbsp; If you are trying to use the coefficients displayed in the trendline label to generate the
 estimate y-values based, the problem might be that they are rounded to too-little precision to calculate accurate estimated y's.&nbsp; LINEST might work, if you use it correctly.&nbsp; Alternatively, format the trendline coefficients as Scientific with 14 decimal places
 in order to copy-and-paste them into a worksheet.</p>
