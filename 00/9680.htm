<h2>            Zip Codes missing zero in front digit, Spreadsheet with Power Query Editor</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp; I have a Spreadsheet called "outconxl.xlsx" that I have recently created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I set it up, I made it so that it would get data from a CSV file named outconxl.csv.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that it uses Power Query Editor to accomplish this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the field "Postalcode" the cities that have a zip code that starts with zero is missing that first zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to put that zero back as the first digit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the format of Postalcode to Special: Zip Code.&nbsp; It did not do anything add the zero back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then changed the format to Custom: 00000, and this did not add a zero back to the front either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way that I can get this formatted to display five digits?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have opened the Power Query Editor to see if I should format it there maybe.&nbsp; I could not figure out how that could be done there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANK YOU!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>William</p>

<p>Hi Herbert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the information that you gave me and I was able to figure it after a while.&nbsp; The PadStart was the most helpful part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to point out to you that the formulas in the mediafire.com links that you gave me did not work without some alteration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the link that you provided, I was instructed to use the following in the formula bar:</p>
<p>
</p><p>= Table.AddColumn(Types, "ZipCode", each Text.PadStart([Zip],5,"0"))&nbsp; This did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I through a little trial and error figured out that I had to add a # and also put the previous applied step in quotation marks:</p>
<p>
</p><p>= Table.AddColumn(#"Types", "ZipCode", each Text.PadStart([Zip],5,"0"))&nbsp; This is the one that worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your help!!</p>

    <title>What Antivirus program is running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr tc b  say:</h3>
<h2>            What Antivirus program is running</h2>
                    <p>I have been running Microsoft Windows Defender since it came out.&nbsp; Now it won't start because it says there is another AV program running.&nbsp; I don't recall installing another AV (but then, I don't recall what I had for breakfast either).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I figure what other AV is running without running through the entire list of 2,000 existing AV programs.&nbsp; Is there a simple check or a program I can run or download to figure this out.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10, updates current.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Applescript&#58; how can I change a picture by script</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried for hours today bit still am not able to solve my task: I have a word "letter" template (dotx) with some boxes like one for the address-area, one for the sender-information etc. I also have inserted an example signature picture that is formatted
 to have white as a transparent color and lays over the text. Like a signature that is over the "Kind regards,..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to automate this because I have to define many different templates files for different employees. How can I change the already inserted picture by other signature files?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if not possible: how to insert the signature picture at a certain place and make it "laying over the text"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Martin </p>

<li>You have a master template with no pictures</li><li>You place the cursor at a certain position in your document</li><li>You type a special sequence for sender John and you get all of John's pictures in position</li></ul>
<p>That can be done as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the pictures corresponding to a single person in the blank master</li><li>The pictures need to be floating (except if you only use one)</li><li>Place the cursor at what will be your reference spot (all pictures will be placed relative to this position and they all need to be on the same page)</li><li>Select the pictures (<em>Command Click</em> for multiple instances)</li><li>Go to <em>Word &gt; Preferences &gt; AutoCorrect</em></li><li>Select the <em>AutoCorrect</em> tab at the top</li><li>Place a checkmark at the top left (next to "Automatically correct…")</li><li>In the "Replace" field, type a memorable sequence, plus optional framing characters to avert accidental replacements (for instance,<strong> j</strong><strong>ohn\
</strong>or<strong> /smith/</strong>)</li><li>Click on the "Formatted text" button (a picture is the opposite of plain text)</li><li>Click on <em>Add</em></li><li><em>OK</em> your way out</li></ol>
<p>To test, open a no-pictures document, place the cursor at the reference spot and type the sender's sequence.</p>

<h2>            Word for Mac 2016&#58; pressing Undo button only deletes one character at a time</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to undo an action, such as text typed, only one character at a time is deleted, instead of the entire word like it has done in the past.&nbsp; It is very frustrating.&nbsp; I know this been brought up by others who use Word on PCs and I tried the suggestions
 like undoing overtype mode but nothing has changed.&nbsp; I am wondering if anyone else who uses Word for Mac 2016 has a solution.</p>
<p>

            Hello, CurtisBurnett1
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Some versions of Office don't have an associated Microsoft account, or work or school account, or you may need to redeem your product key in a different way. For Office Professional Plus 2019 the steps to install Office depend if you got Office through the following:
<br />
<br />Microsoft HUP: You bought Office for personal use through your company and have a product key, see Install Office through HUP.
<br />Volume license versions: IT departments might use a different method to install Office for their organization. Talk to your IT department for install help.

<p>
</p><p>I created communication SharePoint website using office 365 SharePoint.. in the homepage I added multiple webparts.

<p>One of the webparts is 'News' webpart. What I want is: giving permission to user to add news in the news webpart ONLY.. I don't want him to access</p>
<p>and edit the homepage or other parts..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any idea how can I do it??</p>

<p>Hi Munerah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As there’s no specific permission settings for only the News web part, it’s not possible to only grant permission to add News but block other web parts on the same page. In the meantime, as the News web part is added on the page, the user can’t add News
 if he is blocked to access the page. Based on this scenario, I suggest you create a new page for the News web part, then grant edit permission to only this page for the user as a workaround.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not on a Mac but headers and footers work the same in Windows although the controls may be in different places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next page break is a <em>section </em>break, not a page break although it creates a new page.&nbsp;
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>Every section in Word has three headers and three footers whether you see them or not. The link to previous button relates to a particular kind of header (header/first-page header/even-page header) in the previous section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#Recap_of_Header/Footer_settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Header/Footer Settings Recap</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you want different headers? You may be able to accomplish what you want using the existing headers/footers without a new section. This is especially true if you use a
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/fields.htm#STYLEREF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">StyleRef Field</a> in your header.</p>

            Thanks for the quick response. The reason I need different headers is that Im trying to create a letterhead and on the first page has the logo and on all the rest of the pages will have a different graphic on it. I had this working but I need to change
 the header after the first page so the text starts higher on the page beach on the first page the logo is on the top and centre of the page. Hope this makes sense I don't use word much so this is pretty much all new to me.

<p>You definitely do not need or want a section break for this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Set the header size to work for your continuation pages. If your first-page header content takes more room, it will just use it. Your body text will not write over the top.</p>

<p>Thanks, I sort of have it working but not working. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok for the parts that is working - I have a header on that first page that is different on all the other pages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can't seem to figure out how to make the text on the second page and all the following pages start on a different point in on the page - need this because on the first page has a logo at the top and the rest of the pages so the client wants the text
 to start closer to the top of the page. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if it matters but my header is just an imported image not text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also for some reason my first page text is in 2 columns but when it goes to the second page it's in one column.</p>

<p>I believe you want to move your header area up to about 1" from the top of the page. Your first-page header will still fit. The following is my letterhead, the space is set for the continuation page. The first page is inserted into that space and expands
 the reserved space to fit.</p>

<p>Thanks, I have read the links, I just find it hard to follow since I don't use Word at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to explain how I made my file - my header is just actually just a watermark (this is so it matches their printed letterhead exactly). With this being said is it possible just to be able to adjust the headers the way I need them to look?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            See Sharepoint list items when bar code is Scanned</h2>
                    <p>I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>I have a SharePoint list created which shows the bar code from activating the Information Policies.</p>
<p>I want to be able to scan the bar code and see the list items because these are labels that will be printed.</p>
<p>When I scan the bar code now from any android app, it only give me the bar code number. &nbsp;How do I get it to give me the list items, just as if I scanned a book at the store with a bar code.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Juanita,</p>
<p>Please note that SharePoint barcode is slightly different with a barcode on a book. A book barcode is published on the internet with the information of the book. However, a SharePoint barcode is published within SharePoint, it is used as search criteria
 in SharePoint (See <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc263465(v=office.12).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Configure barcodes</a>). By default, information stored in SharePoint cannot be access outside your organization. That means, information stored in the SharePoint barcode can only access in SharePoint. In another word, if we want to locate the item on a site,
 we need manually input the barcode number into a search box in SharePoint.</p>
<p>In short, it’s not feasible to scan a barcode to get the list items. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>If anything is misunderstood, please correct me.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Fraser</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To identify if the issue you are experiencing is totally the same as described in that thread, I’d like to confirm the following before we proceed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is the email sent with an attachment? If so, let the sender send a test message with no attachment, does the issue persist?</span></li><li><span>Does the issue happen to the email sent from a specific user or all the Office 365 users?</span></li><li><span>How do you view the encrypted email? We’ll appreciate it if you can share some screenshots when you are trying to view the email and the error you have encountered. Note: there are two ways to view the encrypted message, sign
 in with a Microsoft account, work or school account, or use a one-time passcode. Which way do you choose to view the encrypted email?
</span></li><li><span>It will be good if you can involve the Office 365 administrator from the sender side here, and let him provider the details steps of how they configured Office 365 encrypted email, we’ll do some tests exactly as what they
 performed to see if we can find any clues to the issue.</span></li><li><span>To check If it is a firewall issue in your organization, please forward the original email to your home address or another place to test.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Thanks, Joe. I had tried this, but it didn't solve the problem. What did work was rebooting my Comcast wireless gateway. Apparently, when updates were loaded on the phone, it lost sync with the wireless gateway. Rebooting the gateway and phone solved the
 problem. Thanks for your response, though.

            Hi Melanie_D,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes that seems like it should be the situation but the recipient did not receive the email. How do you find out if the email address exists on a domain? I know the domain exists.</div>
<div>Is there any other situation that can occur at the recipients domain that would mean the email wouldn't generate a notification failure? For example not being configured to react specifically for the new outlook.</div>
<div>I only say this as I did a test from a non microsoft email to the same address which generated a message send failure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also did a test from my Outlook account&nbsp;by sending a non email address to the gmail domain, This generated a message send failure.</div>
<div>I have also sent a test wrong addressed email to another small company domain. They actually replied saying that I had the wrong address.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also sent a test message from my other Outlook account to the original address that didn't generate a faliure response and again no postmaster message failure notification.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why does this seem to be a selective process?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Is it my Outlook settings or the domain settings?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I need to understand where the problem lies and how the technology works in message failure notification systems please.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for you consideration</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you're not receiving bounce emails when you send to an invalid email address. I also understand that this must be important to you. Don't worry, let us help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As what Melanie_D. has mentioned, it could be that the email account you have sent the email to does exist which is why you did not receive any bounce emails. If the recipient is not receiving your emails, kindly ask the recipient to check his settings to
 receive your emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have additional questions.</p>

            Hi Denise,
<div><br />
<div>I have asked the recipient and they have said that no email was received, as I said in the first line of my previous post. The email address I was given to send the email to was different from their actual email address but the domain was correct, however
 I did not get a postmaster message send failure notification. When I have sent an email to the same address from a non Microsoft email account I have indeed received the&nbsp;message send failure notification. It seems strange to me that my outlook account is not
 sending me this message. Unless you can offer another explanation I have to conclude that it is a problem with outlook. Can you tell me why this may be happening? Or can someone who has technical knowledge of how these systems work give me some answers?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for helping me out here</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me try to figure out your issue. I would like to inform you that aside from sending to an
<em>"invalid email address"</em>, there are other reasons why a sender receives a failure notification. To have a better understanding about&nbsp;bounce messages, please read this article below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail-email/how-do-i-interpret-the-delivery-failure-message/2f1bf9c0-8b03-4f8f-aacc-5f6ba60a73f3"><b><span><font color="#0000ff">How do I interpret the delivery failure message
 that I have received?</font></span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, you mentioned that you did a test email where you used your Outlook.com account and other non-Microsoft account and sent an email to the same email account. Microsoft account did not generate a postmaster notification failure but the other non-Microsoft
 account did. To be able to answer your question, we need you to provide us the email address of the person you tried to send an email. Please post it in the private message area I've created for you. This information would help us reproduce the issue on our
 end. </p>

    <title>Microsoft Band 2 Not charging - fault found - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Band 2 Not charging - fault found</h2>
                    <p>Just info for anyone else in same position as myself. I have a Band 2 which wont run off battery and shows 0% when plugged into charge and of course wont run unless plugged into usb now.</p>
<p>Because I have lost the receipt and consider the band 2 a paperweight now, as a electronics engineer, thought I would at least look into why its dead.</p>
<p>I stripped band 2 down and found out exactly why its failed and in my opinion it is a design flaw and will prob effect every single band 2 , whether small ,medium or large at some point.</p>
<p>No wonder when searching, I read of so many having this same problem.</p>
<p>Although speaking to Microsoft support what I mentioned I had found and they assured me that this has been resolved , so maybe it wont effect the newer batches?. Support said still send it in , but I told support guy I was 100% sure it will be classed as
 tampered with and so it wont be replaced, and so no point in me sending it back to be told its not covered, even though its pretty obvious the fault before I took it apart.</p>
<p>So although my Band 2 cant be replaced under warranty, my advice is to anyone else who has either the 0% battery left or intermittently does not show battery % or shuts off and you have to set clock again , better get it back for a replacement before your
 warranty expires and also don't lose the receipt!</p>
<p>Shame as my original band 1 still running with no problems and sadly my band 2 has proved to not be as reliable.</p>
<p>Of course Microsoft support would have definitely exchanged this no problems, if I had receipt and not took it apart and so I am not complaining about that at all.</p>
<p>I am now contemplating whether to try and fix the fault myself, as its a trash can job otherwise.</p>
<p>Still love the hardware and just disappointed in failing so soon....<br />

<p>
</p><p>Poor show MS, read many report of people with the same problem, its obviously a design fault.</p>

            I've had the same issue.&nbsp; I've gone&nbsp;through 4&nbsp;Microfost Band 2's in 18 months and&nbsp;number 4&nbsp;stopped working today same issue on each one.&nbsp; Microsoft has been good about replacing them, but this level of product unreliability is a ridiculous.&nbsp; I like the
 function of the product, but because of these repeat failures I will be&nbsp;purchasing a different&nbsp;fitness tracker not manufactured by Microsoft.

            Hi Johnwildes,<br />
<br />
According to the error, please try the following 2 methods to give it a shot:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to your control panel&gt;manager credential&gt; clear the credential (cache). Then re-start your Team client.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to the System Tray and right-click on the Teams icon<br />
Select Log Out<br />
The app will go through the motions of logging off and restart, then ask for your credentials. Enter your O365 credentials.
<br />
Here I say Office 365 credentials as Microsoft Teams can be signed into with a Microsoft account credentials.
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            <p>dwood90,</p>
<p>Maybe you could adapt this approach (which uses a small sample of rooms and equipment):</p>
<p>On sheets bld 1 and bld 2 I have a table in A1:D6</p>
<p>In A2:A6 is a list of equipment (a, b, c, d, e) - row headers.</p>
<p>In B1:D1 is a list of rooms (rm 1, rm 2, rm 3) - column headers.</p>
<p>In B2:D6 I have entered either y or n to indicate whether the equipment on that row is present in the room on that column.</p>
<p>This table layout is repeated on both bld 1 and bld 2 sheets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then on a 3rd sheet I have column header 'eqp' in A2 with the same list of equipment from the bld sheets following below in A3:A7</p>
<p>In B1 I enter a building number (1 or 2).</p>
<p>In B2 I enter a room number (1, 2 or 3).</p>
<p>In B3:B7 I have a formula to return the relevant y and n for the building &amp; room numbers entered. Formula in B3 is this (and drag-filled down):</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(A3,INDIRECT("'bld " &amp; B$1 &amp; "'!A1:D6"),B$2+1,FALSE)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that's something you may be able to make use of.</p>

            <p>Hi LoyalJoe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able both figure out and fix the issue myself.&nbsp; Contacting Microsoft is a waste of time if you have trimmed audio.&nbsp;&nbsp;My slide shows contained&nbsp;trimmed audio in the presentations.&nbsp; I deleted the audio.&nbsp; Downloaded a free version of "Audacity" and converted
 the audio to the correct format and then trimmed the audio in Audacity.&nbsp; Then I had no issues creating a video from the power point.&nbsp; Remember to put everything in the correct formats.&nbsp; It will work then.&nbsp; Microsoft should fix this issue.&nbsp; It was the same
 with PP 2010.&nbsp; I have no idea why they put features in...like trimming....if it affects other features like creating a video.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to listen to their customers and more and more competitive software is being made to compete.&nbsp; I bought PP 2013 so
 it would be easy to make the video I had in mind.&nbsp; It's a lot of extra work and time to make the videos.&nbsp; There are easier ways with other software.&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp; Let me know what happens with your slideshow.</p>

    <title>Windows Phone is sluggish and a pain to have. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> megaman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone is sluggish and a pain to have.</h2>
                    Okay, I have the Nokia Lumia 810, same rants on my old Nokia Lumia 710.<br />
To think that with the 1.5Ghz Dual-Core S4 processors this thing will be fast to keep up with me but it isn't.<br />
<br />
Problems:<br />
1. When I am calling someone and I want to end the call, it could be a dramatic ending of the call or just a regular hang-up, I pull the phone from my ear to press End Call. The problem is that the UI takes almost forever to show me the options, like 1 - 3
 seconds, it happened on my other Lumia Phone and I would understand because the 710 is 1.4Ghz Single-Core S2, but I upgraded for performance and this is ridiculous. I can't take it on Nokia for this problem.<br />
<br />
2. I go to an application and it can take some time to get to the music area to play my music. (Besides the fact that I have to click through so many things to get to the music: Music application, Music, Genre. Then when I click the Music application, I have
 to click the Now Playing, just to get to my music that is playing, that's too many tasks, make it simple!) Of course I do have an extreme rant on the Windows Phones as it happens on both my 710 an 810, the wallpaper changes when I play music. I don't want
 the phone to make a choice on what background I should have, I want the wallpaper I have set! Also, the 710 does a red wallpaper while the 810 does a gray one, that's horrible.<br />
<br />
3. One time I got a call and I might accidentally press "Leave a Text Message" and the option to accept the call. What happens is that the phone froze, I could still talk but there were 2 buttons and both weren't able to be pressed. I tried holding the power
 button but it didn't give me the option shut the phone down, it simply took it as a press and and turned the LCD off, then pressing again got me to the wallpaper where I just slide up and still with that screen to accept the call. (I forgot the screen, but
 I see it often yet it has never froze, and I am dreaded that I have to pull the battery just to shut down the phone)<br />
<br />
Side rants:<br />
4. There is little-to-no customizations on applications. The Camera app doesn't have doodling stuff, just lame presets that are hardly worth caring for.<br />
5. Nokia put an equalizer but they had to put it aside? It should be within the music application. Also, I can't slide the slider on the music to skip ahead or go back, I have to press the the button and hold? Man, this music application feels like the Stone
 Age.<br />
6. Stop taking forever to give updates, we want enhancements and new features, this is why marketshare is still disappointingly down, I bought the phone due to loyalty to Nokia and how it fared with Symbian, I would have thought that they would enhance Windows
 Phones enough but it feels like a failure.<br />
7. The music application is a joke. Besides my other rant, I am not happy with the volume. First off, I have to have the volume at 27/30 just to enjoy it and that only makes it worse on my experience because it drains battery life like there is no tomorrow.
 My 710 was also doing the same so I began to believe that it was the phone's problem because I dropped it several times, but it happened on this 810 as well and it was brand new. Amplify the volume, 27/30 should be 20/30 or something like that, it's saddening.<br />
<br />
I am anti-Google, so I don't plan to ever get an Android phone, but it is looking more and more attractive for its features as I speak. Paired with Quad and/or Octo-core and its making me feel bad about having a Windows Phone. Please fix these problems, like
 what I said above, since I am not the only one that has these issues.<br />
Is there anything I can do for my problems?<br />

Megaman</a>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your publication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you have some issues with your Windows Phone. I'll try to go through them one by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Unfortunately I can not give a solution for this issue, I need to do some investigation and let you know.<br />
2. Concerning the application <strong>Music+Video</strong>, you have many options on how to play the songs, either by arists, album or you can even shuffle the songs. This can not be considered as a problem because it does not affect the functionality of the
 phone. If you do not want the background image to change when you are playing music you need to go to
<strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>Lock Screen</strong> and select <strong>Off</strong> for the option
<strong>Show artist when playing music</strong>.<br />
3. Please verify that you have activated the <strong>Text reply</strong> in <strong>
Settings</strong>, slide to <strong>Applications</strong> and click on <strong>Phone</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
For all the other issues you can submit suggestions to Microsoft's official suggestions website for the windows phone</p>

            <p>I would imagine that the issue of your first point (proximity sensor) is by design.&nbsp; Some people do not like to hold the phone close to their ear while they are talking, or the distance from the phone to their face may vary.&nbsp; If that's the case and the screen
 appears too soon, there's a good chance that they'll press the "end call" button with their cheek.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, the phone's sensor needs to be sure that it's being held away purposely before the keypad appears.&nbsp; With the sensor operation, things are either near or not-near, there doesn't appear to be a notion of distance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not a question of processor speed, it's a Human Interface Design feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Point number 4.&nbsp; There's plenty of camera interface apps out there (they're called "Lens" apps).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Point number six (lack of updates).&nbsp; Please read</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft are putting their efforts into allowing WP8 to support new hardware (at all levels of performance) in an effort to increase the user base.&nbsp; This most likely isn't what you want to hear, but MS are committed to opening up the range of handsets for
 WP8 (as opposed to about 10 for WP7.x).&nbsp; A major functional update is slated for Q1 2014.&nbsp; Hopefully, as the user base increases, other app creators will push out better apps (Instagram may finally decide to create an app, for example).</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t uncheck &#39;Run this program as an administrator&#39; in Privilege Level to allow standard user to run Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>After enabling Full Control everywhere I can think of in Users for a standard user login and unchecking 'Run this program as an administrator' in the Outlook Properties window for all users, an admin login is still required when logging in as a standard
 user. While logged in as a standard user, when the Outlook Properties window is opened, the Privilege Level is elevated and can't be unchecked even when providing the Administrator password.</p>
<p>What other settings might be required to allow a standard user to run Outlook?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

            <span>Meghmala,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I hope you can help find an answer to this puzzle, because I've spent several frustrating days researching this problem without success.&nbsp; As explained, my goal is to configure Outlook Properties so that a standard user login can run
 Outlook without requiring elevation to administrator permission.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when logged in as an administrator, Outlook Properties &gt; Compatibility &gt; Privilege Level is unchecked in 'Run this program as an administrator' as required.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, when logged in as a standard user, the Privilege Level checkbox for 'Run this program as an administrator' is checked, so running Outlook requires administrator elevation with the admin password.&nbsp; When the 'Change settings for all users' button with
 the administrator shield is clicked, the 'OUTLOOK.EXE Properties' window with the 'Compatibility for all users' tab has no boxes checked, including 'Run this program as an administrator' (?)&nbsp; This means there's no way to delete the apparent requirement for
 admin elevation to run Outlook.<br />
<br />
I've even experimented with checking the Privilege Level setting anyway, clicking 'OK' all the way out, including logging out and logging back in, and then returning to the administrator's Properties window to uncheck the Privilege Level checkbox, but this
 doesn't change the behavior.&nbsp; The end result is still that a standard user login requires admin elevation to run Outlook.<br />
<br />
<br />
The OS is 32-bit Windows 7 Ultimate, and Outlook 2007 (in Office 2007 Professional) is installed locally - no exchange server. ESET Nod32 anti-virus software is installed.<br />
The software is running on a Lenovo 32-bit x86 machine.<br />
<br />
Other things that I have tried without success are:<br />
<br />
- Repair re-install of Windows 7<br />
<br />
- Installed all 'Important' Windows 7 updates through today<br />
<br />
- Tested Outlook Properties window on both taskbar icon and Start menu icon<br />
<br />
- Permissions have been set to Full Control for the standard user at each level in the path:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users\&lt;std login&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\Outlook.pst<br />
&nbsp; including the Outlook.pst file itself.<br />
<br />
- The 'Users' folder default settings are: Read &amp; Execute, List folder contents, Read<br />
&nbsp; (Should permissions on the 'Users' folder be elevated?&nbsp; That would affect all logins.)<br />
<br />
- Disabled Windows firewall<br />
<br />
- Temporarily turned off anti-virus protection<br />
<br />
- I have also temporarily disabled UAC as you suggested, but it did not fix the problem.<br />
&nbsp; I've restored UAC to Level 3 (Default).<br />
<br />
I would be comfortable making any registry changes that you could recommend that would control the standard user Outlook permission, but I haven't yet made any registry changes for this problem because I have no information about what changes would help.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions you may have of setting changes or procedures that I haven't already tried would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Don<br />

It's been a little over a month without any further info on this problem.&nbsp; Will there be a solution provided for this problem, or do I need to submit the problem to a different forum?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            I believe I have a user with the same problem you are describing.&nbsp; Did you ever figure this out?

            Brian,
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, no. &nbsp;The apparent error in UAC control over program execution as standard user still exists. &nbsp;I didn't receive a reply with a solution from Microsoft, and I haven't found a solution from anyone else who has encountered the problem.</div>

            <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just encountered this problem with a pesky program and realize it's been a while but here's my two cents as I found this thread looking to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Action - I downgraded a user from Admin to Standard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptom - in compatibility mode "run as admin" was still checked for the standard user despite me unchecking it as admin via any route I could think of.&nbsp; Standard user could not use programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix - Log in as admin.&nbsp; Fully disable UAC.&nbsp; Reboot.&nbsp; Log in as Standard User.&nbsp; Edit compatibility check box as needed.&nbsp; Log out as standard user.&nbsp; Log in as Admin.&nbsp; Enable UAC again.&nbsp; Reboot.&nbsp; Log in as standard user.&nbsp; Check box should be gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>B</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Updated Lumia 640LTE, all contacts and other data wiped out.  How to run backup&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I updated my Uncle's Lumia 640LTE using the Insider app to Windows 10 preview, which was stable on my same model.&nbsp; After the download and install all data is missing from the phone including his address book.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately it has a backup to OneDrive but nowhere on the phone does it show how to easily run the backup.&nbsp; I can see the Windows Phone Device backup but the only choice it gives me is to delete it.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A MS Support page says that the Contacts which are what he is missing most will sync automatically once signed into OneDrive but they are not.&nbsp; Is this because the backup was made on Windows 8.1 phone and it is now Windows 10?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I ran the MS Phone Recovery tool and it confirms this is the latest software version so it will not roll it back, and i"m not sure it needs to be rolled back because it is stable but just missing its data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! </p>

            <p>The phone should sync to the MS account that is setup in settings, accounts,&nbsp;&nbsp; The account address and account holders name should be on top of&nbsp; that page.</p>
<p>To try to sync the account manually go to the email app, sync is at the bottom of the page. When email sycs&nbsp; contacts, calendar and email all sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the phone restarts following a phone reset or use of the recovery tool is the only opportunity to recover a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are cases when data is lost when the insider preview is used. Like I said, &nbsp;pictures, videos, documents and music is not part of the backup.&nbsp; Contacts come from the account on outlook.com when the phone syncs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not about the different versions of the phone OS.</p>

            <p>You can restore from a backup when the phone restarts following a reset or use of the recovery tool.</p>
<p>You can check the backup is there by using the account on the phone and going to
https://onedrive.live.com, gear icon, options, device backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The restore does the phone settings and start screen, also the installed app list. You have to know the account email address and password.</p>
<p>To use restore you have to use the account security features. A code is sent to the phone number setup in the security section of the&nbsp; account</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not hidden, <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone
</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is not part of backup is pictures, videos, documents and music. Some to this may be on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts, calendar and email are reloaded from the phone account info</p>
