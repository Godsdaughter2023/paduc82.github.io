            How did you copy them, exactly?<br />
<br />
I've used Nokia PC Suite and its backup/restore (Content Copier) to back up the phone (including messages), and then to restore the data (including messages).

            PC Suite 6.84 can be used to selectively back up and restore things like just messages.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it is too late for you now.<br />
<br />
You still didn't say how, exactly, you copied your SMS to the PC (if you didn't use PC Suite).

<h2>            Sway presentation - page &#47; slide missing&#63; Can it be recovered&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, &nbsp;I am coming through here because Microsoft put me through four people this morning only to tell me they don't provide support for the product. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping to locate is a page from a Sway document I created yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the cloud auto saves so perhaps it is backed up. Just wondering if anybody else had experienced this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When I was almost finished, a page went missing. That page took me 3 hours to draft.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Silly me didn't copy it to notepad which &nbsp;I always do - I relied on the cloud to do its job properly. I thought, it's Microsoft it's fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that I expanded or reduced a group of elements, but I have gone through them all and can't find anything. There's no Recycle Bin or Edit files. the page has simply disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Chrome. Everything else in the presentation is there, just the key work is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate all suggestions. <strong><em>I really can't face writing the page all over again!</em></strong> Thanks Julie&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Any chance you can share the URL to your Sway so I can take a look (remember, this is a public forum)?&nbsp; What was the nature of the content (text, images, etc.)?&nbsp; Is there any particular piece of content you remember that should be there that isn't?</p>

            <p>What content is missing from this Sway that you expected to see?&nbsp; I've made a copy of it and I see some empty groups in the beginning; was there supposed to be other cards in them?&nbsp; Did you see any errors or do you remember anything else unusual from when
 you were creating it?&nbsp; Do you remember if after you added that content you saw it in the Sway preview itself or just in the storyline?</p>

            I had a page of information that took three hours to write. I remember it went missing after I moved some elements around. I definitely didn't delete it. I'm trying to ascertain if previous auto save versions are accessible; It's no longer in my document
 but it would still be in the Sway cloud somewhere.&nbsp;

            <p>Julie, unfortunately there is no way to get to older versions of Sways.&nbsp; Do you remember seeing the content go away when you did a user action or did you just notice it was gone later?&nbsp; Can you describe exactly what you were doing when it disappeared?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you doing this work in a web browser or in the Windows 10 app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you make a guess as to what date/time you added the content and when it disappeared?</p>

 to understand and see if there's something to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the nature of the content?&nbsp; Was it just text or was it other types of media as well?&nbsp; Was the text all in one card or split across multiple ones?&nbsp; The Storyline pane is the place where the content is entered; did you ever see it in the preview of
 the Sway itself or just in the Storyline pane?</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's cloud technology. The page exists. &nbsp;We just can't access it. &nbsp;The file was auto saving constantly and I manually saved every ten minutes because I have lost stuff before (I was around for DOS).

            <p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m very sorry to hear your content was lost, especially given how much time you put into it.&nbsp; I was able to take a look at the logs for the Sway URL that you shared and, while I can't see the specific content of your Sway, here is what I see:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You clicked on a group card to select it</li><li>You clicked the ungroup button on that group (when you ungroup a group, it removes the group and leaves all the cards that were previously children of it all selected together)</li><li>You clicked on an audio card (which, because you had other cards selected, added it to the selection)</li><li>You clicked delete (which removed all cards that were in your selection - at this point the paragraph count in your Sway went from 67 to 46)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>It looks to me like maybe you were intending to remove the audio card and didn't realize that other cards were selected as well?&nbsp; Later when you saw the card was gone, if you had used the undo button, you would have been able to get it back, but the undo
 list only persists until you load the page again at which time it is cleared and it appears that the page was refreshed about 2 minutes after the delete action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can do to get your content back, but we can look into improving the experience so that other users don’t run into the same problem.&nbsp; Does the description above of what happened sound accurate to you?&nbsp; Do you have any
 additional information on what you thought was going on that you believe would be valuable to us as we try to improve this going forward?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jason</p>

<p>Hi Samuel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure where you are (but we've seen a lot of this) so lets start from the beginning, check a few things, and make sure everything is done correctly. And we're going to forget upgrading and install MSE fresh to remove upgrade problems from the
 equation. This virtually always solves the issue though the issue varies from case to case. I believe it is a conflict with something that existed that didn't bother prior versions (check with the tool for anything that may be there from the past) or with
 how the upgrade deals with removing the prior MSE version (and doesn't do it well sometimes and even MrFixit isn't enough). Please don't skip steps or shortcut. All may not be needed (most usually isn't) but follow in order until the situation is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering
 with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.<span>Do
 not yet remove the one primary AV program you are using until you have downloaded the MSE file so you are protected while doing so&nbsp;then uninstall and remove that program after the download but before beginning to install MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install McAfee Security Scanner, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally installed
 McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once
 done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a> I suspect some problem with uninstalling the prior version is behind this, so you may need to focus more of the second
 link with the Mr Fixit and probably also the manual procedures to be sure it is completely removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs �?? you MUST also use the removal tool �?? even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn�??t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you're logged in as an administrator) as I've
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAP and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the infection,
 but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAP database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my</span><span>computer is infected. Options
 will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee
 will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the assisted support or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn�??t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Deleting part of file names within a folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, to make a long story I transferred a bunch of music from a device I no longer have. My problem is all songs transferred in with 01, 02, 03 etc., depending on the track number,&nbsp;in front of&nbsp;the&nbsp;actual song name. So, when I'm scrolling through
 my phone or music folder, it's not sorted in any sort of alphabetical&nbsp;order. I&nbsp;know how to change the names of the files individually, but I was hoping to basically do a find and replace like function that&nbsp;you would&nbsp;find&nbsp;in Word or Excel. I.e., Find 02, leave
 the replace&nbsp;row blank and&nbsp; then hit replace all. Any Ideas???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>Which site you want to upload the template, a site collection or a subsite? Please note that the Solution link is only available in the site collection even though you activated the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature and SharePoint Server
 Publishing feature.</p>
<p>If you can’t see the Solution link in the site collection, I’d like to confirm the following.<br />
1. A screenshot of your permission on the site level.<br />
To check the permission on the site level, please follow the steps below:<br />
Click&nbsp;<strong>Site settings</strong>, in the&nbsp;<strong>Users and Permissions</strong>&nbsp;section, click&nbsp;<strong>Site permissions</strong>. In the new page, click&nbsp;<strong>Check Permission</strong>&nbsp;in the ribbon, input the user’s name and click&nbsp;<strong>Check now</strong>.
 Then the user’s permission in the site level will display in the bottom.<br />
To upload a screenshot, click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong>.</p>
<p>Moreover, make sure <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-scripting-capabilities-on-or-off-1f2c515f-5d7e-448a-9fd7-835da935584f?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
custom scripting feature has been turned on </a>with your tenant.</p>
<p>2. Can you access the Solutions via the URL directly, like <a href="https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_catalogs/solutions/Forms/AllItems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_catalogs/solutions/Forms/AllItems.aspx?<br />
</a>Note: Please change the contoso to your company’s site collection’s name.<br />
3. Could you share us with a screenshot of the page under site settings for investigation?<br />
4. Could you assign another user as site collection administrator and log into your site to see if there is any difference?<br />
5. Does the issue occur all your site collections?</p>
<p>If it occurs in one site collection, based on my experience, some issues of this kind is solved by deleting the affected site collection, and then re-create it with activating the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature and SharePoint Server
 Publishing feature. You can also try the way if you don’t care it.</p>
<p>Please let us know your updates at your convenience.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Cliff</p>

    <title>How to change the subsequent animation timings while moving the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change the subsequent animation timings while moving the selected animation&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I have created a video in a single slide in&nbsp; PowerPoint. As you can imagine, there are a lot of objects in the selection pane and even more animations in the animation pane. So, when I want to change the timing of one animation, I have to manually
 change subsequent animations. Is there any way that would allow me to adjust multiple object timings together?

<p>Hi <strong>ShantanuTonde</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An option is available in PowerPoint if you are to make some changes or format a set objects as a group. To learn more about this, you may click
<span>
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/animate-a-set-of-objects-as-a-group-69f4fa42-b7eb-4381-8042-c3a20e0611bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In line with your concern, can you confirm if you’ll adjust multiple object timings together with
<strong>the same duration</strong> and delay or is it going to be <strong>different on each object</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, would you be able to share the PowerPoint file you’re working with or at least a sample file instead? This is for us to reproduce the concern. You may send it via a private message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Louie. Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to share the file as it is confidential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, I am creating a video. For smooth transitioning between the&nbsp;background videos, I have created it in one slide.&nbsp;As I need to assign different animations to each element&nbsp;and access them separately, I cannot group them. So as&nbsp;you can imagine, the
 animation pane has a long list of animations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is, when I have to slightly alter one animation at the beginning of the list, I have to manually reflect the change in all&nbsp;subsequent animations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to answer your question, I want to adjust multiple object timings together with the same delay. In other words, I want the change in one animation timing to be reflected in every animation timing below the said animation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I could have found the solution by trying different things like selecting multiple animations and then trying to alter the timing; since up to&nbsp;this point I have learned everything about&nbsp;powerpoint with trial&nbsp;and error. But this time around I was a little
 lazy and decided to ask for professional help.</p>

<p>I appreciate you for providing further information about your concern. I understand how tedious it can be to manually apply the necessary changes to all subsequent animations. After trying to replicate this on my end by creating a sample presentation and
 asked for a consultation, the option to reflect the changes you’ll make from one subsequent animation to another is unavailable as of this time. On the other hand, this can be an excellent idea of innovation that you can raise as a feedback to our
<strong>PowerPoint UserVoice forums</strong>. It’s for better visibility for others who also got the same concern. They can upvote it to increase the priority for our engineers and product group to come up with an updated feature. Click this

            <p>Windows Media Player is built into Windows 10, but it is not setup as the default player. To find Media Player, you have to scroll all the way down to the "W's" in the Start Menu&nbsp;to find&nbsp;Windows Media Player.
</p>
<p>To set it up as the default player, go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Default Apps. On the right side at the bottom, you will find Set Defaults By App. A list will pop up, find and highlight Windows Media Player. On the right again at the bottom, you will have a
 couple of choices for setting defaults. Choose Defaults for this Program will give you better control of the file types to be opened. Once you have checked&nbsp;your&nbsp;options, remember to hit Save. The same procedure can be used to set defaults for other programs
 too. </p>

                    OK, I've read the original answers for a similar problem, but mine is associated to the filename IELowutil.exe.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I cannot open IE to follow any suggestions.&nbsp; It just hangs there with a blank face and the whole screen is locked.&nbsp; To get my Windows 7 computer back I have to stop the application with Task Manager.<br />
<br />
After banging my head against the Microsoft Wall, I tried downloading a fresh copy of IE, but because I'm forced to use the Firefox browser to get online I can't even use Windows Update or even download a fix if there was one.<br />
<br />
The error shown started a few days ago and I can't get it to stop appearing every few seconds.&nbsp; Wit's end time. ( sigh )

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I would try to troubleshoot using the below methods and if not joy try a System Restore back to a point before<br />
this started to happen.<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span><br />
</a><br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER had on this<br />
machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
If no joy something maybe blocking it.<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessories - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />

<br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. <br />

<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<h3> owlladyf  say:</h3>
<h2>            RPRK for Lumia 640</h2>
                    My son's Lumia 640 phone quit working last night. We did a hard reset, but need the RPRK to proceed. I don't know what to do here. I'm about to drop this phone off the highest bridge I can find. Does anybody know what I can do to get it working again?
 Or am I just stuck with a $130 paperweight?

<p>The phone in question was given to my son by my husband. We had/have matching phones, both the Lumia 640 and Alcatel Idol 4S. Out of 4 phone activations, we were
<strong>never</strong> offered that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft sent us to B2X earlier today, and they, in turn, sent us back to Microsoft. As we speak, B2X is telling my husband (via chat) that only Microsoft can get the phone working again. Microsoft, earlier, sent me to their Lumia Support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get this phone working again without the RPRK? 🤷</p>

<h2>            Lumia 640 screen blackout on rotation</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, just got a Lumia 640. Love it. Working great, but noticed a problem when it is in sunlight. The screen displays perfectly in portrait position, but when you rotate it to landscape position it blacks out. Only happens outside? Inside is no problem.
 Put it back in portrait and displays again. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Gazza335.</a> Does it happen regardless if the phone is in standby mode or running an application? If yes, you may try performing a hardware reboot. It will not delete any personal data on the phone. To do this while the phone is turned off, press and hold
 the volume down and power button keys at the same time until it vibrates and it will restart. If the issue persists, proceed with phone reset.&nbsp;It will delete everything on the phone. Please do
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Error code 86000C09</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lumia 930 with a Live account&nbsp;which uses eas.outlook.com server&nbsp;and since a couple of days ago it stopped syncing and returns error 86000C09, so now when I do a manual sync from email+accounts&nbsp;it tells me "Not up to date"&nbsp; but when I uncheck the
 email box at&nbsp;"content to sync" and do a manual sync again the "not up to date" clears, but then I get no mail through.</p>
<p>I have set up the same account but used imap and smtp and that one will sync, so now I have 2 accounts set up hopefully the original live account syncs all my calendar etc,etc, and the 2nd account I have is for mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely this is not correct and that a fix should be from Microsoft, this is not how I want my accounts to work, I have had this live account for quite a while and do not understand why this has only just started happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the suggested fixes/work arounds&nbsp;that are mentioned in various posts in the forums, but to no avail, and it has been a know issue for quite a while, so where are Microsoft on this issue, please don't tell me it has been resolved when clearly
 it has not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks in advance for any information on this.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, you can "remove it" and add it again, but don't delete it. Also check if "time and date" is correctly set up. Still if this wouldn't work, we suggest you perform a hard reset. For hard reset FAQ's, go

                    <p>This sounds really bizarre, but I received an email from a known sender, tried to reply, but Outlook changed the recipient name to another that had the same first name.&nbsp; Many people share a first name, but since these individuals had separate accounts, providers,
 and last names, this should not happen.&nbsp; Could be a disaster!!</p>
<p>Let me be clear.&nbsp; I received an email from John Doe, clicked on reply to respond.&nbsp; Outlook changed recipient name to John Smith.&nbsp; I did not enter that name, just clicked reply.&nbsp; Deleted, tried again, same problem.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello ConnieGeck,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's possible&nbsp;that the sender has enabled the <strong>reply-to option</strong>
<span>on their account. It would be great if you could ask the sender if he/she enabled this feature on their account. If the sender didn't setup this option, there's a strong possibility that his/her account was hijacked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I also like to&nbsp;confirm if this issue happens to other sender or only for the specific sender.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In addition, </span><span><span>please refer to the steps provided below if you want to&nbsp;setup the
<span><span><strong>Reply-to option</strong> on your account:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Sign in to your Outlook.com account.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the <b>Gear icon</b> beside your name located at the upper right corner your Outlook.com interface.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click&nbsp;<b>More mail settings.</b></span></p>
<p><span>4. On the Outlook.com options page, under&nbsp;<b>Writing email</b>, click<b>&nbsp;Reply-to address</b>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click <strong>Other address</strong> and input your desired Reply-to address.<br />
6. Click&nbsp;<b>Save</b>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            <p>Hi ConnieGeck,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your previous reply, it seems that your issue occurs on specific sender. Therefore, it is possible that sender has configured reply-to feature on his/her account. Please be informed that reply to address works this way, when you enable the reply-to
 option on your account, it will look like all emails are coming from the original sender but when people click
<strong>Reply</strong>, instead of sending the message back to the sender it will be sent to a different designated email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@ MVP Ron Sommer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The possible cause that I can think of is <span>
Email spoofing. Email spoofing is an <span>email</span> activity in which the sender address and other parts of the email header are altered to appear as though
 the email originated from a different source. These techniques are commonly used in
<span>spam</span> and <span>phishing</span> emails to hide the origin of the email message.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How did you find the email? Is it suspicious?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Best regards.</span></p>

    <title>Outlook Address Book Disappeared After MS 10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertmoss_800  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Address Book Disappeared After MS 10 Update</h2>
                    I use Outlook Express on Windows 10.1.&nbsp; On Sep 7th 2016 an update was carried out which has led to the disappearance of my Address Book.&nbsp; Just a few entries are left in Contacts.&nbsp; When I try to access Address Book, message appears: "The Address Book cannot
 be displayed.&nbsp; The Contents folder associated with this address list could not be opened; it may have been moved or deleted, or you do not have permissions...".&nbsp; On the other hand, when I type in the first few letters of an email address in a message template
 header, the full address is filled in automatically, so there is obviously still a look-up process being performed.&nbsp; So I assume the full list of contacts is still somewher on the PC, it's just that I don't know where!&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas how I may
 retrieve it please?&nbsp; Bob Moss

<h2>            Error Code 0x8004FF56 During Installation of Microsoft Security Essentials</h2>
                    I am on Windows XP and I have been trying to download and install microsoft security essentials and when i download it and select "run" and i see the loading bar with the x86 and thing like that and then a window pops up with an error code which is: 0x8004FF56.
 In the "Support" section of Micrsoft Security Essentials under "Top Solutions" then to "I can't install Microsoft Security Essentials." I have tryed everything there, and still nothing. Security Essentials has worked on another computer, also on Windows XP.
 I don't know if is just this computer, i would like to fix the problem so somebody's response is greatly appreciated. BTW i have also had trouble installing Zune on this computer.

            <p>Hi JMarkx,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm willing to bet you're still using SP2 and haven't upgraded to SP3 because this error code was resolved for SP2 with an update and does not occur now if using SP3 (or Vista or W7).&nbsp; If you are still using SP2, first upgrade to SP3 since SP2 is no longer
 supported and you really need to upgrade to protect your system (and it may fix your Zune issue at the same time).&nbsp; Once that is done, see if it works (but using the procedure below and not whatever you did before).&nbsp; If not, try installing the following&nbsp;update:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/914882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/914882</a> which was a required update on XPSP2 before installing MSE but should be included in SP3 and not necessary, but I suppose it can't hurt to give it a
 try and then proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's do everything from scratch to make sure it is done completely and properly and including all required steps.&nbsp; Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This means not only current ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. If you think it possible but can't remember, try Belarc Advisor:
</span><a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</span></a><span> and/or Secunia PSI
</span><a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/</span></a><span> to find them (and BTW, both of these are good tools to have on yours system anyway as they can often
 come in handy or help with maintenance and security). Or run the removal tools for every one that even vaguely rings a bell as it can't hurt and may help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it's time to uninstall (I say uninstall because you've tried before and the problem may lie in a partial installation or corruption or remaining remnants)&nbsp;and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a> or
<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a>.&nbsp; In your case, pay particulaar attention to the manual procedures and do them all exactly as instructed and completely
 to be certain it's fully removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span>&nbsp; </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;(nowhere else) and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download,
 save it to the desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.&nbsp; Again, DO NOT RUN IT.&nbsp; Save it as indicated
 above and install it that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you
 shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>

<h2>            Converting custom mark footnotes to automatic footnotes</h2>
                    <div>Hello</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>I have a document in which custom marks (such as asterisks, plus signs...) have been used as footnote marks. I can't find a quick way to convert them to automatic footnotes. Since searching for ^f can't find those marks, I search for each custom mark (for
 example the asterisk), select it, press Ctrl+Alt+f, remove the custom mark from the appearing Footnote and Endnote window, then click Insert. But this is taking too much time. Also, Find and Replace can't replace with ^f.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Is there an easier way to do this? A sample document can be found <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!Avk1cc4ydrXHjS5ompvuZaCrWNJE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Combining IF and AND to exclude certain time frame - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ccbeebiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combining IF and AND to exclude certain time frame</h2>
                    <p>I've resolved my original problem as the history below shows.&nbsp; The issue now is how to exclude situations where the start and end time are between the hours of 11pm and 12Midnight.&nbsp; See TIME EXCLUSION below for crux of remaining problem, see HISTORY for
 details of formula and my progression through the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HISTORY:</p>
<p>I'm trying to modify a formula that normally just compares the start time and end time for a project (which assumes a midnight to midnight day) to adjust for a day that starts at 11:00PM.&nbsp; The original formula takes a time of day (2:15pm) entered as&nbsp;14.15
 and converts it to minutes as follows:</p>
<p>=(TRUNC(D5)*60+((D5-TRUNC(D5))*100))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full formula subtracts the start time(Row 5)&nbsp;from the end time (Row 6)&nbsp;as follows, including a small adjustment for the minutes entered in D8.</p>
<p>=(TRUNC(D6)*60+((D6-TRUNC(D6))*100))-(TRUNC(D5)*60+((D5-TRUNC(D5))*100))-D8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our problem is one of the shifts starts at 11:00PM.&nbsp; Therefore the start time needs to be converted to the minutes used between 11:00pm and 12:00pm which are then added to the end time. &nbsp;This is what I've come up with so far, but it's not working yet and
 I'm not sure why. (I also need to check for no time entered, hence the If(C5=0,0... start to the formula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>=IF<span>(</span>C5=0,0,<span>(</span>If (C5&gt;=23),<span>(</span><span>(</span>TRUNC(C6)*60+<span>(</span>(C6-TRUNC(C6))*100<span>)</span><span>)</span>+<span>(</span>1440-<span>(</span>
<span>(</span>TRUNC(C5)*60+<span>(</span>(C5-TRUNC(C5))*100<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>-C8,<span>(</span><span>(</span>TRUNC(C6)*60+((C6-TRUNC(C6))*100)<span>)</span>-((TRUNC(C5)*60+((C5-TRUNC(C5))*100)))))-C8<span>)</span><span>)</span></b></p>
<span>(</span>TRUNC(C5)*60+<span>(</span>(C5-TRUNC(C5))*100<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>-C8,<span>(</span><span>(</span>TRUNC(C6)*60+((C6-TRUNC(C6))*100)<span>)</span>-((TRUNC(C5)*60+((C5-TRUNC(C5))*100)))))-C8<span>)</span><span>)</span></b></p>
<p><b>I'd also like to change C5&gt;=23 to include the upper limit of C5=24 but kept it out to try to get the main part of the formula right.&nbsp; Also, is there a shorter way to do this?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:&nbsp; I've found a couple of errors and am now getting the results I want for every situation except when the start and end time are both within the last hour of the day.&nbsp; Is my only option to make the below even more complicated by embedding
 another IF statement for that condition?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Corrected formula is now (but it breaks when start and end time are both before midnight:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>=IF(C5=0,0,(IF(C5&gt;=23,((TRUNC(C6)*60+((C6-TRUNC(C6))*100))+(1440-((TRUNC(C5)*60+((C5-TRUNC(C5))*100))))-C8),((TRUNC(C6)*60+((C6-TRUNC(C6))*100))-((TRUNC(C5)*60+((C5-TRUNC(C5))*100)))-C8))))</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIME EXCLUSION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to get an IF statement to allow for work completed in the last hour of the day to replace (IF(C5&gt;=23, and so far have:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>IF(AND(C5&gt;=23,C6&lt;23),</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>but I'm not sure how to incorporate that into my formula.</strong></span></p>
