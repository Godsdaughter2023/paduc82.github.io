<p>Hi - you are a brand new Insider member&nbsp; This site is for testing future releases of W10.&nbsp; Therefore, you are not likely a W10 beta tester and you are likely on the wrong site.&nbsp; This site does not offer Microsoft support.&nbsp; We are beta testers and are expected
 to have good knowledge of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Enterprise edition must have a valid license just like the Pro edition.&nbsp; The Enterprise edition often has a Corporation volume license.&nbsp; If you are associated with Corp license, then jjust go to Microsoft and download the Enterprise edition and enter
 your valid license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Enterprise edition offers features not found in Pro.&nbsp; You would expect to receive these Enterprise features and if not, then your help source would be Microsoft support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this is not a Microsoft help source.&nbsp; We are beta testers that try to find bugs in future releases of W10 before they are released to the public.</p>

            right now i can't answer all that, to tired. But you have given me a consideration or two (usb and such) but im thinking it might be something to do with me running spybot (keeps windows from spying on you but there are settings. And see i had windows
 10 and insider options before but have had to "redo it all" and this is how it turned out and im pretty sure i had spybot at it's best performance. As for being greyed out out, that just what i mean, sames as on a phone it's grey and you can't select. Of course
 in reality it is grey but i think it is even a little tone different and you can't select. build 1511 (i think right numbers but maybe wrong order but i think right) thanks for getting back to me.

    <title>How to convert Web pages into Power Point Presentations&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crs kumar  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to convert Web pages into Power Point Presentations&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There are several situations where we need to convert web pages into Power Point presentations. The web pages are
</p>
<p>usually done with XHTML and one way to convert them to slides is to cut and paste the content and images. However,</p>
<p>is there an elegant way to convert the web pages into ppts?&nbsp; Sometimes, &nbsp;web &nbsp;elements such as buttons,&nbsp;checkboxes, background,</p>
<p>&nbsp;etc&nbsp; need to be retained for various reasons. Also, the power point slideshow to some extent cannot perform</p>
<p>functionalities of internet browsers such as submitting information to the server, fecthing content from the internet,
</p>
<p>rendering the markup language, running the embedded scripts &nbsp;etc. </p>
<p>May be these functionalities can be expected in future releases of the power point.</p>
<p>The reasons for expecting browser like functionalities in the power point slideshow are:</p>
<p>- you can embed content from the web such as Youtube video, google maps etc. </p>
<p>- MCQs and tests can be designed which can submit information to the server</p>
<p>- Newsfeeds can be utilized for presentations</p>
<p>Warm regards</p>

            It's unlikely that MS will turn PowerPoint into a web browser; at one time, they attempted to make it possible to save ALL PPT features out to HTML and then open the HTML back into PowerPoint, intact. &nbsp;It worked quite well when PPT was simpler, but it
 eventually became a lost cause and now even the ability to save as HTML has been removed from PowerPoint.
<div><br />
<div>If it's important to display HTML/browser content on a PPT slide, Shyam Pillai's LiveWeb add-in is probably the best bet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That or re-creating the functionality needed in VBA.</div>

<h2>            How do I set the Cursor position for a specific line in centimetres for Office 2010 like 2003&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In a Word document I need to start typing at a particular point (ie the Cursor position) which might vary according to the stationery and window envelope I will be using. I now know how to start at say line 6, but this would change according to font size.
 How can I indicated the position in measurements eg centimetres? I need this information in the bottom status bar as I had with Office 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always knew depending on paper size that I had to start typing on line say 6.5cm!</p>

    <title>Delete all secondary calendars, delete a ton of blank calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete all secondary calendars, delete a ton of blank calendar reminders, and stop deleted calendars from reappearing.</h2>
                    I recently migrated several hundred mail accounts from GSuite to Office 365 using a third party tool<br />
<br />
A vast majority of these accounts have anywhere from 2-20 secondary calendars and are now showing as "Other calendars" in mail.office365.com (the only mail client they use).<br />
<br />
They are not able to delete any calendar under "Other".&nbsp; A few people are able to delete the calendars, but the calendars return within several minutes.<br />
<br />
For an added bonus, they are receiving reminders for past calendar events from these secondary calendars, they are all blank and do not go away.<br />
<br />
There are no connectors to their accounts (IMAP or otherwise) that are syncing to their accounts.<br />
<br />
I'm unable to find a powershell command that will delete the secondary calendars.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            Hi JohnPetroschek,<br />
<br />
According to your description, as you are Office 365 for Business users, we suggest you try to use Outlook 2016 client to delete Calendars. Besides, you can try to use MFCMAPI tool by following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Download the MFCMAPI tool.<br />
2. Launch the MFCMAPI tool.<br />
3. Go to Session &gt; Logon… &gt; Select the outlook profile of the user &gt; double-click “Mailbox - your user name” (If you don’t view the mailbox, please go to Session &gt; Advanced logon &gt; Display message store table).<br />
4. In the next window, expand “Root Container” &gt; expand “IPM_SUBTREE”.<br />
5. Right-click the calendar you want to delete under “Calendar” and choose Delete folder.<br />
6. Expand “Finder” &gt; double –click “Reminders”.<br />
7. Locate the recurring appointment by sorting the Subject column or the To column.<br />
8. Right-click the appointment, and then click Delete Message.<br />
<br />
If the issue still occurs, please verify the permission on calendar from management shell to check if it has delete permission by use the following PowerShell commend Get- MailboxFolderPermission and Get- ManagementRoleAssignment (For reference:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335061.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get-MailboxFolderPermission</a> and <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd638132.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recipients Permissions</a>) .<br />
<br />

This works on any newly created calendars, but is not showing any of the calendars that are showing up as an "Other-" calendar in Outlook.

<p>Hi JohnPetroschek,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know whether you are using Outlook client or <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a>? If you mean you are using Outlook client, if yes, please try to delete calendars under Other Calendars in OWA to check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For cannot delete the calendars, it there any error message? If yes, please provide us a screenshot to make it much clearer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, if the issue happens to all migrated mailboxes? Since you mentioned the newly created calendars can be deleted, about the previous calendars under Other Calendars, if they are any special calendars in your Gmail accounts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

    <title>Outlook 2011 identity rebuild results in error code &#34;-47&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> funbobbysf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2011 identity rebuild results in error code &#34;-47&#34;</h2>
                    On Friday, since a restart of my MacBook Pro, I have been unable to launch Outlook 2011 (v14.3.4) using the main identity. Attempting to rebuild the identity results in a "Your database could not be rebuilt. [-47]" error. I have a somewhat up-to-date Time
 Machine backup but I am looking to keep the messages that have been archived to "On My Computer" folders since the time of the last backup. I have tried creating a new identity and copying the appropriate folders from Main Identity to this new identity but
 get the same error when rebuilding that identity.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone provide more details on error code 47? Is there any way to get more detailed information (e.g. from a log) regarding the operations being performed by the Microsoft Database Utility during the rebuild process? Next, I will be trying to move
 different subsets of messages to the new identity to try and narrow down whether there is a problematic messages folder/directory.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Until I started researching this issue, I was not aware that archiving to "On My Computer" is considered so dangerous/fragile. I am a long-time user of .pst files on Outlook for Windows, where I have had good luck keeping emails long-term... what is the
 recommended way for Mac users to archive emails (since Exchange accounts generally have a quota)?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any suggestions,</div>
<div>-Bobby</div>

            Update: After removing the "Folders" subdirectory under the "Data Records" directory in the Main Identity, I was able to successfully rebuild the Main Identity identity. Unfortunately, this has the side effect of all the "On My Computer" folders being
 renamed and losing their organization but all the "archived" messages appear to be available. Not desirable but I can live with the inconvenience over losing messages.
<div><br />
<div>That being said, even thought it seems I've retrieved my messages, I'd be curious to know what error code 47 from the Microsoft Database Utility rebuild process actually means and how other Outlook 2011 for Mac users are archiving messages [reliably].</div>

                    <span>If I wish to create simple formulae in Word tables, I'm finding it hard to identify specific cells to apply a formula to.<br />
<br />
Is there any way of displaying a cell number (i.e. B34) in a View Box or similar, as one can in Excel?<br />
<br />
I've tried hovering over individual cells with the cursor, switching placeholders on and off (which only displays completed formulae), and viewing paragraph symbols, all without success.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
For various reasons, using an embedded Excel Table isn't a good idea; not least because of often having to save my Word documents in different formats for people using older systems.<br />
<br />
If there isn't such a feature in Word for Mac 2011, it'd make my life a lot easier if it could be included in an update.</span>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            UK Troll, based on Peter's code, I wrote a macro that will show the current cell's coordinates as a popup menu. This is what it looks like:
<div><br />
&nbsp;
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fbyfiles.storage.live.com%2fy1pZFcN_YTneZADCXfD8qhdMnl4CQj6e74oSpFSp9jvaHVmhAP4j5yJDiSbIaP4oyhjNxL7zaGuXw8%2fShowCellCoordinates.jpg%3fpsid%3d1" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>Pretty neat. The simple version has six lines of code:</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub ShowCellCoordinates()</div>
<div>Set myBar = CommandBars.Add(Name:="Custom1", Position:=msoBarPopup, Temporary:=True)</div>
<div>myBar.Controls.Add Type:=msoControlButton</div>
<div>myBar.Controls(1).Caption = ChrW(AscW("A") + Selection.Cells(1).ColumnIndex - 1) &amp; CStr(Selection.Cells(1).RowIndex)</div>
<div>myBar.ShowPopup</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need to follow these instructions to paste the above code as a macro into the Visual Basic Editor:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://word.mvps.org/faqs/macrosvba/CreateAMacro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create A Macro</a></b></li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Then you should assign it an unused key shortcut (like "Control C") by following these instructions:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://word.mvps.org/faqs/customization/asgncmdormacrotohotkey.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Assign command or macro to hot key</a></b></li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Once you're done, click on a cell and press its shorcut. It works nicely, except that Word's "Help" menu choice is always present. And you need to get used to clicking outside the menu in order to dismiss it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>With the simple code above, if the cursor is not within a table, you will get an error message. The message can be elegantly hidden by adding more code to channel the error. The 11 lines of code follow:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Sub ShowCellCoordinates()</div>
<div>Set myBar = CommandBars.Add(Name:="Custom1", Position:=msoBarPopup, Temporary:=True)</div>
<div>myBar.Controls.Add Type:=msoControlButton</div>
<div>On Error GoTo NotATable</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;myBar.Controls(1).Caption = ChrW(AscW("A") + Selection.Cells(1).ColumnIndex - 1) &amp; CStr(Selection.Cells(1).RowIndex)</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;myBar.ShowPopup</div>
<div>Exit Sub</div>
<div>NotATable:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;myBar.Controls(1).Caption = "The cursor must be within a cell"</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;myBar.ShowPopup</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div>
<p><br />

            The grid labels in a Word table are laid out the same as in Excel.<br />
<br />
The table cell in the upper left corner is A1. Columns are letters A, B. C... and rows are numbers. The only difference is that you have to count the rows and columns yourself if you want to use row and column numbers to reference the table cells.<br />
<br />
You could always use the first row as the letters of the columns, then hide them when you don't want to see them (use the table options on the Table Layout tab of the Ribbon or adjust the row height to zero). Remember your first row of data will be 2 instead
 of 1 if you use this trick.<br />
<br />
An alternative is to insert a text field (from the Developer tab on the Ribbon) into each cell you wish to use in the calculation. Double-click the text field. In the Field Settings you will see BookMark1, 2, etc. which you can use in your formulas, or you
 can define a name for each field bookmark by typing a new name into the dialog and then refer to the bookmark name in the formula.<br />

            You'll just waste your time going to a store. Unfortunately this is a known camera problem with the Lumia 950. Microsoft is just ignoring this problem. Never had a problem with Lumias until the 950.

<p>I have reset the phone to factory settings several times.&nbsp;I only use the Microsoft camera app to take photos so I know that this is a Microsoft problem. Some suggested I have a bad SD card but I know that the problem is with the Windows mobile because even
 if I saved directly to the phone it would still display a saving message which locks the phone. I even reconfigured the camera to shoot 8MP and and turned of capture living images and it would still struggle to. After 6 or more consecutive photos the phone
 will get stuck to saving. This is not the case with my older Lumia 830 you can keep on snapping photos and it would not lock. It is also sad that this is just one problem with the Lumia 950. There are times when it just randomly looses phone signal, you have
 to completely power down the phone then turn it back on only to find out how much messages you missed. Thanks for the response but I have to say its really pathetic coming from Microsoft because this is the most basic thing that AT&amp;T representatives do. Why
 don't you just fix a known bug. It appears that Microsoft successfully ruined the Lumia.</p>

            <p>Yes my phone has been reset from the system about and reset via windows device recovery tool. My phone is using the latest software. What Microsoft needs to do is to start recognizing the known problem instead making generic responses.</p>
<p>Even a blog recognizes this known issue http://wmpoweruser.com/three-things-microsoft-needs-fix-lumia-950-950-xl-immediately/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your response to the signal loss is terrible it does not address the problem. The Lumia 950 randomly losses phone signal so instead of waiting for a call I'm actually checking every now and then if my phone still has a signal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Microsoft just ruined this phone.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I returned my Lumia for servicing because of hardware problems with the camera (cannot do focus properly). They refused to repair my phone because of "liquid intrusion". I'm really sorry, but in my country, it sometimes rain... Water is part of our daily
 lives. I always took utmost care of my phone, but apparently, it wasn't enough. </p>

<p>Hi Elmona,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in this forum. Sorry to hear that you're having issues with your Nokia device. Did something happen on the phone prior to that? Have you tried removing the battery and put it back in then try charging it again? Can you also try using
 a different battery and charger for us to isolate the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this will not work, then you may visit any Nokia Care Point in your area and have the phone checked by a technician.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know what will happen.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If this is all OK, then the only thing I can think that is causing the conflict is the Language Registry
 Code, which is set upon install. Sometime ago I had a spurious French (France) appearing and it turned out that because my new build (going from Word 2000 on 2000 to Word2003 on XP) was done in-house and the disks were bought in France (I work for a French
 company – stop… don't turn-off), and even though the IT chappie did the build in English and told everything to be in English, the default language was French! So the only remedy was to go into the Registry and change the Language code to English (UK), which
 has solved my problems of both French and US.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Hotmail password change disables use of mail app using hotmail on iPhone and ipad</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see other users have had problems with mobile devices after changing their hotmail passwords too but I haven't had any success in fixing my problem yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changed my password on my MAC laptop about 1 week ago (using a slightly longer password). &nbsp;Reset password in iPhone and ipad and both worked for 4 days then suddenly stopped working. &nbsp;I just reset my password to be slightly shorter and this did not help
 - both my mobile devices do not recognize the username or password. &nbsp;I can access my hotmail via web browser on my devices and laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the hotmail account off both mobile devices and tried to reset but could not. &nbsp;I received the error message that my username or password for imap-mail.outlook.com was incorrect for my ipad and the POP server imap-mail.outlook.com is not responding
 (though the outgoing server accepted and verified my new password). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use 2 step verification and I really don't want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I have someone from Microsoft Tech please help? &nbsp;I have been a hotmail user forever but this is seriously making me rethink. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

            Hello,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Recently we learned of an issue that could have impacted a small number of people who had been accessing their email account on their device. Though browser access to Hotmail account (via outlook.com) works fine. Using the application might give out error messages
 such as Incorrect password and the like.<br />
<br />
Our team is working on having this issue sorted out as soon as possible. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Regards.

 it seems, but there's a quick solution: go to your Outlook account on the web and create an alias using "@outlook.com." You don't have to make it primary (if you switch, you won't be able to make the old one primary ever again), it only has to be associated
 with your old @hotmail account. Then add the new outlook address to your Mail app through Mail/Add Account, type in the password which is the same as for the old Hotmail alias. You should get access to your old inbox instantly. (non-Outlook aliases should
 work too.)</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your note. &nbsp;Indeed, my hotmail account is a legacy one since MS migrated hotmail to the outlook platform. &nbsp; I was able to add my existing hotmail account to the mail app on my Apple mobile devices by signing into outlook as opposed to signing
 in or creating a hotmail mail account on those devices. &nbsp;Once I used the outlook platform, the devices recognised my hotmail account including my new password. &nbsp;I did not need to create any outlook address for my existing hotmail account to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help and support!</p>

    <title>Word 2007 randomly deletes spaces between words - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2007 randomly deletes spaces between words</h2>
                    My Word 2007 has suddenly started randomly deleting spaces between words. I found a previous thread where this problem was reported to occur when the document was sent for printing - I have not tried printing my document so I don't think it has anything
 to do with this. I also noticed the previous thread refers to Word 2010 which I do not have.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use Word 2008 (Mac) at home, so there is a possibility it is a compatibility issue between the two. However, I've noticed that Word 2007 (PC) will do this to the file even if I haven't opened it on my Mac. I've been using both systems for years and have
 never had a problem until now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div>

 help, cheers.

<h2>            Why can&#39;t &#34;Internet Explorer Display Webpage&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here we go again:</p>
<p>I am used to getting this error message, and that's frustrating enough, but I also get the following message frequently:</p>
<p>"HTTP 400 Bad request" and, more recently, "a problem has occurred - please wait 5 minutes or delete your cookies and try again".</p>
<p>Whenever I follow these problems up with the websites involved, the invariable answer is "delete your cookies and/or empty your cache" or "use a different browser".</p>
<p>If the solution to all these problems is merely "deleting cookies" or "emptying cache", why can't Internet Explorer do this for us instead of generating useless messages?</p>

<p><span>The “400 Bad Request error” is an HTTP status code that means the request you sent to the website server (i.e. a request to load a web page) was somehow malformed. Therefore the server was unable to understand or process the request.</span></p>

To restate information that you have already been given, HTTP 400 is not a problem which can be fixed on the client side, unless the problem is the URL which is being used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you give us a publicly accessible example that you see this symptom with the most?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW I noticed this happening in a recent incident with Yahoo when I was testing just the IPv6 address.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it happens most frequently with IPv6 it may be an idea to try disabling that protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. there could be a problem anywhere on the path to the
 host that could be causing the host to reject your request this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah.&nbsp; I just noticed that your OS is XP.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you may not even have IPv6 support enabled?&nbsp;&nbsp; Then on some sites that might make the symptom more likely, e.g. more contention for an IPv4 address.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then there would be an answer to your question related to your OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; In XP, Diagnose Connection Problems&nbsp; does nothing about checking connectivity to the problem host and nothing even with the problem client.&nbsp;&nbsp; Check your report.&nbsp;&nbsp; It just tests access
 to Microsoft hosts with various protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp; To see my other point you would need a trace tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; ProcMon for its Network trace would be good enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you would see that the test requests are not sent by iexplore.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are sent by a different program,
 further reducing the value of the diagnostic as being able to say much specific about the problem scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</p>

Then that suggests you don't have the add-on installed which provides that feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; IIRC there would be an option in the IE8 Tools menu on XP which does the same thing manually and more clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try that?</p>

                    Logged out of my version 7 skype and now it forces me to "update" to this unusable version 8. It takes minutes to send a picture which took version 7 mere seconds. The UI is horrible and unrefined which doesn't help its case either.

    <title>Windows 10 Build 9926 &#40;Win 8.1 Full Sytem Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petegypsy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Build 9926 &#40;Win 8.1 Full Sytem Upgrade Installation&#41;&#58;  third-Party Program Compatibility Issues -- Will they be resolved&#63;</h2>
                    After making a full system backup image and saving to a removable drive, I did an in-place upgrade installation of my Win 8.1 (64-bit) system to "see how it would work".<br />
<br />
The following was noted:<br />
<br />
1. The upgrade installation of my Win 8.1 system to a Windows 10 system has "converted" my desktop into a "new machine" (much of my installed software now "recognises" the "Windows 10" machine as new; not the same one it was installed on)<br />
<br />
2. Being regarded as a "new" machine, the following software requires to be "first time" registered and/or a new product key obtained:<br />
<br />
a. Microsoft Office Professional requires a new product key<br />
<br />
b. All of my "Nuance" products require to be re-registered (eg, Dragon Naturally Speaking 2013 and OmniPage V18.0, and Nero 14 Platinum). (Re-registration of nuance products without a proper prior un-install of each product renders one liable to have to pay
 for re-registration)<br />
<br />
4. The following programs are regarded as "incompatible" with Windows 10 and also do not work in any of the "redundant versions" from within Windows 10:<br />
PaperPort 14, and Microsoft Money; as well as Norton Internet Security 2014; and Webroot Secure.<br />
<br />
5. The Apps that were installed on my Win 8.1 system had all been deleted, including 2 that I had purchased.<br />
<br />
6. the iCloud Add-in for Outlook 2013 will not install.<br />
<br />
Whilst I recognise that Windows 10 is still a Technical Preview, I seriously doubt that future builds will solve these issues.<br />
<br />
So, it seems we need to be very cautious when Windows 10 is launched (free, via Windows Update to existing Win 7 and 8 users). Simply accepting the update and installing it could have unexpected and unpleasant consequences. (This "free" update could end up
 costing some users quite a great deal!)<br />
<br />
I also wonder what will happen in the future, once Windows 10 has been launched. Will some Windows 10 OS upgrades (which will be rolled out via Windows Update) suddenly render some installed software no-longer usable?<br />
<br />
I was enjoying testing Windows 10 Build 9926 as a pure OS in a virtual machine; but the implications for me when it is rolled out are not too exciting(!)<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?

            <p>This is most probably not what you wish to hear, but it is the responsibility of third party apps/programs to ensure that they are compatible to operate within an OS, this has always been the case.</p>
<p>It would be impossible for MS to adapt the OS to the thousands of variations of different apps/programs.</p>

            <p>Looks like I screwed up on my 1st try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I basically agree with most of your comments as they apply today.&nbsp; However, I doubt that the final release will be as problematic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a spare notebook lying around so I took a W8.1 HP over to W10TP as a sole OS.&nbsp; I realized at the time that I would lose my installed apps.&nbsp; This was really the same as bringing on a new PC.&nbsp; I also run Office 2013 Pro Plus and I also use Norton 2014
 on my fleet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a fully functional PC with Office and Onedrive.&nbsp; I knew I would lose Norton since they do not support Beta OS's.&nbsp; I now use Windows Defender.&nbsp; I had no issue with any other program and I run several.&nbsp; I did have to re-install them.&nbsp; I do have a couple
 of minor issues that I have able to work around or have/will be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would fully expect that the W7 and W8.1 transitions to final W10 will be seamless in the same way as W8 went to W8.1 where all files and programs made the transition.&nbsp; 3rd party programs will release new edition to handle W10, Norton included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that my W10TP will simply transition to W10 final, seamlessly.</p>

            <p>I did an in-place upgrade of my Win 8.1 (64-bit) system to Win 10 (9926) using an installation DVD burned with the downloaded .ISO file. The results were posted here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/167066-Windows-10-Build-9926-(Win-8-1-Full-Sytem-Upgrade-Installation)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windowssecrets.com/forums/sho...-Installation)</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(and in this thread above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I then recovered my Win 8.1 image and then performed an in-place upgrade to Win10 (9926) via Windows Update as per the options here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/preview-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/w...eview-download</span></a><br />
<br />
The upgrade processes experienced using the two different methods <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
DID NOT yield the same end result</span>.<br />
The upgrade via Windows Update DID retain my original Apps (both free and purchased); for some strange reason it DID recognise and permit me to run Nuance's OmniPage 18, but once again required my other Nuance products to be re-registered/activated; and my
 Microsoft Office 2013 Pro once again opened with the warning that "Office has detected a change in the hardware of this device and this product must be re-activated". I cannot understand why an up-to-date version of a Microsoft product sees thus build as "new
 hardware", yet this has now happened to me twice after upgrading via two different methods.<br />
<br />
The Start Button in this build is not "nice"! (I can currently not get the latest version of Classic Shell to work with Build 9926)

    <title>Windows7 - Outlook data file location&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows7 - Outlook data file location&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just installed Windows7 and have installed Office 2003 (yes, it's old, but I'm retired so no longer need more sophisticated version).&nbsp; My only problem is that I need to move my Outlook data files (I believe, that is Outlook.pst)&nbsp;stored by Outlook2003 &nbsp;under
 WindowsXP to my new Windows7 system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there other Outlook2003 data files (for contacts, tasks, calendar, etc.?&nbsp;&nbsp; And, where are those Outlook data files stored under Windows7?</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone who can help.</p>
