<p>Hi there FiveStar EVO, sorry to hear that your stick deleting Xbox Content, I also have Grand Theft Auto V on USB drive.</p>
<p>Try another USB drive, if everything will be fine so problem is your "Deleting Itself" stick.That will mean that your stick is broken or not compatible with Xbox 360 no matter what Xbox USB check message says.Try to use another drives or SanDisk Xbox 360
 USB 2.0 Stick - it's official Xbox 360 16gb drive. I have SanDisk Cruzer Blade 16gb and it working fine with my Xbox.</p>
<p>Hope that will help you and you will be able to play soon.</p>

<p>So it sounds like it is incompatible</p>
<p>Alot of people find pny drives not to work too well with xbox units</p>
<p>Kingston or SanDisk or Lexar tend to be better there used to be a compatibility list for USB drive in the old forums but those are gone</p>
<p>Remember not all USB drives are created equal</p>
<p>Paying for a better quality drive saves you money and time</p>

            Hi Jimmy, since the reset is not completing successfully, a clean installation of Windows 10 would probably be your best option . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers
<br />
<br />Click this link:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br /> to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD
<br /> 
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS, go into your BIOS and make the following changes:
<br />1.	Insert the Bootable Media
<br />2.	Disable Secure Boot
<br />3.	Enable Legacy Boot
<br />4.	If Available enable CSM
<br />5.	If Required enable USB Boot
<br />6.	Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order
<br />7.	Save BIOS changes and restart your System

            Hi Jimmy.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If Reset doesn't work from Windows, you should try it from bootable media which is more stable and doesn't depend on possibly corrupt onboard files.  
<br />
<br /> First create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />In the Troubleshoot options choose Reset.
<br />
<br />If it fails then do the gold standard Clean install here which has no reported problems from hundreds of thousands of users and is better than any amount of money can buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>&lt;Original title - Span settings in Windows Live Mail &gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my email is received by my service provider my spam directions&nbsp; are followed. As what is considered spam and what is done with it. When my email is downloaded to Windows Live Mail allot of address are marked as spam that should not. There is no reason
 for them to be marked as spam such as Facebook.com and other very common addresses. These addresses that are marked as spam are also not sent to my junk mail file like I have marked for all spam to go. I don't want to change the service provider settings as
 everything is working right there, it's not until the email download to Windows Live Mail that the problem starts. I have double check my spam settings there also. Does anyone know why this is happening. I am running Windows Vista 64 Home Pro, Internet Explorer
 9.</p>

            Hi, I did not make any changes to my email account and I don't get error messages. But I did notice this started to happen when I bought a new computer that runs Windows 9. At this time all&nbsp;I did was transfer my contacts. &nbsp;But I did go back both in Webmail
 and Windows Live Mail to check my settings in these accounts.

<h2>            &#34;Microsoft Automap Streets Plus 1997&#34; compatibility problem</h2>
                    I have an authentic Microsoft CD with the original software key which I have been able to&nbsp;install on my former PC with Windows XP Professional in compatibility mode.&nbsp; I have been able to get it to run twice on my new computer with Windows 7 HP.&nbsp; I want
 to get it set up to run with the CD when it is inserted.&nbsp; I keep getting a little window that says "Run the Setup.exe".&nbsp; I'm going around in circles.&nbsp; Can anyone out there tell me what to do?

1) I was trying to use the compatibility mode (tried both Windows 98 and Windows XP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 &amp; 3) It brings up the program screen and goes through the installation process, but, when I try to run it, it tells me (in a small window) to "Please run the Setup.exe to install this product.&nbsp; I got the program to work two times last week but I cannot
 get it to work again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I clicked on the above link, it took me to a website to download and install the software for "Windows XP mode in Windows 7".&nbsp; However, the system requirements include the statement, "<span>Make sure you're running
<span>Windows&nbsp;7</span> Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate."&nbsp; My operating system is Windows 7 Home Premium.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; Please let me know if you have anymore ideas about how to do it.</span></p>

<h2>            MBSA Offline Scan WSUSSCN2.cab Released In June 2016 Not Working</h2>
                    I've downloaded the latest wsusscn2.cab file from&nbsp;http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=74689 which was updated on Patch Tuesday or June 14th this month (file size 167,909 KB). I then place the wssuscn2.cab into the "C:\Users\&lt;current user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\MBSA\Cache"
 directory. I've run a MBSA offline scan using MBSA 2.3 by selecting only "Check for Security Updates", "Advanced Update Services option", and "Scan using offline catalog only" in the "scan a computer" option. I've been doing this for over a year without a
 problem. Currently it appears the wsusscn2.cab file is broken because a completed scan does not report any of the patches released on June 14th as missing even though they are.&nbsp;

<h2>            Resetting Windows 10 for return of new computer</h2>
                    During a troubleshooting session with Dell, the tech had me reinstall Windows 10 and wipe all files and programs.&nbsp; I then re-entered my name as primary user.&nbsp; Now I must return this defective computer to Amazon for replacement.&nbsp; How can I remove my user
 name and its requirement for&nbsp;my password from the sign-on screen?&nbsp; I've already retried the Windows reset procedure, but I get a message that there&nbsp;was a problem and that no changes were made. Help!&nbsp;

<p>Hi Missy,<br />
<br />
The easiest way to make a copy of something is to take a snapshot of your screen by using the Snipping Tool. You can use it to save and share news stories, movie reviews, or recipes. To access the Properties and set a shortcut key for the Snipping Tool, you
 can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>key.</li><li>Type <strong>Snipping </strong><strong>Tool</strong>.</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the <strong>Snipping </strong><strong>Tool </strong>
result, and click <strong>Open file location</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on the <strong>Snipping Tool </strong>shortcut, and click <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

<h2>            Old games from Windows 95&#47;98 not fullscreen</h2>
                    I was just wondering if there is any way to play old Windows 95/98 games in fullscreen instead of just windowed. &nbsp;I tried using alt + enter and that didn't work is there any other buttons that i have to use. &nbsp;

            I'm well aware of that but they put better support towards using older apps and games. &nbsp;As said the only problems with using the old 32bit apps is that they fit into a window instead of fullscreen. &nbsp;So therefore I am looking for an answer that will tell
 me how to get these old apps to work fullscreen on Windows 8. &nbsp;There probably isn't a way to get them fullscreen but its worth waiting for an answer.

<p><br />
That sounds like running DOS programs under command.com in its non-windowed mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I just did a search for&nbsp; command.com&nbsp; and it appears that there isn't one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even see one in my W7 partition so looks like this is not new with W8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect the best you could do is install Win9x as a virtual machine and run your games in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I was running old Windows programs they are cropped in a small Window. &nbsp;I guess they are being run from Command Prompt not to sure how they are being run. &nbsp;The games I have been running are Rayman 2 and Troy 2000.

In that case, you should be able to change its Properties.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. press Alt-Space, P</p>

            Yeah I wish that would help. &nbsp;I believe that a lot of old games are using some sort of emulation which is built into Windows 8. &nbsp;I wish Microsoft would give us more options then using a fullscreen cropped Window to play the game. &nbsp;The reason why its a
 problem is that some of the game screen is cropped and that is a problem for some games where you need to see what your doing or its game over. &nbsp;I know that Microsoft may not care about this cause they are old games but if they made the options to play these
 games they should expect questions from customers.

<h2>            How to tell Windows to stop bringing my machine to its knees&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Windows thrashes my hard drive, sucks up all my cpu cycles so my machine shuts down due to thermal overload. Is there a program out there that will diagnose my system and tell me which services to disable? I can see it's running some kind of host.exe service.
 Also, is there a way to do this without becoming indoctrinated into the Windows continuum (I just want to use the computer)? I have Avast and I think Mcaffee is running and I guess Windows has its own anitvirus. Maybe it's a virus or is it the virus called
 Windows :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I'm trying to get my PC to boot Linux.</p>
<p>thank you!</p>

<p>I'd bet it's the anti-virus that is bringing your machine to its knees. Uninstall both McAfee and Avast using the specialized tool from their website or use the universal tool from eset:
<a href="https://support.eset.com/kb146/?locale=en_UShttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
av remover tool</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>https://support.eset.com/kb146/?locale=en_US</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let Windows Defender do its thing on its own. Or use it with malwarebytes anti-malware (turn off realtime protection and just use it for an on-demand scan once a week or so). Eset Security has a good online scanner which can be downloaded and just run on-demand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course your computer's problems may extend beyond this but give it a try and get back to us.</p>

<p>Well, I've been trying all the things posted in the article but it still doesn't work. I'd like to turn of the "Windows System Protection background tasks" because that's what seems to be thrashing my hard drive all day long. I would like to turn off the
 Windows antivirus/protection software so I can run my own third-party software. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But Microsoft has me held hostage: I either run Windows (which brings my machine to its knees) or not use Windows. Microsoft has a monopoly on the operating system market. There's no other choice! I wish people would put an end to the Microsoft monopoly.
 I suppose it's because Microsoft has the Congress in its pocket.</p>

            The advice was "<span>Let Windows Defender do its own thing". That's terrible advice. I think it may be Defender that's the problem, not the solution. Also you said "</span><span>I'd bet

<h2>            Zoo Tycoon 2 Zookeeper collection won&#39;t install</h2>
                    My Zoo Tycoon 2 Zookeeper collection won't install. At first, I click install. Then it installs a little bit, then stops at C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon 2\x151_000.z2f, continuing to install on the same file. When I put in Disc 2, it stops
 at one point and says, "Error 1305.Error reading from file E:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon 2\x151_000.z2f. Verify that the file exists and that you can access it." Then when it reaches the end, it has the same message continuously, not installing.
 Then a couple more tries later, I click cancel. What do I do? <br />

            Dear Irfan,
<br />
<br />A 65W power supply can be used with Surface Book, Surface Laptop, Surface Pro, Surface Pro 4, and Surface Pro 3. Furthermore, a Surface Book power supply unit that's capable of 102-watt power supply is also available for purchase for users to quickly charge the Surface Book.
<br />
<br />A 39W (SB2 i5) 95W (SB2 i7) power supply can be used with your first generation Surface Book, and vice versa. However, we recommend that you use the dedicated power supply for each device to ensure longer battery life. Your Surface is designed to work best with the power supply it came with. For more information check out the link below

            <p>Hi Marian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Are you referring to hidden files in the computer or hidden windows?</p>
<p>2) What happen when you click on Window?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although you usually can't see a hidden file, it's an ordinary file in all other respects. You can choose whether a file is hidden or visible by changing its properties</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Right-click a file icon, and then click <span>Properties</span>.</div>
</li><li>
<p>Next to <span>Attributes</span>, select the <span>
Hidden</span> check box, and then click <span>OK</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to run the below mentioned commands in elevated command prompt and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> and <strong>X</strong> at the same time.</span></li><li>
<span>Choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li>
<span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: </span>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This command is used to check if an image is repairable. Scan the image to check for corruption. This operation will take several minutes.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This command is used to repair an image.

            <p>This answer was not helpful, but I ended up calling HP Tech Support about another issue and it turned out that several of my drivers were corrupted or not working. Whatever they did about the drivers seems to have fixed my problem with the windows, at least
 so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I was trying to say was that when I was working with two or more windows open on a screen (e.g. documents and possibly also a window showing contents of a folder) and trying to move from one window to another, the norm was for whatever document I clicked
 on to come to the fore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the problem was that those windows that were partially hidden by another open window, were no longer coming forward if I clicked on them.&nbsp; I had to close, move or minimize the window in front in order to work with the other windows--which
 was not at all user-friendly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad it seems to be fixed now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Anil &amp; Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I replied too soon, because the problem is back. So it looks like whatever the tech people did regarding the drivers in my computer, it did not fix this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, this is what the problem is:&nbsp; when I'm working with two or more windows open on a screen (e.g. documents, internet, windows showing contents of a folder) and trying to move from one window to another, the norm was for whatever window I clicked
 on to come to the fore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that those windows that are partially hidden by another open window, do not come forward if I click on them.&nbsp; I must close, move or minimize the window in front in order to work with the window I need. This takes up extra time, makes tasks
 much harder and is not at all user-friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marian</p>

<h2>            Strange Folder Names on my data drive &#40;E&#58;&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong><u><em>Strange Folder Names</em></u></strong></p>
<p>I have 3 physical drives on my system. C is what you would think it to be. D is dedicated to iTunes. E is a general data drive. I am running Win 7 Home. Lately, I am seeing folders on the E drive only with strange names such as: 9f13dc58d6bd3991eacd70900721b273.&nbsp;
 There are many such files. What is going on here and what is the remedy?<br />

            <p>What is really ridiculous is that the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer alleged "expert" doesn't seem to know what to do about these mystery folders...&nbsp; do you just keep letting them accumulate on your system for a few years?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of explanation/expertise is that?</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>
</p><p>When some programs (including Microsoft programs) install things, it may create a temporary folder consisting of 20-30 random letters and numbers or random numbers and letters in the root drive of the volume with the most free space.<br />
<br />
This explains why sometimes the folders are on your C drive or on some might be on another drive - which one has the most free space?<br />
<br />
For example you may see a folder similar to or called:<br />
<br />
D:\9470bb12e8a4f3447657236478e41c5<br />
<br />
There may be other folders and files under that main temporary folder such as amd64 and i386.<br />
<br />
These should normally be removed when the installation is complete, but sometimes they are not - especially if the installation fails.&nbsp; They are harmless but annoying.&nbsp; You may think something is wrong when there is not or be afraid the files are really needed.&nbsp;
 To avoid confusion you can delete the temporary folders.<br />
<br />
If your installation failed or the installation does not delete the randomly named folder when it completes running and you run the installation again, the installation again will make another randomly named folder.&nbsp; Sometimes you will see several folder like
 this and they can all be deleted.<br />
<br />
You may be able to identify the installation (for curiosity) by looking at some of the folder contents and decide if that installation was okay, just delete the files/folders.&nbsp; If the installation did not work properly for some reason, running the installation
 again will just create a new randomly named temporary folder so the old temporary folder is really of no use.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the folders are stubborn to delete.&nbsp; Even if you are an Administrator on the system you may get a "sharing violation", "access denied", "being used" or similar type message when trying to remove the temporary folders.&nbsp; Installations sometimes use
 different permissions than a regular user with Administrator group might have.<br />
<br />
There are many methods to try to remove the folders and some involve third party programs to install or changing certain Windows settings that may compromise your system security if you don't change them back when you are done.<br />
<br />
Booting your system in Safe Mode (pressing the F8 key repeatedly right before Windows loads is a good first method to try and remove the folders since it doesn't involve making any changes to your system configuration or downloading any third party programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the above work, try a popular third party tool called Unlocker.&nbsp; Unlocker will work for any version of Windows.<br />
<br />
Unlocker can be downloaded from here (may get a security warning):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/</a><br />
<br />
You may need to use Internet Explorer to get Unlocker to download properly.<br />
<br />
Do not be tempted to download or install any other software that promises some miracle on your system.&nbsp; Just download the correct Unlocker for your system (either 32 bit or 64 bit).<br />
<br />
<strong>Pay attention</strong> when installing Unlocker since it wants to add a bunch of options, addons, shortcuts, and other extras you don't need so be sure to
<strong>SKIP </strong>and <strong>DECLINE </strong>any free things, or other checkboxes for example:<br />
<br />
UNcheck the box to install the Babylon Toolbar and click Next<br />
UNcheck the box to Check for Unlocker updates<br />
UNcheck the box to install the Unlocker Assistant<br />
<br />
DO check the box to install the Explorer Shell extension (you are going to need that)<br />
<br />
Click Install, you do not need to reboot.<br />
<br />
The reason you need to add the Explorer Shell Extension is so when you right click on the offending folder, you will have an Unlocker option to choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explorer Shell Extensions help make up the right click menu when you look at a file or folder.<br />
<br />
Right click one of the offending folders and choose Unlocker, then choose the Action (that would be delete) and click OK and you should see a Success message and the folder should be gone.<br />
<br />
I would just install Unlocker long enough to clean up those leftovers and then, I then generally use Add/Remove Programs to uninstall Unlocker and all parts of it.&nbsp; You can always install it again some other day if you need to.<br />
<br />
Unlocker can be uninstalled when you are finished using it.&nbsp; A good idea since you can install it again if you ever need to in the future.<br />
<br />
Reboot when you are finished to be sure the annoying folders are really gone. </p>

<h2>            Windows Update error 80072EE2 and Cannot connect to Any Content servers on steam.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Cannot connect to Any Content servers for Windows Updates (Unknown Error 80072EE2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HI I'm getting the above error (80072ee2) when trying to download Windows Updates. I have gone through all the existing forums etc, and tried every fix (Connecting to router directly, changing proxy settings, making sure the McAfee Firewall settings are
 suitable, etc, etc) I've tried it at different times of the day, I've pretty much done everything I can think of, and everything that seems to have worked for other people... One thing that I find 'Interesting' (Read - Pain in the ****) is that I am having
 a similar problem with Steam games programs - there is no connection to any content servers... Everything else seems to be running fine, the speeds are good, I can download other things, and streaming from sites such as ABC iView etc work perfectly... I hope
 someone can help. Thanks, Troy</p>

    <title>My Xbox one AND computer think i&#39;m a child&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cashoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Xbox one AND computer think i&#39;m a child&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ever since yesterday, my family's Xbox One has been acting odd. It thinks i'm a child. I can't log in without it telling me to get an adult to get me set up. I assumed it was referring to the Family settings. But here is the thing: There IS no family. I
 just got a random email saying I was removed from the family, and that's it. The only "family" is me, my sisters (including me), and my brother. Just random accounts put on the system with no family settings. I tried removing my account (which actually worked),
 but it would ask me for adult permission if i wanted to log in again. I tried re adding myself, but it said the email was still on it. I can't remove it (and i went into my brother's account to do this, so don't just tell me to get an adult). This also carried
 on to my laptop. Family settings locking the only browsers I could use (Chrome and Firefox), and asking for parental permission to open the browsers. I try sending an email, but it says something went wrong (i also tried adding myself as an adult but to no
 avail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to sum it all up:</p>
<p>- XBox One won't let me log in because i'm a child, apparently</p>
<p>-Microsoft family features won't **** off (and i can't turn it off)</p>
<p>-Parental permission being asked for even though i am old enough to access mature content on the xbox one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Note: </p>
<p>Windows Live Essentials isn't on my computer or can't be found on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried to bypass it on my computer by going to a local account, but nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sick and tired of using the terrible default browsers that Microsoft is forcing on me.&nbsp;</p>

            0x80073712 means Windows update engine is damaged.

<br />Try doing a repair install. A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.

            Hi Elliot.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's a lot of turmoil with Windows Updates right now, with problematic Updates being withdrawn and updated while a half billion PC's are being rescanned constantly to sort each them all out.  So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give it a few weeks to sort itself out. 
<br />
<br />If it is interfering or you don't want to wait then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:   <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Windows%2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search....</a>
<br />
<br />If Updates cause problems you can find out which one by checking at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and uninstall them there.  
<br />
<br />You can block Windows Updates and Version Updates:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-unwanted-windows-updates-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-unwanted-wi...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install this tool to tell you exactly your level of protection needed for the CPU threat that has lately caused some disruption, how it may affect performance, and what you can do about it:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You can get more control over Windows Updates with some new features in the last two versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update under Restart Options and set Active Hours when you don't' want to be bothered.
<br />
<br />As a last resort, you can set a Metered Connection or disable Windows Update service and only install the Version Updates twice a year when you are ready via the most stable method - which isn't Windows Update anyway, but by running it from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  All previous Updates are rolled up in the Version Update.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>How to enable GUI boot manager in Windows 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to enable GUI boot manager in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I dual-boot my PC due to one online game that is not supported on Windows 8.1 with Update.</p>
<p>I've decided to install Windows 8.1 and Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I install Windows 8.1 before Windows 7. I change my default OS to Windows 8.1 rather than Windows 7.</p>
<p>Second, whenever I boot-up my PC, still, the legacy boot manager appears on my screen even though I set the default OS to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Third, I tried to edit it in Command Prompt (Admin) by typing&nbsp;<em>bcdedit /set {default} / {current} bootmenupolicy standard</em>. But, I'm still seeing the legacy options. I also tried to change the display order by listing first Windows 8.1 and Windows
 7 as the second option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I enable the GUI boot manager and even the Advanced Startup Option?</p>
