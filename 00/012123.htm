<h2>            How do I view emails sent and received in September&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I view emails that were sent and received back in September? In fact any emails, I can only view email from 7/10/14 to date! &nbsp;I've tried searching in the search box and the emails I want don't appear. &nbsp;I've tried the 'go to' button at the bottom by
 the page number bit and yet again it doesn't work. &nbsp;It still shows me email from October even when I click on the September month button. &nbsp;I know I have not deleted the emails I want. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be quite frank I just want to delete the account, it's a load of rubbish and certainly not easy to use! &nbsp;Take me back to the old hotmail style account! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful of any help as to how I can view emails before October 2014!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            There is a setting one may set to keep all sent emails.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As no system is fool proof without error; one can always consider this option -- <br />
<br />
For every email you send out, one may CC or BCC to yourself so you will always have a record of your emails.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have always done the later option since I have had issue of lost email that was to be kept (2006).<br />

<p>I have had same issue since yesterday. I can open Feedback Hub and I see that I am sign-in, I see announcements, my profile and quests, but I can't see any feedback. I get same error message as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click FB link in some thread I get this error message:</p>
<p>"Your account doesn't have access to this feedback".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have test this with 3 PC's with builds 17134, 17763 and 18252 always with same errors.</p>

<p>Yes, those are accounts all verified and as I wrote 3 different PC, 3 different build s and two of those have been receiving previews for a long time.

</p><p>I find on Tuesday that there is problems&nbsp; in getting to FBH. With many attempts to follow links posted to this forum I have got only two successful attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not only one who seem to have problems with FBH.</p>
<p>

<p>Feedback Hub is working better. FB app in start menu is working, random failures while using posted FBH links.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Usually means:&nbsp; "You're trying to use the wrong Feedback database."&nbsp; So log out of whichever one you were in.&nbsp; Sign in with an account which is "authorized" to use the other one and then Refresh the page which caused the redirect.&nbsp; Since this is an Insider
 forum I will guess that you are currently signed in to the Insider Feedback database and that the link you are trying to use is one that was created by a non-Insider.&nbsp; So, sign out, sign in with a non-Insider account and Refresh the redirect.</p>

<h2>            Figuring hours to Wages</h2>
                    <p>What is the formula to figure out gross wages if I have the hours and the base pay?</p>
<p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Total Time</td>
<td>Gross Wages</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>39:45</td>
<td>423:20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>17:30</td>
<td>186:22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>In the first one, I have 39.45 hours @ base rate of $10.65. It comes out at $423.20, which is incorrect. It should be $420.14.</p>
<p>In the second one, it is 17.30 hours @ $10.65. It comes to $186.22 but should be $184.25.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula I have in the Gross Wages cell is&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>=AD3*10.65&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Please let me know what I did wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>First, 39:45 is not 39.45 hours.&nbsp; It is 39 hr 45 min, which is 39.75 hr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, AD3*10.65 did not come out $423.20.&nbsp; It came out 423:20, which is 423 hr 20 min.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it appears that way&nbsp;only because Excel chose the time format [h]:mm because that is the format in A1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you change the format of column AE ("Gross Wage") to General, you will see 17.6390625 or some rounded form of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, the correct calculation is =24*AD3*10.65, which is some form of 423.3375 when you&nbsp;choose an appropriate format:&nbsp; General, Number, Currency or Accounting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, note that the wages are 423.34 (rounded), not 420.14.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, 17:30 is not 17.30 hours.&nbsp; It is 17 hrs 30 min, which is 17.5 hr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The correct formula is =24*AD4*10.65.&nbsp; And the result is some form of 186.375, not 184.25,&nbsp;when you choose an appropriate format:&nbsp; General, Number, Currency or Accounting.</p>

 all hours worked over 40. In addition, your company policy or state law may require you to pay employees double time for any hours worked per day above a certain threshold. You can create an Excel worksheet that correctly adds the hours an employee has worked
 and test to see if he has earned overtime or double time pay.<br />

    <title>Background in Word 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> monicap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Background in Word 2003</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to create a template for our office to be used as stationary.&nbsp; The others in this office are not computer savvy to say the least, so it must be easy for them to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created the graphic for the stationary (including company logo) in Photoshop and saved it as a .gif.&nbsp; I wanted the graphic to be a background image in the template.&nbsp; When I import as a background image, it comes in much larger than the image I created.&nbsp;
 How to I adjust the size of the background image OR is there a way to insert it as a graphic and still allow others in the office to type over the graphic (right now, when you double click to type, it grabs the graphic).</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>
<p>-Monica</p>

            You need to insert it Behind Text, preferably anchored to the page header. See

            <p>Hello. Officially, there is a minor update that is still 6.1 from LG:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/LG-CT810.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/LG-CT810.jsp</a></p>
<p>Click on the resources tab. If you decide to update, you will have to ask LG for instructions.
</p>
<p>It appears that ATT will not support the update if you have any problems. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB102425&amp;cv=820#fbid=9j7vtm4cdYj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB102425&amp;cv=820#fbid=9j7vtm4cdYj</a></p>
<p>So, unless you are having problems that the "fixes" will resolve, I wouldn't do it. It isn't worth the time to back up the device and rebuild it after the upgrade.
</p>
<p>Unofficially, there are 6.5 custom&nbsp;ROMs available but you do that at your own risk and will void any support from LG or ATT.

    <title>Icons for Favorites in IE11&#47;W8.1 keep disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> assassin 11b3p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icons for Favorites in IE11&#47;W8.1 keep disappearing</h2>
                    <p>As described in the title, I am constantly losing the icons for certain bookmarks in my favorites. I have over 300 favorites in multiple folders, but it's the same 4 or 5 sites that are affected only. Most of them are in the root of the favorites folder;
 in other words, you click on Favorites in the Menu bar in IE11, and they appear at the bottom if the list of folders. Icons do appear in the Metro version of IE, though.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have been using the following set of commands to "fix" this problem, but it's getting worse; I just ran them and 5 minutes later, they were gone again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Open Task Manager</p>
<p>2. End Windows Explorer</p>
<p>3. Run a New Task, CMD.exe, with Administrative Privileges.</p>
<p>4. cd %UserProfile%\AppData\Local</p>
<p>5. del IconCache.db /a</p>
<p>6. exit</p>
<p>7. Back in Task Manager, Run a New Task, EXPLORER.exe</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've seen this issue in Windows 7, 8, and now 8.1. I have recently completed a clean install with 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am using Win8.1 x64 Pro and this issue pertains to the Desktop version of IE11.</p>
<p><br />

            I disabled everything in NIS concerning spam filtering and any disk-related tasks. So far, the icons disappeared only once, but I was able to bring them back using the commands I mentioned earlier and also performing a restart afterwards. Hopefully this
 issue is resolved.

            Hi Marky, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the quick repair, if that does not resolve this, choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .       
        </p>

<br />
<br />Like Dave, I would recommend a repair. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />An additional step would be to run a scan to find and repair files. 
<br />
<br />To do that, you would bring up a command prompt window in administrator mode.
<br />1. In Cortana type Command.
<br />2.You will see Command Prompt.
<br />3. Right-click on that and run as Administrator.
<br />4. Then type or paste the following into the command prompt black box:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />5. Then press the Enter key.

<h2>            N95 8GB Edition Themes&#63; Anybody&#63;</h2>
                    Hi! Just got the N95 8GB edition. Doesn't seem to have any theme functions. Anybody have any solutions? I tried downloading N95 (the normal one) themes to install, but they aren't installing.

            I can use those ones. But I've been trying to use some of the ones I've downloaded off the web. .sis files don't seem to be installing using the PC Suite. Not compatible apparently.

            I think they need to be .sisx not .sis.<br />
<br />
They have to be for the S60 3rd Edition Platform.<br />
<br />
2nd edition won't work.

            It can install Both SIS and SISX files. Don't pay attention to that.<br />
<br />
If you get a certificate error then the problem is with the certificate of the install. You can get around this by changing the Date on your phone to Dec 2006 then try, if it fails keep increasing the date for 1 month. If it still fails then look for another
 theme ;)<br />
<br />
There are 1000s of themes. Any theme that is intended for S60 3.0 should work with N95 8GB, but the quality of some themes out there is not really good. Look for themes that other users have rated as good or that have been downloaded a lot. Even then they could
 be poor.<br />
<br />
Many themes don't fully support landscape mode (rotated screen) and some actually slow down the phone. So keep those things in mind.<br />
<br />
Oh and install the Theme in Phone memory.

<h2>            Web pages not loading under my user account account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, Can anyone offer me some help with this problem?</p>
<p>I have a windows 7 pc and have set up 3 user accounts. (me , wife, Son). I have an admin account.</p>
<p>When using IE8. There are numerous websites that don't load properley or take a very long time to complete. (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/default.stm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/default.stm</a>) is an example. The tab shows
 a revolving circle and often crashes.</p>
<p>If I switch to my Wife or Sons user Accounts then these web sites load instantly. The problems only seem to appear to be on my user account. I can't see any differences in the IE8 options.</p>
<p>I have created a test user account and this seems to work fine but I am not sure if I should simply delete my account that is causing problems and rename the test one to me. Will I loose all my pictures and music under my old account?</p>
<p>This has been driving me crazy for months now. It was not always the case.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Omnia 7 seems to be dying. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonsyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Omnia 7 seems to be dying.</h2>
                    <p>I've had my Omnia 7 for ~1.5 yrs now and for most of the time it has worked fine (give or take a few software failings here and there.) Over the past two months or so the phone has really been suffering (I could probably say ever since I upgraded to Mango)
 - the battery life is terrible, the phone will stutter or freeze for a few seconds, it will fail to open hubs or apps (it will hang for a few seconds and return to Start), connectivity will fail&nbsp;and lately the phone will reboot randomly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a new battery for the phone (from Samsung, it is a legit battery) a fortnight ago and that has ameliorated some of the battery concerns (probably only because the old one had lost some capacity) but even still the battery life is
<em>worse</em> than when it was new - I used to use it to listen to music, if I dared try that now the battery would be dead before the day was half up. The software is still suffering though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Particularly bad is the connectivity - both cellular data and WiFi are unreliable. For no apparent reason both will take it upon themselves to stop working, often for minutes at a time (sometimes to get it working I need to disable the phone radios or reboot
 it). Originally I chalked it up to bad connection (esp. for the cellular, my carrier Optus isn't brilliant) but it can't be. I have had brilliant reception for the WiFi and been using another device connected to the same source and it has worked fine but the
 phone fails to do anything but time out. The cellular must suffer similar woes as I have seen many people in my vicinity in public enjoying the benefits of mobile internet, some of whom must also be with Optus, but my handset times out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do really like the Windows Phone OS but this, along with the terrible update schedule and lack of enthusiasm for the brand by Microsoft, is really driving me towards picking up a nice new Android handset at my next opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably worth mentioning is the phone has suffered very little physical trauma&nbsp;- nothing that would damage the internal components, the cosmetic damage is very minimal in itself.</p>

            <p>The Samsung phones are the ones with the most problems it seems. I have only had HTC and Nokia phones and I am very satisfied with both (even in terms of battery life). So if I can make a recommendation for a future WP phone, I would recommend Nokia. The
 build quality is just awesome and they update their firmware when problems are found. So don't let one phone from Samsung drive you away from Windows Phone, if you like the platform.. Not all phones behave like that..</p>

<h2>            External Email Addresses and how to apply to shared mailboxes&#47;distribution Lists</h2>
                    
<p>Hey All,</p>

<p>I've got an issue with a client that has recently migrated to Office365. &nbsp;He uses external parties and they manage this support and feedback mailboxes. &nbsp;However, I'm trying to think of a smarter way of working this and the research on the net is kinda sketchy.</p>
<p>At the moment the support@ and feedback@ are E3 mailboxes. &nbsp;However, he doesn't wish to pay for them when his trial ends. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've read that if you add the external party to the contacts then you should be able to add them to a distribution list. &nbsp;I've been unsuccessful in this so far. &nbsp;</p>

<p>All we need is a rule / list where identified people (both internal and external) are forwarded the necessary emals. &nbsp;Help please1</p>

<p>Hi Miles,<br />
<br />
According to your description, my understanding is that you want to add those support@ and feedback@ mailboxes without paying during the trial period. Based on my experience, you could add these mailboxes as shared mailboxes which don’t need licenses and you
 can give other users the permission to access the shared mailboxes and forward emails to those shared mailboxes. You can refer to the article below to create shared mailboxes and assign the required permission.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-shared-mailboxes-in-Office-365-871a246d-3acd-4bba-948e-5de8be0544c9?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-shared-mailboxes-in-Office-365-871a246d-3acd-4bba-948e-5de8be0544c9?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a></p>
<p>Then users will the required full access permission can access the shared mailboxes in OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) and Outlook clients.<br />

<p>yep I got all that thanks and thanks for re-affirming that - but, its the accessing these mailboxes from an external email address. &nbsp;I read somewhere that if you add them to your contacts in the O365 interface then it would be possible but when creating
 even a distribution list they are only looking at registered 0365 users.... any ideas?</p>

<p>hi miles,<br />
<br />
thanks for your reply.<br />
i would confirm whether your requirement is to let an external contact to receive emails sent to an office 365
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-sg/library/bb124513(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
distribution group</a>.<br />
if so, you can add the contact as a <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998858(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mail contact</a> in office 365 eac (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a>). then when creating a distribution group, you can add the contact into the distribution group so that the contact will be able to receive the emails sent
 the distribution group.<br />
<br />
if your requirement is not the same as above, please provide us with more details and the detailed screenshots of the steps you have tried.<br />
to upload screenshots in the forum, please click use rich formatting under the reply box and then click the insert/edit media icon.<br />

<p>I had a response from another group whereby if the individual was in the contacts then they could have a mail forwader set up by the MAIL FLOW settings under Exchange, &nbsp;I had no luck with adding external parties to distribution groups but, with mailflow
 under exchange it worked and seems fine. &nbsp;I just need to make sure I can add more than one person.</p>

                    <p>I'm a Windows Insider and I notice sometimes Windows or Microsoft Update will not find an update even when there is one. &nbsp;I've twice resorted to downloading Windows Insider by other means (seeking an ESD file, decoding it, converting it to an iso).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What does half this gobbledigook even mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The purpose of the Windows Insider Program was to allow users to try pre-release builds of Windows 10 before they reached the public, as a means to identify problems and help guide MSFT to smooth out the rough edges.&nbsp; In that light, yes, our job
<em>is</em> to present issues with things like unsuccessful upgrades--if something goes wrong, telemetry goes to MSFT, who then solves the problem in the builds that ultimately go to the public.&nbsp; "Experiment[ing] on the Win 10 project" is part of it, since
 our subjective feedback on what we like and what we don't helps guide MSFT in some important ways, but the larger concern is fixing issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insider builds are not nor have they ever been recommended for daily use, precisely because they may be less stable and have more bugs.&nbsp; Those builds released via the Fast Ring will by nature have more issues; those released to the Slow Ring will have fewer
 issues, thanks to selection criteria that MSFT has in place.&nbsp; If you object to such issues as are present in build 11082, you need to switch from the Fast Ring to the Slow Ring, so you get builds that are more stable and have fewer issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>trbogt, if you disagree with or don't understand any part of this, you need to leave the Windows Insider Program immediately, since it's clearly not for you.</p>

<p>You posted in a public thread on a public forum.&nbsp; Therefore you were talking to me every bit as much as everyone else present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The telemetry system in Windows 10 has been explained in great detail many times, so I won't get into that here.&nbsp; Succinctly, the information I'm referring to is sent electronically to MSFT over the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agreed with you that using Windows 10 and providing subjective feedback (what I assume you meant by "experimenting") is an important part of the WIP, but that it takes a back seat to the ever-critical task of finding and identifying problems, including
 things like failed upgrades.&nbsp; Something that causes an upgrade to fail takes priority over aesthetics or "experimenting."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an Insider who's used Windows 10 in some form or other since December 2014, so you can be assured that I know exactly what I'm talking about on these matters.&nbsp; As to why you're getting "picked on" in this thread, it's for exactly two reasons:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; You add "hee hee" at the end of most of your posts, making it sound like you're mocking this whole process and all your fellow Insiders with it</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; In an earlier post, you showed clearly that you expected every Insider build to be free of issues, and that you felt the whole point was simply for us to get builds earlier--never mind our proper role as de facto beta testers, a role you've expressly
 said you had no intention of filling</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is troubling to me because in order to join the Windows Insider Program, one must agree to certain terms, terms which specify everything I pointed out, and more...including the use of certain automatic telemetry.&nbsp; Couple that with your statements
 about Fast Ring builds, and it's abundantly clear to me that minimally you don't belong on the Fast Ring, and that more probably you don't belong in the WIP.</p>

                    I had a computer crash.&nbsp; I never received a disk for my accounting program.&nbsp; Since accounting is no longer supported by Microsoft, I am trying to convert to quickbooks, but I need to install the MS accounting software on my system before quickbooks will
 do a data conversion.&nbsp; Can you help?

<p>
</p><p>I did not turn off either program, I bought this computer refurbished, with security already
</p>
<p>loaded&nbsp; (I was told). I would like to have Windows Defender&nbsp;for my security.&nbsp; So if this is possible, to have it turned back on.... I would greatly appreciate it.
</p>
<p>This computer has served me well, as I have gained the skills needed to invest in a new computer</p>
<p>at this time. Because I work from home, security is a must for the various documents that I am
</p>
<p>exposed to, and assigned to work on. &nbsp;I do not take my computer&nbsp;&nbsp;security lightly.

            <p><span>Well… in the current version of Windows 10, Windows Defender should be completely disabled when you install a third-party AV app – but in many cases, Defender hasn’t been getting properly disabled in its registry key, and it's actually being put in
 a state of limbo (half-on/half-off) when another AV app is installed. When this happens, Defender is turned-on to the point where it shows its face (UI) when you try to start it, but turned-off to the point where the service won’t start (Error 8007139f) –
 and it’s turned-on to the point where it asks for definition updates, but turned-off to the point where it can’t install them (Error 0x80070643 in Windows Update). And its service executable also can’t be verified (Error 577 in services.msc).</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_updating/definition-update-for-windows-defender-kb2267602/ea933090-9301-4c27-b915-1d3ba92b301f"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_updating/definition-update-for-windows-defender-kb2267602/ea933090-9301-4c27-b915-1d3ba92b301f</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft has been made aware of the situation through this forum, and although there hasn’t been any indication of progress with this issue, it looks like the Anniversary Edition of Windows 10, which is scheduled for deployment starting August 2,
 will incorporate a mechanism that will resolve this issue. The new version of Windows Defender will never be completely turned off when you install a third-party AV app, and it will allow you to turn on its
</span><strong><span>Limited Periodic Scanning</span></strong><span> feature in the UI with a third-party AV app installed. This new feature will allow you to run any kind of on-demand scan in the Defender UI; and it will also enable the Automatic Maintenance
 scan, as well as the Command Line Utility for scheduling and scripting Defender scans and updates.</span><span> It just won't let you turn on Defender's real-time protection, because that's the component that tends to interact adversely with third-party AV
 apps:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/protect_defender-protect_scanning/limited-periodic-scanning-in-windows-10-to-provide/3dcfc8dd-36b4-43f2-9a0a-732e43191cf3"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/protect_defender-protect_scanning/limited-periodic-scanning-in-windows-10-to-provide/3dcfc8dd-36b4-43f2-9a0a-732e43191cf3</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So with a little luck, the new edition of Windows Defender will both allow you to use Defender along with your third-party AV app, and&nbsp;also resolve&nbsp;any potential&nbsp;issue with&nbsp;it being trapped in a state of limbo. Since the interaction between Windows
 Defender and third-party AV apps will be changing substantially in just a week or two now, some folks might actually want to be thinking ahead when they’re "mulling their options".</span></p>

    <title>Synching --&#62; doubled contacts in PDA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cacohendvm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synching --&#62; doubled contacts in PDA</h2>
                    I have had some issues keeping My Phone as an installed application on my ATT 8525 with WM6.0 OS. So, I unistall the application occasionally and then reinstall it and run a MyPhone session - expecting to upload any changes to my photos and contacts to
 the MS website. <br />
<br />
That seems to happen, however, the MS site senses something amiss apparently for it uploads to my PDA's contacts all the phone numbers it has on file. I then get the wonderful experience of deleting duplicates, one-by-one, from my PDA. that is frustrating,
 takes up memory, requires to reboot. So, I figure I have a setting somewhere on the MS server that I need to change?<br />
<br />
Help appreciated.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Chuck,</p>
<p>You mention that you're running Microsoft My Phone on a PDA -- what kind of device is this? What is the make and model?&nbsp; I'm asking because we have not done any testing on using My Phone on non-phone devices.&nbsp; There may be some compatibility issues here
 that we are not aware of.</p>

    <title>Outlook for Mac Drafts Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac Drafts Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Sometimes when our users save multiple saved drafts in Outlook for Mac, and then later on send one of those drafts, their client will merge two drafts together and end up sending Draft B, with all of the content of Draft B, but to the recipients specified
 in Draft A.&nbsp; In this situation both drafts disappear completely , and as far as Exchange is concerned, only one email is submitted which is the strange merged version, which is then routed as you would normally expect it to be.</p>
<p>The other odd part of this bug is, when we later take a look at these merged messages, the headers look correct, as in the headers of Draft B show the originally intended recipients of that Draft B, and make no reference to the mistaken recipients that are
 'borrowed' from Draft A.&nbsp; We obviously can't do any analysis of Draft A in these situations as Draft A disappears completely.</p>
<p>So if I have two emails in my drafts folder:</p>
<p>Draft 1:</p>
<p>To: Todd</p>
<p>Subject: Hey Todd</p>
<p>Body: Hey Todd</p>
<p>Draft 2:</p>
<p>To: Andy</p>
<p>Subject: Hey Andy</p>
<p>Body: Hey Andy</p>
<p>When I send the first draft in this example, I will end up sending an email to Todd, but it will be an email with the subject line, body and headers of the other draft originally addressed to Andy.&nbsp; The hybrid email will make its way into the "Sent Items",
 the other draft will disappear completely.</p>
<p>It's almost as if the client is combining these two drafts together and then submitting a merged copy to Exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi TerriMiller4236,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed description. I have tried to reproduce the issue in Outlook 2011 for Mac (version: 14.16.1) based on them but failed to do so in the end. Therefore, I’d like to figure out the following details to better understand the situation:<br />
1. What’s the detailed version of your Outlook 2011 for Mac client? As the latest version 14.16.1 has just been released, could you please upgrade the application (Navigate to
<strong>Help</strong>&gt; <strong>Check for updates</strong>) if you haven’t and perform another test?<br />
2. How many users are affected by this issue?<br />
3. Can this issue always be reproduced whenever there are several drafts available?<br />
4. Was the functionality to send drafts separately working fine before from your side?<br />
5. About the example you gave, I’d like to collect the corresponding screenshots and mail header you mentioned for further analysis. To be specific, please provide the following information:<br />
a) Several undelivered drafts with separate recipients, subjects and bodies, etc.<br />
b) The status of draft folder after one draft is delivered.<br />
c) A screenshot of the sent ‘hybrid’ email.<br />
d) The complete mail header of the message. (Please save them in a .txt file and upload it.)<br />
To protect your privacy, I have created a workspace to collect the information. The way to access the workspace is in the private message link below:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>We are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts on this issue.<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have Outlook Mail (previously Hotmail) and up until a couple of days ago everything was working perfectly. Suddenly I stopped being able to scroll down the folders on the left-hand side of the screen using the grey bar. I can't find any other way to scroll
 down either so I can't access some of my folders - yes, I have a lot! I'd really appreciate any help anyone can offer but I'm not very technically minded so an explanation for idiots would be helpful! Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>How do I make the Reveal Formatting box bigger - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rednectar.chris  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I make the Reveal Formatting box bigger</h2>
                    <p>Hi experts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select&nbsp;<strong>View &gt; Reveal Formatting</strong>&nbsp;and then select a paragraph, the formatting is revealed as shown below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a6b6c2a-9936-4f53-a921-35bc85ac88ba?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a6b6c2a-9936-4f53-a921-35bc85ac88ba?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>However, the display box is way too small to show any useful information.&nbsp; I have read&nbsp;that you ought to be able to "<span>simply hover the pointer over the info that is shown in order to have that portion expanded" but clearly
 this was with an earlier version of Word - when I "hover over" either the box dissapears or nothing happens.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I KNOW I can select&nbsp;<strong>Format &gt; Styles</strong>&nbsp;to see the formatting, but that's not the point. I want to be able to use the&nbsp;<strong>Reveal Formatting&nbsp;</strong>feature so I can move to several places in the document to see formatting - and besides,
 what I'm really interested in is to see what variations on a particular paragraph have been applied that are different to the underlying style. (And yes - I know you can use&nbsp;<strong>Show direct formatting guides</strong>&nbsp;to see which parts have been changed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am using MS Word version 19.19 (181109) Office 365 subscription (Mac OS)</li></ul>
<p>

<p>I'm not sure either, but I've sent a message to Jim advising him of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's been no instruction on how to make the dialog window larger because there is no means of doing so provided in the UI. Apparently this is a design issue affecting only those using macOS 10.13 &amp; later. Nobody here can do anything about something of
 this nature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please use the ☺︎ at the right end of a document title bar to report the concern directly to Microsoft development. The feature does permit including a screen shot but the dialog won't remain displayed, nor do I know of any other method of including an image,
 but you can include a reference to this thread. I will submit a bug report as well.</p>

<h2>            How to find a hidden link when opening an Excel file</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open my working excel file which I adopted from another colleague (who left the company many years ago) it appears that there is a link to a mystery file called "CF.xls"&nbsp; Normally Excel asks to "Enable Editing", so I do click on this button to enable
 content. Then, this message appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I checked all possible places for links: </p>
<p>1. Connections - There are no current connections</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Define Names - There are no links to any external source </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am lost... Please help to find the way to trace this link to mystery "CF.xls" file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nick</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I would like to explain that I couldn’t see the error message, you need to upload the screenshot via the following option:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17ab3a99-e727-440f-94bd-cba81bb44a2c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17ab3a99-e727-440f-94bd-cba81bb44a2c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, I need to confirm if the file “CF.XLS” has been deleted, if so, you can’t open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others, I want to collect the following information for further analysis:</p>
<p>1. Where did the file store? </p>
<p>2. The version of Office. (Click File&gt;select Account)</p>
<p>3. Can you open it before?</p>
<p>4. The CF.XLS file’s link, I want to check the link.</p>
<p><span>To protect your privacy, I've sent you a private message </span><span>to collect the information</span><span>. You can access it via
</span><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox"><span>private message</span></a></span><span>.</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;jah32,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia discussions board!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I advise you to perform a soft reset on your device: type *#7780# on the keypad. Original lock code is 12345.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also make sure that the time settings are correct as this may affect the way the messages are sorted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on and feel free to post any other questions you may have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>
