    <title>XBox Live Recurring Subscription - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nukedzergy  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox Live Recurring Subscription</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Today, I turned on my 360 for the first time in months to download and play the Mass Effect 3 demo.&nbsp; It's been so long since I've even turned on my 360 that I hadn't even gotten the Windows Phone-inspired dashboard update.</p>
<p>After playing through the demo, I noticed that I was still a Gold member.&nbsp; Upon checking through the dashboard interface, it turns out that I had been put on a recurring subscription since November of last year.</p>
<p>This was news to me, as the last time I had subscribed to XBox Live, I had purchased a 3-month subscription at a promotional price, then immediately called into XBox Live support afterwards to make sure that I would not be put on recurring billing after
 the 3 months had ended.</p>
<p>So, I called into support again to make sure that recurring billing was turned off for sure this time (including deleting my credit card info from the account to provide further protection against another recurring billing oversight) and to get reimbursed
 for the 4 months (November, December, January, and a pending charge for February)&nbsp;for which&nbsp;I was erroneously charged.</p>
<p>The first customer service rep I spoke to said that he couldn't reimburse the 4 months of charges, so I asked to speak to his supervisor (for ease, this supervisor will be referred to as "Mumbler" for the rest of this post, as it was incredibly difficult
 to understand anything she said due to her low voice and mumbling).</p>
<p>After holding for a while, Mumbler claimed that I had not called in previously to stop the recurring billing, as evidenced by the lack of notation on my account indicating that I had.&nbsp; She said that she wouldn't refund the charges for the 4 months of recurring
 billing, as there were also e-mails sent to the e-mail address associated&nbsp;with the XBox&nbsp;Live account that I&nbsp;rarely check indicating the recurring billing (there was an e-mail dated 10/03/11 notification that the account would be renewed on November 02, 2011
 on a recurring basis and another e-mail notification on November 02, 2011 that XBox Live had been renewed for 1 month.&nbsp; No other e-mails were received re: subsequent months' renewals (December, January, February charges weren't notified)).</p>
<p>After arguing with her for a while re: whether I actually had called in to cancel the automatic renewal (which would also clear me from not having more-actively checked that e-mail address' inbox for any possible renewal notices), I asked to speak with her
 supervisor.&nbsp; She told me that none were available at the time, so I asked for them to contact me as soon as they were available.</p>
<p>She asked for my phone number and my time zone, then was completely silent.&nbsp; I asked if she was going to have her supervisor contact me, to which she answered with a mere "Ok..." which was in an even more muted and mumbled tone than how she sounded throughout
 the conversation.&nbsp; This made me suspicious, so I asked again in explicit words "So, your supervisor will be contacting me, yes?" with the "yes?" emphasized to elicit a response more precise than "Ok...."</p>
<p>She responded "Yes," so we ended the call, and I waited for the response from her supervisor.</p>
<p>After an hour of waiting, I called back into XBox Live support.</p>
<p>Went through another first-level customer service representative, rehashing the basics of my issue with the added bonus of Mumbly's supervisor not having called me back yet.&nbsp; After he said that he, too, couldn't reimburse me for the erroneous charges, I
 asked to speak with his supervisor.</p>
<p>When his supervisor answered, we rehashed the issue again with as much detail as was sorted through with Mumbly before.&nbsp; After holding for a bit, she came back and told me that she had just spoken to Mumbly, and that Mumbly claims that she had made no promises
 regarding her supervisor (which I learned was the person I was speaking to at this point, the "floor manager") contacting me, and that it would have been noted on my account much like how my claim that I had called in to cancel the recurring subscription would
 have been notated on my account if I had made that call.</p>
<p>So, despite my having called in to make sure that my account would not go on recurring billing after the 3-month promo subscription had expired, now support is relying on the same notation system to deny my claim for having done so in addition to my claim
 that Mumbly said that she would have her supervisor contact me.&nbsp; This proves that this notation system that support is relying on to deny my claims can be abused simply by a representative not making proper notations in the first place, despite Mumbly's supervisor's
 claim that the system is "perfect."</p>
<p>Is there anyone else I can speak to, particularly in regards to these charges, let alone the&nbsp;December, January, and February charges which I wasn't even notified about via the e-mail address I rarely check (which I shouldn't have had to check because the
 recurring billing shouldn't have&nbsp;been charged&nbsp;in the first place) before I start disputing charges through my credit card?</p>
<p>I'm really hoping that what the system says about the conversation possibly being recorded is true.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>you would need the reference number from the previous calls</p>
<p>and no there is no refunds</p>
<p>yes the only people who you can contact for refunds is the billing department</p>
<p>generally companies do not refund for past membership you are well past the 30day refund period</p>
<p>if you had takien the issue up within the 30day period then something could've been done with it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>call backs can tend to take 24-72 hours not immediate</p>

as they do tend to be busy</p>

<p>I have the reference number(s).</p>
<p>There are refunds. &nbsp;They even said they do them under certain conditions, one of which is when there wasn't an e-mail sent informing of automatic renewal, which there wasn't in the case of December, January, and February's renewal charges.</p>
<p>The 30-day refund period is an arbitrary term limit - and it's clear they don't operate under a 30-day policy either.</p>
<p>As for the call back - Mumbly claimed to not have promised a call back by her supervisor in the first place (a blatant lie), which means that I wouldn't have gotten a call back at all.</p>

<p>Just called again, and this time, I got Caleb, who immediately announced that he was "close friends" with Mumbly's supervisor, Rachel (I believe).</p>
<p>After going through all this with Caleb again, I got escalated to (you guessed it!) Rachel again, who immediately tells me that she was sitting right next to Caleb as he was speaking to me.</p>
<p>Needless to say, with the two of them being such "close friends," I didn't get anywhere with her the second time. &nbsp;How this is a proper separation of powers in terms of corporate accountability practices is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>They referred me to section 18.8 of the XBox Live Terms of Service, but I'd rather contact my state's attorney general and have them handle this.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>as a matter of fact, we still deploying MSI of classic skype, because Skype 8 cannot be controled by GPO and user interface is not useable for bussiness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some time we were discussing switching to skype for bussines, but since microsoft is discontinuing SfB in favor of teams, we willl most likely need to find some other solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UWP skype is unusable due missing features and GPO control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for deploying exe trough policy, that's bad idea in general, you don't want to run any exe from network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to changes in onedrive client, deploying modern onedrive client for use with onedrive for business is hell lot of pain. if skype aims to be deployed same way, it's another reason to drop skype.</p>

<p>Hey MooreMN,</p>
<p>I'm a product manager for Skype and we're currently looking at what it would take to help solve this problem. Can I ask, what version of Skype you have running for your users? We recently shipped a feature which doesn't show the upgrade prompt for
 users who aren't admins on the machine. I'd like to make sure there isn't a bug and that this is working properly, let me know if that's not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for providing an MSI - we're currently looking at our options. If we provide a script that deploys exes to your users using group policy will that meet your needs?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Can you provide more details as to why it's not a good idea to deploy exe through group policy? We believe using this method may solve your problem of deploying Skype to your users but would like to know if that's not the case.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Shane,</p>
<p>To be more precise, Skype still shows the upgrade prompt for users who aren't admins, however the latest version (8.31) allow users who aren't admins to dismiss the prompt and continue working. Let us know if that's not the case and we'll take a look to
 help unblock your team.</p>

<p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>We're investigating how to best provide a solution for deploying Skype to your users. What are your specific needs? It sounds like you are not using group policy to distribute Skype. Have you thought about using OneDrive and setting permissions to users
 that need to download and install Skype?</p>

<p>We have two situations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Company network:</p>
<p>A Windows domain controller runs there and deploys Skype via GPO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Plant network:</p>
<p>Stand alone PCs without domain integration, Skype gets intalled once manually and should stay up to date without any user action like Windows updates. There are no users available with admin privileges on these sites.</p>

<h2>            Bulletstorm Picked it up today.</h2>
                    
<div>Today i traded in a load of old games and got LA Noire and Bulletstorm (not played it until today). I thought i would have a quick go on Bulletstorm and then go on LA Noire. Loved the story in Bulletstorm so much that apart from an half an hour break for
 something to eat i have played it right the way from start to finish in one go. I just found the game really fun to play after the let down of brink. Going to go onto Xbox live in the morning. I will start LA Noire on Sunday i think. I got Bulletstorm just
 to have something else to play i did not expect to enjoy it this much. Anybody else really enjoy playing it.</div>

<p>You may or may not love LA Noire. &nbsp;There have been some people who hate it. &nbsp;I would turn all clue assists off before starting it and really think about the clue-finding as the fun-factor. &nbsp;Don't just try to get past the crime scenes as if they're part of
 the motions. &nbsp;And interrogations are freaking frustrating sometimes. &nbsp;Read the manual before playing because I guarantee you that you're not going to understand what the "doubt" option really is.</p>

<p>I also think Bulletstorm is awesome. I bought it becuase i found it pretty cheap but didnt know that i would like it this much. I love the dialogue especially when you control the robot and sing the song about Ichi and killer robots. I also loved this exchange"</p>

<p>"You're gonna kill my dick? What does that even mean? ... I'm gonna kill YOUR dick!"</p>
<p>laughed my ass off.</p>
<p>I also bought LA Noire as well. Liking it alot. really cool story telling and i love the searcing for clues. I turned all assists off right off the bat. really cool game.

<p>at the moment it's on offer at Game £29.99 with 1000 (£2.50) extra reward card points. I traded in a load of games so i got 400 points per game on top of the normal trade in points. I also had some points already on the card which took the game down to £19.99.

<p>no worries, all that counts is this game rocks. Though I find that online people dont understand that its a team game and to pass the higher waves you NEED team work. people justrun around trying to kill everythingbefore someone else does.

<p>Is there a list of processors that support the NX bit? Not all processors are necessary, just the first generation of cpu's supporting this bit; so that I know, if I have a later model, i more than likely have a supported processor.</p>

<h2>            Resident Evil 2 Remake Preordered bonus and deluxe dlc not working.</h2>
                    <p>I paided for the deluxe edition. After I started up the game and played then return to the main menu, I saw the dlc costumes then later the option to change disappeared. Cant access the costumes, the bonus weapons weren't in the game, and the option to switch
 to original soundtrack wasn't there. I uninstall and reinstall all dlc and the game but the problem wasn't solved.</p>

            are you sure you bought the deluxe edition? check if you did on your microsoft profile, and if you actually did, you should try delete your profile from your console and log in it again, maybe that will help you

Hi Bennet,
<div><br />
<div>I am facing the same issue. I probably have more details around this. Here are the answers to your questions. Hope you will be able to help:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) I am not able to recollect what is triggering this error. It have come across it multiple times on the 2 Windows 7 laptop I own. This time it was triggered when I was trying to copy something from a web page. However, once it is triggered, copying and
 pasting anything from anywhere to anywhere produces the same result (No print data).</div>
<div>2) As mentioned, I have tried pasting them in word, text pad, html text box, address bar... anywhere.</div>
<div>3) I have come across this issue multiple times. This time it occurred around 5 mins back. There were absolutely no software changes to the computer prior to this issue. In fact I had copied and pasted another piece of information from another webpage
 to Word around a minute before this issue started.&nbsp;</div>
<div>In this particular instance, it started I was trying to copy text from a webpage which had some kind of copy/CTL key restriction. But I do not remember if during all my previous instances that was true</div>
<div>The only fix that is known to me currently is rebooting the machine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please help. Thanks in advance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Ritwik&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Bennet,
<div><br />
<div>Some additional information about the error (it just resolved itself :) !!! ). Not sure if this will be helpful.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>While I was still having the problem, ALL possible methods of copy &amp; paste would not work (including Print Screen). Also, I was not able to open the right click menu on any Office documents (I tried Word and Excel).</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, suddenly the webpage from which I was trying to copy threw this error:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"There was an error on this page.&nbsp;</div>

<p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>R</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard to open the “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>” Command window.</p>

 that, I've encountered issues with the Windows Store updating certain apps and games which had been installed months before and had previously been updating fine. These apps are located on my H: drive (the Storage location for apps is set to H:), which is
 where I have either installed them or moved them to over the months to save space on my 256 GB boot SSD. The error is 0x80070005; I believe this means "access denied".&nbsp;</span><span>I
 cannot say when this issue started as I only noticed it after upgrading to v1607 via the Insider Preview and noticing I was low on disk space (however, I have restored a backup of v1511 and that too has the same issue, unfortunately).</span><br />

 there does not appear to be an issue with the way the Windows Store works when using the default Storage location, which is C:</span><span>.</span><br />

            After using Tweaking.com's Windows Repair All in One v3.9.5 tool in a last ditch effort to fix the error and completely messing up the Windows install (missing taskbar icons for Store, Xbox, Photos, etc, and Edge plus the Store opening and instantly closing),
 I decided to restore my backup of Windows 10 Pro v1511 Build 10586.494 from 14th July 2016. I then tried to move apps and games from C: to H: but got the same error so clearly the issue, whatever it is, was there before upgrading to Insider Preview Build 14393.<br />
<br />
That said, I was able to set the Storage location for apps to H: and download both Forza Motorsport 6 Apex (Beta) and Killer Instinct to the H: drive once I'd uninstalled them. Thinking that I had a solution to the issue, I went ahead and upgraded straight
 to Build 14393 again. But, and it's a big but, I am unable to download those same games to H: under this v1607 build of Windows with Storage set to H: despite it working under v1511! I have been able to download Forza to my C: drive though, once I set the
 Storage location to C: but, again, I am unable to move it back to H:!<br />
<br />
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!<br />
<br />
I did some reading and found that you can move Windows Store packages via Powershell so here's what I tried:<br />
<br />
1. Opened an elevated Powershell window;<br />
2. Typed <strong>Get-Appxpackages</strong>&nbsp;and pressed Enter which then lists all the installed apps and games.<br />
3. I found the full package name for Forza and typed <strong>Move-Appxpackage "Microsoft.APEXPG_1.3.12.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml" -Volume H</strong>: (cut and paste from the listing to avoid mistyping it) and got this error:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>move-appxpackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80070005, Access is denied.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>error 0x80070005: Creating file \\?\H:\WindowsApps\Microsoft.ApexPG_1.3.12.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml</strong></em><br />

Does that help identify what the issue is to anyone who understands it please? I would be so grateful for any help as this is driving me mad. My only recourse at the moment, since a clean install of Windows or even a repair install is not possible at the moment,
 is to buy a larger 1 GB SSD!<br />
<br />

            <p>What I did notice when I briefly restored v1511 of Windows 10 ahead of reinstalling v1607 Build 14393 was that while I was still unable to update apps and games that where installed to H:\WindowsApps, I could reinstall there (with Storage location set to
 H:) after uninstalling them and redownloading them. I started doing this for both Killer Instinct and Forza Motorsport 6: Apex (Beta) but neither completed before the Windows upgrade started (another question is why is the Windows Store so depressingly slow
 to download compared with Steam, Uplay and Origin but that's for another topic, I guess!!!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, post-v1607 Build 14393, again with Storage location set to H: (which it retained from v1511 anyway), I was unable to download either of those games as both would fail with error 0x80070005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That does sound to me like the v1607 upgrade has someone how messed up the settings somewhere since I could redownload them to H: on v1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some reading around and while I am no expert, I understand that Windows assigns a new security ID to the user account with each upgrade/install even if you continue to use the same account. Could these SIDs be the reason why I am unable to move or
 install files to anywhere but C:?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite two threads and hundreds of people having read them, I have yet to receive a single reply, which is depressing since it makes it very hard to know what to do. I've Google-d error 0x80070005 and tried the various suggestions but they all have no affect
 and many of them end up completely breaking the Store and apps!</p>

 steps, I discovered "Microsoft Fix-it Solution Center".&nbsp;&nbsp;Processing the network symptoms in MS Fix-it provided an instant repair for the problem.&nbsp; I still do not know what the exact issue was, but all computers can now see each other on the LAN.

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Flickering while moving items displayed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fcurti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Flickering while moving items displayed</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm asurface customer since one year and some months. Some weeks ago my surface started flickering. In paricular, the screen shifts upper for some pixels at variable frequency (it usually increases) and this not affects the first and the last centimeter
 of the screen. The most important thing is that i noticed that if i stop moving the mouse and leave a static image on the screen (without any little moving item) after 2-3 seconds it stops flickering and restart when I move something again. Of course, as others
 were reporting, I noticed also a correlation with the temperature (or in general the usage). In fact if i leave my Surface 20-30 mins at rest, it stops definitely flickering again for 3-4 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That leads to the second part of my question. If the flickering troubles occurs after some hours and while doing things with it, does the support center (mine is still under warranty) be able to reproduce the issue? Can I attach a video of the issue or a
 written text while describing more precisely (like here) the issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your support</p>
<p>
</p><p>Filippo</p>

<p>Hello Richard,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply. Will contact the answer desk as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I tried all the solutions I found here on the commuunity and I since it was present also during UEFI and during the clean install procedure (also in the surface logo screen) think it's hardware-related issue. Can it also be something related with software
 even if it's present on UEFI and after a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think that can I solve the issue with a software fix?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already opened a support ticket for replacement/repair and waiting to find a good way to pack my device and ship it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps. Yes, during the last months i had troubles with windows hello since the camera not always was able to start can it be something related to that, should I attach some notes about that on my returning device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You!</p>

<p>I just off the phone with Microsoft Support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I been having screen flickering problem since around May 2017 after I did a windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alone the way Microsoft Support offer to replace my surface but seeing how people still having the same problem after replacement, no point.</p>
<p>Other than that Microsoft never really provide any solution for the problem. Disable Hyper V and etc dont solve my problem.</p>
<p>After that somehow after many trial and error of whatever solution I can get, the problem no longer appear for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then now with warranty over, after a windows update last week, the problem start coming back and Mircosoft Support reply is my warranty over, so i should be happy they did not charge me service charge. So i assume now their solution is to drag till warranty
 is over instead of really solving your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So no more Microsoft surface or whatever Microsoft hardware product for me. Not even the keyboard or mouse which I purchase and the mouse after few months of use, the left click did not function properly and even after I get replacement, same problem happen
 after&nbsp; while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you are willing to pay for an expensive Microsoft device that cost a big lump sum only to have it replace after a year (not to mention may require replacement within that one year), please go ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don't be fool by them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just off the phone with them. According to Microsoft support, the only solution they have are</p>
<p>1. Reduce the Resolution to the next level</p>
<p>2. Disable the HyperV</p>
<p>3. Disable two services : Windows Error Reporting Service and Problem Report and Solutions Control Panel Support.</p>
<p>4. On Task Manager and see whether it is flickering.</p>
<p>5. Shut down computer and wait for 15 minutes report start up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these steps if did not solve your problem. They may offer to do one to one swap but is pointless as I see on the forum that problem also happen on the new set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically what I am getting is Microsoft never really bother to solve the problem as this been 6 months plus already and the only solution i am getting is changing setting. They don't even know what the cause of it. I suspect it is hardware issue. So I think
 they will just drag till your warranty is over.</p>

<h2>            Ethernet not Working in Windows 10 after rebooting from Ubuntu Linux</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>I am having an issue with my connection to the internet via my Ethernet port. This issue occurs when I boot out of Ubuntu Linux (which is UEFI Duel Booted) and back into Windows 10. The always on (when the ethernet is plugged in) light occasionally goes
 off and back on (like the Ethernet port is getting reset or if the ethernet cable is being unplugged and replugged back in.) I've had this issue occur once, and that was solved via a bios reset to factory settings. I've tried that, and I've had no luck with
 that method. Linux still works fine with it. I have also tried uninstalling and disabling it, with no luck. (The Ethernet is an Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller) Everything is up to date. If more information is required, please tell me.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update Now WiFi Won&#39;t Work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Now WiFi Won&#39;t Work</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried most of these and &nbsp;nothing &nbsp;has worked. My driver is updated, I have unchecked the &nbsp;box for WiFi to turn off, and I did the admin prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get two different error messages, No Wi-Fi networks found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Wi-Fi 2 Turned off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, &nbsp;it appears that the Wi-Fi is turn3d on but once you click Network settings, you can see it change to off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to fix this. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Burke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to Cumulative Windows Update?</p>
<p>What is the make and model of your device?</p>
<p>What troubleshooting steps did you tried?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;can see a function key combination on your keyboard for turning Off/On Wi-Fi. For example,
<strong>Fn Key + F2</strong>. As per your device use the key combination for turning On the Wi-Fi to see if it makes any difference. Once you press the key combination, give a pause for behavior to take place. I mean, once you press the key combination, don't
 press it again immediately. It will take 3-5 seconds for change to take place. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do check <strong>Airplane Mode </strong>is enabled on your PC. Click <strong>Start /&gt; Settings /&gt;
</strong><strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong> <strong>/&gt; </strong><strong>Airplane Mode.
</strong>The right pane of the <strong>Airplane Mode</strong> you can see a toggle to turn it off/on. Ensure it should be turned off. If not, make it&nbsp;accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it won't work, then try removing the particular Windows Update, which you believe caused the issue.

<h2>            Skype and a Lost Email</h2>
                    <p>I think I already know the answer to my own question, but here goes despite that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted my Hotmail account about a year ago, but I didn't realize I'd connected it to my Skype account. Now I've forgotten the password to my Skype, and since I deleted it, can't reset the password manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way I can get the account back, or is it lost forever?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>

            Hi mitramirshafiee,
<br />
<br />Officially the free upgrade period has ended a long time ago . . .
<br />
<br />Unofficially a lot of users are reporting that if they clean install Windows 10 and then use their Windows 8 product Key they can successfully have the upgrade for free.
<br />
<br />So the only way to know is to try . .. 
<br />
<br />Backup your Data before proceeding . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 8 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Note down that product Key
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />During the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC'
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed in Windows 8
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Once the Installation has completed, go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation and enter your Windows 8 Product Key       
        </p>

            Nope, The free upgrade offer ended a long time ago.
<br />The only way out to avoid hassle is to buy a new copy of Windows 10 from the Store.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />
<br />f you have a PC running a "genuine" copy of Windows 7/8/8.1 (properly licensed and activated), you can follow the same steps I did to upgrade it to Windows 10. To get started, go to the Download Windows 10 webpage and click the Download tool now button. After the download completes, run the Media Creation Tool.
<br />
<br />This article can help you

    <title>Windows 10 Home edition - add user account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexanderayers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home edition - add user account</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to add a user account to a PC with Win10 Home edition, preferably a local account which isn't tied to a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, the PC has an administrator account, which I'm logged into, and an account linked to my Hotmail account.&nbsp; So
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I go to Control Panel, User Accounts, Manage Accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I click the link "Add a new user in PC settings"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; Step 2 takes me to a Settings panel headed "Home"&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list of Accounts options on the left there is an entry "Other people".&nbsp; I mention that because google results for this problem say it should say "Family &amp; other people" but it doesn't</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; I click the "Add someone else to this PC" icon on the RHS of the panel</p>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; This pops up lusrmgr.msc&nbsp; which has a red cross in its centre panel and the message "This snapin cannot be used with this edition&nbsp;&nbsp; ... use the User Accounts tool in the Control Panel".&nbsp; But that of course is EXACTLY what I was trying to to in step 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how on Earth DO I add another account to the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I believe what it is referring to is <strong>Local Users and Groups&nbsp;</strong>which&nbsp;allows&nbsp;an administrator&nbsp;to add users in an environment with multiple machines.&nbsp;It is in the list of system tools under computer management in the Administrative Tools in control
 panel.&nbsp; This facility is <strong>not</strong> available in the <strong>home</strong> edition of windows 10 so you won't see it in the system tools list,&nbsp;that's why you got the pop up.This link may help.</p>
