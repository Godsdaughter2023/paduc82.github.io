    <title>Simultaneous editing of Word 2013 documents on OneDrive&#58; 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Simultaneous editing of Word 2013 documents on OneDrive&#58; 8.1 oddity</h2>
                    <p>I'm working on a number of Word documents with some colleagues, using the simultaneous editing feature for files stored on OneDrive. On Windows 7 machines the document can be opened either from within Word 2013 or from the OneDrive desktop folder (i.e. the
 folder as it appears in OneDrive on Windows Explorer), and once open either way the simultaneous editing works fine. However, on Windows 8.1 machines the simultaneous editing features only works if the file is opened from within Word 2013. If it's opened by
 double-clicking on the file displayed in the desktop app, the file opens but Word gives no indication of whether anyone else is editing the file, and if someone else is editing the file at the same time on another machine, a conflict copy is created on the
 Win 8.1 machine, and Word doesn't attempt to merge the editing of the two files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know whether this is a temporary situation and whether it'll be fixed? The problem is that many, if not most of us have got used to opening Word documents by double-clicking on the file in an Explorer display. Unless you know about this odd change
 in behaviour between Win 7 and Win 8.1 you can easily be driven nuts by Word's apparent inability to do what it's supposed to in terms of editing documents simultaneously across different machines.</p>

</span>Unlike Windows 7, <span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">OneDrive app is an inbuilt feature of Windows 8.1 . If you're signed in with the email account associated with OneDrive, any changes made on the document will be updated at the same time.

When you access an Office application file from within OneDrive app on Windows 8.1, there is no option to view the simultaneous editing when other users are accessing the same file and this is by design in Windows 8.1.<br />

            Hi Wimowo. I'm a fellow Community member here to help.<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear you're having this difficulty. I know it is very frustrating.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development. As such it is lacking many of the features and functions that users have come to know and expect. Several bugs have also been identified.<br /><br />While there is not an ETA, it is expected that Microsoft will be rapidly releasing updates in the very near future in order to add features and functions to Skype and address any known bugs so that Skype can once again be at the level of function that users know and expect.<br /><br />Microsoft has dedicated a site to collecting feedback, feature request, and Bug reports. It can be found here<br /><a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skypefeedback.com</a><br /><br />in the meantime, while it is not recommended to downgrade, classic Skype is still available and Microsoft is p

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Volume licensing is recommended when you need more than 5 licenses. Volume licensing is possible only for 3 products - Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Standard 2016 and Office Standard 2016 for Mac. But these are not updated monthly the way office 365 is updated.

            Volume licensing is handled differently using "KMS" or "MAK" type licenses. This page describes the differences:
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Activate-volume-editions-of-Office-b70a28a9-8257-40ba-921b-7bddd9a0324b?CTT=5&amp;origin=HA102819770&amp;CorrelationId=fb8e3c4e-b9f2-4894-a220-d5e5e2d1e98f&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;ocmsassetID=HA010381834

Yes, volume licensing requires you buy a  minimum of 5 products initially. For the rest of the next year you can buy 1 or more volume licenses at a time. There is a loophole that can work for you.  There are many products on the Volume license list. Some of them are much cheaper than Office. So if you only need one or two copies of Office, you can fill out the initial 5 count (much) with cheaper products.

<h2>            I can&#39;t send picture messages &#40;even after factory reset&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have the Nokia E73 Mode for T-Mobile. About 1 week ago I couldn't send anymore MMS messages.<br />
<br />
The phone "beeped" to notify me that the messages went through. It never gave me an error message or anything either. The people I had sent the picture messages to just didn't receive them. I tried messaging myself and it sent according to the "beeping" noise.
 I just never received my own message. Again, no error message about being unable to send. As far as everything is concerned, it did send.<br />
<br />
At first I thought that I ignorantly installed a theme with a virus or something that made my phone not work as it should. I called T-Mobile and they told me that everything was Okay (signal wise, plan wise, payment of bills, etc). They said it might be my
 phone settings and after talking to them nothing appeared to be wrong.<br />
<br />
I reset the phone to factory settings and I still cannot send any picture messages. I was using another phone in the mean time and I was able to send messages with that other phone (Samsung Exhibit 4G Android Phone). As of now (after the reset) I have not messed
 with any of the settings but I still cannot send picture messages (but I can receive them from other people, just not my own ones that I sent to myself to test if it works).<br />
<br />
Any idea how I can fix this? It's annoying since it began out of no where. I cannot even e-mail Nokia because when I go to their support page, Firefox gives me an error and it can't display it.</p>

<p>I know the settings already. I even went back to reset my Nokia E73 Mode to the factory settings and I still cannot send MMS messages.<br />
<br />
When I call directly to T-Mobile first I get sent to some Indian lady and she's no help, she sends me to a ''higher up'' in the USA and he's no help, and by the 3rd guy he is the "technical" guy, who tells me to remove the battery and turn on my phone again
 -_-<br />
<br />
Nothing is found of course, so they tell me at this point that something is wrong in the area (Their excuse always) and that it would be resolve in 72hours (Which it hasn't been solved)<br />
<br />
The phone can send Sms messages, it can receive mms, but it cannot send mms (it doesn't say fail to send so I'm assuming it's sent somewhere and no one receives it)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10240 deactivated &#38; disabled preview builds after moving VHDX to another Hyper-V host.</h2>
                    <p>I have a serious problem with activation of Windows 10 Pro build 10240 after moving VHDX to other host OS (instead of importing a whole VM). Could you help me?<br />
<br />
I am Windows Insider from the first build available for testing.<br />
Last year, installation of Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview (from official ISO) on virtual machine failed. The only workaround that worked for me was doing an upgrade from existing OS.<br />
I've installed 8.1 Pro with generic key and not activated it. Outrageous! Bad tester, deserves punishment, not a helping hand!<br />
Of course after entering "my" Insider key during upgrade, system activated itself.<br />
<br />
So, I've been using preview versions of Windows 10 (only from WU), including 10240, and everything was just fine.<br />
Of course I have MS Account on that system.<br />
</p>
<p>Few days ago, after suspending new Insider Preview activations, I've <strong>moved only VHDX file</strong> to other Hyper-V host,
<strong>not a whole VM</strong>. And it was a mistake. I haven't checked it before. New VM has other ID and requires activation.<br />
</p>
<p>I realised that I've <strong>lost activation</strong>. Current key ends with 3V66T (so it's OK). After entering it again, I am told that the key is blocked.<br />
I'm <strong>no longer offered with preview builds</strong>, but I haven't turned it off by myself (can't re-enable this option, after reboot it reverts).</p>
<p>Is there a way to activate it again, manually by Microsoft? Or will it be activated automatically after June 29th? What will happen with after-release Insider builds?<br />
<br />
And even more important question - will I be able to test new Insider builds on (the same) VM after June 29th? Or is that restricted to only "early" installations, like 10162, and not mine, that is treated as "new VM"?<br />

            <p>That is like moving a hard disk to a different computer and expecting Windows to remain activated.&nbsp; The other device was never licensed for Windows 10, so
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">will not be activated</span>.&nbsp; Windows is licensed per device, whether physical or virtual.&nbsp; Each VM on the same host PC needs it's own license for Windows and activation will be based on having upgraded from a
 qualifying OS, such as an activated Windows 10&nbsp;Insider Preview,&nbsp;on each VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So once you have an activated VM with Windows 10, you can replace the VHDX file, or wipe all partitions from it.&nbsp; Clean installs of Windows 10 or newer Insider Preview Builds&nbsp;will activate, but you can't replace the VM itself,&nbsp;if you want it to remain activated.&nbsp;
 The VM has become a licensed Windows 10 device, with the ability to clean install Windows 10 with no product key.&nbsp; Changing the VHDX file is not enough of a change to deactivate the VM&nbsp;device as a licensed Windows 10 device.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I've accidentally made a backup copy of that VM file before, so the problem is solved. After moving it from W8.1 to Win10 everything works fine, but VM must remain at legacy configuration version 5.0, not 6.2, to be still activated.</p>

            <p>I am not that familiar with upgrading VM's, but if you were to upgrade that VM with Windows 8.1 installed on it and were able to activate it, you could then upgrade to activated Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Easier is to install and activate an old Windows 10 Insider Preview Pro Build between 9926 and 10130 on a new Generation 2 VM in Windows 10&nbsp;(if you have or can create an ISO for the old build).&nbsp; The 10074 Pro product key was still working for activations
 last week, but only on the older builds.&nbsp; Then upgrade that to build 10240 Pro with the official ISO and rejoin the Insider Program, which is on build 10532, as of today.</p>

<p>That's exactly what I've done last year, but 8.1 were not activated that time - it was just a workaround for my problems with installing first 10 build directly from ISO to empty VM. I've upgraded from 8.1 to 10, using my Insider key (maybe everyone had
 the same key, I don't know).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now I have 10525 on that VM - I've found -that- VM file and restored it, so currently I'm using Insider build on a valid Windows 10 (virtual) device ;)<br />
Of course it's gen2. I was completely sure that pre-release Insider builds can't be activated, after Gabe's statement. Good to know that it's not entirely true and we could make a new VM, maybe I'll try.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am having the exact same issue as apisano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MacBook Pro for work that I had to have repaired. The Apple store did a fresh install of macOS High Sierra for me last weekend. I installed Office 365 and initially it worked fine. But then I got a notice to install the updates released on 3/19/18.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately after installing these updates, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel all froze upon saving a document no matter if:</p>
<ul>
<li>I try to save on my Mac or Online Location</li><li>it is an existing document or one newly created</li><li>performing initial "Save" or "Save As..."</li></ul>
<p>If it is an existing document and I click the save icon in the ribbon, there is no issue which could be because no dialog box pops up to select location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled macOS High Sierra and reinstalled Office 365. Again it worked fine until I installed the 3/19/18 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I also purchased a MacBook Air last weekend, and despite identical macOS and same installation of Office 365 with most recent updates, I have no issues with the same programs on the MacBook Air.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. The version I was using at time of the error was 16.11.1 and I'm running macOS 10.13.3. My office manager called Microsoft support who in turn called me. They instructed me to revert to 16.11 or 16.10 to see if I still had issues.
 I chose 16.10 and this did fix my problem.</p>

                    <p>This is a reply to all those who have have had this problem or is going to have this problem in the future. &nbsp;I don't know if it will work for everyone. &nbsp;But it did work for me. &nbsp;And &nbsp;even if it doesn't work for you it shouldn't hurt to give it a try anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I got this problem solver from one of you. &nbsp;But I don't remember who it was. &nbsp;Whoever it was I want to thank them again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I had to do to solve this problem is to 'select all' text. &nbsp;And go to my font - and select it again. &nbsp;That solved my problem. &nbsp;I haven't had the problem since.</p>

<p>Sorry to be a dummie, but what do you mean by "go to my font and select the font again" ? You mean selecting the font again from the font picker drop-down, that doesn't work for me, not on Word 2016 anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my system the extra space after apostrophe only happens when using the Microsoft Yahei font though.</p>

<p>Actually what really fixed this issue for me is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f48f355-8b55-412c-845e-68b6033e9433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f48f355-8b55-412c-845e-68b6033e9433" /></a></p>
<p>I noticed this problem was not happening in other rich text editors, so I copied the strange "apostrophe &amp; space" character from Word into WordPad, then typed an apostrophe next to it, also in WordPad. At that point I noticed that, even though neither apostrophe
 had a space after it, the two apostrophes looked different, so I figured they were not identical characters. It occurred to me that this might be related to Word's auto-correct feature and, indeed, there is an option that takes care of this. It's the smart
 quotes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>donâ€™t</p>
<p>don't</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative solution, if you must use smart quotes, is to pick a different font. In my case I was using Microsoft Yaheij which was causing this problem. After switching to
<strong>Microsoft Yahei UI</strong> the problem was gone (of course if I switch back to Microsoft Yahei the problem reappears). These two fonts look identical, but the "UI" variant doesn't result in the strange spacing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this can help someone.</p>

            Sorry, this still doesn't work for me. I have this problem&nbsp;ONLY when I change the text direction in a table cell from horizontal to vertical. I have tried the tip above, checked all the language settings, unchecked the default language option, tried selecting
 the word and using Ctrl plus the space bar, and verified that the font is installed. In fact, this occurs with all fonts under the conditions I described above, even the most ordinary ones. I am using Word 2013. And I can't believe that this problem has been
 going on since 2010!

<h2>            Microsoft, why did you remove the built-in Bing Map application for turn-by-turn navigation in WP8</h2>
                    Hi! Just bought an HTC Windows phone 8X and so far I love it!!!!... Except for that I notice that the built-in Bing Maps turn-by-turn navigation application is gone!!!!!!! I know that Nokia is the backbone for maps systems for WP8 but removing a WP7.5
 standard application and making it worse with less options and user-friendly I REALLY don't understand. I had an HTC HD7 and loved it then moved to the great world of WP8 but I really miss Bing Maps app.<br />
<br />
I miss how before I used to open Bing search, did my search and clicking on the answer and then on address and it would give me the turn-by-turn navigation system and just drove!!!!! Now when searching I have the option to press on "Drive" but it directs me
 to choose an app in the Store then tells me that there is no app for that...Sorry no apps found!!!!! What????<br />
<br />
Nokia said that Maps and Drive would be part of WP8 but now it seems that Nokia did provide it to the OEMs and it's them that decides if they will implement it! Would of just made it built-in in the OS!<br />
<br />
Please reply to my email with a positive answer!!!!<br />

            <p><span>I posted my extreme disappointment and conflicted feelings about this on another thread. This is just a horrible experience for those coming from Windows Phone 7.5 where we had this feature built in... albeit not very good. ... and for those migrating
 to Windows Phone 8 considering the criticism that Apple is getting for their maps in 5. So what does Microsoft do? ... no more "directions" let alone "turn by turn"!!! The feeling I got after so much excitement with getting my 8x was like going to the King
 Tut exhibit with my family... having seen all the advertisements for the iconic, golden burial mask. Anticipating this... turn the last corner of the exhibit... "gift shop".... is that it?</span></p>
<p><span>Now... that being said there is an excellent alternative I found (discovered from another post here) that is excellent... available for WP 7.5 as well... for only $5.</span></p>
<p><span>Navigation by gpstuner</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.gpstuner.com/tbt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gpstuner.com/tbt/</a></span></p>

<p><span>That being said... what is missing is the direct integration with Windows Phone 8 maps and the complication this creates for people migrating to WP8.</span></p>
<p><span>I wonder if Microsoft invested any effort in helping companies (other than Nokia Drive and Verizon's VZ Navigator) to implement this API / integration?
</span></p>
<p><span>... so that when I click on the "drive", "use an app" link and... </span>
</p>
<p><span>...&nbsp;get the "Search for app in the Store?" "you need to install an app for this task. Would you like to search for one in the Store?"</span></p>
<p><span>... that Navigation by gpstuner or Garmin StreetPilot or Navigon... are listed as being available?</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>UPDATE</b></p>
<p>Since my original post there has been some major developments. We now have two REALLY nice solutions available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nokia's HERE Drive Beta (free)<br />
</li><li>GPS Voice Navigation ($6.99)<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Also:</p>

            Thanks! I already have that app but like you said it is frustrating that coming from WP7.5 and having a built-in well integrated into the OS is now gone!!!! It look like MS just left Nokia with this part and if you don't have a Nokia phone or from Verizon
 then you are out of luck! It kills me that I do a search in Bing get the info, address, drive (use an app) **** but I need to copy the address or remember it and then open the other application that you needed to download and paste it or write it again! I
 REALLY hope that MS changes that in the near future because I was sooooo proud of showing all the things that WP7.5 could do built-in but now this essential yet simple nice integration is gone!!!!!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been a Windows Mobile user since they came out with the PocketPC and have upgraded to every new device since inception&nbsp;until........Microsoft decided to drop Bing Maps Turn-by-Turn Navigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; My last Windows phone was the HTC HD2 which I specifically
 bought based on the&nbsp;Bing add-on.&nbsp; So even though I bought it based on the feature one&nbsp;day I&nbsp;am driving and needed to use GPS to get back home from New Hamphire and to my surprise Bing navigation no longer worked.&nbsp; No email, no warning, no apologies, nothing
 from Microsoft.&nbsp; Microsoft really blew this one! &nbsp;They&nbsp;decided to drop&nbsp;Bing Maps T-by-T Navigation and&nbsp;the Windows Mobile 6.5 App Store&nbsp; at the same time to move to the new platform.&nbsp; I suspect they dropped the navigation feature to appease Nokia and GM so
 they wouldn't compromise their realtionship with a competing application like Bing T-by-T&nbsp;on the Windows Mobile Phone.&nbsp; However, they had no problem compromisng their relationship with some of their most loyal&nbsp;legacy customers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still hanging onto the HD2 becuase I don;t want to go to IOS or Android but Microsoft has left me no choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they re-introduced Bing T-by-T Navigation into WM 8 I dodn't know if I could ever buy it after the way I feel they treated&nbsp;me.&nbsp; Oh
 yeah, I was considering a Windows tablet at one time also but that never going to happen now.&nbsp; It is just this type of arrogant business&nbsp;decision and lack of concern for their&nbsp;customers that could turn Microsoft into the next Wang or Digital Computers.&nbsp; Whoever
 was in charge of this product transition did a very bad jobb.&nbsp; Very sad Mr. Balmer, very sad what you have done to a once visionary software company!&nbsp;&nbsp; You turned the&nbsp;company into one that now chases Apple and their IOS and at the same abandoned the customers
 that had been keeping you in mobile business in the first place.</p>

Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm disappointed to read your comments about Windows Phone, Windows Mobile, Bing and such.&nbsp; Though I too share the disappointment regarding Bing Maps, A collective decision to move to the Nokia, now called Here Maps, was made many many years ago.&nbsp; The intent
 to collaborate more closely with Nokia was made in the Mid 2000's, with several joint ventures to include mapping data in some of the MS products like MapPoint and Streets and Trips.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though I preferred the touch and feel of Bing, I do accept that Microsoft as a company will proceed and I as a customer will vote with my $$.&nbsp; After being exposed to Nokia Maps in WP7.x, I am willing to see the possibilities with this.&nbsp; I have purchased
 2 WP8's and am happy with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I do, respectfully, question a statement you have made regarding loyal customer.&nbsp; We are now 3 versions past WM6.5.&nbsp; You are still using an HD2.&nbsp;&nbsp; I may respectfully submit that your Mobility loyalty is not quite up to date.&nbsp; This is, of course,
 your choice.&nbsp; There is no right or wrong with it.&nbsp; But the technology is old, outdated and in some cases no longer applicable.&nbsp; I understand your desire to keep a phone you like.&nbsp; No issues there....however at what point can a customer be called loyal when
 no upgrades or purchases are made with newer and better products?&nbsp; Are Windows XP owners extreme loyalists, or, do they simply prefer Windows XP?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tough Question...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, I think the future with TxT maps and voice navigation with Here Maps or any other relationship that Microsoft enters into, is still to be written.&nbsp; I like the phone.&nbsp; I like the way it handles.&nbsp; I prefer it...so I buy it.&nbsp; You may not feel that
 way...we all accept that.&nbsp; </p>

 in IT for over 30 years. They may not update the software, but shutdown, never. Additionally,&nbsp; shutting down the MS App Store for the older versions of&nbsp;MS Mobile devices was like throwing salt on the wound. Though you want to make this about current devices
 and the strategic direction of MS. It is about abiding by a contract and delivering on what you promised and sold and treating the customer experience as your most valuable prize. This was a major blunder in execution as it relates to customer satisfaction.

As it is said, respectfully disagree.&nbsp; Loyalty can be measured in many ways.&nbsp; For someone in the IT industry for over 30 years as you say, the movement from DOS, to Windows 3.x, then NT and finally on to the W95 era, W7 and now W8, all left a trail of disappointed
 loyal and ex-loyal customers.&nbsp; At some point a future direction is determined and path is forged....someone/something gets left behind...its inevitable. I personally feel there is no right or wrong about it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a conversation only a few weeks ago with an ex-loyal Microsoft customer about the product MS Works. He was so disappointed about the decision to drop the product and he indicated he felt betrayed by the decision. As we talked I discovered he still
 ran Windows 3.1 and was talking about the product Works for DOS 1.0.&nbsp; Did he simply find a product that he liked and didn't move....or ???&nbsp; At what point is this loyalty questioned?&nbsp; Not for me to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I am disappointed by the lack of Bing maps and TxT involving Bing.&nbsp; I simply do not care for Nokia Maps.&nbsp; But I a not prepared to announce myself as an ex-loyal Microsoft person over it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I too have been involved in every MS venture from PPC1, right through to WP8.&nbsp; It was and still is my opinion that MS was way off track with WM5, 6, and 6.5&nbsp; They were barking up the wrong trees....my opinion.&nbsp; When I saw the first hints of Windows Mobile
 next..I was determined I would not buy into it.&nbsp; I thought it was wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually someone else thought that too....it was trashed and along can WP7 as we now know it.&nbsp; The focus wasn't Office and Enterprise, it was consumer.&nbsp; I was once again a very loyal
 MS person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the compatible part you speak of is a duh...except for 1 thing....I don't think they wanted compatible.&nbsp; I think they wanted new.&nbsp; And right or wrong, they got new.&nbsp; I think the process right now is NOT sealed in concrete.&nbsp; I think its subject to
 change and re-thinking.&nbsp; I think this is good.&nbsp; Good for consumers, good for me...&nbsp; I love Windows Phone ...I look forward to seeing what comes out tomorrow.&nbsp; I hope it will include Bing....but if not....I'll keep looking forward to it....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I respect your opinion and understand your point.....if you choose to become an ex-loyal Microsoft fan because of it...it would be a shame.</p>

            <p>Phil, Your definition of the word loyal is seriously flawed. Loyalty is not measured by how much money you spend with a company, and it's not a one way street either. If you stick with a company's product for any length of time, that is considered loyalty
 to them. When they tell you that they will no longer support that product, they force that user to question their loyalty.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HD2 may be an old phone as far as it's actual age, but to say that it's technology is old, outdated or not applicable is simply incorrect. As far as I know, the HD2 is capable of (but not limited to) performing all of the following:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make and receive telephone calls SMS messaging, PIM (Personal Information Management) which includes e-mail, calendar and contacts, including a method of synchronization with both cloud and cloudless options, Wi-Fi, Mass storage with file management, Instant
 messaging using any of the latest protocols, Music and video player, Maps with GPS, Calculator, Alarm Clock, Camera/Camcorder, Games, Remote desktop, Tethering, etc etc etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That pretty much sums up what we expect all smart phones to do. Just because a new device comes out that does some of these tasks faster, better or even has some new features that didn't exist on the old phone doesn't mandate the need to upgrade to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 If the user is happy with the product they already have and it performs all of the functions they need it to, there is no reason to upgrade. In this economy, we can't all afford to be upgrading our smart phone every 2 years just to impress our friends with
 the latest and greatest. I'm not in this to impress my friends, I'm in it to have a functional mobile device so that I can get stuff done on the road. If an old device allows me to do it, and that's what I have and prefer to use, then who are you to judge?&nbsp;
 There is a huge difference between a PRODUCT not being supported anymore and a TECHNOLOGY not being supported.&nbsp; The technology here is: Smartphones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with Microsoft is that they keep dropping support for existing, working products or remove features that people use in subsequent versions of their software. In many cases, they don't offer any alternatives to the features that were lost. Offering
 a DIFFERENT way to do something is GREAT, as long as it is in ADDITION to the OTHER ways that were previously offered. There is absolutely no valid justification for removing features and functions that have no bearing on the new ones. As an example, there
 is absolutely NO GOOD REASON why users should not be able to CHOOSE either to use the Metro Interface or the old Desktop with Start Menu. It doesn't hurt Microsoft to leave the choice there... instead, it's abandons the customers that preferred it-- forcing
 them to question their loyalty to Microsoft. Please don't reply with your opinion on that particular feature, I'm not interested in going&nbsp;back and forth about every feature or function that relates to the discussion. It's perfectly fine if you prefer the new
 methods or functions and feel like the old ones are no loss to you. But there are plenty of people that disagree. And it all equates to revenue lost for Microsoft. Bad business decisions. It should be obvious at this point that people would rather have a CHOICE
 of how they do things, not be forced into doing things based on what the manufacturer THINKS is the best way.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main reasons that used to keep users loyal to Microsoft was that very ability to choose your options, and tight integration with other Microsoft products.&nbsp; Pages and pages worth of complex settings and options that let the user CHOOSE how they
 want to experience things.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most common reason a user would switch to Apple was because they didn't want so many options anymore, or were not tech savvy enough to make the choices themselves.&nbsp; They wanted things to be easier.&nbsp; Those who still wanted the
 options and choices stuck with Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Microsoft is slowly punishing those users.&nbsp; The reason you hear them complain about it&nbsp;is because they WANT&nbsp;to continue to be loyal, but Microsoft is FORCING them to switch away because let's face it -- when it
 comes to EASY and LACK OF CHOICE, Apple is still King of the Hill... and probably always will be.</p>

            <p>The Wm6.5 version of Bing maps was the absolute best version ever. Each successive version has been a HUGE step backwards to the point now, that on my HTC 8X, I essentially have NO map functionality and it certainly does not integrate with the other programs..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nokia maps are not available for other manufactures products- such as my HTC. And again, the nokia here maps do not integrate across the WP8 platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore it is a total fail,</p>

<p>Check if you have multiple or a trial version office program installed. If found, uninstall them and try to install office 2010.</p>
<p>Also try booting the system in clean boot mode and try installing office. This is to check if any non-Microsoft services are conflicting with office installation.<br />

<p>Hi Toolman-520,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings. According to your description, the issue youâ€™re experiencing is an expected behavior. External users cannot access the shared calendar due to different calendar formats.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create a free Microsoft account to open the shared calendar(click the Accept and view calendar).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you have any mail apps can open the ics file, you can also click on the hyperlink(this URL) in the sharing invitation email. After clicking the link, an ics file will be downloaded via your browser, you
 can open the file using a mail app.</p>

    <title>iPhone - Hotmail Account does not stay in Sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ik2005  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPhone - Hotmail Account does not stay in Sync</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm hoping someone from the community or MS has a fix for my problem.&nbsp; I've noticed that for a while (intermittently for over a year) my Hotmail account does not stay in sync properly.&nbsp; It will work fine for a while, then every couple of weeks it gets out of
 sync.&nbsp; This does not happen with email accounts from other providers.<br />
<br />
Scenario:<br />
Using the Hotmail/Live.com web interface, I am deleting or moving messages from my Inbox.&nbsp; On my iPhone, the Inbox gets out of sync - meaning moved messages still show in the Inbox or deleted messages still show there.&nbsp; If I try to delete a message that was
 already successfully deleted from the web interface then the message will only go away temporarily and an error message will be shown.<br />
Refreshing the Inbox on my iPhone does not get things back in sync.&nbsp; Only way to get things synced back up is to remove the account from my iPhone then add it again - a pretty bad workaround.&nbsp; My Hotmail account does not even get very many messages.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
iPhone running iOS 6.1.3<br />
Accessing Hotmail through built in Mail app - account added via Hotmail specific button (have tried MS Exchange option in past with same results)<br />
Mail days to sync = no limit, pushing Inbox folder (have tried pushing others with no difference in terms of this problem)<br />
<br />
Either there is a problem with my account or Hotmail does not actually do proper syncing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />

<h2>            Have Lumia 950, looking for new phoneI</h2>
                    I love my Lumia 950, but because of the random shutting down issues that I have been dealing with for a while now and the lack of a real fixes, I wanted to ask this community for suggestions for a phone that might be comparable, but actually reliable.
 I really like this phone, but it is so frustrating that I can't rely on it at all.

    <title>Office 365 aqnd PayPal. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tnl.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 aqnd PayPal.</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Automatic billing through PayPal.com began 12/8/13 for an Office 365 subscription.<br />
</div>
On 1/8/14, funds were not available for use through my PayPal account.&nbsp; Office showed a red bar saying invalid at the top of all applications.<br />
</div>
on 1/20/14, i sold an item on e-bay.&nbsp; on 1/21/14, Microsoft charged me for 9.99 for the month of January for Office 365 through PayPal on the newly available funds.&nbsp; During the time of 1/8 to 1/21, I was unable to use any Office 365 applications.<br />
<br />
<br />
</div>
I have not been able to use Office for more than half the month.&nbsp; I would like to see from Microsoft:<br />
<br />
</div>
1, a credit of 4.99 for the time i was unable to use this product/service or,<br />
</div>
<div>2, a months worth of service for free and,<br />
</div>
3, a ticket number so this issue can be looked at technically so no one else runs into the same issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmail.google.com%2fmail%2fu%2f0%2fimages%2fcleardot.gif" />Microsoft billing has refused any help on refunds or credit for this issue.&nbsp; Technical support will not look into this issue as the Office
 product is showing valid and activated (obviously now that the payment has gone though).<br />
<br />
Is anyone else experiencing this issue with Office 365?&nbsp; Has anyone been able to get support on a matter like this?<br />

<br />
I have Office 365 installed and use it occasionally. &nbsp;Each month I see paypal has charged me.<br />
<br />
I cannot however find any emails that I purchased 365, but I do remember doing it.<br />
<br />
I don't know what email I used but when I try my emails, each of them says I am not subscribed to 365.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get to my account with the information I have from my paypal account?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I started experiencing this error in the last 4 days or so. The error message pops up almost every minute, right after I launch my internet explorer. I am still able to browse normally irrespective of this error, but is very annoying. I tried all the troubleshooting
 options in Windows 7 and tried searching for online help, but I don't see any resolutions posted by anyone yet; appreciate if anyone could offer some suggestions to get rid of this error. Thanks in advance!</p>

 you using any proxy connection?</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to follow the methods below to resolve this issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span><span><span> I
 would suggest that you disable the proxy settings in the internet explorer and check if it works.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under "Tools" in the browser tool bar select "Internet Options".</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Internet Options" window that pops up, click the "Connections" tab at the top.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click "LAN Settings" near the bottom of the "Connections" section.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "Proxy server" checkbox is marked with a check, click it to deselect/uncheck it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click "Ok" to close the "Local Area Network (LAN) Settings" window.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click "Ok" to close the "Internet Options" window.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now check if you are able to connect to Internet Explorer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span><span><span>If
 the above step fails then try resetting the internet explorer settings to default and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For more information refer the below link.</span></span></span></p>

            I followed all of these steps, and when I go into account settings, there is no picture, there are no linked accounts, and therefore nothing to remove.&nbsp; However, hotmail is still "grabbing" my picture from my FB account and I can see it in Hotmail.&nbsp; Are

<p>Your phone runs on Symbian S60 V 3.1 and there is no way to check or change this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However you can check the firmware by keying in *#0000# while on standby</p>
<p>you will have sumthing like v1000.0.00</p>
<p>thats the firmware on your phone and can be updated using NSU.</p>

<p>Do you know if it is the Symbian 3th edition or the Symbian 3th edition feature pack 2?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot. I am trying to instal the sygic navigator, and it asks me for this.</p>
<p>Do you have also any information if the maps come with the program for the sygic?</p>

<h2>            E72 - Can&#39;t make WLAN working says - Web&#58; Unable to perform operation</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! I just bought my E72. First it was working ok, but there are some problems that i have been experiencing, it hangs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then i went to the nokia.com website to update my firmware. I got the newest software version 052.005 with software version date october 27, 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the upgrade, it became worse, the phone hangs almost every time i lookup in the contacts when i am about to create a message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What i did was back-up all data and did a reset (*#7370#) and then restored all data. After that, i noticed i cannot connect to our wifi. It says "<strong>WLAN: WLAN connection already active. Close it and try again</strong>." and another message would appear
 that says "<strong>Web: Unable to perform operation</strong>."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the installed applications that need internet connection like shmessenger or facebook chat, still those same messages would appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me on this please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance! Merry christmas and a happy new year!</p>

            And i tried also restarting my phone, still doesn't work. I don't know yet if it removed all the hanging on my phone after the reset. Will update you on it. Thanks!

<p>Whilst carrying out "#7370# was the correct thing to do, restoring your data may have led to this situation. Try function just after reset and maybe just restore contacts and calendar.</p>

            I have never had this problem and so can only guess. I would think a hard reset would have removed all settings and files that could interfere, but have you dug around in Menu -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Settings -&gt; Connection -&gt; Destinations or Menu -&gt; Control
 Panel -&gt; Connectivity? Are all access points removed, except those for your mobile carrier? Can you switch WiFi off and on? If you switch WiFi off and reboot, does it stay off? Does removing the SD card make any difference? If none of this leads anywhwhere,
 I would suggest re-flashing the firmware. If that doesn't help, then you may have a dud phone. :(

            hey guys! i tried the hard reset again and this time, i removed the SD card before the reset, then after the reset, tried to connect to the internet through WLAN Wizard to our home internet, it works!!! :)<br />
<br />
then i restored ONLY the contacts, messages, calendar and note data in my phone, tried again if i can connect through WLAN, yes it works also!!! :)<br />
<br />

<p>i too faced this problem in my nokia c601 last week, the reason i noticed for this after a long search is that the security firewall in my phone was set to high.<strong><font>(so it was giving me a warn web unable to perform operation)</font></strong>&nbsp;When&nbsp;
 the firewall settings was restored to normal the web could work this time to the normal situation as it was previously... so i suggest you if any third part security software like antivirus or antispam is installed in you mobile check whether it is set to
 high . if it is high jus restore it to normal ... then your web will be working fine.....</p>
