<p>hi ronc,<br />
<br />
there is no official solution to add dropbox to the add a place menu.<br />
<br />
regarding the situation, you can consider setting the default file location of the office applications to your dropbox sync folder via the steps below:<br />
1. open word 2016, then click <strong>file &gt; options &gt; save</strong>.<br />
2. find <strong>default local file location</strong>, and set the location to your dropbox sync folder.<br />

<p>Thank you for the immediate response MoyarJackson.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting a notification is normal since you have received an email since a new junk message is still considered as a new message. I would recommend that you report those spam emails for you to avoid receiving them. You may also use the Outlook desktop app
 to permanently do not get spam messages if you will enable the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2697941/junk-e-mail-messages-are-permanently-deleted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Permanently delete suspected junk e-mail instead

</p><p>I don't think you understand the issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Embedding Symbol Font into PDFs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supernano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedding Symbol Font into PDFs</h2>
                    Whenever I use the Symbol font in any of the Office 2007 applications, when I save as a PDF file, the symbols get converted to bitmap images. Sometimes they have a shadow behind them in the PDF, or if I'm using vertical text, the symbol characters will
 come out horizontal.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PDF supports the Symbol font, so this shouldn't be an issue. Is there a way to set office 2007 to embed the symbol into it's PDFs?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            Thanks for all your help everyone, I've solved the problem. I checked my Fonts folder and there were 2 versions of Symbol in it, SYMBOL.TTF and SYMBOLE.FON. I removed the latter and now the PDFs are encoded with the symbol font.
<div><br />
<div>I'm sure I was using the ttf in the presentation files originally, because only one symbol font appeared in the PowerPoint font list and it had the TT next to it. It must have been a encoding to PDF issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, before checking the fonts folder I had found a way to remove SP2 from office. There is a command line tool for that which can be downloaded from the Microsoft Support site. Just thought some of you might find that useful.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your help.</div>

<h2>            Excel Bar Chart - How to Dynamically expand or reduce the number of bars in a bar chart</h2>
                    <p>I have a master table that i have created sub-tables from based on certain criteria.&nbsp; From each sub-table i have created a separate bar chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i add a row to the master table, based on the criteria, it will update the appropriate sub table.&nbsp; Then the appropriate bar chart will be automatically updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question is:&nbsp; If the sub table has only 5 rows, the bar chart should only have five bars.&nbsp; if i add a row to the master table that adds a row to the sub table, then the bar chart should show a 6th bar automatically.&nbsp; If the sub table goes down to 4 rows,
 then the bar chart should automatically go down to four bars.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have figured it out.&nbsp; I used the OFFSET function per your suggestion:</p>
<p>=OFFSET(Architecture!$B$2,0,0,COUNTA(Architecture!$B:$B)-1,1) and this did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason:&nbsp; In my "Sub-table", I have "empty" cells that actually have formulas that were "FALSE", so no value was showing in the cell.&nbsp; So it looked "empty".&nbsp; The "COUNTA" was counting this as an non-empty cell.&nbsp; I did not want this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I changed the COUNTA to COUNT&nbsp; and took out the "-1" and my graphs are coming out the way I want them.</p>
<p>=OFFSET(Architecture!$B$2,0,0,COUNT(Architecture!$B:$B),1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the help.&nbsp; You got me on the right track.&nbsp; I just had to understand what COUNTA and COUNT really do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again</p>

<h2>            Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I have a county government email and another work email because I am a contractor. Before today I was able to have them both on the Outlook app. It's now telling me that no other account can be added with the government account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a new thing? I really don't want to have to add my other work email to my personal mail on my iPhone and I can't have two outlook applications on my phone. I can't figure out how to link the two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            When you say "Outlook app", which one do you mean? Do you mean the Windows 10 Mail app, aka "Outlook Mail", the Outlook for mobile app (iOS or Android), or the Office Outlook application on a desktop PC? OIn top of that, you posted in the Outlook.com forum, which is the forum for questions about the web-based, free online mail service and none of what you ask seems to relate to that even though you're in that forum.

<p>Yes I was talking about the iOS outlook app. I believe both of the accounts are office 365 for business. If I add the county gov email outlook will not let me add another account. If I add my contractor email I can add the county gov email but it then deletes
 my contractor email from the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I had both accounts on my Outlook iOS app. Today, all because I couldn't remember my password I guess I've lost dual account outlook iOS app privilages. I also just remembered what my password was, so I'm pretty mad at my self for a wasted day.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a new thing for government cloud accounts.&nbsp; I have some information about it at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.slipstick.com/exchange/outlook-mobile-apps-gcc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Mobile apps and Government Cloud Accounts (GCC)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft made a change to the government cloud accounts (GCC) and unfortunately, it caused problems for Outlook mobile users, removing their personal account from Outlook or preventing them from adding work email accounts.&nbsp; If you connect to an on-prem
 exchange account, make sure your mobile app is updated - if your mailbox is on office 365, the admin would need to change the settings, which are set to On by default.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Admins can read more about GCC, the tenant setting, and non-FedRAMP compliant features here :

    <title>Conversation History Folder - Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zipel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conversation History Folder - Outlook.com</h2>
                    I recently connected my Skype account with my Microsoft account. This action created the "Conversation History" folder in outlook.com which cannot be deleted (the delete option is grayed out when I right click on it). The folder as I understand is supposed
 to handle all the saved chat conversation from Skype but it does not, it is just always empty without having the opportunity to disable it. In other words it is a completely useless folder, not unlike the Archive folder which also exists for no reason... I
 contacted the support but they could not help with my problem. According to this post: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook/conversation-history-folder-outlook/38518c3c-49e1-4776-8519-9c3150395426 if I am not mistaken there is
 a way to remove the folder (using something called mfcmapi client) from the back-end?

                    <p>dear microsoft. the taskbar icons in later builds(9926) of windows 10 TP &nbsp;are very small and the file explorer button is ugly. in later builds and in windows 10 please make icons big and change file explorer icon to previous one (like in build 9841) . file
 explorer icon in build 9841 is very nice. keep these small icons for "use small taskbar buttons" option.</p>

    <title>Active X Controls Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodl1967  say:</h3>
<h2>            Active X Controls Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have an macro-enabled Excel 2013 workbook that contains Active X controls. &nbsp;The Active X controls have always worked. &nbsp;I don't know what occurred, but when I opened this workbook today, all of my Active X controls were not working. &nbsp;In fact, they appear
 to be nothing more than just objects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of my Active X controls are command buttons, which contained the code, <strong>
=EMBED("Forms,CommandButton.1","")</strong> in the dialog box. &nbsp;Now this code is missing when I click on the object. &nbsp;Also, I'm not able to view the properties when I click on the object. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe there was a problem with my macro being disabled, but I enabled it, plus, I made sure that the Active X controls were enabled. &nbsp;However, my controls are still not working. &nbsp;Will I be able to restore these controls? &nbsp;Each of these controls had VBA
 code behind it. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Teylyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the link. &nbsp;Reading the information in the link, I am able to create new Active X controls. &nbsp;However, the existing ones are not working. &nbsp;I'm not sure if there were Office updates, but I had a Windows update prior to having this problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, I have more than one worksheet that contains Active X controls. &nbsp;However, only one worksheet was affected (the one I had open at the time I rebooted my computer). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting the *.exd extension in my hidden folder and rebooted the computer. &nbsp;That method didn't work. &nbsp;Any other suggestions? &nbsp;</p>

            I was able to find the Microsoft Office updates, and I deleted them, then deleted the *.exd extension before restarting my Excel. &nbsp;Even though I am able to create new Active X controls, the existing ones still do not work. &nbsp;I'm looking into finding software
 that can fix my worksheet, but I would prefer to do it manually, if anyone have any suggestions. &nbsp;

            No one was able to offer a solution to my problem. &nbsp;I suppose once the Active X control is broken, it can't be fixed. &nbsp;I'm afraid I will need to replace the controls with new ones. &nbsp;I wanted to avoid this, because it's going to be time-consuming replacing
 all the command buttons, textboxes and image boxes. &nbsp;

                    <p>I'm trying to set up a group chat or Conversation as Skype calls it.&nbsp; When I initially set up the chat, it gave me an option to invite others not on my contact list.&nbsp; When I clicked on that choice, I got two options--copy a link and email a link.&nbsp; I clicked
 on copy and nothing happened and then that option to invite others went away.&nbsp; I created a different chat and this time clicked on email a link, and again nothing happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get a sharable link for people not in my contacts? This used to be easy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I now have multiple chats--when I try to delete the ones created in trying to solve this problem nothing happens, they remain in my timeline on the left</p>

<p>I actually just found a fix a few minutes ago.&nbsp; I had to right click on the conversation and select view profile. There I found a setting "make a link for anyone to join".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why this is hidden in the profile rather than in settings, and why it made it look like that was already an option when I created the chat is a mystery. Would be helpful for this to be an option whenever you click to invite others. But appears to be working
 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try doing the reset, but will wait until I don't need the current chat anymore as I don't want to risk messing up the link I have already sent and not exactly sure what the reset will do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>

</p><p>Dish says they don't support it and also gives us goofy reasons and 3 flavors of their systems. It used to work fine until ...an update by them. I've called Dish, but questions and no answers. Dish doesn't understand they push the updates, not us.

    <title>Intermittent WiFi problem with PEAP&#47;MS-CHAPv2 authentication - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cathode  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent WiFi problem with PEAP&#47;MS-CHAPv2 authentication</h2>
                    I have a new Windows Phone 8.0 device, the Nokia Lumia 920.<br />
<br />
I have configured it to be able to connect to the University network where I am based, which uses the WPA2-Enterprise/802.11.x, PEAP/MS-CHAPv2 scheme. I have also correctly installed the Root Certificate and the phone successfully connects with the Certificate
 validation ON. (Note that laptops and other devices, like my old S60-based Symbian device also works flawlessly.)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Trouble is, after a few cycles of connecting and disconnecting from the WiFi network (including when the lock screen comes on), the phone then refuses to connect to the same WiFi network and in the WiFi Settings&nbsp;panel&nbsp;displays "attention required" underneath
 the configured network. If I tap the network on the list, I get the username and password configuration screen for the same network again. I have found that this sometimes works, sometimes does not work. Ultimately the solution is to remove the network from
 the list of known networks and re-configure it from scratch.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would hope that the phone would save the network settings and reconnect automatically and successfully every single time, not only a couple of times. I suspect there is some bug lurking around, as it can connect a couple of times fine. This is obviously
 tedious to have to re-enter the username and password details every few times to please the authentication.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else facing a similar issue? I would like to know whether someone will take care of such issue and raise it within Microsoft. Is this the official place to report bugs?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div>

            I have just realised that I have the same Certificate installed twice. When I configured the WiFi network connection I mistakenly assumed that the Root Certificate was not part of the builtin ones, so I installed it.<br />
<br />
It seems that if I choose the built-in certificate over the one I installed, it seems to work most of the time, but not always. Is there a problem with duplicate certificates? I wonder in the first place why the OS accepted a duplicate certificate for "US,
 Equifax" if the only difference is in a minor detail, hashes and fingerprint match completely.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts? Do I need to go through the hassle of a reset in order to remove a certificate from the Root CA list?

            You will probably need to do a reset to remove the cert and to configure it again. Let us know if that doesn't work.<br />

            Well, I have not actually tried to do a hard reset as I am afraid it may brick the phone (that's what other people have mentioned over the Internet, not to mention the hassle of having to reconfigure the start screen, it's not something I take lightly),
 and I do not have enough time at the moment to deal with that possibility. Having said that, every now and then I get consistently working connections&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;the day, just like yesterday for instance: it reconnected fine the entire day, and most of this
 morning,&nbsp;until&nbsp;it finally failed to re-connect automatically.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that if it were purely related to the certificate, it would probably happen either all the time or much more often. I seem to be getting an erratic behaviour, where most of the time it works, but every now and then it stops working, requiring
 me to input the login credentials again. There seems to be some randomness to it, rather than some consistent pattern.<br />
<br />
Anyone else facing similar issues?

            Is there any way to see a list of installed certificates and/or remove a certificate?<br />
<br />
I've installed a series of 4 certificates but I don't see them in the list when trying to set up a new WiFi connection.<br />

            As far as I am away you cannot remove a certificate once it has been installed, other than by doing a reset of the phone.<br />
<br />
You should see the list of certificates when you configure a wireless network and enable certificate validation. Otherwise - and as far as I am aware - there isn't any place on the phone to see the list of certificates. Poor choice, because one should be able
 to at least see that list and remove any user-added certificates and or update them at any time.<br />
<br />
I am still having intermittent issues with WiFi. Sometimes it connects fine, sometimes not. What a bizarre behaviour.

<div>Have you contacted MS and directly reported this specific problem? It isn't always clear whether they read these forums and pick up bug report through them. This problem is so serious as actually to be a deal breaker for WP8 in certain environments (like
 work and University for instance). iOS and Android don't have a problem with it. It appears to relate to the Windows 8 Enterprise features being half implemented in WP8. Win 8 laptops also have difficulty connecting to our PEAP/MSChapV2 network, but at least
 with WP8 you can get at configuration options.</div>

<div>I'm trying out my workaround today, which is to revert back to a WP7 device. So far so good. It takes credentials, and doesn't even ask for a server certificate.</div>

I am sorry, but through which medium shall I contact MS? Is there an e-mail account? Does this need to be through twitter? Shall I contact Nokia directly? I thought this would be the appropriate place.. but maybe it is not.<br />
<br />
I am still having the intermittent issues.. Seeing as so many other people seem to have the same issue it would be useful to have some sort of feedback.

            <p>I have simular problems on a HTC 8x<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Has been here since first release of WP8<br />
</p>
<p>- Has been here with GDR1, GDR2 and GDR3 update<br />
</p>
<p>- Has been here without using a certificate<br />
</p>
<p>- The problem only happens on a corporate network with PEAP/MS-CHAPv2 and never on my home network with wpa2</p>
<p>- The problem is quit persistent. It won't last a week before connection problems arise.</p>
<p>- The problem happens on all phones in our company (HTC8x and Lumia 920)</p>
<p>- No problems with Android and iOS devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>When connection is dropped we only have to go to the wifi-settings, fill in user name and password and the phone is connected instantly. There is a warning asking if I expect the wlan with this name in this location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest problem is not having to fill in user credentials. It's the cost people have when downloading data over the air (phone provider) and not via wifi, especially when viewing corporate movie streams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will be addressed in upcoming updates for WP8</p>

<h2>            Creating a custom calendar in MS Project 2007</h2>
                    <p>I know how to create custom calendars, save them to global template, etc.&nbsp; My challenge is with creating a completely custom calendar as in month's start end days are not the traditional 1 to 30/31.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The accounting calendar for the company is as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Jan/15 starts on the 1st and ends on the 24th</li><li>Feb/15 starts Jan 26th and ends on the 21st, </li><li>Mar/15 starts Feb 22rd and ends on Mar 28th</li><li>Apr/15 starts Mar 29th and ends Apr 25th </li></ul>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to create a calendar where when I select to view 'April' it shows me hours/costs from Mar 29th to Apr 25th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone come across this challenge? Any suggestions? Oh, and by the way, the dates above change every year :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate anyone's help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if it can't be done in 2007 but this is an option in newer versions, please let me know.&nbsp; Might be a very good reason to upgrade :)</p>

</p><p>You can group task but the grouping has to be by some repeatable criteria.&nbsp; If every interval was 24 days it wouldn't be a problem.</p>

                    <p><span>I've been using it for years on my HP Pavilion DV6-6135DX. About a year or so ago, when I open Microsoft Word or another office program, it comes up with a prompt screen telling me it's not activated and to change the
 product key, error 0x8007232B.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Well years ago I must have installed Microsoft Office 2010 on to this laptop from a product key I purchased or perhaps the laptop already came with it? I can't remember. But I no longer have that product key anymore
 if I purchased it so what do I do? It must have started happening when I had someone fix my computer and they completely wiped out everything is my guess. And why does it still allow me to use it though if I just hit close? It's just annoying. It says it's
 Microsoft Office Standard 2010 if that helps too. My laptop is Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, side question. Say somehow you guys at Microsoft can help me and give me the original product key....if I ever get a new
 laptop in the future that also doesn't have Microsoft Office installed, will I be able to use that same product key from this laptop for a new laptop or do you have to buy a new Microsoft Office product key each time with each different laptop?</span></p>

    <title>Preventing image compression when saving PPT to PDF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preventing image compression when saving PPT to PDF</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been reading a lot of Steve Rindsberg's replies on this topic so I'll review my problem and what I've tried without success&nbsp;- hopefully there's a solution out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running PowerPoint 2016 through the Office 365 Subscription on Windows 10 and have latest updates installed.&nbsp; I've used PPT to create some Letter sized marketing materials which will be professionally printed.&nbsp; I've set high resolution images from a
 photographer as the Background.&nbsp; In&nbsp;Windows Explorer the&nbsp;Properties of these files show them as being 275dpi.&nbsp; When I zoom into the images while in PPT they look perfect&nbsp;up to the 400% limit and the PPT file is &gt;8MB with 2 such files embedded into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I save or print to PDF the images are horrible quality (text is fantastic) and the file size just 500kb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placed checkmark in "Do not compress images in file" checkbox and deleted &amp; re-imported images after doing so</li><li>In File | Save As dialog selected "Standard (publishing online and printing)" and either Tools | Compress Pictures | HD (330 ppi) or Use document resolution</li></ul>
<p>None of these settings appear to make any difference at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw that Steve was helping <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/26274bbb-d058-4537-95da-c1f278374718" title="Martijn van Berkel">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Martijn van Berkel</span></a>&nbsp;back in April 2015 but his solution appeared to involve Adobe Acrobat DC.&nbsp; I don't have the way withal&nbsp;to purchase that at this time and am&nbsp;thinking it should be possible to get decent results just by
 using PPT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help very gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jason.</p>

            <p>I can reproduce what I think you're seeing here (Win7 + PPT 2016/365).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the same photo twice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added as the slide background on one slide</p>
<p>Add as a photo ON the slide on another slide</p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference between the two isn't huge (at least not with this particular photo) but it's there; the image used as the slide b/g is somewhat less sharp/more pixelated than the same image used on the slide directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both images are lower resolution than the original (not surprising, since the original image and the PPTX I created are both about 4.5mb, where the resulting PDF is only 250kb).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To PPT's credit, it's done quite a job of shrinking the image to that degree w/o utterly destroying it, but more detailed images will probably suffer more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the free PDF option in PPT doesn't give us nearly the range of settings/choices that Acrobat does. &nbsp;Since budget is an issue, it might be worth trying a couple of the various free/inexpensive alternatives to Acrobat. &nbsp;SodaPDF or CutePDF seem
 popular and may give you more control over how images are downsampled into the PDF (which is the problem here, I'm pretty sure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One caveat: &nbsp;most of these alternative PDF makers are simply printer drivers; they probably won't preserve interactivity (hyperlinks/action settings and such) when converting your presentation to PDF.</p>

<h2>            Auto Fill in To&#58; subject line</h2>
                    <p>I am an administrator and have come across a user with a difficult question...... When in outlook, sending an email, the auto fill function only shows the recent people, Instead of showing the complete list of past users who have emailed.&nbsp; We have users
 who go months in between conversations, and those emails no longer auto populate in the (To: field.) We are running outlook 2016. I have selected the auto complete option in the options menu. I have seen in other threads that many people have this issue but
 have not seen a solution.</p>

            That's the new ("and improved!") autocomplete list - it should show some names from the autocomplete list and suggestions based on recent senders - if the user keeps typing, older names from the autocomplete list should come up. 
<br />
<br />The older, longer, but more compact, list was definitely better, IMHO.. but unfortunately, it's gone at least for now. 
<br />
<br />I recommend posting a suggestion at outlook.uservoice.com - i found this suggestion you can vote on if you feel it fits your complaint: <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows/suggestions/19962472-autocomplete-email-addresses-longevity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-out...</a>

<p>Hey!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any chance that I could scrobble what I listen in Nokia Music software to Last.fm? Is there a plugin for the Last.fm application like there is for iTunes / WMP / Winamp?</p>

<p>I would like this too.&nbsp; Nokia Music is great because it doesn't try to take over your whole library and does a great job at embedding album artwork into my mp3s (in a way that my E71 will actually use!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having Last.fm integration would make it that much better.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd also like to see this. Either make plugin for Nokia music as there is for e.g. WMP or make native support to the player itself like e.g. in Spotify PC client.</p>
<p>As an emphasis, the request is for PC player. The plugin for S60 mobile player already exists.</p>

<h2>            notifying recipients that an incoming email is quarantined</h2>
                    <p>Hi--</p>
<p>I tried turning on a policy where I have Exchange On-Line Protection ATP turned on to quarantine suspected phishing emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I'm seeing a ton of false positives, and my users are becoming very frustrated.&nbsp; How do I tune the policy to catch emails with malicious links and emails that are spoofing protected email addresses or domains?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, how do I notify recipients that an email has been quarantined for suspected phishing or malware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, how can I create a daily report that sends an email with a list of emails in quarantine and for what reason?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to any feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reference to KBs, training videos or step by step demos would also be welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindest regards.</p>

<p>Hi Sara,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your query in this community.</p>
<p>Per my understanding on your question, when you are trying to create a new notebook, you received that error code.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched for the error code, but seems like this error code is not listed in the common errors. Thus, to help us further investigate on this issue, please provide the following information with
 us:</p>
<p>1.Please provide us a screenshot of that error message.
</p>
<p>2.Where were you trying to create the notebook? In your OneDrive Web Page or via the OneNote desktop client?</p>
<p>3.At which step did the error message prompt out?</p>
<p>4.Can you access your existing notebooks without issue?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your cooperation is highly appreciated.

<p>
</p><p>Since OneDrive appears to be working for Documents and other file types, we can only assume this is a OneNote issue?</p>

<p>Hi Alex,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your questions the notebook is exported from my One Drive online through Office 365 to my H Drive on my desktop. It all unpacks when I export it but when I am importing it back into my One Drive to be able to share it, it doesn’t unpack any
 of the sections as per screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/181b48f8-cecb-4221-a5e4-18ddf4a2d012?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/181b48f8-cecb-4221-a5e4-18ddf4a2d012?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to access all other notebooks and they are all syncing when changes are made. It is only affecting the ability to create new notebooks. At present i have about 80 notebooks which i have created and are being used for a few months at a time before
 they can be deleted. Is there a limit to the amount of notebooks which can be created in your One Drive or could it be a server &nbsp;issue?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This sounds like moving OneNote files manually to OneDrive (as usual with doc, xls).</p>
<p>This doesn't work. OneNote files need a special treatment (a conversion). Has to be done with
<strong>OneNote 2016,</strong> its <strong>File --&gt;Share </strong>feature.</p>

<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>Could you share us with the detailed steps when you try to import this notebook back to the OneDrive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As all the other notebooks could be synced without issue, I assume this issue is not related with the OneNote Desktop Client. Please follow the steps mentioned in the article below to see if you could
 upload this local notebook to your OneDrive.</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>AT&amp;&amp;77</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry about the inconvenience.</p>
<p>The OneNote syncing mechanism is different from OneDrive sync client, although your notebooks are stored in OneDrive cloud storage, the syncing procedure is performed inside of the OneNote Desktop
 client, not your OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your scenario, I have some suggestions to narrow down on this issue:</p>
<p>1.Go to the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm_4nalKfjAhWbWc0KHcJzDmcQFjAAegQIBBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.onenote.com%2Fhrd&amp;usg=AOvVaw12U2qtqasGNRXah_DZrvju" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneNote Online</a>, sign in your Office 365 work account, check if your notebooks could be opened without issue.</p>
<p>2.If you have confirmed the Notebook can be opened via OneNote Online without issue, please export your current notebook to the local drive as a backup, and click on
</span></p>
<p>3.Log out your account in the OneNote 2016 desktop client and log in again.</p>
<p>4.Is the sync error occurring on all of your notebooks or just a specific one? Please try creating a new notebook via OneNote 2016 and store it in the OneDrive, check if the sync error persist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>I found a solution for this problem!</p>
<p>I had a user that had the exact same problem.</p>
<p>The solution is to take a look into the onedrive location he is syncing to:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdf2dbda-d755-44a5-a406-2fe84ba2b20c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdf2dbda-d755-44a5-a406-2fe84ba2b20c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Check if there are any files that aren't in the onenote it self. Delete all the files you don't need anymore(which are already deleted out of the onenote application).</p>
<p>Also check if the user is syncing to the right location, i saw that the user i helped synced to wrong location, he synced to the local onedrive sync which is weird and onedrive can't handle this or onenote of course.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7402ae8a-b886-4294-a716-55019bca2c70?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7402ae8a-b886-4294-a716-55019bca2c70?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The user i helped had the problem that he choosed this pc and then he directed to the onedrive that was synced to the local pc!</p>
<p><br />
The last step that you could try is this:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5687d84f-07f0-4ad3-9873-9c253d7f9586?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5687d84f-07f0-4ad3-9873-9c253d7f9586?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you see any errors here delete them, these are probably pages that go previously deleted or aren't needed anymore, or are broken!
</strong></p>

<p>I seet that the notebook is syncing to a personal location. Was the notebook created at a OneDrive location to begin with?</p>
<p>If not try pointing the notebook to a OneDrive location</p>
<p>File&gt;&gt;Click 'Settings' respective to your notebook&gt;&gt; Click Move/Copy&gt;&gt; Point to a OneDrive location</p>
