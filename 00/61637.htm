<h2>            How to sort files by date modified in Windows 7</h2>
                    I can choose sort by: album, artist, song, genre and rating by nothing about date modified! Since I have over 500 audio files it would be of great use to sort by date.<br />
thanks!!

            Thanks, Andre.&nbsp; I spotted Date Created and Date Added in Media Player but didn't do a thorough search for all headings.&nbsp; Fortunately, the procedure is the same for Music Library. :)&nbsp; Right-click in the column headings and check/uncheck the desired columns.

    <title>Problem with Kindle App Windows 10, Lenovo Yoga 730 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bpshark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Kindle App Windows 10, Lenovo Yoga 730</h2>
                    <p>I saw a similar thread about this but it was unable to help me with my problem. I just tried downloading the kindle app for PC, and upon opening the application it brings up the login page, but every time I go to enter my email address it "resets" and deletes
 any text I try to write about every second or so, preventing me from logging in and registering my device.</p>
<p>I tried restarting my computer, and uninstalled and redownloaded the application twice, but I'm still getting the same glitch. Google and youtube searches have both come up without relevant results. And it's not a keyboard issue because everything else on
 my laptop seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

<p>Hi there! Thank you for replying so quickly.</p>
<p>To answer your questions-</p>
<p>1. I recently had my laptop sent to Geek Squad but it was to repair the lcd component of my screen, shouldn't affect the particular app.</p>
<p>2. Yes, it is</p>
<p>3. I have Webroot as my security software</p>
<p>And unfortunately the Amazon site was unhelpful, as it assumes that I am able to even attempt to sign in. I cannot seem to enter my credentials at all.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<h2>            Todd Howard Is Dedicated</h2>
                    
<p><strong>In the new making of Skyrim vid, we can see Todd Howard, the project lead of Skyrim, who is clearly very much sleep deprived as can be seen here.
<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6031/6302620397_29dca0378f_b.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6031/6302620397_29dca0378f_b.jpg</a></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>That's true dedication. Most project leads would be content going to work 9 to 5 or even phoning from home like some other devs.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>When Skyrim launches, I hope all the guys at Bethesda get some sleep. They've earned it.</strong></p>

<h2>            I can map a network drive using appropriate credentials, but access is denied &#40;defaulting to local account for browsing&#41;</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>I've got a laptop running XP SP3.&nbsp; If I log in locally to the laptop and try to map a network drive from a server on my network, it prompts me for a username and password which I supply and then the drive is mapped.&nbsp; The problem is that when I click on the
 new drive, I get an access denied message.&nbsp; It is trying to connect to the share with my local account which does not have access privileges.&nbsp; Previously it would prompt me for a username and password, but apparently I changed some security settings and it
 doesn't do this anymore.</p>
<p>The same thing happens if I use the net use command.&nbsp; I can map the drive by supplying an appropriate username and password, but I can't browse it in windows explorer.&nbsp; I would really like to understand the setting that controls whether you get a prompt
 when accessing a resource over the network.&nbsp; I believe it is related to the security policy setting for Network Access: Sharing and security model for local accounts.&nbsp; I've played with that a bit, but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize that I could probably add an account with the same username / password as my local account to the server and give it access to my shared folder.&nbsp; I do not want to do this.&nbsp; I've got several users that share the laptop and have access to the local
 account (I realize this is not ideal, but it is unavoidable at the moment).&nbsp; I do not want them to have access to this network share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me get my login prompt back?&nbsp; I've been searching google for the last 2 days trying all kinds of suggested solutions, but I was unable to find one that works.</p>

<p>Too bad... I was hoping that was the problem.&nbsp; But at least it now asks you for a username/password&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>Apart from that, you might look to be sure that NetBios-over-TCP (NetBT) is enabled on the client.&nbsp; Disabling this forces a direct hosting of SMB which sometimes has problems.</p>

<p>Your latest observations seem to point to an initial connection followed by either difficulty connecting further or perhaps you did not authenticate as you expected.&nbsp; Some quick tests I made showed that if you connect using TCP/IP address instead of computer
 name and fully specify everything including username scope in a "net use" line, it significantly reduces network traffic needed to establish a connection.&nbsp; As a test on a client, from a command prompt, try a syntax such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp; net use * \\192.168.1.10\share&nbsp; /user:192.168.1.10\username &nbsp; password</p>
<p>Where "192.168.1.10" is the IP address of the server, "share" is the name of the share you desire to connect to, and "username" is the local user on the server machine to which you are authenticating.&nbsp; If you are using domain credentials, substutite the
 domain name for "192.168.1.10" in the "/user:" portion.&nbsp; If you are authenticating to a server local account from a graphic username/password prompt, try including the computer name along with the user name in the user name box as in computername\username.&nbsp;
 If this doesn't work, and unless there is really something wrong with the access permissions, I'm out of ideas.</p>

            It seems I can't reproduce the overload issue yet . I came to realize that I noticed the problem after connecting a Samsung TV ,thru HDMI ,and using magnifier.Then ,with no reboot,problem occured ,3 times ,if I'm correct,and every time I whacked &nbsp;the process.
 I am really trying to reproduce the issue , but with no results until now. I tried third method ,but the troubleshooter find no problem with the system. I got maximum 8% CPU load from AtBroker.exe until now ,but I will get at bottom of this soon,I'm sure.

<div>Edit : I want to make a recovery on external HDD, thats why I want to be all good with my O.S. .<br />

            It is caused by using Magnifier or OnScreen Keyboard. I think a bug causes the atbroker.exe to misbehave after closing the Magnifier sometimes (not always, not every time). I am very frustrated too - I use a Magnifier alot and pissed to kill atbroker.exe
 then via TaskManager.<br />

&nbsp;I use Magnifier a lot. When i close Magnifier app,the atbroker.exe still working at background. atbroker.exe uses %30 of CPU so it causes cpu fans work crazy .I always close atbroker.exe via task manager manually after closing magnifier.It really pi.s.s me
 off <br />
<br />
note:I have been having same problem with windows 8 x64 and yesterday,I upgraded to 8.1 but I sitll have the same problem.I think it is not personal problem,everyone complaning about it

            Hi, i'm experiencing the same problem.<br />
<br />
And i indeed use magnifier a lot. Some times, randomly, when i close the magnifier, "ATbroker.exe /copy" freezes and starts consuming my CPU.<br />
<br />
Windows 8 Pro x64 here.<br />
<br />
PLz give us a proper fix, this type of bug shouldn't have passed QA tests of Windows.. I can't understand how such thing got pass the tests

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 Pro x64 and Microsoft Laser Mouse 7000 here.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've had the atbroker.exe problem for a while, but it became severe when I upgraded to 8.1 Pro. It launched not one but multiple instances of atbroker.exe, which I periodically killed when the system started choking.&nbsp;I called Microsoft about it, and, get
 this, &nbsp;the upgrade comes with FREE support for the first 90 days! Even though it was a free upgrade!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Long story short and after&nbsp;many support hours since 10/23, I stumbled onto a the cause quite accidently.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is some sort of conflict with the mouse magnify button&nbsp;when there's a third-party anti-virus software installed.&nbsp; I replicated the results using Bit Defender, Norton, and Trend Micro. It doesn't occur if you run magnify.exe directly. It only happens
 using the mouse magnify button. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And it never occurs when using Windows Defender.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The tech at first pointed out that the mouse software wasn't certified on 8.1, which struck me as bazaar. I did a refresh on the system and took it back to 8 Home. No dice. I installed only the Windows updates and Norton, and though not as bad, the atbroker.exe
 problem didn't go away. I again tested with Bit Defender and Trend Micro- same story as before.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then the tech&nbsp;wanted to lay&nbsp;the blame on Norton,&nbsp;but relented when I reminded him of my findings. He's going to do&nbsp;some testing&nbsp;with the laser&nbsp;mouse, and I'm going to run it by Norton, and we'll talk again on Sunday. I'll post the results</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Product Key</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell machine on which I was running Windows 8.1&nbsp;. I got the window 10 upgrade and when I tried it kept failing after loading 25% due to some windows update error. Tried it 5 times, didn't work. :(
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I searched and read up on windows community to resolve the issue , I finally downloaded media center and created a windows 10 boot on USB and installed from it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have windows 10 running on my machine which is great, but its not activated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to activate my windows 10 , I have a valid windows 8.1 key .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. But the issue of activation still persist. I waited for over 3 weeks to see if the activation happens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code that is shown in my pc is Error code: 0x8004FE93</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this error code I didn't find any details in the link that was shared. Can you please suggest how I can addressed the activation issue?
</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Greg, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks .. lot of steps to do </span><span><span>J</span></span><span>&nbsp; Will try this out .. effectively what you are suggesting is to reinstall
 windows 8.1 that I had earlier then do an upgrade to windows 10.. post this upgrade if needed I can to a clean install
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I was facing issue upgrading to windows 10 through windows update.. it used to keep failing after 25% installation.. so I created boot file and did a fresh install of windows 10.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Will try out the option you suggested .. thanks once again for your input
</span></p>

<h2>            Neverwinter&#47;Arc non customer support</h2>
                    
Arc non customer service/support
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>ok i know it is not that big of deal, but i purchased a Heirloom pack for xbox one and some of the items listed were not in the pack. I sent a ticket in 11 days ago and the only response was "we are aware there is an issue and are working to resolve
 it". Now i might be old school thinking that the consumer should not be the one forced to wait for the supplier to figure out the issue and that some type of apologetic step should be made for the consumer.<br />
<br />
Below is the last live chat i had with Arc, i just want to show this so that anyone else that spends real money in the game and IF something goes wrong what to expect. Total in all, to buy the missing items would cost $14 real cash. So user beware, if you do
 spend money and something goes wrong do not expect sympathy or a quick response to your issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zendiel (Listening)<br />
Zendiel: Hi there! I'm Game Master Zendiel and I'm reviewing your ticket information right now. How are you doing today?<br />
dale13: good and you?<br />
Zendiel: I'm glad to hear that you doing well today. I'm feeling the same way. Thank you for asking.&nbsp;<br />
Zendiel: I see that you're having some trouble with your account. May I know what happened?<br />
dale13: sure 11 days ago i purchased an in game item and did not receive part of the offer<br />
dale13: almost 2 weeks<br />
Zendiel: Oh, it seems that you still don't have the Greater Bag of Holding from the pack that you have purchased. No worries as upon checking the ticket that you previously sent us, it seems that it is under investigation.&nbsp;<br />
dale13: correct<br />
dale13: however the excuse that its a problem is not solving my issues<br />
dale13: had the item said "may take up to 2 weeks to receive items i never would have bought it<br />
Zendiel: I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience that this caused you. No worries as I will be updating that ticket for you.&nbsp;<br />
Zendiel: Unfortunately, I cannot provide you with a specific timeframe of the resolution as this issue is currently being handled by a different department.<br />
dale13: i just want the items i paid for or my Zen back<br />
dale13: to me it there is no reason to make the consumer wait for a problem on your end, that is not how things are supposed to work, is it an issue? I am sure it is, but should the consumer have to be punished for it?<br />
Zendiel: Yes, I understand that you want to have the items that you purchased. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience as this issue is currently being handled by a different department.&nbsp;<br />
Zendiel: Let me assure you that they are doing their best to resolve this.&nbsp;<br />
dale13: again that is not really my concern, my concern is it is now day 11 and i have not gotten anything as much as a "sorry we are still working on it". Also I don't care about what department it is in...it is the SAME company that you are working for now,
 there has to be someone there with enough athority to make a decision and take correct actions<br />
Zendiel: Unfortunately, I cannot provide you the items from the pack that you have purchased. However, for this concern, I will be updating the ticket that you previously sent us, would that be okay?<br />
dale13: just update my in game Zen to reflect the missing item<br />
dale13: very similiar issues were resolved with in a few days, where Zen spent was reissues to those that bought the item<br />
dale13: so if you cannot give the item, then just credit back the zen it cot to buy a new one, which is 1000 zen<br />
dale13: cost*<br />
dale13: it really cannot be that hard to do something that is done all the time, I see no reason i should have to wait so long for some type of customer service on a game that i have spent about $80 on<br />
dale13: there has to be someone there with enough authority to say "hey he is right he should not have to wait for us to figure this out, lets give him a credit or another item and say sorry"&nbsp;<br />
Zendiel: I understand your frustration regarding this issue. For this situation, I will be creating a ticket that would be escalated to the next tier for further investigation. Would that be okay?<br />
dale13: well no, i want some type of tangible response today, so you escalate the ticket, that still does not answer the customer service issue, and what i am supposed to just stand around and wait for something magical to happen?<br />
dale13: question, you go into a store and buy a coke...you open the can and it is 1/2 empty<br />
dale13: when you go back into the store, do you care if Coca cola had a bottleing malfunction?<br />
Zendiel: Unfortunately, I cannot provide you the item from the pack that you purchased as this issue is currently being handled by a different department.&nbsp;<br />
dale13: would you then say ok, thanks for telling me?<br />
dale13: ok then tell me What company that department is in<br />
dale13: who do i need to talk to, to explain correct customer service?<br />
dale13: please send me the contact information for the company responsible for neverwinter for Xbox one<br />
Zendiel: I will be updating the ticket that you previously sent. Unfortunately, I cannot provide you with the item as this is currently being investigated.&nbsp;<br />
dale13: ok so basically you are saying there is nothing you can do...ok i get that....please send me the contact information for who can actually do something<br />
Zendiel: We are sad to say that we do not have a direct line for customer service. You can only contact us through our ticketing system.<br />
dale13: ok no problem I am sure social media will have a bunch of fun reading how you guys can't actually do anything to help your customers<br />
Zendiel: I am sad to hear that you felt that way. I can only suggest that you wait for a response from the ticket that you previously sent as this has been forwarded to the appropriate department for further investigation.<br />
dale13: i know it is not you per say, but you need to tell someone that to actually be a support for a product someone has to be able to make decisions and judgements<br />
Zendiel: Is there anything else I can help you with today?<br />
dale13: no i guess i will just have to use other means<br />
dale13: thankyou</blockquote>

<p>xbox will only tell you that the game developer has to fix it,we pay a subscription to xbox to even play these games but when arc wont fix know bugs,fix servers that have been complete unplayable for 3 days or in your case get the items you pay for they
 blow it off.</p>
<p>xbox need to make these companies accountable for your lack of support since we have to pay a fee just to use xbox live or we all stop paying for xbox live and take our business somewhere else</p>

<p>I have issues with Neverwinter as well. Their customer service is fairly poor.
</p>
<p>One more fairly big issue that has come to attention is that how are they managing to sell items (ZEN) in Australia when they have not been classified by the Australian Classification Board? I have spoken to the ACB and it seems the game has only been &nbsp;classified
 for PC and not XBOX1. </p>
<p>Why did XBOX1 allow the ZEN app to be active in Australia?</p>

<p>From where are you getting the drivers? You need to install drivers for all your hardware, including the motherboard (chipset) and your modem.</p>
<p>Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />

    <title>Red Dead Redemption not playing on my xbox one. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moneybags89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Red Dead Redemption not playing on my xbox one.</h2>
                    I bought a new copy of Red Dead Redemption that is clearly marked to play on Xbox 360 and Xbox One console but when I put in the disk to begin installation I get an error stating the game is not playable due to it not being on the backwards compatible
 list. Am I doing something wrong or is it something else?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to see if the game is BC and download the game, your console most be able to read the disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if your console can read other 360 discs ok. if it can, try cleaning the disc. If that does not work get the disc replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your console can't read other 360 games, or DVD disc movies, then the fault is with the console.</p>

<p>Hey there Moneybags!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get your console to let you play Red Dead.
</p>
<p>I would say that if you have this happen consistently, it could be due to your console needing to have the newest update applied to it again. When you can, try a soft reset.</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>It's
 a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(<strong>as</strong></span></span><span><span><strong>they
 will be removed</strong>) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Have you tried exchanging the disc for another one? It could be that the disc itself is damaged or corrupted.

</p><p>Your team's website can tell you if it's possible to download their schedule and, if so, what the downloadable format(s) are. Pick a format that your calendar app can import, follow your calendar app's instructions for importing a calendar, and - voila!

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Ok... This topic may be "out of the topic" under this category.... But where should I post this anyway? So here's the thing...</strong></p>
<p>if you can search my other question right here, You probably know that I was using windows vista. and that my computer was attacked by a virus.. So I was able to install a new O.S., Windows 7 Home Premium rather and recover almost every file I can retrieve...
 But one thing I've noticed weird for me...</p>
<p>Back then, When I was using Windows Vista, I noticed the the gadget of my sidebar, that CPU meter. The Process went more that 60% despite that I wasn't Doing anything with The PC... I was Curious and found a way to find out... By opening the Task manager
 and checking the process tab... And WOAH!!!! The Process Named UMonit.exe used most of the process.... or whatever... I was just curious what is this thing, a little digging made me worried for some said that It could be 50-60% dangerous... It also says that
 It runs at the startup.. It merely alerts when a usb(something is available). if this is just its functions, maybe it'd be better for me to remove it.... some said that by permanently removing it, I must uninstall a Driver called Genesys USB mass storage Device...
 Well, For now, I just Ended the process and the Process meter went down to 3%... But Would it be&nbsp;advisable.... I mean, what's the HArm revoming it?</p>

            I dont know whether you Genesys Mass storage driver / software installed this utility, and if uninstalling it would have any impact on a device you may have. its also possible that this utility may show in msconfig, the startup tab, where you could deselect
 it to prevent it starting on boot.

<h3> steve4291  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems booting up an Acer Travelmate Laptop </h2>
                    
<p><span>I am having problems booting up an Acer Travelmate 292LMi Laptop (running XP pro, SP3, 40GB Seagate HDD).<span>&nbsp; (No BSOD)</span></span></p>
<p><span>It started a week or so ago, when I got an error message:</span></p>
<p><em><span>Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:<br />
&lt;Windows root&gt;\system32\hal.dll.<br />
Please re-install a copy of the above file.</span></em></p>
<p><span>I scanned the internet, finding numerous problems similar to this, some saying it could be a HDD fault etc.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to re-boot the laptop using the XP installation discs, but the pc would not recognise the discs in the CD drive.</span></p>
<p><span>So I have no way of booting up the pc at all. I can’t even get to a DOS prompt to try anything from there…</span></p>
<p><span>After long hours scouring the web, I’m at a stage where I am now going ‘round in circles.</span></p>
<p><span>Acitions undertaken so far:-</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Within the BIOS it shows both the HDD &amp; DVD/CD Rom drives, so I assume they are installed OK.</span></li><li><span>I have changed the Boot device between HDD &amp; CD-ROM, but to no avail. (There is no FDD available).</span></li><li><span>When trying to boot to CD, I get:</span></li></ul>
<p><em><span>Checking Boot CD-ROM</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>No Bootable CD in ATAPI CD-Rom</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I have tried to boot other PC’s with the XP discs (Toshiba Sat Pro Laptop &amp; Self Built Desktop) and they are OK.</span></li><li><span>I found and downloaded “Seatools” from the Seagate website, wrote this to a CD and checked the HDD by using it in a second Laptop.<span>&nbsp;</span>Failed the short
 test, ran long test and fixed errors.</span> </li><li><span>I have removed the Laptop HDD &amp; attached it via an external USB HDD case and checked it with the Windows Disk Management software and all appears OK.</span></li><li><span>I have wiped the drive with this software, removing all partitions etc.<span>&nbsp;</span>It shows it now as 37.25GB Unallocated, properties are Type: Basic, Partition
 style: Master Boot Record.</span></li><li><span>When re-installed in the Laptop, I get:</span></li></ul>
<p><em><span>Checking Boot CD-ROM</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>No Bootable CD in ATAPI CD-Rom</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Hard disk boot sector invalid</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Press ‘H’ to retry Hard Disk, any other key for floppy</span></em></p>
<p><span>So if anyone has any ideas of where to go next (already tried the pub!) …</span></p>

<p>I'm sorry but your laptop has suffered hardware failure. From your description of the errors, I would say that the motherboard and the hard drive are bad. If the hard drive failed any of SeaTools' physical tests, it is toast. You cannot "fix" it by repairing
 bad sectors. If this is an older laptop, replacing the motherboard will not be cost-effective.</p>
<p>I must stress that you should not take what I have written as a definitive diagnosis. I cannot see or test your computer from here. I'm giving you my opinion about your computer based on my professional experience as a computer tech and on what you've written.
 For a more accurate diagnosis, take your computer to a reputable local professional (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As per the description, I understand that you are getting BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) on your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>

<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Does this issue appear while working on or opening a particular application?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What is the exact and complete BSOD error message/code you receive?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Were there any significant hardware or software changes made prior to this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows system uses separated user mode and kernel mode memory space, stop errors are mostly caused by kernel portion components, such as a hardware device, third-party drivers, backup software or anti-virus services.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When it detects some errors occur in the kernel, it shut down the computer box to prevent from some more severe damage. Then we get a blue screen or the system reboots (it depends on what the system settings are).</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s try these methods below and check if that solves the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disconnect all the external devices </span></strong><span>(printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc.) except mouse and the keyboard and try to boot the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If this fixes the issue, then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue. Then update latest driver for that particular device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Start your computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists.<span>&nbsp;

</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue does not appear in safe mode there could be possibility of some background programs conflicting with the smooth running of the computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start computer by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<p>1.Sometimes it runs perfectly for the whole day and my computer seems a lot more stable after i installed the latest drivers and used TuneUp Utilities. Yesterday it crashed when i was in facebook. Sometimes it crashes when i'm in a game. Sometimes it crashes
 when it is just running idle. Sometimes it doesnt crash at all.<br />
2. Where can i see that? I'm never expecting to get the blue screen so im not ready to take a picture of it or memorize the code.<br />
3. I'm sure it's not a hardware issue. The only thing i have changed in the past year is my new headset, but it crashes even if my headset is not plugged in.<br />
<br />
Right now it seems quite normal, but i can never know when another bluescreen hits me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ive tried method 1, That's not the problem. Ill try the methods 2 and 3 later today or tomarrow when i have time.<br />
&nbsp;My computer seems to work fine right now, there are some internet sites that cause the bluescreens but i dont need to use them so im good for now. Ill let you know when i get another bluescreen, or when i have tried the other 2 methods.</p>

<p><span>Well for starters we can not help you unless you provide us with some information about your network. Such as:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What Country do you live in?<br />
<br />
What make and model modem do you have?<br />
<br />
What make and model router do you have? <br />
<br />
Wired or Wireless connection to the console?<br />
<br />
If wireless, are you using any encryption? If yes, what type? <br />
<br />
Do you have one or more of these enabled? uPnP/DMZ/Port Forward?<br />
<br />
What is your NAT type? <br />
<br />
Any Error Codes you encounter?<br />
<br />
What type of internet do you have? Cable/DSL/T1/3G?<br />
<br />
Who is your ISP (Internet Service Provider)?<br />
<br />
Do you have the most current version of router firmware? You can check the manufacturer website for this information and compare it to your router information.<br />
<br />
Go to speedtest.net and run three tests; one close to you, one far from you and one in between. Then post your results here, including the ping.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>One thing to try before you do anything else is to do as suggested above by Mister Gwyther, unplug your modem and router for a few minutes then power them back up. Wait a minute and then connect your console
 and see if you can go online.<br />

<h2>            Home Network Computers Not Showing Up</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have my laptop and PC connected to the same network for file sharing, however my PC refuses to show up the network even when opening the network tab from the PC itself, even though it does show the laptop.</p>
<p>While trying to fix this problem, someone recommended doing a network reset from the "Open Network and Internet Settings" page which worked, my PC was showing up on the network and everything was working as it was suppose to.</p>
<p>The problem is, that every time the PC reboots, I have to do a network reset again and restart the PC only then does it become visible in the network tab. I've tried several methods including enabling the required services but this problem seems to persist.
 Is there any solution to this so I don't have restart my PC and do a network reset every time I want to share something over the network?</p>

            Rest assured, you are not alone.&nbsp; This bug affected my computer with build 1809 and it persists with build 1903.&nbsp; I have tried all the fixes I can, including the ones offered by Aditya_Roy and none of them work.&nbsp; So as with you I do a Network Reset when
 necessary.

            I an Running Windows 10 Education Build 1903, and my laptop is running the same build but Home version and is not having the same issue, only the desktop is (the education version).<br />
As for the 2 methods mentioned above, I've already tried those and several more.<br />
As the case is now, Network on the PC only Works for the first boot after a Network Reset.

<p>That is what I am experiencing although my desktop has Windows 10 pro.&nbsp; I have another three PCs that I need to network with and they all have Windows 10 home edition.&nbsp; It is only the Pro version which can't see itself until a network reset.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
 my printer is also networked via my hub and that also doesn't appear on the pro version until a reset.&nbsp; This is definitely a bug with was introduced with build 1809 and not fixed in 1903.&nbsp; Prior to that it was fine</p>

            It's weird that it's only on the Pro and above versions. Doesn't male much sense.
