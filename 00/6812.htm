<h2>            Validating Form Module</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I found this module and it works&nbsp;great except I cant get it to work without using a "Close Button" to triger the code if closed. Im using the default close that the report has and I dont want to use a close button so how could I triger the validation
 when either the form is closed OR the DB window is closed with the form open. Thanks!</p>

<p>I don't use Access, so I don't know whether the following will help, but you can trap the clicking of the X in the top right of a User Form with the following code:</p>

            <p>I found the code useful for my access database project however I had two problems with it.</p>
<p>a) the above code listed produces a 2455 error about a property of Dirty.</p>
<p>b) the code doesn't vaildate the two combo boxes&nbsp;type of controls I have on the form when I tab through this.
</p>
<p>Behaviourly&nbsp;when pressing tab, the cursor just passes right through without validating. Which is frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Credentials</h2>
                    <p>I have a user that recently had her My Documents folder moved to OneDrive. As soon as the move occurred Excel started to ask the user to login to her Office365 Business account each time she tries to save a file. When I check the user account information
 it looks like the user is logged into the account. So far the only thing I can see that is odd is with the Windows Credentials. There is no user name on the credential. I have tried to delete all Windows credentials and reboot, still the same thing, no user
 name. I've tried to edit the credential manually, again no change in behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our environment is a local Exchange server, our user names are different than our Internet addresses. This is a typical credential</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Address: MS.Outlook.15:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>User Name: xxx\user_name (where xxx is our internal domain)</p>
<p>Password: ********</p>
<p>Persistence: Enterprise</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of this specific user the User Name is blank</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are running Windows 10, latest update and all updates for Office 365 have been installed.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to resolve this would be appreciated</p>
<p>

    <title>Modifying Ribbon and ALT shortcuts. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> westcoastken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Modifying Ribbon and ALT shortcuts.</h2>
                    <p><span>I've recently migrated from Win 7/Office 2007 to Win 8.1/Office 365 (but currently using the&nbsp;2016 Preview). I'm trying to do the following:<br />
<br />
I have email templates of literally 2 dozen emails that go out daily/every other day.</span></p>
<p><span>To streamline the process in Outlook 2007&nbsp;I did the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Set up a new&nbsp;toolbar item
</span><span>in the standard toolbar </span><span>and called it&nbsp;"Email Templates" (in the screenshots I added "</span><span>Email Templates II</span><span>"
 item</span><span>&nbsp;so as not to disturb my original.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b89e61c5-37e1-4b00-b5d4-e7a668799dba" /></p>
<p><span>2. Then I inserted the&nbsp;"New Message" items.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d905354f-7fc9-4536-a005-366ae46edc66" /></p>
<p><span>3/4. I assigned a hyperlink directly to an Outlook message template.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a75c10b8-45f1-4ab9-8cf6-cc177336a4e2" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c694f20-8fc1-4f93-a4f4-96c43c9ce479" /></p>
<p><span>5. Named the new message item accordingly with an ampersand inserted for ALT shortcut keys.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df709659-02a6-46c6-8f43-90ec35c8d002" /><span><br />
<br />
So from then on when I hit: ALT M and then the corresponding shortcut key (B in the screenshots) it would open the appropriate template.<br />
<br />
End result: two commands (three keystrokes) and BINGO! the correct template was opened.<br />
<br />
Since I've jumped right from 2007 to 2016, I'm not accustomed to the Ribbon yet and I can't figure out how to customize the Outlook 365 ribbon to allow me to A. create a new group like this or B. modify the ALT shortcut keys of new/existing Ribbon items.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I know how to open a Template via: New Items &gt;&gt; More Items &gt;&gt; Choose Form &gt;&gt; Scroll to "User Templates in File System" &gt;&gt; Find the correct Template (many of which
 have almost identical names since they are sent for similar reasons).<br />
<br />
Not such a big deal until you have to do it 2 dozen times in a row - sometimes more.<br />
<br />
I had hopes when I saw the "Quick Steps" tool that I could setup stuff there, but it's so limited in commands and the new message command there converts to plain text and these emails all have links/pictures/etc... in them.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I spent an hour and a half getting bounced from support person to support person - even letting them remote access both systems so I could show them EXACTLY what
 I was trying to do - and then on the last person the connection was so bad that I couldn't hear them. They were supposed to call back but...HAHAHAHAHAHA.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone here can help me.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Ted,<br />
<br />
Before I get to what may be a solution,&nbsp;in the second link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first method is what I was talking about above with my "hopes when I saw the Quick Steps tool". The problem with that is it changes the formatting to plain text and my templates have links/picture/etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second option on that page doesn't really save any time. I already set a link to "Choose Form" on the ribbon - this saves literally two clicks. You still have to scroll to the right directory and then sort through dozens of templates to find the right
 one. Meh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's simpler, and what I've done for the moment, is&nbsp;to have a link to the Templates folder on my Desktop since at least there I can open the folder to full screen to locate the correct Templates. I can also create Desktop shortcuts with friendly names but
 again, this is a silly workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back up to&nbsp;the first link you sent:<br />
<br />
"You cannot create hyperlinked buttons to launch forms or other applications from the ribbon or QAT." - LOL, tell me something I didn't know! But they did! Because...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's followed by a link to this... http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/hyperlink-templates/</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS looks hopeful, but it has me creating Macros. I've never done that in Office. Wish me luck, I'll let you know how it works out. I'll try it now after I read the page a couple of times. "/<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

            <p>OK, this (<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/hyperlink-templates/)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/hyperlink-templates/)</a> worked - I created a macro to a template and added it to the Ribbon. Unfortunately, the item is called "<span>Project1.ThisOutlookSession.MakeItem</span>"
 and I have no idea how to properly name the macro in the VBA editor OR create a new one. Each time I hit ALT F11 it opens THIS macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will continue to explore, but any and all help is welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

            <p>BTW, I do know how to rename the Ribbon item. I'm talking about renaming the macros themselves since I'm going to need to create about 2 dozen (one for each template) I need to be able to change the name from "<span>Project1.ThisOutlookSession.MakeItem</span>"
 to a friendly name so I can tell which macro does what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, anyone know how I modify the ALT shortcut keys of new/existing Ribbon items? In 2007 you just put an ampersand before the letter you wanted to use. For example: "Missed &amp;Deadline"</p>
<p>would set "d" as the ALT+ shortcut.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<h2>            how to easily switch between cams during skype call &#40;version 8.3&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    In the previous version, there was a tiny icon on the Skype screen so that during a call I could immediately switch between my laptop cam and my external webcam. With Version 8, that icon is no longer there and I have to go into video setting to change
 the cam- awkward, and interrupts the flow of the call. Is there a shortcut in Version 8 to do this?

    <title>After last update of OneDrive for mac it is stuck in sync, when there - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            After last update of OneDrive for mac it is stuck in sync, when there is nothing to sync, everything is up to date</h2>
                    <p>On Aug. 4, 2017 (yesterday) I downloaded and installed the recommended update of OneDrive (version 17.3.6945) for mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then OneDrive has been stuck on trying to sync. When I update any files (create/edit, delete), OneDrive goes into sync, but doesn't seem to stop syncing! When I force OneDrive to stop (quit), and check my OneDrive folders on the web (through a browser),
 I find that all the updates have actually been done. However the OneDrive MAC App still runs trying to sync. those same files. An additional problem is that it is getting my CPU hot! OneDrive is utilizing almost constantly 95% of CPU resources. So, I have
 ot shut it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice how to fix the problem? Maybe uninstall and install the previous version of the app (previous to&nbsp;version 17.3.6945 for mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>OneDrive finally seems to be working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed all the steps above, but that didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted ot isolate whether the problem is in one of my files (unacceptable characters iin filename, zero size, etc.), or in the application itself and how it is configured on my mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I reset OneDrive one more time and re-connected my mac, and created a new test folder with only one file in it to see if it syncs. But it didn't. The same problem happened again where it was stuck in syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I reset OneDrive one more time, re-connected my mac, but selected only one folder to sync out of the hundreds of folders that make up my whole OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did the same thing, got hung up on syncing, but I left it this time and maybe after close to 20 minutes it started running and syncing that one single folder and FINISHED!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset OneDrive again, reconnected my mac and chose all of the hundreds of folders as before. Again, stuck on syncing for about 10-15 minutes, then all of the sudden started working again and finished. I just did small changes on one file and this time
 it worked correctly and synced it within few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't explain what happened, other than theorizing that this new version had to spend a long period of time ot get its counters/flags/status up to date and then start working again. For whatever this is worth, this is my explanation. If this is true, this
 version has a bug, and I don't know when it will re-appear agin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I am ok with continuing my work as-is, and thanks Yoga for your support!</p>

    <title>Win 10 x64 &#40;&#38; x32&#63;&#41; will not install if JMicron JMB36X - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john121&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 x64 &#40;&#38; x32&#63;&#41; will not install if JMicron JMB36X SATA card is installed</h2>
                    <p>MotherBoard is MSI 990XA-GD55 (AMD Chipset RD990). I use all 6 of the MB's SATA ports, but need more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Jmicron JMB36x 2x SATA extension installed in PCI x1 slot (JMB36x&nbsp;has 1x IDE slot, but this is not used).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, no matter what I try, Win 10 x64 will not install with the card present. Win 10 &nbsp;Install routine gives random changing error messages on install screen saying disk is GPT but should be MBR. Switched drive status from MBR&nbsp;to GPT and&nbsp;error message
 would change from one to the other, and even said there was insufficient space on a 2TB clean drive, when switching from GPT to MBR! It was impossible to install driver during Win 10 install to try to ensure Win 10 could see the card. Having the card installed
 with no drives connected to the JMB36x also caused the install to fail. Win 10 would fail whether the Install drive (C:) was connected to the MB or the JMB36x, it made no difference and Win 10 install fails! Win 10 fails to install regardless of disk size
 (tested from 1TB to 3TB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution was to completely remove the card from the PCI x1 slot (also tried in spare Graphics card x16 slot which didn't work either!), install windows, then&nbsp;switch off and reinstall card with drives attached, then install driver on re-boot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be fixed in time for the RTM release?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, this is also an issue in Win 7 x64 (I haven't tried to install in Win 8/8.1 environment).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you referring to MSE? If so, uninstall MSE:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a></p>
<p>Before installing again from the official download page:</p>
<p>What operating system and service pack?</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

    <title>Fixing &#34;Publisher Cannot Complete The Operation&#34; - Office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amit.kapoor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fixing &#34;Publisher Cannot Complete The Operation&#34; - Office 2010</h2>
                    I spend 7-8 hours trying to fix this and finally I am successful. The solution steps I followed:<br />
<ol>
<li>Change default printer (solution that worked for most people out there)</li><li>Remove all the printers that I don't use. (still no go)<br />
</li><li>Reinstall Office. (still no go)</li><li>Update Windows &amp; Office. (still no go)</li><li>Remove ADOBE PDF add-on for PDF generation &amp; remove all other apps I don't use (only a few) (the solution).<br />
</li></ol>
What finally worked for me is step 5. I strongly believe that it was Adobe PDF printing add-on. Even after removing the Adobe PDF printer, nothing worked, but the last step really solved it for me.<br />
<br />
Tip for everyone facing this issue: Remove all printer related software/tools one by one and see which one is the culprit.
<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - Can &#39;Find Related&#39; feature default to search only the current folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for a way set the 'find related' feature to search for only the current folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is I use the "find related messages from sender" feature frequently and move incoming emails into another folders. Unfortunately, even if I set the option to default to search the current folder, the "find related" feature still returns results
 from the entire mailbox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads to a longer search times and those items that have already been moved will also been shown up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask would there be any fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advances!</p>

    <title>Parameter Criteria on DateSerial Function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saar3369  say:</h3>
<h2>            Parameter Criteria on DateSerial Function</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Sample # where the date is the first part of the number. I use Left and Mid functions to extract the year, month and day and then DateSerial to join it in a normal date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I need to summarise the data in a query by month. This I can do successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now I want to enter criteria to define which month's summary I need. But then I get different types of error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My search on the Internet shows that there are a number of people with similar problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to enter criteria on a field whose underlying field has DateSerial in it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, is there any other way in which I can put the date together? Other than using Date Serial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            As the Sample # column's value presumably represents the year and month as substrings at specific positions then you don't need to worry about computing a date/time value from it; simply restrict the query on the substrings.&nbsp; If the value starts with the
 date in the format yyyymmdd for instance then:<br />
<br />
WHERE LEFT([Sample #],4) = "2014"<br />
AND MID([Sample #],5,2) = "08"<br />
<br />
would return the current month's rows.<br />
<br />
But the reason you have to jump through these hoops is that you are using a single column structured key.&nbsp; This is a bad idea.&nbsp; The key should be a composite one of two or more columns, of which one is a column of date/time data type.&nbsp; You can easily return
 the full structured value at any time by concatenating the formatted values of the columns into a single string expression in a computed column in a query, or a computed control in a form or report.<br />

<h2>            Nokia 101 - Assign SIM to contact</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everybody, I just got a Nokia 101 (FW 7.20) and I noticed there is the option to assign SIM1 or SIM2 to text or calls.</p>
<p>Is it possible to set a specific SIM to a specific contact, so that all communication (call + text) with that contact goes through that SIM?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the phone for work and I'd like to use the Work SIM for the Work contacts, and the private SIM for the private contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>word 2016 cannot open .doc file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> botanene  say:</h3>
<h2>            word 2016 cannot open .doc file</h2>
                    <p>I have a couple of .doc files I worked on last year (office 2013) that don't open in Office 2016 (64 bit). They still open in Office 2013 (I aske some else to try it for me) and after saving to .docx they open again.
</p>
<p>Strangely enough LibreOffice opens the .doc files without a problem. Compatibility of file types seems to be more difficult for Microsoft than for freeware...</p>
<p>Is there one or the other setting in Office 2016 that I might have to change (I do not want to check all my files for compatibility :-).</p>

            <p>Hi Parth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very strange, can't replicate the error anymore. In the afternoon I have restarted Word and the PC several times with no improvement, now I am at home and the PC is no longer docked - however it was not restarted since the last time I had the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway what happened was the following:</p>
<p>- Word hangs and says it has encountered a problem while opening the file, and that it is trying to recover the file. Word closed.</p>
<p>- Next time I opened Word, the file (or a newly saved version) was in the document recovery pane, but trying to open that version of the file still gave the same problem. Word generated a file with extension .asd and with with a name that has 'Liverecovery
 save of' preceding the original file name.</p>
<p>- Also the file (the original one) was listed in the 'disabled items' list (file/options/add-ins/go...). So it was basically judged to be unfit to be opened by Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this pattern is something you can recognize?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your efforts.</p>

            <p>To fix this issue, try opening control panel and search for Default Programs.</p>
<p>Click on Set Your Default Programs.</p>
<p>Now from the list of the installed applications, click WORD 2016 and click SET THIS PROGRAM AS DEFAULT and click OK.</p>
<p>This step mostly fixes this issue.</p>

    <title>Unusual Sign-in Activity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> optical24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unusual Sign-in Activity</h2>
                    <p>I just received an email from Microsoft saying:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unusual sign-in activity</p>
<p>
</p><p>We detected something unusual about a recent sign-in to the Microsoft account&nbsp;*****.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign-in details:</p>
<p>Country/region: India</p>
<p>IP address: 120.61.34.167</p>
<p>Date: 6/22/2018 12:26 PM (GMT)</p>
<p>Platform: Mac OS</p>
<p>Browser: Chrome</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please go to your recent activity page to let us know whether or not this was you. If this wasn't you, we'll help you secure your account. If this was you, we'll trust similar activity in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the email address: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and according to Microsoft, it is legit. Source "https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/13967/microsoft-account-unusual-sign-in". I checked my "recent activity" on both
 my email and recovery email, but there seems to be no unusual sign-ins? As a precaution, I did change my password.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried with my Skype id and with the address registered with it, and no way, I get a systematic :</p>

</p><p>I consider "Away" a very useful status to let people know that you are not in front of the computer. Any chance to customize statuses in the future? Thanks</p>

    <title>Creating sub-documents from parts of master document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> utinni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating sub-documents from parts of master document</h2>
                    <p>I have a master document with a lot of parts included, but will often need to make documents from this document that do not include all headings (levels include 1 and 2) of the master. Each part is not long, but they are many. I am looking for a streamlined
 fashion to move terms over to shell documents prepared for different types of scenarios.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best guess is using macros and may a user-form to move it over, but I'm new to the more advanced uses of word, especially macros. I'm familiar with Excel Macros, so I can see how it is possible there, but not here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could get a direction on how best to go about this, I can look around for specifics as to more details, but any information on best direction would be great as I'm at a loss other than that guess above.
</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>The first question is whether the result of the expression is time independently determined by the values
 in the columns referenced by the expression.<span>&nbsp; </span>If so then you should not store it in a column in a table, but compute it, either in a computed control as you are doing, or in a computed column in a query.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An example of an expression whose result
<i>should not</i> be stored in a column in a table would be:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>=[UnitPrice]*[Quantity]</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>where both UnitPrice and Quantity are columns in an OrderDetails table.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The gross price being computed here is time independently determined by UnitPrice and Quantity, so can be computed at any time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Storing it in a table would introduce redundancy and the possibility of update anomalies.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An example of an expression whose result
<i>should</i> be stored in a column in a table would be:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>=[cboProductID].Column(1)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>where cboProductID is a combo box control bound to the ProductID in an OrderDetails table, where the combo
 box's RowSource is:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SELECT ProductID, UnitPrice, Product FROM Products ORDER BY Product;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this case UnitPrice is not time independently determined by ProductID as the price of a product will
 change over time, whereas the price in each row in OrderDetails should remain static as that when the order was created.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So in this case the control should not use the above expression as its ControlSource property, but should be bound to a UnitPrice column in OrderDetails, and the current Unit price should be assigned to this control by means of the following code in
 the AfterUpdate event procedure of the cboProductID combo box:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Me.UnitPrice = Me.cboProductID.Column(1)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Generally, you <strong>wouldn't want to</strong>&nbsp;do this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storing data into a table when it can be calculated accomplishes three things: it wastes disk space (trivial these days I know), wastes time (almost any calculation is MUCH faster than a disk fetch), and worst, risks the integrity of your data. If the calculated
 field or one of the fields that went into the calculation is edited, you now have data which is
<em>wrong, </em>with no easy way to tell that it is wrong or what is the correct value! Generally you just want to recalculate the expression whenever it's needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you feel that this is not applicable in your case please post the expression and explain why you need to store the result.</p>

            As Ken and John explained you do not want to do this. As a general rule we don't store calculated values, so you don't even want to have the field in your table. The expression you use can be used anywhere you need to display that value.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>But a word of explanation, for a control on a form to update the underlying table the control's Controlsource property needs to be set to the field in the table. So you can't have a controlsource set to an expression AND the field.&nbsp;</div>

<h3> johnmcquillian  say:</h3>
<h2>            New install&#58; where are program icons&#63;</h2>
                    Just installed 2010 by download. The applications work with existing office files but there are no office icons anywhere to be seen to launch new programs. When I look in 'all programs' from the start button menu I see an MS Office folder but the folder
 is empty. When I look on the control panel for installed programs Office is definitely there. How do I get the usual program icons onto the start menu or task bar or anywhere i can see them?

            <p>Hi Johnmcquillian,</p>
<p><span>Thanks for the question! This issue may occur if you have multiple versions of Office installed on the computer or if the Office installation is corrupt. Don’t worry we can help you with this issue, but I’m going to need a little more information first.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the edition of Office installed on the machine?</span></p>
<p><span>Did you download and install Office 2010 trial or a full version?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Lets us follow the below steps and check if it helps fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Verify if you have multiple versions of Office installed on the machine by going to programs and features list.</span>
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Go to Control panel </span></li><li><span>Programs and features </span></li><li><span>Look for the installed Office suites </span><span>. </span></li></ul>
<p><span>2. If there are no multiple versions of Office<span> </span>in the list, close the window and follow the below steps.</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Check if you are able to view and access the Office icons from the default installed location.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Windows 7 32bit: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 64bit: C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14</span></p>
<p><span>Or</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold Windows key + R</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>In Run window type </span><span style="font-weight: bold">%programfiles%</span><span>
</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Go to Microsoft Office, Office 14 and look for Outlook.exe </span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>If you find Excel or Word try to open the program and check if you are able to access it.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>If you are able to open then create shortcuts for the Outlook applications on the desktop, right click on each Office icon one by one and click on
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Send</span><span> </span><span style="font-weight: bold">to, Desktop (Create shortcut).</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3. If the above steps fail, then try performing a repair\uninstall and reinstall the Office 2010 suite and check if the icons appears.</span>
</p>

<p>(Note: If you are uninstalling and reinstalling the Office suite , ensue to have the product key and the setup file to reinstall the suite)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above steps helps. If you need any further assistance reply and we will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            How do I backup the data on my 6700 slide&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 6700 slide, and I have problems with the memory. The phone says the memory is full, even though I removed all the files I can, and cleared the cache in the internet browser. When i remove things the amount of memory doesn't change at all. Now I
 can't take photos, and I can't put any music in my phone at all, it's very frustrating!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read that it could be a good idea to hard reset the phone to free up memory. But then I'll need to do a backup on my data, but how do I do that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's basically the contacts i need to backup, since I sort of removed all the other files....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using a Mac, so I can't use the PC suite program.</p>

            <p>Graham, why Nokia was not interested in a one-button backup in Symbian/S60, that is beyond me as well. Therefore, we have to find workarounds now. Does one of these help:</p>
<p>A) Nokia » Menu » (Office ») File manager » Options » Back up phone memory</p>
<p>B) Nokia » Menu » Contacts » Options » Create backup » Phone to memory card</p>
<p>C) Apple Boot Camp</p>
<p>D) acquaintance with Windows computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, your friend is about migrating to a new phone, isn’t he? In that case, please, mention the new phone model as well. Perhaps we find an easier way to migrate the data. Then, on the new phone he might be able to create a backup more easily.</p>

<p>There is NO fix, as far as I know.</p>
<p>I have a Nokia E6-00, and MULTIPLE bluetooth headsets (I have a hard time trying to find a comfortable fit + good sound combo).</p>
<p>I also own a Nokia N79, like you do.</p>
<p>So, with all of my other headsets I DO have a sound coming in the bluetooth headsets when the silent profile is activated in my cell phones (BOTH of them), but with the NEWEST Nokia BH-609. there is NONE.</p>
<p>I think, it is the bluetooth - phone incompatibility.</p>
<p>I decided I will try another headset, thinking, it might be that the unit was defective, but after reading your post, I think it is just a bug.</p>
<p>If I were you, I would try a different headset with your Nokia N79, maybe even several headsets, in silent mode.</p>
<p>IF none of them works, then something is wrong with your phone.</p>
<p>BUT, alas, there is NO fix.</p>

<h3> miloinsandiego  say:</h3>
<h2>            My favorites folders are still out there on C&#58;&#47;users, but IE is not showing them</h2>
                    Something went odd in my Win7 computer about a week again and a whole lot of default locations in my computer started pointing to an external drive location instead of my C:/users/milo file.<br />
<br />
IE seems to have taken a hit.&nbsp; It works in general, but nothing shows up for Favorites anymore.<br />
I can still see that the C:/users/milo/favorites file is on my hard drive, but IE doesn't seem to point to it anymore.<br />
When I do the dropdown on "favorites", it just shows four menu options, with nothing underneath "Organize Favorites".&nbsp;
<br />
And if I click on that option, all that happens is that the menu disappears.<br />
<br />
I've tried the Restore Settings button...the "reset" button...uninstalling version 9...nothing seems to be pointing it back to C:/users/milo/favorites.<br />
Some threads have said to right click on "Favorites" and look at a "Locations" tab, but I don't know if they mean the menu options called Favorites (right clicking there only shows toolbar options) or if they mean to right-click on the "Favorites" and choose
 properties from there, but there's no Locations tab there either.<br />
<br />
There must be some way to just tell IE where to look for "Favorites", right?<br />
<br />
Add to the frustration that I tried to get back to IE9...it runs a few minutes and then tells me it couldn't do it...with no explanation.<br />
But one thing at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><b><span>Method I:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps to fix your favorites or favorites bar.
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open the
<b>Start menu</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the Start Search, type in the
<b>shell: Favorites</b> for the missing Personal User folder and press <b>
Enter</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: For example, I'm using the shell: My Music shell command for the Music personal user folder.</span></p>
<p><span>c. This should open the
<b>missing personal user folder</b> from its <b>current location</b> and
<b>replace it in the Start menu.</b></span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Check to see if the personal user folder has returned to the Start menu or
<b>C:\Users\(user name) location.</b> Sometimes a <b>restart is needed</b>. If the user folder did not return, then proceed to
<b>Method 2</b> below.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method II:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a.
<b>Right click</b> on the user folder that you want to restore the default location for and click on
<b>Properties</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Do this from the
<b>C:\Users\ (user name)</b> location for the best results and not from the Start menu user folders.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click on the
<b>Location</b> tab. </span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: If you do not have a Location tab, then this is not the correct user folder and is only a normal folder that has the same name as the
 user folder. You will most likely need to use <b>step c</b> in this case instead.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on the
<b>Restore Default button</b> and click on <b>OK</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>d. If you get this, then click on
<b>Yes</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click on
<b>Yes</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>WARNING: If you do not click on Yes, you will have two copies of the personal user folder in the main (user name) folder with one being as
 described in the NOTE under step b.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps and keep us posted.</span></p>
        </p>

            Thank you for writing.&nbsp; I accidentally clicked the button that said it was answered but I have not made progress.&nbsp; Please read on:<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not following step B.&nbsp; If I click the start button, a white search box pops up that says "Search Programs and files".&nbsp; I'm assuming that's where you're suggesting that I type in "<span><b>shell: Favorites".&nbsp;</b> If i'm wrong about that, that's the main
 thing.&nbsp; If I'm right, keep reading...<b><br />
<br />
</b></span>I type in "shell: Favorites" in quotes and it only finds your email to me.&nbsp; Or, I type it without quotes (as you probably intended) and it brings up about 15 emails and documents that have these words in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't follow at all what the word
 'shell' with the colon is supposed to be accomplishing there.&nbsp; Regardless, this leaves me unsure how to proceed.<br />
<br />
If you didn't mean for me to type the word shell at all and just meant Favorites (in which case I don't know what shell referred to), I did that and it found 2700 items.&nbsp; Among them, there are 13 folders called Favorites and one of those is the one that I want
 IE to point to.&nbsp; Is there something you're asking me to do with that folder?&nbsp; I am not getting what would "<span>open the
<b>missing personal user folder</b> from its <b>current location</b> and <b>replace it in the Start menu."&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>All i've done is search on the word "Favorites".<br />
<br />
Clearly i'm missing something big here.<br />
<br />
<br />
I opened Exploring and drilled down to C:\Documents and Settings\milo\Favorites .&nbsp; As alluded to in your note, there is no&nbsp; "Locations" tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how it could be "only a normal folder that has the same name" when it's the only folder there, but I
 continued with your directions.&nbsp; It says to "Click on the Restore Default button"&nbsp; What "Restore Default" button?&nbsp; The only thing I could find in the Properties box that said that was on a tab called "Customize" and there's a "Restore Default" that is for
 folder pictures, but that doesn't seem to connect to this issue at all.<br />
<br />
Then I thought, maybe Rohit means directly off the right click and not under the Properties box.&nbsp; There is an option there called "Restore Previous Versions" but as that doesn't quite match your wording and isn't a "button", i wasn't going to try that without
 being told that that was what you were referring to.<br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi Joe and thanks for the effort.<br />
Unfortunately, I got as far as this step:<br />
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Previous Versions</strong></li><li>Wait for the list of previous versions to load</li><li>Select a version that was before you lost the files/folders</li></ul>
<p>but where the list could come up, it comes up with "There are no previous versions available"<br />
</p>
<br />
I believe the source of all this trouble is that during a back-up to my external hard drive (called M:) last week -- something I do weekly with a simple drag and drop of folders from the C: drive -- something went wrong and when I woke in the morning, my user
 profile seemed to point to M!&nbsp; I've slowly been straightening it out....repointing Outlook to my C drive (easily done), macros back to C: (no problem there either), etc.&nbsp; But i suspect something in IE got hosed at that time and it's looking in the wrong place
 for my favorites.&nbsp; In fact, if I go to a website and choose a random webpage and say "Add to favorites", it doesn't object.&nbsp; It's putting it somewhere, I think.&nbsp; I just have no idea where or why it isn't, at least, showing newly assigned favorites.<br />
<br />
I just added a silly random youtube video to my favorites on IE.&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZUPCB9533Y&nbsp;&nbsp; My hope was that if I could search my computer via the start button for kZUPCB9533Y, it might tell me if it actually saved that favorite somewhere.&nbsp;
 The search turned up nothing.<br />
<br />
Thank you both again for any more ideas you have.&nbsp; Kind of maddening!<br />

You don't want a space between the two words.&nbsp; The only separator is the colon.</p>
<p>However, I think trying to use the Start menu Search bar could be problematic anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would do it in either a&nbsp; Run... dialog (e.g. press Win-R for that) or in a&nbsp;Windows Explorer&nbsp;window's Address bar (press Win-E and then Alt-d before typing for that).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Either should leave you in an Explorer window with the path to the current Favorites folder in its Address bar, press Alt-d, Ctrl-c to see and capture that.</p>
<p>When you do that you should then be able to go up in the path (e.g. use the parent "bread crumb link"&nbsp;or otherwise navigate up one level&nbsp;Alt-V,G,U) to show that folder in the Windows Explorer window.&nbsp; If you right-click on that you may then be able to see
 the Location tab which could allow you to Move...&nbsp;the folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure how well that would work if it involves a different drive though.</p>

            I held the Windows button and clicked the R.&nbsp; A little window popped up that said Run at the top.<br />
In the entry field, I typed shell:Favorites without a space.&nbsp; A nasty noise was made and a pop-up came up that said "Windows cannot find 'shell:Favorites'.&nbsp; Make sure you typed the name correctly and try again."<br />
<br />
Tried it with the external drive both on and off with the same results.<br />
<br />
If I had gotten further, though, I'm not sure I'd have known what bread-crumb-link referred to.&nbsp; ;-)<br />

<p><br />
That's interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may explain your symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; See if that message is because&nbsp;of the shell:&nbsp; part or because of the Favorites part.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. try the same thing with&nbsp; shell:History&nbsp; and&nbsp; shell:cache</p>

I am assuming that the OS is W7.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a new feature in it in which the normal path in the Address bar is usually hidden and broken into "links".&nbsp;&nbsp; The presentation is thus called "bread crumbs".&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm...&nbsp; well a web search proves that in fact the feature
 has been present in Windows since Vista and apparently is better knows as "breadcrumb bar"&nbsp; (no space).&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not find any useful official description.&nbsp;&nbsp; As usual it must be one of the intuitively obvious UI components of Windows which needs no documentation
 or explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; }</p>

            This problem got solved with my bigger problem:&nbsp; I have no idea why but the computer started running many resources off my external drive instead of C: .&nbsp; On a whim, I tried doing the "System Restore" repeatedly until suddenly, it started looking at C:
 again.<br />
<br />
And the IE problem disappeared with it.<br />
