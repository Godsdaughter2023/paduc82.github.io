<h2>            E72 proxy settings&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hey can anyone help me with setting proxy settings on applications? At university we have a wlan using a proxy server, i set up my access point with proxy settings and port number. Web browsing works fine: when i start web browsing, i am asked to enter
 my user name and password. But the problem starts when i want to use applications like Vyke Mobile, Chat, E-mail. Somehow there is no connection. I searched the settings of these applications in order to see if there is some place i could enter a proxy/port
 number, but nothing worked. Any suggestions please, it's driving me crazy !!!!

            S60 does not support proxy authentication in this way. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

<p>You can set up a VPN connection with your Uni as described on page 129 of the English manual. However, setting up VPN is not an easy task. You better contact your IT department for the right settings and certificates.</p>

            The problem is big , however the solution is really easy :). I was stuck in the same situation and thought of the workaround.<br />
On any laptop or desktop in your university , install a cascading proxy enabled software , one which takes your requests and then forwards it to the server with authentication credentials.<br />
I use "<a href="http://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/</a>"<br />
<br />
This will make the desktop/laptop a new proxy server. Enter the ip address of this pc in your nokia device and start surfing :).<br />

            Not at this time. In the FAQ it does state that some hardware configs are not supported in the Technical Preview. Also, Virtual setups are pretty much hit or miss...

            <p>I worked at it and reset BIOS CPU to support Virtual Machines and that enabled full 64 bit capability.&nbsp; That eliminated the Physical Address Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I booted the Virtual Machine straight from the ISO file instead of the DVD burn I made.&nbsp; It's running now.</p>

<h2>            Performance of Windows 10 TP</h2>
                    <p>I find the performance of the TP amazing....not what I expected from a beta.&nbsp; Everything works well on my setup with only a few minor glitches and could be used as is for my working OS.&nbsp; I remember the first betas of Windows 95 (Chicago with 16 to 20 floppies
 mailed to you!) where&nbsp;there were problems with almost everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other old-timers&nbsp;out there who&nbsp;remember&nbsp;Win-95 or DOS 6.0 betas?&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I would say it is because this is in fact&nbsp;8.1 with some extra features/tweaks for desktop users. That's the reason why there are no bigger issues with&nbsp;system, drivers, etc. It is not like 95 which was a completely new system, a big step from 3.11,&nbsp;reworked
 from the scratch. I also use this as&nbsp;my&nbsp;primary system.&nbsp;I would use 7 but 8 is much faster and stable and I cannot stand 8.1 because of UI. I want a desktop system and not some hybrid :) Looking forward for customer preview and then for final build!</p>

            <p>There have been many changes/improvements in the OS codebase over Win 8/8.1, it really is a new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The use of the Win 8.1 UI for the starting point of the preview would simply seem to be for convenience, what you see here may or may not be&nbsp;part of the UI included in the final release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too prefer the Win 8 UI and I am not a fan of the current trend here to take things back to the old desktop metaphor.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, the TP is proving to be a wonderful experience...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am one of the old ones. I would like to see a new OS roll out with the impact of Win 3.1 or Win 95 that brought requirements for new hardware though. It seems that software development is lagging behind in providing uses for the new hardware available
 and not assisting in growth of the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the final release of Win 10 will make more use of the "Internet of Things" advancements that are/will be available than we see in this early preview.&nbsp;Or perhaps the release after that.</p>

            <p>I recommend that you notice the usage of the Windows key on the keyboard. The ability to press the Windows key and type a character or two (without caring where the cursor is) to launch anything on the PC is a wonderful advancement in "ease of use".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new keyboards from Microsoft and Logitech that were brought out (and included or emulated with many/most new PC purchases) as an adjunct to the Win&nbsp;8 interface, with Charms buttons and touch enabled pads included, make the new interface very easy to
 navigate.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to answer your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know through which player you are trying to play the DVD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that in Windows 10, you will need the DVD player app to play DVDs. However, if you do not have the app, you will have to purchase it from the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can use your favourite search engine and look for media player that supports DVD playback.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Win 10 does not include a program to play DVDs.&nbsp; MS does have a DVD player app in the app store.&nbsp; If you upgraded from certain versions of Windows, you can get that app for free.&nbsp; Otherwise, you have to pay for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Or, there are various other programs you can use - Some free and some not.&nbsp; As already mentioned, a Web search should turn up lots of possibilities.&nbsp; FWIW, one free player that I've seen recommended is VLC Media Player (I don't play DVDs on my computer,
 so I can't really comment on it).&nbsp; FYI, I've read that there is a VLC app in the MS app store, but that the "regular" program is much better, so you probably want to go to the VLC site and d/l the player from there, rather than go to the app store.</p>

            &nbsp;The MS app store should be there in the Start menu.&nbsp; You should be able to find the DVD player app there easily enough (I haven't looked).&nbsp; But, like I said, there are other programs you could use, including some that are free, so you might want to look
 into that first.

            I am having the same problem as was described in this post and have been reading multiple threads trying to find a sensible answer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When I inserted a DVD in my DVD player, Autoplay reacted about 8 minutes after I inserted the DVD.&nbsp; I then asked me to select an App that would let me play this and suggested "Movies and TV" and also suggested that I could go to the APP Store to try to find
 another APP.&nbsp; Since "Movies and TV" was already installed, I chose this. Unfortunately, this APP does not seem to want to look at my DVD device, it only wants me to download something from the MS store.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Microsoft should provide a clear set of instructions about how to play a DVD in Windows 10.&nbsp; It appears that many people share the same frustration.&nbsp;
<br />

</p><blockquote>When I inserted a DVD in my DVD player, Autoplay reacted about 8 minutes after I inserted the DVD.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It sounds like Windows may be having problems with your DVD drive.&nbsp; Can you look at the DVD contents in File Explorer?&nbsp; You could also check Device Manager and see if the drive is listed there.&nbsp; I've seen some posts about problems getting Win 10 to recognize
 some DVD drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;As for playing a movie, the "standard" Win 10 doesn't come with DVD player software.&nbsp; MS does have a DVD player app in the store, but that costs money, unless you upgraded from certain versions of Windows.&nbsp; There are also a number of other programs out
 there that will play DVDs, some of which are free.&nbsp; But the first thing is to make sure that your DVD drive is working properly under Win 10.</p>

            Thanks to James 1509 for your reply.&nbsp; As an answer to your questions:&nbsp; Yes, the DVD player shows up in Device Manager and Yes, File Explorer can read the DVD as well.&nbsp; My problem seems to be associated with either an Autoplay problem or with the lack of
 a DVD player APP.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have tried to download the Toshiba Video Player which comes with my machine but have had trouble with the install.&nbsp; Is there a good DVD Player that people. can recommend?

            &nbsp;I don't play DVDs on my computer, but some have recommended VLC Media Player.&nbsp; FYI, I've read that there is a version of VLC Media Player in the MS app store, but the "full" program is better, so you might want to go to the VLC site to get it, instead
 of the app store.

            &nbsp;Can you open a DVD in File Explorer and look at the files on it?&nbsp; That would at least confirm that the DVD drive is working in Windows.&nbsp; If that works, I don't know why the DVD player software isn't working.&nbsp; What happens when you try it?&nbsp; Are you getting
 any error messages?

    <title>n82 camera issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moder---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            n82 camera issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hi anyone who can help, am very good with troubleshooting/diss assembly of most things BUT, have my fab much loved n82 which has been sitting for 4yrs in storage with a broken screen, have recently replaced screen and brought phone back into use, screen
 proceedure worked well, went a step further and bought a replacement geniun n82 complete cover/case due to damage&nbsp;to old. with tools supplied with new covers and detailed instructions removed old components and transferred them into new casing. on assembly
 discovered that old keypad had a small circuit ribbon connecting keypad to phone circuit board. problem being that end of ribbon connected to keypad square directional key, not sure of its purpose, could not be unplugged,nor could&nbsp;I find it in any dissaembly
 proceedures. New replacement pad did not include this or was not part of this keypad. dilema was to either cut or disconnect ribbon or cut existing directional keypad out with ribbon attched &nbsp;and incur it into new keypad. there is distinctive circuitry visable
 under this key but is not separablefrom directional key either. what to do?</p>
<p>second for me the best part of the phone is the carl ziess camera, which to my understanding is a light sensitive activated camera ( when slid flab is opened camera turns on), this worked before case transfer but does not activate camera now ( **bleep**),
 have pulled it down again but could not find anything. What have I done wrong?</p>
<p>However when bar code scanner is activated the camera does work, obviuosly only for scanner options.</p>
<p>The other small camera does work also.</p>
<p>Menu options relating to both cameras do not give an indication of option to change from secondary camera to primary camera anymore or visa versa.</p>
<p>Have spoken to Nokia support, have hard and soft reset phone per thier instructions, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Please can any give advice on attempting to rectify these problems, short on sending it in to get repaired.</p>
<p>Much appreciated.</p>
<p>Luke</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about the problems with your phone. Obviously, any modifications you undertake yourself could further damage the phone. If you knew what you were doing, you wouldn't need to come here and ask for help, if you chose to go down that route. It
 is prohibited on these forums for discussions of those types. If you really need your phone repaired, please visit your local Nokia Care point.</p>

<p>Look I didn't come here to be critised by you and left in the dark by nokia. Im certainly not an idiot when it comes to changing phone covers as the old one was simply broken, followed all instructions to the letter, all I wanted was some advice not to be
 belittled by an idiot who doesn't know the full story, sending it to nokia to change a cover would simply make the phone a costly repair and a waste of time for me, yes it was my mistake to sign up to this forum for any help, my opinion still stands with nokia.
 no need to reply im outa here for good.</p>

<h2>            OneNote Online not showing proper page title &#47; indentation</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue where the browser-based version of OneNote displays certain pages in the page list as "Untitled Page" without proper indentation until I explicitly click on the page. After a few seconds, the page title shows up and the page automatically
 indents as intended in the page list.</p>

    <title>Loop through only Visible PivotItems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freshjivin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loop through only Visible PivotItems</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a pivot table and I have one field in my row labels, the field is called bill_to, in my column labels I have a field called product, and in my values area of the pivot table I have a field called amount.&nbsp; I'm placing a filter on a product value and the
 pivot table is then showing me the bill_to clients whom revenue was generated from for those products.&nbsp; How do I loop through the bill_to column and grab only the bill_to clients that are visible on the pivot table, at the moment I'm using the PivotItem Object
 but that appears to be looping through all bill_to clients and not just the ones that I can see on the pivot table based on the filters applied.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Simon<br />

<p>Hi <strong>Elmercloud</strong>,</p>
<p>To troubleshoot script errors in Internet Explorer on Windows-based computers you may follow below step and see if they can resolve the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disable script debugging</strong></p>
<p>If the only sign of a problem is the error message, and Web sites are working, you can probably ignore the error. Also, if the problem only happens on one or two Web pages, it might be a problem with those pages. If you decide to ignore the errors, you can
 disable script debugging.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If this problem occurs on more than one or two sites, do not disable script debugging. Go to method 2 now.</p>
<p>To turn off the Scripting Debugger in Internet Explorer 6, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Tools menu, click Internet Options.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Advanced tab, click to select the Disable script debugging check box, and then click OK.</p>
<p>To turn off notification about every script error in Internet Explorer 7, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Tools menu, click Internet Options.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Advanced tab, click to clear the Display a notification about every script error check box, and then click OK.</p>
<p>In most cases, you can ignore them. Script error messages are displayed by Internet Explorer when there is a problem with the JavaScript or VBScript code on the website you are viewing. Occasionally a script error can be caused by an error in downloading
 a webpage, but more often it is an error in the webpage itself.</p>
<p>Refer the below Microsoft kb article and try the steps mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot script errors in Internet Explorer on Windows-based computers</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308260</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To resolve the problem, disable all script blockers if any temporarily and try again. If that does not help, execute the following commands from Start, Run dialog:</p>
<p><strong>regsvr32 jscript.dll <br />
regsvr32 wshom.ocx <br />
regsvr32 scrrun.dll</strong></p>
<p>If the problem persists, try reinstalling Windows Script 5.7 from Microsoft site.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=47809025-D896-482E-A0D6-524E7E844D81&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=47809025-D896-482E-A0D6-524E7E844D81&amp;displaylang=en</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>If the issue persists then, I would suggest you to perform Internet Explorer Optimization on your computer and check for the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>How to optimize Internet Explorer</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936213</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Step 4:<br />
<br />
</strong>a. go to internet options.<br />
b. Select security tab.<br />
c. Under Custom level.<br />
d. Ensure that "<strong>Initialize and script active x controls</strong>" is not marked safe for scripting and mark them enabled and i think your problem will be removed<br />

    <title>Hotmail accounts stopped working in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leslier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail accounts stopped working in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Outlook 2010 with Windows 7 for some time with no problem. I have several hotmail.com and msn.com email accounts. Then a week or so ago I stopped being able to get or send email from these accounts. I received Microsoft Outlook Hotmail Connector
 message "We were unable to sign in to your account. Please try again. Could not authenticate against the Windows Live ID service. Please try again later."&nbsp; Also, when I try to send/receive from any one of these accounts I get the error:&nbsp; "Sending reported
 error (0x80040126) : 'The operation cannot be performed because the connection to the server"</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, I did nothing to my pc that should have had any effect on Outlook. I've searched the forums for solutions and it's clear that this is a problem for many people. I've uninstalled and reinstalled Outlook Connector. I changed the settings
 in Internet Explorer (which I never use). I've deleted one of the accounts in Outlook and then tried to recreate it, with no success in fact I get yet another error message " The set of folders cannot be opened. The file C:\Users\... is not an Outlook data
 file (.ost). Really??? Outlook just created this file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, I am very frustrated and am finding it hard to believe that Microsoft Outlook is generally incompatible with the email clients it sells to customers like me.&nbsp; I would like to figure out how to fix this, but thankfully, my other computer,
 a MacBook Pro, has a more stable email client.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft community. We're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you. You said you were unable to get to your account on Outlook 2010 as you're receiving something saying "We were unable to sign in to your account. Please try again later".
<br />
<br />
You also get an error when sending, but as you said, you did nothing to your PC. You mentioned about deleting and recreating an account in Outlook but with no success.<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes in your account prior to the problem? If so, let us know the specific changes as well as the exact steps.<br />
<br />
What you can do is to try to access your account via Outlook.com web, and let us know if the issue persists.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We will wait for your reply.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            <p>I made no changes to Outlook before the problem started. Accessing my account on Outlook.com defeats the purpose of having the Outlook application on my PC. I can certainly access all my email accounts online -- but only one at a time -- I use Outlook to
 see all my email accounts in one place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty much the last straw that's leading me to ditch Windows and switch entirely to a Mac.</p>

            The advantage of Outlook is to have a single point to see multiple email accounts - I don't want to have to look at each account in a different browser window. I have now stopped using Outlook and have switched from my PC to a Mac. It's so much simpler!

            Interestingly, I have seen no solution to this issue or any official word from Microsoft. I haven't received an email in my inbox from my msn account since November 26, 2014. So I downloaded a new email client (Mailbird), simply added my msn account when
 I first launched with my email name and password and the program auto-configured and the emails flowed right in with no issue. I see that if you want more than 3 accounts there is a small fee for their lifetime pro version. Given the already usefulness of
 this email client and no resolution from Microsoft in sight, it looks like I may do that and simply dump outlook.

            I never received any additional information from Microsoft, and I have indeed switched my mail to a Mac -- along with all my other apps. It's frustrating to pay good money for Outlook and then have it stop being compatible with Microsoft's own Hotmail
 mail! Glad to know about Mailbird if I even need to go back to my PC.

    <title>Cannot delete email account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ddale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete email account</h2>
                    
<p>I went to create a new email account and something happened and I was interrupted while setting up the account. The account that I was creating does not show up under the account picker screen so I cannot delete it,
 however the name that I had initially assigned the account shows up on the sliding panel home page. I cannot select the account from the sliding panel screen, it just flashes and is not selectable (incredibly annoying).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I change home pages to a different theme, the ghost accounts do not show up, only on the sliding panel home screen, and returns when I reselect the sliding panel setting. When I go
to create a new email account with the rogue accounts name, I receive an error like "That account name already exists", since apparently&nbsp;the name remains registered somewhere on the device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to reset pocket outlook so get rid of the ghost account settings? I'd also take a custom script for the home screen that&nbsp;keeps the other mail accounts and just ditches the ghost account. I've tried using MailAccountRepair and
 it says the repair failed.&nbsp;It also will not delete the account, but it does show that the account exists when I run the program. I really do not want to hard reset the device as I've installed too many applications and don't feel like spending all the time
 to re-customize my device. I've searched and found that this seems to be a problem others have run into, however the only solutions seen are to hard reset the device and that seems a bit aggressive of a fix for something like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

 the MailAccountRepair program has stated that the account information is not located in the registry and can only be edited with a program such as his that is written in C+ and has not given further details as to where exactly the information in located. The
 only place the account shows up is on the sliding panel home page and when I try to create an account with the same name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>No, not that I'm aware of. As far as I can tell, email is managed through messaging built in to windows mobile 6.1. Any place where the 'setup email' link is accessed, it brings you to the wizard that is available
 under the messaging tab (account picker) and this does not appear to be Sprint specific.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "getting started" app has setup email under it which explains that you can setup an email account in Messaging &gt; Set Up Email and also has a link to the mail setup wizard.</p>

            What if you switch to another homescreen, reboot your device, then switch back to the sliding panel. Do you still see that ghost account?

<p>Interesting idea...I hadn't thought about trying that. However,&nbsp;I just tried it and unfortunately, no, it didn't help, the account is still there. mailAccountRepair still identifies the account and is unable to repair
 it as well. Any other ideas? Thanks for the help...it probably shouldn't annoy me so much, be it really does, and gets in the way when i'm trying to scroll to check my legitimate email accounts.</p>

<div><span>While reading this, I thought that you might want to try modifying the XML file and remove CMessage. You'll have to copy the file to your computer and edit the file in Notepad. Remember to keep
 a copy of the original as a backup just in case. Once you've modified the file, copy it back to the PC to replace the original and reboot your device. After the reboot, you should not have Messaging in the sliding panel. Edit the XML file again on your computer
 and add CMessage back and reboot.</span></div>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
I would require additional information for better assistance.<br />
<br />
1) Are you trying to link data to any table or link a table Excel?<br />
2) Do you intend to use external data? <br />
<br />
Check the section 'Creating a Linked Table' in the following article and see if it helps:<br />

<p>2)As a test I just added a new agendatask and synced my phone. The new task is not shown in the list! That means the backup is not 100% and not trustable.</p>
<p>3)There is not even one sms stored after I synced. Why? In the options menu the sms-box is checked.</p>

            Have you used My Phone much in the past?&nbsp; Have you ever deleted anything from My Phone?&nbsp; If so, check the archive.&nbsp; When you delete things from My Phone, the items get moved to the archive so this could be a reason why you are receiving a storage full

<h2>            Microsoft live password works on a device but not on another</h2>
                    <p>I have this most annoying problem that my Microsoft login credentials work in one laptop, but using the exact same credentials (login/password) on another computer/tablet (I checked CAPS, etc.) I do not manage to login (it returns a wrong password warning).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a recurrent problem that I have and I'm always chilled each time I'm asked my Microsoft live password, bacause I know I will most likely ran into trouble and lose a couple of hours resetting passwords, and trying other gymnicks until I finally manage
 to login...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have a laptop blocked (I did the mistake of allowing the session to finish when I tried to increase the fonts of the system) and it does not accept the Microsoft live password that works just fine in this computer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really hugely tired of this situation. Any suggestions of how to avoid this problem?</p>

<h2>            OneNote keeps crashing when hand writing notes on first gen IPad Pro. Newest IOS update 11.1.2.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I’m reaching the end of my rope with trying to get this fixed. Tried restarting iPad, reinstalled OneNote, upgraded to the latest IOS update. I run my business and take classes all with this program so this is extremely frustrating. This is not an
 issue on my desktop PC, only the iPad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to keep loving and using this app on the iPad, please help! Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Crystal, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are possible reasons why you are experiencing the said issue with OneNote on your iOS. One of the possible reasons since you updated your iOS is your OneNote is not updated. Does the same issue also occur on the other Office apps that are installed
 on your iOS? Have you also tried updating your OneNote? </p>

<h2>            access &#38; powershell script...cannot be loaded because the execution of scripts is disabled on this system</h2>
                    
<p>Hello MVPs,<br />
<br />
I have simple problem. I have a access sub that executes a powershell script. When the shell is opened, I get an error message.<br />
<br />
<strong>The problem message:<br />
</strong>Windows PowerShell<br />
Copyright (C) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.<br />
File C:\users\petruska\documents\scripts\bofa import.ps1 cannot be loaded because the execution of scripts is disabled on this system. Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details.<br />
&nbsp;+ CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException<br />
&nbsp;+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : RuntimeException<br />
PS C:\Users\Petruska\Documents\Banking&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong>Here is the Access sub:</strong> <br />
Private Sub convertstmt_Click()<br />
Dim rval<br />
rval = Shell("powershell -noninteractive -noexit -file ""c:\users\petruska\documents\scripts\bofa import.ps1""")<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
<strong>Here is the environment<br />
</strong>Windows 7 home<br />
Access 2007<br />
Powershell 2.0<br />
Name : Windows PowerShell ISE Host<br />
Version: 2.0<br />
<em>(from powershell's get-host)</em> <br />
<br />
<strong>POI:<br />
</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The powershell script is signed in conformance with the powershell about_signing manpage. (Confirmed by examining properties of the script file and seeing digital signatures tab completed.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The execution policy for powershell is remotesigned. (Confirmed by the ise, "get-executionpolicy" &amp; at a command prompt, powershell -command "get-executionpolicy")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The script executes from the command shell and the ise<strong> without an error</strong> (i.e., take the string from the shell command, paste it into a command shell window, and execution occurs without any message)<br />
<br />
<strong>Unsuccessful approaches I've tested:<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Changed execution policy to unsigned in the powershell ise.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Published the database as signed and executed the sub.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. One poster to a similar question said this: run the script with Admin rights. With UAC you have standard user rights even if you are part of the admin group.<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2exwpku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2exwpku</a>
 I'm not sure how that would be implemented.&nbsp; For the record, contrary to the post issue, I can set-executionpolicy.<br />
<br />
For demonstration purposes, the script can be anything at all,<strong> e.g</strong> .:</p>
<p><em>get-date |out-file c:\temp\junk.txt</em></p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2010.12.26</strong> I also have a user powershell profile, so I added a -noprofile to the shell command string, but it did not resolve the problem. I also made sure the user powershell profile was signed. No resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2010.12.26</strong></p>
<p>I finally resolved this in an unexpected way. With the -noexit option on the powershell command, I issued a<strong>get-executionpolicy</strong> , which returned "restricted", which is not the policy when I run it interactively either through a command prompt
 or through the ISE. So, at that point, I issued<strong>set-executionpolicy remotesigned</strong> , retested and the problem is now resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

HilaryLloyd.</a> Another way of verifying your&nbsp;account is thru a verification code sent to the mobile number associated&nbsp;with your Microsoft account. Did you get that option? How did you add your Microsoft account? Is it during the setup process or you just
 add it under Settings&gt;email+accont&gt;Microsoft account? You can start downloading app as soon as your Microsoft account sync properly.

<h2>            What does error code 8007002C - 4000D mean when installing windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    What does error code 8007002C - 4000D mean when installing windows 10? It gets close to 100% and then says it is reverting back to Windows 8. This is really frustrating! It takes a great deal of time to get the install to that point and to not have it
 work repeatedly at that point is irritating. I have tried disabling my antivirus and firewall (as suggested elsewhere online). It has not worked. Any help is appreciated?

That is a common error that covers a lot of problems, remove anything plugged into USB except Keyboard/Mouse, remove any 3rd party Virus/Malware, Check to see if at least 30Gig is available on hard drive, are some of the most common, the problem on this site
 is trying to figure what build, what is the system that a person is posting about. &nbsp;

            <p>If uninstalling your third-party antivirus does not fix the issue.</p>
<p>Sometimes error code 8007002C - 4000D</p>
<p>is caused when you have corruption in windows update files in C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. You can reset windows update components with these commands</strong></p>
<p>(Disconnect your internet cable and turn off wifi if using a laptop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click start, Command prompt (admin)</p>
<p>Copy and paste these commands &amp; press enter</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong><br />
<strong>net stop cryptSvc</strong><br />
<strong>net stop bits</strong><br />
<strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong><br />
<strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old</strong><br />
<strong>net start wuauserv</strong><br />
<strong>net start cryptSvc</strong><br />
<strong>net start bits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Reconnect your internet cable and turn on wifi if using a laptop)</p>
<p>reboot</p>
<p>Login and rerun&nbsp; windows update</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. You can use windows media tool to install and update to the retail windows 10 build 10586.</strong></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>3. Then use windows 10 ISO to update to windows Insider builds 14295 or 14233</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the ISO - windows Insider builds 14295 or 14233</p>
<p>Open the ISO with file explorer to mount windows 10 and double-click setup.exe to update.</p>

    <title>How Can I create a New Contact Group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> being joe mcguire  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Can I create a New Contact Group</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble creating a new distribution list, now called New Contact List.&nbsp; I have created a couple in the past.&nbsp; Help advises me, "In Contacts, on the
<b>Home</b> tab, in the <b>New</b> group, click <b>
New Contact Group</b>."&nbsp; Sounds simple.&nbsp; But when I go to the New group my only option is to create a New Contact.&nbsp; In the iCloud Group I see Create New Group but that simply creates a new folder.&nbsp; I have loads of pointless--but undeletable--folders already,
 all called Suggested Contacts.&nbsp; And a new Contacts folder is not a distribution list or whatever it's called these days.&nbsp; I tried&nbsp; to see if I was missing something from the "Ribbon" but found nothing obvious.&nbsp; I simply want a distribution list for 4-5 Contacts
 who are family members.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>Given the situation, we&nbsp;would suggest that you install the new sync client-Next Generation OneDrive for Business preview client via the link below. You may need to go through the documentation for the installation steps as well as the instruction to report
 any issues back to us.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.onedrive.com/sync/setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://preview.onedrive.com/sync/setup.html</a></p>
<p>Note: Install OneDriveDF referring to the document <b>OneDrive for Business Mac Configuration Guide (Preview 0929)</b> included in the package you downloaded.</p>
<p>Before installing the new sync client, please completely remove the current sync client following the steps below:<br />
<br />
a. Exit OneDrive for Business completely.<br />
b. Drag the app to the Trash.<br />
c. Search for the following locations to delete the related items.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;~/Library/Application Support/OneDriveBusiness<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;~/Library/Logs/OneDriveBusiness-*<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;~/Library/Preferences/<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;~/Library/Caches/<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;~System Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; Login Items &gt; OneDrive for Business<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;~System/Library/Extensions <br />
<b>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note</b>：Please first back up the files you need.<br />
d. Empty the Trash.<br />
f. Restart your Mac.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>
