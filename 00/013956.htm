<h2>            Unable to download files in Internet Explorer 11 on multiple machines.</h2>
                    <p>First things first, resetting Internet Explorer completely solves this problem, until I close IE and re-open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Web pages display mostly correctly. </p>
<p>Web Apps like ADP&nbsp;display in incorrect fonts because it cant download external css files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloading reports, .xls files, .docx files, .pdfs does not work at&nbsp;all. Nor does downloading .exe files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These all work in other&nbsp;browsers, including Edge, Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;We need to use Internet Explorer as a default though because it is the only browser that still supports&nbsp;our Java plugin for&nbsp;our version of Kronos timekeeping software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, clearing the cache (full Reset of Internet Explorer Options that requires a restart) works, but only temporarily.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a domain joined computer, and logging in as an administrator does not have the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>

<h2>            How do I get the color categories to display in &#34;Color&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I don't understand the Color Categories option.&nbsp; Whenever I assign a category (e.g. "urgent") it simply enters the words in the categories column.&nbsp; I'd much prefer to simply show a colored icon (e.g. bright red) so that it jumps off the page for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;When
 I&nbsp;right click the field name, select&nbsp;"View Settings" then "Format Columns" then&nbsp;"Categories"... the format box dropdown gives me one option... "Text".&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Virus&#58; &#34;Fix it&#34; scam&#63;  Here&#39;s the story.</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p><strong>Is&nbsp;http://www.ezytechsupport.com/ really a support contractor to Microsoft?
</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skimming Microsoft Edge MSN News Stream I clicked on something of interest and a pink page/security warning (RDN/Trojan) popped up. &nbsp;This was quickly covered over with instructions to call
<strong>Microsoft Technical Supp</strong><strong>ort</strong> <strong>immediately</strong> at
<strong>1 (855) 247-2771 Toll-Free</strong>. &nbsp;[See: Image Insert below.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calling the Toll-Free number that was answered as "Tech Support" (no mention of Microsoft) a very polite gentleman with an East Indian accent, answered. &nbsp;I then stupidly allowed myself to be talked into allowing him to access my laptop. &nbsp;[My desire to fix
 the problem had over-ridden my common sense, although, under the circumstances caution was more acute than usual]. &nbsp; My suspicions soon escalated when, instead of dealing with the issue at hand, he took me for a tour through my computer showing me why my Virus
 Protection wasn't working. &nbsp; A box popped open showing that my Virus software was only serving Microsoft 8 and not 10, as it should have been. &nbsp;[The box vanished.] &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aware, as I am, living in an area with a big East Indian community, that many within the culture have a propensity to be overly courteous, I listened and watched... &nbsp;Almost immediately he helped himself to my NOTEPAD program where he slowly typed in the
 various subjects, re: Windows Defender and Windows Firewall, etc., telling me Defender was working fine but the Firewall protection was not... &nbsp;thereafter opening something called "Administrative Events" showing I had 8,428 of these with red ERROR and yellow
 WARNING icons, there. &nbsp;And on he went... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I finally asked that he get on to "working the solution" and stop showing me all the problems, I was asked to hold while he transfered me to a "senior tech agent" who would help me.... &nbsp;A little music, and the line was picked up by someone who introduced
 himself &nbsp;as "Ani" who also started typing on the NOTEPAD page, first with his short (nickname) as well as how his name would be written in full, also annunciating over our phone connection, how it would be pronounced, in his mother tongue. &nbsp;[Why? ...other
 than to possibly instill the idea that he's my friend!] ...then he went on to repeat much of what the first fellow had conveyed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeated my request, as to fixing the Trojan Virus, to which I was then asked to please listen to a lengthy discourse on what could happen if I didn't heed his advice. &nbsp;This was to spend either; $300 (1 year protection) or $500 (3 years) or $1400 (lifetime/transferable).
 &nbsp;He mentioned Microsoft Store several times directing me to my Desktop access to STORE. &nbsp;After listening to more phone monologue, I questioned why the new investment? &nbsp;I stated that I believed Microsoft possibly had 'updates', perhaps reinstalling Windows
 10 w. Firewall]. &nbsp;I was emphatically told this could not happen, as the Firewall was damaged by Trojan. &nbsp;I then said. that quite frankly, I questioned whether his firm
<strong>was a legitimate Microsoft contract-provider</strong>, he got more aggressive, finally letting me know me, his firm was called "ezytech support", and had been around a long time (6 or 8 years he said) while simultaneously popping up a good looking landing
 page, and saying they were New York based. &nbsp; His tone evermore forceful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I'd had enough. &nbsp;Regardless of the fancy 'landing page', after hearing he wanted $300 or $500 or $1400 before he got started on 'the fix', (not even looking for it) &nbsp;I said, "I wanted to check on something, and would call him back." &nbsp; The 'hard
 sell' was cranked up further, suggesting I was a fool if I didn't comply and I was taking a huge risk that my laptop would be compromised. &nbsp;Well, maybe I was... &nbsp;but his 'pitch' certainly seemed "fishy"... &nbsp;I said good-bye. &nbsp;As I did. I saw the NOTEPAD page
 disappeared, even though I had asked earlier to keep it open. &nbsp;Then, other open boxes, went poof! &nbsp; I just wasn't quick enough to kill his access, which had been minimized, for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking, the, with my own Virus Protection provider, and re-scanned, nothing showed up! &nbsp;And, all things that should have been working, were!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there you have it. &nbsp;Whether who I had on the line, is in fact connected to <strong>
Ezytech Support&nbsp;</strong>or not I cannot say, nor do I know whether Ezytech is a Microsoft provider. &nbsp;Finally, I apologize for the excessive pontification, as...</p>

            I think you're talking about windows phone 8.1, select the app in download list, a prompt will appear, and choose download now to download over mobile data. Otherwise it's a limitation of windows phones that apps above 100 MB can't be downloaded over mobile
 data.

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I post to Yahoo Groups from Outlook 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I installed Outlook 2013 I haven't been able to send emails to my Yahoo Groups from Outlook. I keep getting the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are unable to deliver the message from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span><span> to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>
<p><span>Your email was not delivered due to a suspected guidelines violation. Please visit

<p>
</p><p>However, I can post if I do it directly from my online Gmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's worse, today I discovered that many emails I've sent from Outlook to my Google Groups lists have simply disappeared without a trace. This doesn't happen all the time, and I don't receive any error messages like the one above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 since last week, but this started happening when I was still on Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any ideas as to why this is happening? Thank you!</p>

</p><p>I have exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>I can send an email to my yahoo group from my gmail account when I'm connected to gmail on internet, but I can't do it from outlook 2013, and I don't want to use the Mail App. I have already registered all my contact on outlook.</p>

<h2>            Strange NDR message. Mail flow from on-premises Exchange server to Exchange Online mailbox gives flawed SPF fail</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A colleague of mine notified me of a repeated NDR he keeps receiving trying to email a customer that is on Office 365.</p>
<p>After examining the mail flow the following things occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>mail server CBDGML-SMG.cronos.be (94.143.189.3) delivers the message to mail server DB3FFO11FD025.mail.protection.outlook.com (10.47.217.56)
</li><li>SPF check SUCCEEDS (arxus.eu) for ip 94.143.189.3 </li><li>DB3FFO11FD025.mail.protection.outlook.com (10.47.217.56) mail server passes the mail message to multiple Office 365 servers.
</li><li>At some point the receiving Office 365 server (AM1FFO11FD036.mail.protection.outlook.com (10.174.64.225)) tries to verify the SPF record again using the receiving IP 157.56.112.29, which is the IP of an originating Microsoft Server emea01-am1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 passing along the message. </li><li>This SPF validation on domain arxus.eu fails for ip 157.56.112.29. This is expected behaviour, as our mail service is not hosted on Exchange Online servers.
</li><li>mail gets stuck in a loop and gets halted, resulting in a NDR message. </li></ol>
<p>Does anyone have a clue what's going on? To my understanding, this is a communication/verification flaw between exchange online mail servers passing along the mail message.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for any kind of clarification on this matter.</p>

<p>Hi Tim,<br />
<br />
Since the NDR and the mail header contained a lot of privacy information such as email addresses and mail server names, I have removed the entire content. Please be aware.<br />
<br />
After checking the detailed information in the mail header you provided, we can determine that the root cause should not be related to the SPF validation.<br />
<br />
According to our further analysis, <strong>the sender is not an Office 365 Exchange Online user, but the mail flow just went through an Exchange related mail server</strong>, which is rare. Based on this, I need to know<strong> if you have configured any integration
 to let the outside sender use your Exchange server to deliver his/her emails</strong> (for example, a customized on-premises send connector to point the mail flow to Office 365). Please provide a detailed description of the current mail flow configuration
 situation.<br />
<br />
Also, we may need to involve the administrator of the recipient’s Exchange organization.<br />
<br />
Moreover, was it the entire NDR content that you had posted in this thread (which I have copied and saved)? If there’s anything more that you can provide, please reply to me via private messages. See
<strong>your details</strong> (on the right) -&gt; <strong>Private messages</strong> to find the PM I sent you.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>Hi Tim,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the detailed feedback in the private message.<br />
<br />
According to your clarification, I see that the affected email was sent from an Exchange on-premises server to an Office 365 Exchange Online mailbox.<br />
<br />
Generally, when an SPF validation fails, the affected email should be delivered to the recipient’s Junk E-Mail folder instead of being rejected directly. And that’s why I said this should not be related to the SPF validation.<br />
<br />
I will do some further analysis based upon what you have provided. Meanwhile, I’d like to confirm the information below:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After checking the domains involved in the NDR and mail header, it seems the recipient is in an Exchange hybrid deployment, and the recipient is an online mailbox user. Can you please confirm it?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can the same sender send emails to other users in the recipient’s organization, both online mailbox users and on-premises mailbox users?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Regarding the sender’s own email system, does it have any relationship with the recipient’s Exchange hybrid deployment? Or the two organizations are completely separate?<br />
<br />
Your updates will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>1. I cannot confirm this as I do not manage their Exchange Online environment. I've been notified by a colleague that mails keep getting bounced and NDR's are being received while trying to email to this recipient. The mail flow to the recipient directs
 to Exchange Online, that's why I try to get some support or clarification through the community site.</p>
<p>2. This recipient is our only and main contact for that organisation. So I cannot verify this.</p>
<p>3. There are no relationships with the recipient's hybrid deployment. The recipient and the sender are both on completely separate mail systems.</p>

<br />
Thanks for the updates. Now I need to escalate this issue to the next level resource, thus some detailed information is required. I have sent you a private message to collect the information. Are you an administrator of your Office 365 organization? If not,
 please contact an administrator to provide the information.<br />

<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 is still a beta version, all software’s might not work as expected. As it was working in the previous Builds, I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install the latest version of Firefox and Thunderbird and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know the update after you try the above steps.</span>

<h2>            Nokia 3110c Problem &#58; Music Player &#38;amp&#59; Phone Memory not functioning</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I just came across this forum and reading a few post here made me feel that I have a few problems with my Nokia 3110c, which some of you might have a solution :-<br />
<br />
Music Player :-<br />
I have a 512MB memory card &amp; also 1GB memory card.100+ songs in my both memory card.But my phone's music player doesn't find any songs,even after updating the library for 4/5 times repeatedly.In fact,it starts to update library everytime I try to open my Music
 Player, only to find no songs in it.&nbsp;<br />
Please do let me know if any of you have any solution to this problem.<br />
<br />
Internal Memory :-<br />
Even though the internal memory of the phone is supposed to be 9Mb,and it shows the internal memory is filled to almost 1.1 Mb[288kb of message,672kb of applications,4kb of bookmarks],the free memory is 3.4MB; Where is the rest of the internal memory gone ?
 Also,the manufacture installed files like the ringtones etc. is no more seen inside. So, do you have any idea what is wrong with y handset &amp; how can I get back that 4.5MB of internal memory, or the files that might be there in that part of the internal memory
 ?<br />
<br />
Hoping to hear from at least some of you soon.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem before with my player, which I was able to solve with a few simple steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. go to menu&gt;media&gt;music player</p>
<p>2. after opening the player, go to options&gt;music library&gt;all tracks</p>
<p>3. your player will then display all the songs available from your memory card. Choose one of the songs and then press play. The music player will automatically load the tracks into the player. Updating the library is not enough, you have to load the tracks
 into the player for them to appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the process once and my problem never happened again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your phone memory, you could try going to menu&gt;gallery&gt;options&gt;memory status&gt;phone. This should show all the memory used in your phone. Add it all up and it should be around 9MB. It won't be exact since your phone is some of its memory just to display
 the data to you. Check your gallery too for your themes, graphics, clip-art, etc. They also use up your phone's memory and they won't appear in your memory card.</p>

            Out of that 9 Mb only around 7.2 is available for user. Try clearing the cache in internet option. Its the last option in the menu of internet. It will clear off the cookies and free some memory. U can also download file explorer from getjar.com using
 ur phone browser and installing the file in .jar format. Set the app access to allow add and edit data. Them explore the phone's memory. Pls remember that it won't explore the app folder of ur phone. If even this doesn't solve the memory problem then u better
 get ur phone formatted at nokia care centre.

            Remove the memory card from ur phone. Restart it without card. Open the music player. It'll show no files found. Then switch off the phone again. Meanwhile scan ur memory card for viruses. Then copy the content of the card. Format ur card(remember formatting
 will delete all the data on the card so back up essential). Then copy the content back to it. Switch on ur phone &amp; see if it works now. If it still doesn't work, then reinstalling ur phone's firmware is the only solution. Pls note that reinstalling will wipe
 out the phone data completely so pls take back up of ur phone's contacts, calender, bookmarks etc.

<h2>            Nokia E72 - Mail for Exchange sync problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with Mail for Exchange on Nokia E72. When I set up the email everything works fine I can send and recieve mail both automaticaly (peak time etc.) and manualy. But after an hour or so I can't do it anymore. The client on Nokia E72 looks like
 it connects to Exchange and check for email then in finishes without giving any error but new mail doesn't arrive. Also if I check devices in Outlook web access the last time device connected was an hour ago, not right now when I checked for email. Our companys
 Exchange Server is 2007 SP1 (or maybe SP2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My log file:</p>
<p>21/06/2010 12:50:34 Mail for Exch. Build : 2.02.000<br />

21/06/2010 12:51:48 HTTP Failure while sending messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any hints on what could be wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing I noticed on desktop Outook is that it says that task reported error 0x8004010F - the Microsoft website says its related to the Offline Address List - could it be somehow connected to GlobalAddressLookup?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone had similar problem and how to fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and best regards!</p>

<p>Hi Guys, I use gmail for my primary business email and hotmail for registration BS. I used the built in email client and the gmail app but neither allowed to sync th calendar (this started back in my E71 days). Then Nokia Email client came along and I simply
 configured it to work wi my 2 email accounts.&nbsp;However, Nokia email cant sync the calendar. Since I wanted to use google calendar with my gmail, i read up that MforEx solves this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, let me say that it doesnt work for **bleep**! Over the course of a week, I tried to configure the phone to allow MforEx but i get several problem notices. First of all, 9 out of 10 times I cant send out an email because it says it is unable to
 perform such task (even though it does receive email messages). One time I had luck with sending out an email but it was while I had set up mail for exchange for my google and hadnt yet gotten to configure my hotmail (through non-MforEx route in Nokia Messaging).
 This time, an email sent from gmail via Mail for Exchange arrived back in the inbox of MforEx.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, assuming that this thing actualy works, has anyone had any luck with syncing all 4 items - email, contacts, calendar and to-do lists? I think I only managed to get MforEx working (to the extent that I did - meaning at least receiving mail) when I only
 checked email and one other item (either contacts or calendar, not sure; but definitely it was not to-do tasks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anyone&nbsp;else having similar problems. Can anyone recommend a solution because talking to Nokia customer care call center is like talking to a bunch of monkeys. They're completely incompetent and lack a lot of knowledge about the product, especially the
 one made for busy businessmen who have no time to play this monkey business. They hung up the phone on me on several occasions, lied, pulled stuff out of their **bleep** to try to **bleep** me, and finally was promised (ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS) that tier 2 reps
 would get back to me within 24 to 48 business hour window. 9 out of ten times nobody follows up with a call for weeks (if ever!) I was tired of waiting and after several weeks I called myself, just to get the same BS answer and no resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am planing to give up the Nokia E-Series! I have proudly owned these products dating back to the E61i. However, in my opinion Nokia ruined the near perfect E71 by putting out a far inferior, cryptic, completely illogical and plain old ugly E72, which,
 BTW, seems a lot slower and more power hungry then its predecessor. &nbsp;And Nokia customer service finalized my decision on the divorce with Nokia. BTW, if anyone can suggest a good non-touchscreen qwerty smartphone, pls do.</p>

<p>yes, OneNote mobile on Android and iOS has the ability to draw freely, ironically, on Microsoft's own platform, it's missing. i can't remember how many times did Microsoft do something like this, bye. I will try my best to stop using all MS devices and services.
 The company never takes the users voice seriously, for instance, users demand that outlook mail should have the ability to set separate display name on each of the alias address, after 4 or 5 years, this is still missing. and just like this copyed answer,
 showing non sense cliché without actually doing anything again and again. Anyway, bye bye, M$</p>

Why not believe them?&nbsp;&nbsp; Just click Stop and use one of the links that is showing.&nbsp; E.g. perhaps something innocuous and simple such as a Help page.&nbsp; If that seems Ok continue on with a more demanding page.&nbsp; Etc.<br />

            Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.
<br />
<br />You can download Classic Skype and use that.

<p>To clear the pairing settings from the headset, switch off the headset,<br />
and press and hold the multifunction key and the volume up key (for<br />
over 8 seconds) until the red, green, and blue indicator lights alternate<br />
three times.<br />

connect the headset to a charger, and press and hold the multifunction<br />

            This is not normal behavior and might be a hardware issue. So if a factory reset (<strong>Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone</strong>) does not solve the problem, you should contact Nokia Care or the place of purchase. They will be able to fix or replace
 your device.

            <p>Hi BaruchArteaga,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message "Service Unavailable" when signing-in, viewing emails, syncing accounts in mobile is already resolved. You should be able to access your account successfully. Please refer to the link below for more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail-signin/im-unable-to-see-my-emails-my-hotmail-inbox-comes/cb39b54a-57bf-40ec-8f78-f8cbc27e77e7#_self">I'm unable to see my emails. My Hotmail Inbox comes up with the error
 "Service Not Available"</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still encounter the same error message, we suggest that you <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/optimize-internet-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
optimize your browser</a> to clear your browser's cache and temporary internet files. Try to access your account in a different browser or computer to check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once done, let us know the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. <br />

<div>God knows where you got that one star from, as your reply is akin to that of a robot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have already done the optimisation of the browser, and checked the service status and the issue is not even reported!!!!!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>As this email/account is the number two that I use, it has effectively denied me of an effective fall back.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good thing that I do have Gmail as my default, plus a third and fourth email services.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think that for all the hassle this service and account causes, I would rather abandon it, than undergo all risk of stress and resultant ill health it causes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please get this issue sorted otherwise, one less loyal -since 1985- customer will bid farewell.</div>

<h2>            I am getting a bounce message when sending emails to my alias</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Multiple aliases no longer working. NEED HELP!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About a year ago, I renamed my hotmail account to outlook. When I did that, several of my aliases just quit working. I would get error messages when sending test emails from my work email account (which is running Exchange, so not at all tied to the Outlook.com
 servers). Eventually MS allowed us to have up to 10 aliases, so I had the opportunity to delete them and start over...well now two of them have stopped working again.
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really need someone from the Outlook team to fix this. Here is a screenshot of the bounce back message I receive, when sending a message to my non-working outlook.com aliases.</div>

            Hi, timingisgood.<br />
<br />
Some Treo devices use a custom store for text messages instead of the standard Windows Mobile store. Microsoft My Phone does not support these custom stores.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marco.

    <title>popup on my desktop homescreen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            popup on my desktop homescreen</h2>
                    I left mt apple computer sitting at the home screen when a popup window appeared that said "suspicious content found". I cant remember 100% what it looked like bc it was a while ago, but it had that typical Microsoft look like from the website. I was wondering
 what this even means and if its even possible to get these types of warnings on an apple computer.

<p>They're all scams, since Microsoft never makes such calls unless you had contacted them first to request it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't a Microsoft popup, it was a popup that someone made look like it came from Microsoft by adding things like the Microsoft logo or text.&nbsp; There's a huge difference and most consumers aren't capable of telling the difference, which is why these scams
 often work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's easy to open a popup through a browser if you're already using the PC to do something else that can also launch these.&nbsp; It's more common for these popups to display when you're already browsing other web pages, especially those displaying advertisements,
 but since many apps are also capable of opening browser pages for various reasons including ads, these can just as easily be abused to display a popup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the item was displayed in a popup on a MAC, what would ever make you believe that Microsoft would be telling you about something on a device they don't even support, let alone doesn't have a Microsoft operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're buying into the fake messages here and shouldn't, since that's what the malicious actors use to trick people into doing foolish things.&nbsp; It never makes sense to see security messages from Microsoft on an Apple device, so don't believe it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The call is only related in that it also claimed to be from Microsoft and though it's possible they somehow got your phone number from some malware installed on your device, it's much more likely it was just a random "cold call" made by automated dialers
 running through every possible number in your particular area.&nbsp; This type of&nbsp; robocall is very common now, with some expecting these to reach half (50%) of all cell phone calls by late next year.</p>

</p><p>Sounds like a tech support scam popup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But – </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be best to seek advice regarding this issue from Apple Support.</p>
