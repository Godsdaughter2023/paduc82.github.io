<h2>            Windows 8.1 Computer Reset Missing Files</h2>
                    <p>Hello, lately I have been having loads of issues with my computer. An ungodly amount of issues, and finally I have reached the mother load of issues I feel. My issues began about four days ago. It started with my external hard drive disappearing. I was doing
 a system restore because i was having some virus issues, and my virus protection couldn't seem to solve the problem. When I started the system restore I unplugged my external hard drive ( I can't really say why. I think I was worried it might cause issues
 with it for some reason, but I really can't explain the logic behind that) from there I did the system restore. When I reconnected my external hard drive it could no longer be accessed. I could not find it anywhere except in the control panel under storage
 spaces where it tells me that the configuration is unrecognized or something like that. I went on to try and solve this problem which then resulted in more issues occurring. My virus protection programs autoprotect function was shut off and could not be turned
 on. It kept coming up with errors every time I tried to turn it back on. Then things continued to worsen. My internet would no longer work. I had connection to the internet but every time I opened my browser it would flash and then instantly close. In attempt
 to fix the solution I had a friend email me the mozzila Firefox and google chrome internet browsers to install them without the need of internet. Fortunately my email app on my computer functioned properly but when I tried to install either one of them I was
 prompted with an error telling me the side by side configuration was incorrect. When I attempted to open up the trouble shooter I was prompted with the same error about the configuration. So finally I said screw it and was going to do a complete system restart.
 I inserted my windows 8.1 64 bit configuration disc and went to restart the whole thing. During the process I went through 4-7 blue screens of death before finally I got to 76% complete on gathering the files and was prompted with the message telling me I
 was missing files. Which makes no sense because everything should be on the disc. I tried it a couple more times which resulted in a new issue where my operating system key code was considered invalid. After trying this four more times I got the activation
 key to work again just to get another installation error and blue screen of death. Can I please get some answers as to what's wrong with my installation disc so I can attempt to fix my computer, and any information regarding all the issues prior to that which
 I listed would be nice as well. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Alex, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed description and I appreciate the steps that you have tried to recover the operating system.
</p>
<p><br />
What is the make and model of the computer? <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Blue screen error mostly occurs due to software or hardware issue. In your case, I can see that you suspect few virus infection on the computer due to which you had majority of the issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reset is the best option if your system became unstable after a virus infection or any other infection, it formats your hard drive and you begin at 0 again. Everything, even your personal files are lost. You can follow the steps mentioned in the article
 to get more information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases if you have the disc or USB drive in your system and then choose to refresh your system it will automatically detect and use the disc or USB stick.&nbsp;But in some cases it does not, or you simply can't enter your system anymore and still want
 to try System Refresh / Restore, in that case <strong>method 2 </strong>is what you need.

    <title>windows could not automatically detect this network&#39;s proxy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamschilling  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows could not automatically detect this network&#39;s proxy settings windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro 3 will not connect to the Internet. The last time I had a successful connection was yesterday. Other devices use the network without issue. My surface pro 3 will not connect to other networks either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I troubleshoot, I see a yellow triangle with the error message: "windows could not automatically detect this network's proxy settings"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restarting, shutting down and resetting my surface without success. I have also reset my wireless router, just to be double sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Elsewhere on the Microsoft forum, I have found and followed directions to reset winsock as an administrator from a command prompt (which did not solve the problem). I have also gone to control panel, networks, LAN connections where I unchecked all the boxes,
 and that also failed to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see a list of available wireless networks- when I try to onnect, the network connection says "connected" for a moment, then switches to "Limited"; however no data is exchanged.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you, but none of these suggestions have resolved my issue. I brought my Surface to a local repair shop who told me that they have seen several Surface Pro 3 computers with this issue. Apparently users who installed AVG antivirus software (while their
 surface had Windows 8), and then who upgraded to Windows 10 have registry errors which make it impossible to use AVG software with Windows 10. I was advised by AVG that they are working on a fix, but that Microsoft is not being cooperative. Meanwhile, I'm
 stuck in the middle.</p>

    <title>Trying to get sound to work on Windows 7 64-bit official student - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mickder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to get sound to work on Windows 7 64-bit official student upgrade version.</h2>
                    Whenever i try to install the official realtek hd audio driver (latest version), the first step of the installation is to uninstall the old driver and restart. However, the moment i restart, windows 7 automatically reinstalls the recommended driver (these
 drivers arn't apart of windows update, so disabling that doesn't solve this problem. apparently its apart of a list that windows 7 has built in).<br />
<br />
Currently, the green bars for sound move accordingly when sound is playing, but i have no sound. When i go to test my speakers, left and right dont work, but all the others make a bell sound (6.1 surround sound with a sub woofer).<br />
<br />
Also tried to install the realtek ac'97 drivers, incase its because my speakers (which are plugged into my motherboard), aren't HD, and my second problem arises here... "Windows can't verify the publisher of this driver sofrware", even if it was straight from
 the realtek site, and for windows 7 64-bit. When i go "Install this driver software anyways" it just pops up the same message again, over and over.<br />
<br />
I tried running cmd.exe as administrator, running bcdedit.exe, and setting DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS and TESTSIGNING ON, as some other website suggested.<br />
Also made sure in-built audio was enabled in bios (its on AUTO, only options were auto or disable).<br />
<br />
If anyone has any items, that would be awesome. Thanks!

            I found the problem, after about 8 hours.<br />
<br />
You have to actually go to program files/realtek/audio/hda/<br />
run RAVCpl64<br />
under speakers, go to the DTS connect tab, turn that on.<br />
<br />
It would of been a lot easier if windows actually integrated the realtek hd audio manager into the sound in control panel...

<p>It seems a "bit" hit and miss to me, sometimes it seems to give the correct answer and at other times I get the -1 result.&nbsp; I assume it is my fault and my own operating error.&nbsp; It would be nice if it was consistently wrong or consistently correct.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is a "bug"?<br />

<h2>            Epson Stylus 440 - Driver for Windows 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I have just been given a brand new spanking machine (old one just completely died!) with Windows 7 on it.</p>
<p>I have tried installing a the original driver for my printer, but when I do I get a message -"Windows can’t install the EPSON Stylus COLOUR 440 kernel-mode print driver.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To obtain a driver that is compatible with the version of Windows you are running, contact the manufacturer".</p>
<p>I click ok and then - another message - "Printer driver cannot be installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Your Windows system may be abnormal condition.<span>&nbsp; </span>Exit Windows and try again, or setup your Windows again".</p>
<p>Admittedly the printer is a parallel port - but I am waiting to receive an a adapter that will hook it up to the usb on my new box.</p>
<p>I noticed that in this formum

<p>There are no printer drivers on my system to unistall.&nbsp; I tried contacting Epson Aust and they said they didn't make a driver for Wind 7 that Microsoft should - I rang Microsoft and they said it was up to Epson.</p>
<p>If satanonaharley got his to work, how can I??</p>
<p>Any suggestions appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dragon doesn't start up until after log in. Currently, I've set it up for pin, but that means he HAS to have someone come over to his apartment to enter the pin for him to log on. He really needs a way to bypass log in password, so he can restart his computer
 as needed, etc.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Edge Browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slider638  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge Browser</h2>
                    <p>Is there a standalone installer for Microsoft Edge. I updated to Windows 10 about a week ago, and Edge worked for 1 day and disappeared. I went through 3 reinstalls of Windows 10 and the edge icon is back. When I try to open Edge I get a blue 1/2 screen
 with the Edge Icon which stays up for about 3 seconds. Twice when I tried to open I saw the opening screen for Edge for a second and then as before it went away. I would think that something is incomplete with the Edge install. Hence, my question: Is there
 a standalone installer for Edge.</p>
<p>Thanx in advance (I hope!!!) for a solution.</p>

<p>I have followed all of these parts of this answer. Some many times. In one of my questions I stated that I updated to Windows 10 about5 a week ago, and Edge worked for 1 day. Since then whenever I try to open, I get a 1/2 size blue screen and then it goes
 down. It will not fully open. I just went through all parts of this answer in the sequence given and Edge still will not open. I re-installed 3 times and at least I gained the use of Cortana and the Start. But.... NO Edge.</p>
<p>It's a shame too because I would like to give the browser a try. I may also have a problem in Update because it has reinstalled 1 update several times, but when I look for updates, there are none available. I have gone through the clearing of the Software
 Distribution folder DataStore and Download folders numerous times with no change. The recurring update was for Microsoft Office Professional. I think I may uninstall MS Office Pro and see if that changes anything. I had mentioned before that I wish there was
 a stand alone installer for Microsoft Edge. I got no responses so I assume not. I'll keep trying!!</p>

I have also lost Microsoft Edge on my PC.&nbsp;Edge starts for about two seconds and then goes away.&nbsp;I feel your pain!&nbsp; I have tried many thing but Edge does not come back to it's original state.&nbsp; I also wish Edge could be installed by itself&nbsp;but it appears it is
 not an option.&nbsp; When I&nbsp; upgraded to Windows-10 I had one user account on my PC.&nbsp; The one user account was the "Administrator account."&nbsp; I have added a second user account to my PC and Microsoft Edge works fine on the second account only.&nbsp; I hope Microsoft
 can fix this problem reasonable fast or explain to us how we can bring Microsoft Edge back.&nbsp; Try adding a second user account to you PC.&nbsp; Good Luck.

<h2>            Windows 7 nothing shows up after boot</h2>
                    After booting windows in normal mode, the cursor only shows up and nothing else pops up. I can run windows in safe mode. How can I use windows normally. This happened a day ago. I didn't download or install any kind of software before this problem..

    <title>Can&#39;t Rename IIS Manager shortcut to &#34;IIS Manager&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaedarn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Rename IIS Manager shortcut to &#34;IIS Manager&#34;</h2>
                    Okay, It seems like a completely silly thing but I really have to know...<br />
<br />
I have a shortcut to the IIS Manager in Windows Vista x64 on my Desktop. By default the name appears as "Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager" which is great and descriptive and all but it annoys me that it is always shortened to "Internet Informatio..."
 when it's not selected. So I've decided to rename it to "IIS Manager", the nice and non-truncated version of the name... but any time I do it sets the name back to the default "Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager".<br />
<br />
Now this isn't to say that it can't be renamed... I can call it "IIS", "(IIS) Manager", "IIS Manager!" or "Willy the Wonder Dog", but any attempt to lable it simple "IIS Manager" restores the name to the original.<br />
<br />
If anyone can figure this out I'd love to know why.

            Hi, Kaedarn!<br />
<br />
I played a bit with what you said on my Vista. What I found is:<br />
<br />
1. I get the same behaviour on my computer as you described and <br />
<br />
2. For some (unknown to me) reason, changing the name of the shortcut to "IIS Manager" actually
<strong><em>changes</em></strong> the name of the .lnk file, as shown by a third-party file-managing programme! Moreover, this operation changes settings in the Registry, so that
<strong><em>any</em></strong> next shortcut made from IIS Manager item in the Control Panel has the actual name of
<strong>IIS Manager</strong>, <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> the default <strong>Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</strong>! Still, the desktop shows the default name.<br />
<br />
That's quite funny, from my point of view (as I can't find any logical way to explain what happens). And I also am curious to hear official explanations of this issue from Microsoft...

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I've seen the same problem on:<br />
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Enterprise x64</li><li>Windows 2008R2 x64</li></ul>
It happens wherever the shortcut is located, so on the start menu or on the desktop, does not seem to matter.<br />
My workaround is I call it "IIS Man" instead of my first choice of "IIS Manager". I don't have time to go further, but if I were to investigate further I would:<br />
<ul>
<li>Search the registry to see if "IIS Manager" is listed there as some kind of reserved name</li><li>Try fiddling with the permissions on the shortcut to deny the SYSTEM and other built in security groups write permissions on the shortcut, only allowing my user (directly) to have full control and making sure my user (not the administrators group) was the
 owner.</li></ul>
It's really weird... my guess is that many shortcuts like this have some kind of internal shorthand name that isn't exposed to us and whenever a shortcut has that name, it's auto-renamed to the "public relations" full name... but that's just a guess.<br />
<br />
I really wish Microsoft wouldn't do stuff like this. It's so like Apple to do stuff behind your back without asking you :-)<br />

<p>Hi raniabekkouri,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Syncing the notifications on your phone to your Windows 10 device is one of the most useful features of the
<strong><em>Cortana</em></strong> app. <span>Failure to send messages can be caused by configuration not set properly. To effectively assist you with your concern I'd like to ask the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which <strong><em>Windows</em></strong> build version is running on your device? Type
<strong>winver</strong> in the search box and press <strong>Enter</strong> to help you identify.</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Have you made any changes on your device prior to your concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, ensure that the App notifications sync option on your phone is enabled. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your phone, open <em><strong>Cortana</strong></em>.</li><li>Tap the <strong>Menu</strong> button, then select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <em><strong>Sync notifications</strong></em>, check if the App notifications sync option is enabled. If not, enable the option.</li><li>Ensure that all notifications are enabled.</li><li>Once you're done, check if the same issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for responding. </p>
<p>As for your questions, I am using Windows 10. I'm not getting any error messages and i haven't made any changes to my device. The only thing i did was connect cortana to my phone.
</p>
<p>My the App notifications sync option is already enabled. This is what i recieve when i open the messaging app
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p>
<p>

<p>I appreciate the prompt response. Another factor that you may want to consider is to confirm if the
<strong><em>Cortana</em></strong> app for Android has the permission to send messages. To do this, you may check the device manufacturer on how to grant app permission on your device. If permission was already granted and the issue still persists, our next
 option is to re-install the <strong><em>Cortana</em></strong> app and perform the setup again to re-sync both devices.

    <title>How to turn off automatic updates in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greggoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to turn off automatic updates in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am on a data plan, Windows update is using all my data in 4 or 5 days every month since I downloaded Windows 10. How can I turn the update off?? I am not impressed with Windows 10, I have already stopped using the Edge browser because there was no way
 to stop all the flash players on a page. I now use Firefox with adblocker and Flashstopper, much faster than Edge. I wish I had never downloaded windows 10. I get 10 gigs a month and windows update uses them in 4 or 5 days and I cannot seem to find any info
 on how to stop the automatic updates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business for Mac - Can&#39;t initiate chat</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Skype for Business 16.6.333 installed on OSX 10.11 and while I am logged in (meeting list updates, can see users online/offline/etc) I cannot seem to initiate a conversation/chat with any of them. Every menu item under the menu items Contacts and
 Conversations is greyed out</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work but now even past chats say that "the chat feature is disabled"</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT all works fine on my windows PC running skype for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried connecting to different networks on the off-chance that it was some outbound firewalling going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seen this problem and know how to fix it?</p>

<p>I had the same issue. Try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- in the login window try the following in the username (the last one):</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - domain\username</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the issue when i used *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (I was able to login, but all chat features were disabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I logged in with domain\username and once I logged in I was able to chat with other users.</p>

<p>Hi Lewis!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums with this question. Glad to hear that you're able to log into the 360 and can view the email to your old Xbox account. If you'd like to recover the password, I recommend using the wizard we have available on our
 support pages, the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/lost-password-solution?icid=forgot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Lost Password Solution</a>, which can help you reset it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a try and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you out!</p>
        </p>

<p>CCleaner is the only place I see this when I do the reg. clean, but what can not be fixed according to cleaner is a lot of files like the one I mention. Most active x controls Win 32.</p>

            <p>i too have run into the same problem. running system file checker, (SFC), does not correct this. i have run this numerous times.....and the problem is still there. on my second computer running win 10, this is not an issue.</p>
<p>unfortunately, trying to blame third party software, is a bailout. Piriform CC Cleaner, is doing the job of what Microsoft has neglected.........cleaning the registry. take a look of the mess microsoft makes to the registry upon a new install and upgrades.
 absolutely horrible. for those of us that are unaware........this mess, does slow the performance.....a lot !</p>

<p>
</p><p>I couldn't agree with "EJedgrohosky jr" more. I've been fighting to get Windows 7 to install the same 11 "Important" MS Office 2013, updates for 4 days &amp; nights. In addition to that problem, I have a "<strong>COM3</strong>" driver
 error (<em>"<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</span>"</em>) in my Device Manager and a "<strong><em>?</em></strong>" next to "<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PDI Kernal Ports Device
 Driver</span></em>" which is listed under "<strong>Unknown</strong>"!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is all the result of a Windows Upgrade which I did about 5 or 6 days ago, (maybe even 8 or 9 days ago). My complaint is the same as it's always been; Microsoft expresses the details of an error and/or way to fix it in such
 vague and cryptic ways that only an IT expert can translate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even then, IT Experts, (schooled, trained, and experienced in PC systems, particularly MS Windows systems), moire often than not, fail to make sense of the messages that supposedly name the problem and how to fix it by R-clicking
 or passing the cursor over it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case, I'm absolutely certain that these three problems, (The COM3, PDI Kernel, and Office Update fails), are interconnected and have to do with a;&nbsp;<em>security/permissions/Trusted Certificate and Verified Certificate</em>,
 problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The removal and re-installation of Office doesn't help and I can't even make a change in the Office configuration. That’s because the "Change" option in "Programs &amp; Features" only opens the MS Welcome screen for about 2 seconds.
 After that, it closes, (or actually, crashes), triggering another box to open that says
<em>Windows is searching on line for a fix to what just happened</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, I'm paraphrasing but the Windows search for a fix will run for as long as you let it and won’t stop until you stop it. It never finds anything and I can’t even tell if it’s really looking…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, the fact is, I know this issue could be fixed if Windows would only&nbsp;<em>apply some English</em>&nbsp;to the alerts, diagnosis, and/or events information. As it is, no one can help because there's simply too much they don't
 know about my system configuration for them to filter out the causes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a custom-built high performance system with 5 internally, SATA connected SSD's (@ 500GB ea.), and a USB 3.0 connected SSHD (1TB). The programs I have installed are many and many are installed on drives other than the "C"
 drive, (which contains the O/S).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that's just a 'lay of the land' sort of speak. It's the little details that make it impossible for It pros to help. Details like the Junction links, (I use Steam Mover but have also used mkLinks). I also have a very complicated
 Flight Simulator installed, (MS FSX), which used a program method considered to be very difficult to work with because the 'coding' is mixed and obsolete as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then to complicate matters even more, the FSX platform is strictly a foundation for 8 years of high definition add-ons. These 3rd party add-ons directly overwrite the scenery, mess, land-class, atmosphere, weather, and generally
 speaking, the physics of the operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does that 'muddy the waters' for an IT tech to help me? "Simconnect", "NavData", "FSUIPC", those are just the tip of the iceberg and keep in mind that I've only mentioned ONE program installed of the dozens I have. All this
 changes the way data is placed throughout the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's just no way an IT tech, (expert, pro, or not), can be expected to help unless they; A: are very familiar with some of the programs installed and how they interact with the internet. B: are absolutely clear on how I set
 the UEFI up and the way I've applied my drives, and C: are sitting right next to me...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm the first to admit that I could be wrong on one, even two of the those three points, but I know this much; no IT technician has been able to even come close to suggesting something I haven't tried. Most&nbsp;of them start with
 the usual, "Clean reboot", or uninstall this and that, and of course the ever so wonderful "Elevated Command" approach, LOL!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried 'em all and I don't mean just once. Not only have I tried all these troubleshooting and 'fix-it' downloads operations, (and yes,
<em>SFC /scannow</em>, and <em>chkdisk</em> too), several times over, I've tried them with variations on the procedure when the initial steps failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it's not a driver, I'm 90% sure that this is all about permissions and certificates, and security... Worst of all, I'm afraid it's at the NETWORK end of things! For me, that's the worst-case scenario short of a full Windows
 7 reinstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the security functions between my router and my system is playing a part, (if not 'all the parts'), in this. Of all the things I don't understand regarding software and operating systems, the "darkest place" is the system
 Network. I simply cannot grasp the simplest details of that idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's like some kind of mental block... though I will admit that I've done stupid things in my life, (...boy, have I done some stupid things in my life), I'm no idiot. Mensa tested my IQ at 136, 8 years ago so why I can't seem
 to understand role of the "Network", "network adapter", "Home Group" and all of that stuff is just plain frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow! I just realized what I wrote... Oh well, chalk it up to "FWIW".</p>
