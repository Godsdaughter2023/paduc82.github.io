</p><p>The view named "Multiple Baselines Gantt" shows baseline, baseline 1, and baseline 2 bars. &nbsp;You can create a new view based on the view and change the baseline bars to any baselineX you saved in the interim plan.</p>

            <p>This is easiest if you saved your interim plan as a numbered baseline rather than the numbered custom date fields (Start1/Finish1, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case:</p>
<p>1. Apply the built-in "Tracking Gantt" view.</p>
<p>2. If your interim plan is saved as a baseline, then pick the correct baseline to apply in the view. &nbsp;Pick from the Baseline pull-down menu on the "Gantt Chart Tools" - "Format" Ribbon.</p>
<p>3. If your interim plan is saved in the custom date fields, then you need to create a new bar style for it. &nbsp;Open the Bar Styles window by right-clicking on an empty area of the bar chart, then add a new bar for your custom fields. &nbsp;Here I added a new, middle
 bar for the interim plan in addition to the current task bar and the baseline bar for the task:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I didn't get your procedure. May be i followed different procedure to create interim plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed this procedure to create Interim Plan:</p>
<p>1. Project &gt;&gt; schedule group &gt;&gt; set baseline and from the drop-down &gt;&gt; set baseline. The set baseline dialog box appears.</p>
<p>2. Selected the set interim plan option button.</p>
<p>3. Selected scheduled start/finish from the copy drop-down list.</p>
<p>4. selected Start1/Finish1 from the into drop down list.</p>
<p>5. I marked for Entire project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this right?</p>

            <p>You chose to use Interim Plan instead of Baseline - too bad for you.</p>
<p>Interim plans seem rarely used in the Project world, and Project does not include a built-in bar to show Start1-Finish1. &nbsp;You have to add it to a view using the bar styles editor. &nbsp;Please revisit item 3 and the accompanying image from my earlier post.</p>

            As a suggestion - instead of saving the interim plan into Start1/Finish1 - save into another Baseline - Baseline1 or Baseline2. &nbsp;The advantage of using Baselines instead is that you will be able to capture baselines for work, duration, cost.

    <title>Baseless Suspension Of Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhijeetpatel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Baseless Suspension Of Account</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I have consulted with many others advertisers as well and I have the complete information about my account suspension and I got to know this Bingads is
 suspending any account on which there is any change in billing information is done recently, I have investigated enough about the reason and found this that many advertisers were running phishing scareware ads on the bingads accounts and bing is stopping those
 people to open any new account, and in this process Bingads is also suspending accounts on which there is a recent change in billing information, To precise my issue , you can check my account is an agency account , I am a certified accredited bingads professional,
 and there is no violation on my account , Whenever Bingads demanded any change in my ads and content I did that without questioning and delay, and the reason for me to change the card information was very much visible that I was facing trouble of balance getting
 depleted numerous times and often too, due the fact I have a lower limit on previous card ending with 0814, However the new card I added is completely valid and legit for which I have provided enough of proofs too in my previous email too, Being associated
 with bingads from long time, I am requesting you to please get any higher level of reviews required and if I am found guilty for any fraud or error bingads have complete right to close my account, but I do see the current suspension is just baseless and I
 want to get my account access restored as I have not made any mistake till now and committed to not making any mistake in future.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I am getting punished for what I have not done, and this is not happening first time, Previously Bingads also had system Issues due to which Advertisers
 From India were never able to open the account, This time due to stupid folks, Advertisers like me are getting troubled.</span></p>

<h2>            Bad headphone quality &#40;WH-207&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experience a very bad headphone quality (music is quite ok, but speech of the singer is very distorted). Here are the parameters of my phone:</p>
<p>- Nokia Lumia 620<br />
- Windows Phone 8.1<br />
- OS: 8.10.14192.280</p>
<p>- FW: 3058.50000.1425.00006</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headphone that I'm using is WH-207. When I'm pressing one of the buttons of the headphones, then the quality is good. As soon as I release the button, it's bad again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and best regards,</p>
<p>Patrick </p>

            <p>Hello Patrick:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having with your headphones.&nbsp; Audio quality can be caused by several things; the headphones themselves, your phones audio settings; issues between the phone OS and firmware or it could be an
 indication of hardware issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a few things to try and a couple questions that should help us to figure this out.&nbsp; The first thing I would like to have you do is try other headphones with this phone.&nbsp; If you can, try a couple other pairs and take notice of how the sound quality
 is.&nbsp; While you are doing this, it would be a good idea to try these headphones with other products, another Windows Phone, a PC, another smart phone or MP3 player, etc....&nbsp; The more you do with this testing the better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next thing I would suggest you try is to connect your headphones and start some music.&nbsp; While the music is playing go to settings &gt; audio &gt; tinker with the equalizer and enhancements settings to see if anything here improves your audio quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue continues the next thing to try is a soft reset of the phone.&nbsp; You can do this by going to settings &gt; storage sense &gt; phone &gt; temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet Explorer settings &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once this is done, press and hold the down
 volume button + the power button until the phone vibrates and reboots.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. This is what I've done so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Used the same&nbsp;headphone (WH-207) on another phone (Nokia 701 / Symbian OS). Works good, no issues. Quality is good.</li><li>Used another headphone&nbsp;(from Blackberry) on my Windows Phone 620. Works good, no issues. Quality is good.</li><li>Changed the equalizer settings. Makes no difference when using WH-207. Speech seems to be far away resp. is hardly hearable. Music is quite good. Pressing one of the headphone's buttons resolves this issue completely, i.e. then the overal quality is good.</li><li>Deleted the IE history. Issue persists.</li><li>Made a soft reset. Issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Looks as if the WH-207 is somehow affected on the Lumia phone only and the two buttons play a certain role concerning this issue as&nbsp;keeping&nbsp;one of the buttons pressed resolves the issue.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the other parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make and model of your phone: Nokia Lumia 620</li><li>Current OS version: 8.10.14192.280</li><li>Current firmware revision: 3058.50000.1425.00006</li><li>Country you are located in: Switzerland</li><li>Regional setting of your phone: Switzerland (German)</li><li>Language setting of your phone: German</li><li>Speech setting of your phone: German</li><li>Make and model of the headphones you are using: Nokia Stereo Headset WH-207</li><li>Type of music this happens with, MP3 from your personal collection, DRM protected content from a Music Pass or both: I just have MP3 files. They're affected. Also watching video clips from Youtube causes the same issue.</li><li>When did you first notice this, since the first time you tried these headphones, after installing the developer preview, after updating the phone with the recent critical update, other? I cannot say this exactly, as this is the first time that I'm using
 these headphones. Before, I was listening to music by using the speakers of the phone.</li></ul>
<p>Hope this helps to find the issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Patrick</p>

            <p>Hello Patrick:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; From what you have described to this point it does seem like this is an issue related to the headphones.&nbsp; As they seem to perform normally under certain conditions and with other devices, this may be related to the firmware
 on your phone or maybe even with the OS.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what you have meant by "Pressing one of the headphone's buttons resolves this issue completely".&nbsp; If you are referring to some physical buttons on the headphones, you may need to contact the manufacturer of the headphones for more information
 on why this is happening, it looks like these were made by Nokia.&nbsp; Before reaching out to them it may be worth referring to your owner's manual for more information on exactly what these buttons are for and how they impact the performance of the headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for additional troubleshooting you can try the last two things available may be a bit extreme if you can get the headphones to work or if you can simply use different headphones without issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<ol>
<li>Factory reset the phone.&nbsp; This can correct minor hiccups with the OS and improve performance of the phone and applications.</li><li>The Nokia Recovery Tool.&nbsp; This tool allows you to reinstall previous OS and firmware's to your phone.&nbsp; It may be worth seeing if this issue persists when running 8.0 as well as when on 8.1 without the developer preview.&nbsp; You can install the tool from here,

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I've already reset the phone (soft and hard reset). Both methods didn't solve the issue and as you might understand, I'm not really eager to rollback the firmware of my phone and re-install it again ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headphone WH-207 has too physical buttons as you can see from the following screenshot:</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-my/mobile/accessory/nokia-stereo-headset-wh-207/specifications/</p>
<p>
</p><p>They're simply used to answer/end a call, so the shouldn't have any impact on the quality of the music/speech. As I've mentioned, pressing and holding down such a button solves the issue. I'm pretty sure that the cause is related to the firmware as it probably
 doesn't take the existence of&nbsp;the buttons into account. I remember&nbsp;that a long time ago the same&nbsp;issue came up in Symbian OS, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headphone WH-207 has been sold together with my Lumia 620 and&nbsp;there is still support for it. The owner of Nokia is now Microsoft. Therefore, could you please forward this issue to the developer team for further analysis and bugfixing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and best regards,</p>
<p>Patrick</p>

            <p>Hello Patrick:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp; you for the follow up.&nbsp; I will send this along to the Windows Phone side of things for additional review.&nbsp; So that all bases are covered I would suggest you continue to work with the hardware side of things and contact Microsoft mobile support.&nbsp; The

http://www.microsoft.com/en-my/mobile/support/contact/</a> .&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If and when I receive new details about this I will be sure to post here.&nbsp; In the meantime, I might consider trying one more thing on the phone and being sure to post your comments about how this is working here,
<a href="http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions</a> .</p>
<ul>
<li>Try changing the language and speech settings on your phone.&nbsp; Once these changes are made you should see a restart button.&nbsp; Restart the phone and monitor it's behavior.</li><li>This may also come down to waiting for the official release of 8.1 update one and Denim.&nbsp; If this is indeed related to the firmware, this is likely to be when this will be corrected.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to encourage any other Lumia 620 owner's to post here with your experience with these headphones.&nbsp; Whether you have the same experience or not, please post here with your feedback and provide the details requested in my previous post.</p>

            <p>Patrick, You mentioned the headsets were sold with the 620. Do you mean they were packaged in the box, or just bought at the same time. I fear they may not actually be compatible. The pinouts (which ring does what on the connector) did change between Symbian,
 WP7 and WP8, over the years. The fact that it works OK on your Symbian phone, and when you push a button, makes me suspicious. I even got an adapter dongle with some Nokia headsets for Lumia, to be used if I were going to use an older Nokia device. It just
 fixed the wiring and button functionality. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is always a possibility that something is wrong with the headsets. There is a sort of support page at Microsoft Mobile for the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-my/mobile/support/product/nokia-stereo-headset-wh-207/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WH-207</a>. About all it seems to do is cover warranty, but it is a start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wiring on headphones, what is left, right, mic and ground, is not standardized across the industry. Worse yet the implementation of the answer/end, pause/play, volume up and down is proprietary by OEM, so you can't go get headsets designed for Apple
 and have everything work on HTC/Nokia, etc. In some cases even within an OEM (Nokia) different lines and times yielded different implementations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: did a little more digging and the WH-207 shipped with Nokia 603 and E6-00, both Symbian devices. I'd bet it just isn't compatible with a Lumia.</p>

<p>My personal recommendations include:</p>
<p>=&gt; Install IE8 manually, not via Windows Update/Automatic Updates!! =&gt; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/worldwide-sites.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/worldwide-sites.aspx</a></p>
<p>NB WinXP users: Save the installer to your desktop, do not Run it.&nbsp; When you're prepared to install IE8, double-click on the saved file.</p>
<p>NB Vista users: Save the installer to your desktop, do not Run it.&nbsp; When you're prepared to install IE8, right-click on the saved file and select Run as Administator.</p>
<p>=&gt; Uninstall all third-party toolbars (e.g., Google; Yahoo; Windows Live) and third-party Windows Themes before installing IE8.</p>
<p>=&gt; Close all open applications (i.e., anything with a taskbar icon) before installing or uninstalling IE8.</p>
<p>=&gt; I would strongly recommend disabling your anti-virus application and any anti-spyware application's "system protections" (other than Defender's) before installing (or uninstalling) an IE upgrade.&nbsp; If you're running a third-party firewall, I would recommend
 disabling it and then enabling the Windows Firewall before installing (or uninstalling) an IE upgrade.</p>
<p>=&gt; Never, EVER use System Restore to "undo" an update, Service Pack, or IE upgrade!&nbsp; Instead, uninstall the update, Service Pack, or IE upgrade &amp; reboot.&nbsp; If that doesn't correct the problem, then try System Restore. [Norton users will need to see
<a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/html/symantecdoc1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bertk.mvps.org/html/symantecdoc1.html</a>]</p>
<p>NB WinXP users=&gt; Reboot twice after installing or uninstalling IE8, then go to<a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a> | Select CUSTOM and scan | Install any Critical Security Updates offered (i.e., KB2183461).&nbsp;
 If a Root Certificates update is listed (possibly in the Optional Updates category on the left), install it to take full advantage of IE's enhanced security.</p>
<p>NB Vista users=&gt; Reboot twice after installing or uninstalling IE8, then check-in at Windows Update and install any critical security updates offered (i.e., KB2183461).</p>

Recently started getting error message: "Adobe Flash Player 11.5 r502 has stopped working" - the message flashes continually so I cannot use my browser at all and obviously cannot view any video. I have uninstalled and re-installed Flash Player 3 times now

<h2>            Email issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I seem to be having problems sending emails on my 950xl. </p>
<p>When I click on the + to write a new email all I get is a white screen.</p>
<p>I have Outlook mail Version 17.6868.40732.0</p>
<p>Only way I've been able to fix it is by sync the draft folder.</p>
<p>This is a pain to do ever time so how can I fix it so I don't have to sync the draft folder each time?</p>
<p>I have also tried to delete it and re-install to see if that helps but no help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for help/advice</p>

                    <p><span>Hi. </span></p>
<p><span>Over the past year, spam has increased from about zero to 15-20 spam each day. This seems to be common problem for many of my friends, that also have outlook/hotmail/live email adress. I have attempted blocking of
 addresses, but since the sender address varies all the time, this does not work. I have tried to report spam / phishing, but it does not seem to have any effect, nor does it move the mail to junk mail. What can I do to drop all spam emails? Considering switching
 mail provider, as this is unsustainable.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Dear Moen88,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a> so make sure that you are blocking the correct address.
<br />
<br />Please note that Postmaster ( <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a> ) is actually blocking lots of spammers ( and I quote ):
<br />For example, we've implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce the burden of junk email which currently prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day!
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails and improve how your anty filter will work (I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> and add conditions, that are common for those emails, for example additional keywords, recipient address includes etc.
<br />
<br />You can also check tips on how to stay safe online from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/online-safety-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>This is an ongoing problem that still has no answer. When will this problem be fixed? The problem is when you accept a task that was assigned to you, then mark it as complete, there is an error which comes up which says,&nbsp; "We need to know who to send this
 to..." This error occurs in both Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2016. When will this be addressed and/or resolved?</p>

            <p>We have to keep in mind the Skype Utility and Windows App version do not behave the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 9926 I was having problems with the APP because the small video box was not showing, but was hiding off screen and would only show after the window had been expanded.&nbsp; It seems to me, so far the window behaves better, but I have not gotten a call to check.</p>

            Hello 
<br />
<br />My name is Alberto, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />Please you can do this steps:
<br />Sign into Skype and click Calls call icon.
<br />Click the Dial pad dial pad. Skype automatically displays your current country and the relevant calling rates.
<br />Click the country name above the dial pad, then select the country you need to make a call to from the drop-down list.
<br />You can also enter a country code manually. To dial a country code, for example +44, click and hold the 0 + button for two seconds on the Skype dial pad, then release; the + symbol appears in the Enter number box.
<br />Enter the number you want to call.
<br />Click the call button.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need anything else.
<br />Regards       
        </p>

</p><p>If you are using (and you probably should) Content Controls, to prevent the text in the document from being edited, select the text and the Content Controls and use the Group facility in the Controls section of the Developer tab of the ribbon.</p>

    <title>Vertical Ribbon versus Horizontal Ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaeljcarroll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vertical Ribbon versus Horizontal Ribbon</h2>
                    <p>I am posting as someone who is mostly a computer user.&nbsp; I am finding more and more -- as we move into the world of Windows 10 and Edge -- that display controls and data are horizontally oriented.&nbsp; As a PC user, I find this incredibly inefficient and annoying.&nbsp;
 But even as a handheld device user, I see no point to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, there is the problem of the endless string of text flowing across the screen off the sides of the window so one must scroll from left to right to even read the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, there is the issue of data orientation.&nbsp; Consider a list of names followed by phone numbers.&nbsp; On a traditional vertical scroll screen, one would see something like the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thomas Auyer -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx</p>
<p>Al Bertstein --(xxx) xxx-xxxx</p>
<p>Mick Emmanuel -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx</p>
<p>Adam Firsmon -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx</p>
<p>Frank and Lynn Rosebelt -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx</p>
<p>Ludbert Tovern -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx</p>
<p>Tom Clint Zey -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice how easy these are to read and scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at the same data in horizontal orientation:</p>
<p>Thomas Auyer -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al Bertstein --(xxx) xxx-xxxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mick Emmanuel -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam Firsmon -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank and Lynn Rosebelt -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ludbert Tovern -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom Clint Zey -- (xxx) xxx-xxxx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now keep in mind that you are looking at this with word wrap.&nbsp; Word wrap is disappearing among all the displays in Windows Store.&nbsp; So imagine that instead of wrapping, the string disappears off to the right of the screen.&nbsp; Next imagine that instead of seven
 entries, there are seventy.&nbsp; Your eye could scan the list and pick out the name you wanted -- even if you had forgotten the last name -- within a few moments ... if the list were vertical.&nbsp; Horizontally, the list becomes almost useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You only have to start scanning apps in the App Store to find out the difficulty of this kind of navigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS may be saying that they aren't coming up with one-size-fits-all for all technology from computers through phones; but you only have to look at everything that's new to see that this is simply not so.&nbsp; Endless left-to-right movement is not useful to any
 real work.&nbsp; How we read is not an accident; it is the result of growth and adaption and recognition of mental needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pattern is symmetrically replicated for cultures that read up-to-down or right-to-left or any other way.&nbsp; There is a motion in one direction, staying on the visible page, then a perpendicular shift to a parallel line, still staying on the same page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone were to give you a story in three parallel columns, where after getting to the end of a column you had to go to the next page instead of to the next&nbsp;parallel column, and you had to continue this way until you got to the end of the pages, after
 which you would return to the first page and continue into the second column and so on, you would think they were nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our display patterns should match our inculcated reading patterns!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h3> _riccardo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 640DS - B2X refused to repair three times, now the warranty has expired.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm an owner of a Lumia 640 Dual SIM. The phone is really good, but I always noticed a problem with mobile networks: about twice a day the device disconnects from the mobile network and I can't make/receive calls, send/receive SMS and using the internet
 connection if I don't reboot it. The problem is known in Lumia 640 (XL and non-XL) Dual SIM devices. You can find a detailed thread&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdsettings/solved-lumia-640xl-dual-sim-cellular-module-defect/a5361d8b-666c-406d-ad9a-93ae3ba5c89e">here</a>&nbsp;on
 Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to talk of the problem, but of the B2X service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In August the problem became more annoying: I noticed that it disconnected too many times and I lost many calls. I decided to send my phone to a repair center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Sept. 11 I sent my phone to the B2X service in Hungary (I live in Italy and it is the nearest repair center). They changed the camera module, the antenna assembly, the upper flex cable and the antenna cover. The phone has still those connection issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I talked with a B2X agent and they kindly requested me to re-send my phone to the support center. On Sept. 18 I re-sent my phone with the same documentation (problem description), the latest repair report, and a letter where I wrote that I already sent them
 the device, but it hasn't been repaired properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On September 22 i got back my device: they changed the micro-USB connector, the cover and some other components, obviously the phone was not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I contacted a B2X agent to send my device for "<em>repair</em>" (for the third time). They gave me the usual DHL receipt and on Oct. 2 I sent my phone. This time there was a problem: my warranty expired on Oct. 6. On Oct. 5 I checked the repair status
 on their website and it was "Not Repaired".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I specified the MS Answers link with the problem description (and solution) on the letter in the package, today I got my phone back, not repaired because of the expired warranty and I can't speak to a B2X agent anymore (for free).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is not my fault: they should have repaired my phone the first or the second time I sent it, and now it is out of warranty because&nbsp;<strong>THEY</strong>&nbsp;made me try to get it repaired&nbsp;<strong>THREE</strong>&nbsp;times, without any visible result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I kindly ask if there is a way to contact Microsoft to let them know how B2X behaved with me, and possibly ask for a definitive solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sorry for my anger and my bad English.</p>

<p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>Based on my test, you can do the same thing for Public Folders. However, we don't recommend that you use Outlook’s PST export feature to migrate public folders to Office 365 or Exchange Online if your on-premises public folder hierarchy is greater than 30
 GB.</p>
<p>Office 365 public folder mailbox growth is managed using an auto-split feature that splits the public folder mailbox when it exceeds size quotas.
<strong>Auto-split can’t handle the sudden growth of public folder mailboxes when you use PST export to migrate your public folders and you might have to wait for up to two weeks for auto-split to move the data from the primary mailbox</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition,&nbsp;please note&nbsp;the following before using Outlook PST to export public folders to Office 365 or Exchange Online:</p>
<p>1) Public folder permissions will be lost during this process. Capture the current permissions before migration and manually add them back once the migration is completed.<br />
2) If you use complex permissions or have many folders to migrate, we recommend that you use the cmdlet method for migration.<br />
3) Any item and folder changes made to the source public folders during the PST export migration will be lost.</p>
<p>If you still want to migrate your public folders by using PST files, follow these steps to ensure a successful migration.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn874017(v=exchg.150).aspx#Scripts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download the migration scripts </a>To download the migration scripts, you only need to download the
<strong>PublicFolderToMailboxMapGenerator.ps1</strong> file.<br />
2. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn874017(v=exchg.150).aspx#CSVFiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Generate the .csv files </a>to create the public folder-to-mailbox mapping file. This file is used to calculate the correct number of public folder mailboxes in Exchange Online.<br />
3. Create the public folder mailboxes that you’ll need based on the mapping file. For more information, see
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj552410(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a public folder mailbox</a>.<br />
4. Use the New-PublicFolder cmdlet to create the top-most public folder in each of the public folder mailboxes by using the Mailbox parameter.<br />
5. Export and import the PST files using Outlook.<br />
6. Set the permissions on the public folders using the EAC. For more information, please see:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7b419906-8977-47f0-8687-a87911b5ebec(v=exchg.150)#Perms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>For Exchange 2003 users, we strongly recommend that you upgrade your on-premises servers to Exchange 2010 SP3 RU8 or later/Exchange 2007 SP3 RU15 or later, and use batch migration, which is the only supported public folder migration method.</p>

    <title>Footnote marker font in word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Footnote marker font in word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp; So I have been using Word for many years, writing and editing papers and theses. Frequently use endnotes and footnotes in documents. Now suddenly something has gotten totally messed up.&nbsp; When I insert an endnote or a footnote, the number appears
 in superscript size, but sitting on the middle of the line.&nbsp; Word thinks it is formatted superscript, but it is in the wrong place. (see picture).</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions?&nbsp; This is Word in Office 2016 on PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>There are two limitations to the use of AutoCorrect entries:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>They are language-specific. To be available, they must have been saved in the .acl file corresponding to the language applied at the insertion point. That is, if you created an English AutoCorrect entry, but the language applied to your text is French,
 that English entry will not work (this is pretty granular; I believe there are separate .acl files for, say, UK and US English).</li><li>Only unformatted AutoCorrect entries are saved to .acl files and available Office-wide. Formatted entries are saved in the Normal template and area available only in Word.</li></ol>

<div><br />
<div>This error code indicates that there is a problem with Outlook. Since you did not specify the version of Outlook, I'll assume that you are running either version 2003 or 2007. In both version, click the Help menu and select Detect &amp; Repair or Office Diagnostics.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Re-connect your device after the repair is done.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What do you mean by "I cant see the screen"?</div>
