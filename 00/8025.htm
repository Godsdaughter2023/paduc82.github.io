    <title>Shortcut to Deleted items is missing Empty from context menu - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Shortcut to Deleted items is missing Empty from context menu</h2>
                    <p>The shortcuts in the Shortcuts pane should have the same context menus as they do in the Folder List.&nbsp; Here is how to reproduce the bug:</p>
<p>Note: Shortcuts are found in the navigation pane. Try a Ctrl-F7 to view Shortcuts. Look at the bottom of the navigation pane. Shortcuts is one of the icons there. It's either on the bottom or on the right. Right-click on "Shortcuts" in the shortcuts pane
 and select "New Shortcut". Add a shortcut to the recycle bin. Now add a shortcut to Junk E-mail.</p>
<p>Create a shortcut to Deleted Items to the Shortcuts pane.</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete some messages.</li><li>Right-click on the shortcut to Deleted Items.&nbsp; Note that "Empty Deleted Items" is missing from the context menu.</li></ol>
<p>There should also be "Empty Folder" in the context menu for Junk Email.&nbsp; This is also missing in the Shortcuts pane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have Excel 2007, so I'm not sure if this applies, but in Excel 2010 there are two ways to insert a text box into a chart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. from the Insert ribbon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. from the Chart Tools &gt; Layout ribbon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using the Insert ribbon, you can insert a text box, but the chart may not be selected. In that case, the text box will not be connected to the chart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select the chart first, then the text box will stay with the chart. The best way to ensure the chart is selected is to use the command from the Layout ribbon, since that only appears when the chart is selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshots show a chart with three text boxes. In the second screenshot, the chart was dragged to a different location. Anything that does not survive a drag inside Excel will not survive a copy/paste to Word, either.</p>

<h2>            office 365 blocking .xlsx because of JAR &#40;java archive&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have malware detection set up in our office 365 environment. Emails get scanned and are not delivered into our environment if they contain malware. Since setting this up I've noticed it is blocking emails with .xlsx and .docx because of JAR (java archive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that .xlsx and .docx contain java? Or is the email filter working to well and blocking false positives? If so, how can this be tuned to not block .xlsx and .docx but still block JAR?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">This message was created automatically by mail delivery software. Your email message was not delivered to the intended recipients because malware was detected.</p>

            <p>Hi Dagarci2,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s possible that the .xlsx and .docx files contains java.</p>
<p>Also, you can <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200769(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
report false positives to Microsoft for analysis</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all of the .xlsx and .docx files are blocked, you can check OWA mailbox policy to check if they are blocked file types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;You need to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a> and use the cmdlet Get-OwaMailboxPolicy | Export-Csv C:\owamailboxpolicy.csv to export the policy setting to a csv file to check the blocked file types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Franky</p>

    <title>14959 - Lumia 950XL- Fatal&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dd-drahnier  say:</h3>
<h2>            14959 - Lumia 950XL- Fatal&#33;</h2>
                    <p>That's it for me. I'm out. Not that I wanted to, but upgrading from build 14955 to 14959 has just killed my Lumia 950XL (while a Lumia 930 updated just fine).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, more precisely: It was Windows Device Recovery Tool that killed the phone. After four or five failed attempts to install build 14959, I decided to do a full device recovery. A freshly downloaded and&nbsp;installed Windows Device Recovery Tool detected my
 Lumia 950 XL correctly, but at the end of the recovery process it claimed that the recovery has failed - and that&nbsp;rendered the phone inoperable: It can not be turnend on any more ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 20161105:</p>
<p>I've made some progress in resurrecting the device: (It requires several attempts, but:) Attaching it to my tablet, the tablet enumerates it as "Qualcomm "HS-USB QDLoader 9008 (COM3)" - but the phone itself still looks dead: no vibrate, no display.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another Edit:</p>
<p>This is getting wired: Because it has to do with cables! To explain: The devices involved&nbsp;are a HP Pro Tablet 608G1, and the very Lumia 950XL. The Tablet has only one USB-C type connector, so the two devices were connected to each other by a USB-C 3.1 cable
 which came with a Microsoft Surface Continuum Display Adapter. This setup requires several attempts to have the tablet recognize the phone as the Qualcom QDLoader mentioned in my first edit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, throwing the Widows Device Recovery tool at this setup, it fails to recognize the phone, but eventually finds sort of a attached device. However, the connection between phone and tablet appears to be very unstable: The Qualcom QDLoader randomly disappears
 from Device Manager, causing the Windows Device Recovery Tool, although having downloaded a recovery emergency package, once again&nbsp;complain about not seeing a device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replacing the Microsoft USB-C 3.1 cable with a chain of Belkin USB-C-to-USB3 adapter and a Microsoft USB-C/USB3 cable (the one which originally came with the phone)currently gives reason for some hope: The tablet/phone connection appears to be (more) stable,
 and the Windows Device Recover Tool claims to have initiated an emergency recovery for the phone. It is currently waiting for the phone to complete this recovery which is supposed to take up to 30 minutes. The phone's screen is still black, but he phone is
 quite hot, so it is possible busy doing something ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I gave up after patiently waiting for almost one hour: The phone remains dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 20161117: </p>
<p>Good news: I finally succeeded in resurrecting the phone. Two "issues" were at the heart of previous failed attempts: (a) a HP USB-C Dock which I use to provide (pass-through) power to the tablet and to wich I connected the phone; this dock&nbsp;caused any&nbsp;connection&nbsp;to
 the phone to be extremely unreliable, (b) the phone's unwillingness to charge an empty battery (even with it's original charger) while it was in a "dead" state. --- Both the phone itself and it's battery are fine now, running build 14965 (which is actually
 not a&nbsp; "fine" build).</p>

<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you perform a soft reset. Press and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button
 until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:<strong>Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt;
 about &gt; reset your phone.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure to back up all of your files before performing a hard reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Go to Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Backup &gt; Apps + settings &gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Back

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what you’ve mentioned, the issue that you’ve encountered when you use Internet Explorer in accessing a website is caused by a software installed on your computer. Since you’ve already performed some troubleshooting steps and fixes that was found
 in the developer’s website and the issue still persists, we’d like to confirm if you’ve tried also reinstalling the software and updating its version. If you haven’t tried yet, you may check the steps on the support website of the software and install the
 latest version. Once it was already reinstalled, check if that resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’ll wait for your response.</p>

 not shared any of the calendar with anyone.&nbsp;I tried to disable the To-Do list, reconfigure To-Do list and Add<span>&nbsp;
</span>ins but the problem persists.&nbsp;I tried to look at future items in To-Do list by arranging the items in "Arrange by: Due date mode" but no use.Is this some kind of bug?? Please help me out on this...</span></p>

<p>There are several phone cases and screen protectors available online and at our
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care Points</a> which minimise damage to the device and protect the phone from being affected by dust. Have a look here for your nearest Nokia Care Point, you can use a search engine
 online to find cases and screen protectors for the E72 online.</p>

<p>To add a web part to a page, navigate on the Home page and then click on Edit. On the ribbon, click on Insert and then select Web Part. You can check this

            If you click a list item you'll open the&nbsp;DispForm.aspx page - is that what you're seeing? Does it open in a dialog or a new tab? Those instructions aren't clear but though the dispform page is editable I don't think that's the best way to do this.

            Good grief &nbsp;- another feature we've spent countless resources training people to use has been removed in the "new" experience? It's getting harder and harder to justify Msft's absurd lack of concern for their customers. &nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi Syed,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are getting the error “<strong><em>0xC1900101 &amp; 0x20007</em></strong>” while trying to install Windows 10 Technical Preview on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to have the following information regarding this issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) What is the current Windows version installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Did you install the latest drivers for all the devices on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The most likely cause of this error could be an incompatible driver or hardware defect critical for booting the intermediary environment necessary to perform the upgrade actions.
 Let us try the following troubleshooting methods and check if that resolves the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 1: Disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard)</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any unnecessary external devices (except the mouse and the keyboard) connected to the computer, then disconnect them and check if this issue persists. If the issue still persists, then
 try the next method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 2: Update the Drivers for all the Devices on the Computer</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 1: Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have Windows 8.1 on the computer, then follow these steps to check for the latest drivers in Windows Update. If yes, then install the drivers and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Updates</em></strong>” in the search bar and click on the icon “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” from the search result.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” window, click on the link: “<strong><em>Check for updates</em></strong>” from the left pane of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p><span>d) If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For any issues while installing Windows Updates, you may also refer to this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Troubleshoot problems with installing updates</span></a></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t help, then try the next step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 2: Update Driver Software from the Manufacturer’s website:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the computer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 8.1/8 drivers available for all the devices on the computer and then install them by following the instructions given in
 the website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Please get back to us with the troubleshooting results.</span>

<p>hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had build 9841 installed on an old 80gb HDD for a few weeks now ( dual booting on a separate HDD with windows 8.1 ). was having problems&nbsp;updating to build 9860. checked what room I had on my HDD and realised I was using 74gb of my 80gb!!!
 ( no idea why it was taking up 74gb )&nbsp;anyhow &nbsp;I have done a fresh install of build 9841 then immediately updated to build 9860. no other programs installed other than the apps that came with the latest build. it takes up just under 25gb of room on my HDD.
 not sure how&nbsp;the hybrid drive works, but if&nbsp;build 9860&nbsp;is trying to install on the 24gb SSD part, then it just isn't big enough.

            <p>I seriously don't know why the MS guys bother responding to these Win10 threads. &nbsp;I think out of all the answers I've seen them cut'n'paste, only one has been relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read accounts of the upgrade process taking up to an extra 45GB of space (mine took 30GB), so what Gary said could very well apply, I don't know much about how hybrids work. &nbsp;If you have trapped yourself on a 24GB partition you could try using the iso
 method:</p>
<p>http://www.chris123nt.com/2014/10/21/make-an-iso-for-window-10-9860/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I've read reports of driver clashes; upgrade all your drivers, if it still doesn't work, uninstall some stuff (notably graphics drivers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, make sure you only have essential USB devices plugged in during the upgrade (I had left my mouse and keyboard, unplugged my mp3 player). &nbsp;That seems to have affected a lot of Windows 8 --&gt; 8.1 upgrades, don't think I've actually seen it be the cause
 of the problem here, but it can't hurt to keep it in mind.</p>

            I tried all of the recommended "solutions" to the problem of build 9860 installation error 0xc1900101 0x20007 including booting to a cold start, unplugging all USB drives, and uninstalling my graphics Nvidia driver. None of this worked. What did work was
 reformatting the Win10 TP partition, reinstalling the original build 9841 from ISO, allow Windows Update to install fixes and then immediately update to build 9860. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I also cannot install build 9860.&nbsp; I get "Couldn't update to Windows Technical Preview" Error 0xC1900101-0x30018".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried 5 times to install Build 9860 with many of the things tried by others.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It gets to various stages of install (48%, 69%, or 88%), then hangs. After restart it reverts back to Build 9841.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's hard to understand, as Build 9841 installed flawlessly and runs great on the same computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>W</span>hat do I do now?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Stay testing on build 9841?&nbsp; If so, will I continue to get updates? Will some future build work?&nbsp; Or should I simply go back and reinstall Windows 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, am not going to try installing by ISO.&nbsp; Spent too much time on this already (it's not just the clean install, it's then adding my addition programs, personalizing, etc. etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've read Microsoft is trying to get us away from that (ISO).&nbsp; My point to them, is that if this is the way they want us to go, then they should make it work properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; People will not try&nbsp;5 times like me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to keep build 9841 and see where it takes me (and how it influences me).&nbsp; By the way, build 9841 is still getting updates (so I have no idea what Microsoft's intention is with there old builds)???</p>

<p>hello rajesh</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks alot for the reply and i appreicate your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the thing is that i am already running Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 9841 successfully without any errors. my all hardware drivers are installed and running good. there are no errors or un-installed hardware in the device manager. furthermore, my all
 software are also running good. i have done couple of windows updates as well which are available for windows 10 technical preview and now no more updates are there to be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now as Microsoft released the Build 9860 Update for Windows 10 Technical Preview, its unable to install on my system. after downloading and installation, the system reverts back to its previous Build 9841 and gives the above errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am not able to solve it and understand it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am using an Asus VivoBook S550CB Laptop, with 8 GB RAM, Intel Core I7 3537U processor, 750GB Hybrid HDD with 24GB SSD, along with Intel Graphics its coupled with NVidia GeForce 740M 2GB, its a touchscreen laptop with all the hardware running smoothly under
 current Build 9841.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i hope that explains my situation well. thanks alot for your concern and&nbsp;i am still looking to solve this issue.</p>

<p>hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had build 9841 installed on an old 80gb HDD for a few weeks now ( dual booting on a separate HDD with windows 8.1 ). was having problems&nbsp;updating to build 9860. checked what room I had on my HDD and realised I was using 74gb of my 80gb!!!
 ( no idea why it was taking up 74gb )&nbsp;anyhow &nbsp;I have done a fresh install of build 9841 then immediately updated to build 9860. no other programs installed other than the apps that came with the latest build. it takes up just under 25gb of room on my HDD.
 not sure how&nbsp;the hybrid drive works, but if&nbsp;build 9860&nbsp;is trying to install on the 24gb SSD part, then it just isn't big enough.

<p>
</p><p>hello gary</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the thing is that ssd has 2 partitions. one 8gb for IRST setup (by default from asus) and 2nd 14gb un-used and not-initialized. its just sitting there doing nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I don't think that the newer build is trying to get installed on the ssd because one portion is reserved for ISRT and second one is not even available for use. i think its some other issue.</p>

</p><p>Finally, make sure you only have essential USB devices plugged in during the upgrade (I had left my mouse and keyboard, unplugged my mp3 player). &nbsp;That seems to have affected a lot of Windows 8 --&gt; 8.1 upgrades, don't think I've actually seen it be the cause

<p>
</p><p>hello hotcakes</p>
<p>
</p><p>I 100% agree that none of the officials from MS has replied or contacted me. i think they dont even read this forum and thread.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that when they offer their product's developer preview builds, they only expect input from developers, I think they don't give imp to general consumers, their feedbacks, their problems in using the product or even their suggestions but they claim
 exactly the opposite!</p>
<p>
</p><p>well I don't have any devices plugged in, I don't have any drivers issues or software issues. i really dont understand that build 9841 downloaded and installed like a breeze but this is not just installing. it downloaded but not installing, from half way
 it rolls back the installation.</p>

 malfunctioned. Tried restarting the computer, even uninstalled the TPM from device manager. She's signed in to all O365 apps including Excel and can save locally. This only happens when trying to save to OneDrive.</p>

    <title>Font Rendering is Seriously Off in Outlook email and other thoughts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charmoffensive  say:</h3>
<h2>            Font Rendering is Seriously Off in Outlook email and other thoughts about Mac&#47;Outlook&#47;Office</h2>
                    <p>This issue has been addressed previously in some angry posts on this forum, but I thought I would address it a bit differently. The numbers below represented the following: an email sent from Outlook 2016 for Mac using a 16pt Calibri font that displays as
 12 pt when it is received in Outlook for a PC etc. In the screenshot below, it is also apparent that if you are composing the email in O2016/Mac, 11 and 12 point fonts are tiny (I have tried this on both a Retina MBP and Retina 5K iMac). &nbsp;So bumping up the
 font size to make it more readable during the email composition phase paradoxically and weirdly renders the font correctly on the recipient's computer. Since my desire is to send emails in 11 pt, I display them in 15pt in Outlook/Mac and they show up to the
 recipient as 11 pt. &nbsp; So in a sense everything works, but this is not exactly how WYSWIG is supposed to work - this is a perversion of the concept. Also note in the example below that 12 pt Mac translates into 9 pt PC whereas 11 pt Mac renders as 10 pt PC
 Outlook. This is totally illogical and counterintuitive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only the lost in translation issue with fonts. &nbsp;Who knows how other screen elements render on the PC side. &nbsp; Outlook Mac doesn't support insertion of tables, you can't show the markup because there is no paragraph button, and tons of other features
 area missing. On a large screen, the Apple menu houses a ton of commands that on a Windows PC are integrated into the ribbon interface. The Mac way of doing things (they know best of course) &nbsp;foists a confusing and time-consuming bifurcated menu system on
 the user. &nbsp;On the other hand, the browser experience of Safari on the Mac is amazing, it integrates with IOS, FaceTime, IMessage etc. &nbsp;That's a lot of what I do at work. &nbsp;And Mac clearly delivers a hardware experience with Retinal displays using postscript
 rendering that PCs cannot match at ultra high resolutions. &nbsp;It's a real challenge to try to have your cake and eat it to because Office and particularly Outlook for Mac is underpowered and feature deprived compared to its Windows counterpart. &nbsp; I could install
 Windows/Office on a bootcamp partition, but then I would lose the IOS and browser superiority. I have installed window/office/Mac on a VM partition using Parallels Desktop for Mac. &nbsp;It's just not the same. It's slower, jerkier etc. So I will try have to make
 due with the dumbed down version of Office and use Word for a lot of email composition - if really important s then I will send it out using OWA (web-based) Lite client. Outlook for Mac is a big disappointment for me. it was a major reason I switched to Macs.
 &nbsp;Look before you leap, right. In any case, what I learned is that overall, the switch was still better for, given the other features the Mac offers. &nbsp;I don't hold out much hope things will change. Why should Microsoft make the effort? No matter. PC Hardware
 for the high end of the consumer market is doomed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>On the Windows side of Office the Outlook email composing tool that is used is Microsoft Word - you just don't see it as Microsoft Word while you are using Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, on the Mac side Microsoft has chosen to give Outlook its own light-weight email composing tool, which doesn't play well on the PC side, as many have discovered. The Outlook composing tool supports all the languages of Mac OS X and uses Apple's
 spelling and grammar checker. If you use Hebrew or Arabic or any other language supported by Mac OS X but not the rest of Microsoft Office, you can still compose messages. So there are pluses and minuses to this special, light-weight Outlook composing tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Mac side, you can use Microsoft Word as the Outlook composing tool. Whenever you want to send something more complex than just text, open Microsoft Word and from the View menu choose Web Layout. Then compose your message. When you're ready to send,
 in Word choose File &gt; Share &gt; Send HTML. Yes, it's not as convenient as having Word being the default composing tool like it is in Windows, but it does work better for more complex messages and cross-platform compatibility.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is a classic kluge. &nbsp;I will try it. It's better than having to go the VM and send the email there in the more robust version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, the CEO of Microsoft canned a number of high level executives for either not performing or no longer being needed by MS. &nbsp; The same should be done with the executive leadership that is overseeing Outlook for the Mac because this situation with
 inconsistencies at incompatibilities is utterly pathetic.</p>

            <p>Yes - and there are situations where my suggestion won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook for Mac has always been more "Mac-like" than "Office-like." Office for Mac supports Applescript, but not Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications making cross-platform automation solutions impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own impression is that for the past 5 years Mac users want Microsoft Office on the Mac to be more "Office-like" than "Mac-like." To me, that means having feature parity and as much cross-platform programmability support as possible. I think the Mac audience
 in 2004 was the opposite - where we wanted Mac-only features and were willing to compromise when it came to cross-platform capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to see everyone's thoughts about this.</p>

            <p>@Jim - I'm new to the Mac after using Windows since it first came out. I'm obviously in the camp that wants parity. &nbsp; As far as your workaround solution for sending complex emails, it worked reasonably well, but fell short when it came to images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not able to do a cut and past of the work I did in Word. &nbsp;Even the table would not past correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall the Word version of Mac 2016 is closer to its Windows counterpart that Outlook. Outlook seems closer it Outlook Webmail (OTA).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The biggest headache I have with Microsoft Outlook for Mac at the moment is its inability to export my personal folders to a PST file to allow swapping back and forth between the PC and Mac versions. &nbsp;Now that I've switched to Outlook for Mac in the hope
 of never again needing a Windows Boot Camp partition or VM, I'm now stuck with it and can't go back to the superior Windows application. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If it weren't for the lack of a Microsoft Visio or Project variant for OS X I'd have moved away from Windows permanently and never looked back. &nbsp;I'm not impressed with Windows 10 and would prefer to rely on one operating system for all my needs. &nbsp;Someone

            The directions I gave said "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">in Word choose File &gt; Share &gt; Send HTML.</span>" This avoids using Outlook's built-in composing tool. If you copy or cut and paste into the Outlook composing tool, that simply
 won't do because it is the Outlook composing tool we're trying to avoid.

            <p>I also have a few machines I'll dual boot into OS X/ Windows. I have done almost everything I can to avoid the windows side as my work is more important than becoming a full time IT guy trying to keep a windows box running. As an engineer and a scientist
 I use a lot of special software. I'll share with you that for Microsoft Project on the mac side I use iTaskX and it took no time to get up to speed with it. Except of reporting, it is a good alternate for Project and it will read and write .mpp files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Visio, A favorite, I have done everything in Omnigraffle and it will also read vision files, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you might try those and while the MS Office for Mac is not perfect compared to the PC version, I still find it a better tool than iWork. IMHO.&nbsp;</p>

            This is a reasonably good workaround, but not perfect by any means. The images I embedded in my word document using one of the display options did not display very well. &nbsp;it's unfortunate that MS is making things so difficult. &nbsp;I guess if the versions
 had parity, less copies of Windows would be purchased. &nbsp;This product is so new that guides for changing work habits just aren't out there.

            <p>re: the headache you are having, here is a possible RX: </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am transitioning away from Windows to the Mac. My Windows machine is still running, but I am no longer using it except for the moving/migrating of data. &nbsp;Major challenges on the iMac are lack of a robust clipboard app on the Mac, and weaker versions of
 Office apps, especially Outlook for Mac 2016 which is really an embarrassment for MS and missing tons of features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the Parallels Desktop for Mac VM program on both of my Macs. &nbsp;I have an 11gb &nbsp;.PST file that holds nearly a decade's worth of emails. I am now using th0e Exchange server client for all of my emails and have been doing so concurrently for
 two years, maintaining the .PST file on a singles Windows machine as the default data file, trying to keep it in sync through rules. &nbsp;Now the .PST file will no longer be my primary mail store. Exchange is now my default data repository.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 2013 installed in a Windows 8 VM on both my iMac 5K desktop and MBPro. &nbsp;In each VM, I have overwritten the initially created PST w/the PST from my Windows Desktop which is now frozen in time. &nbsp;I &nbsp;have it around for archival and search purposes
 and to copy some the the emails that are important to my Exchange account. &nbsp;(it doesn't appear that Outlook for Mac allows the UI to show favorites folders so I will have be get used to that as well, another glaring and unfortunate lapse of judgment by Microsoft).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also imported the .PST file into Outlook into Outlook for Mac 2016. It was as simple painless process. &nbsp;The default account is now the Exchange Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I need to compose an email that includes tables and images and Outlook for the Mac is not up to the task, I can go into the VM and use Outlook 2013. I have tried the workaround of sharing a Word Doc to Outlook as HTML - it works OK, but its a kluge.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Because Microsoft does not render its OS or Office apps particularly well on ultrahigh definition displays like the 5K iMac, it looks less polished on the screen than the Office Mac 2016 counterpart. &nbsp;Text is not as crisp although it is still retina. &nbsp;My
 guess is that it would look similar in Bootcamp. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's my workaround. Since I am using an Exchange client for my mailstore, exporting has become irrelevant. I have the more robust versions of office at my fingertips. I really don't care how their being stored as long as I can retrieve them from Exchange
 server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Translation of course between both version of Outlook is far from ideal as I have pointed out in other posts. &nbsp;it's obvious the real smart people are not manning this project for MS. &nbsp;They're getting the leftovers, the really top notch talent have fled to
 Google, Apple, Facebook etc. &nbsp;The folks who created Outlook for the Mac 2016 have no vision.</p>

    <title>Cannot access account despite several password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcotugno  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot access account despite several password changes&#47;verifications.</h2>
                    <p>I attempted to log onto my primary e-mail account today, and a message popped up telling me that my account may have been compromised. It then prompted me to prove my ownership of the account by having an e-mail sent to my other (comcast) account for verification.
 I no longer have this other account, so I opted for the second option: create another account with Outlook, fill out a questionnaire, and wait for Outlook to tell me I sent in enough info to claim ownership over my primary account. I'd also tried changing
 my password a couple times, but it still hadn't let me in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About twenty minutes later, I got an automated e-mail telling me that I had sent in enough info, and they'd look into it. About an hour and a half after that I got another e-mail stating that congratulations! I am indeed the owner of my original e-mail and
 that I was free to log back in once I received a password reset prompt from a supposed second e-mail coming in (it's been an hour - nothing in sight). I tried to log in again, only to have my current password not work for whatever reason. I changed it yet
 again but when I tried to log in, It gave me the same "It appears as if someone else has tried to access your account" message. I'm beyond frustrated and am at a loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem, or found any fixes?</p>

<p>If you valued user feedback, then you would have already known that this redesign is absolutely horrible. Claiming that you want a unified platform as a reason for making a UI completely unusable, and alienating all of your current users in the process of
 doing so, is completely asinine. This redesign is atrocious. And ignoring all of the glaring problems with it (Including a complete lack of understanding or consideration with regard to usability), the simple fact that you completely ignored your entire established
 user-base is mind-blowing. I happen to work in the industry, and not only have to make daily decisions about how to support both existing and new customers when it comes to interface and UI changes, but I also have a dedicated UI/UX team that not only designs
 for aesthetics, but also consistently takes into account the needs and behaviors of our current client-base when architecting interfaces. What you've done with this latest abomination you call a redesign is effectively give the finger to the literally millions
 of users you have....or at least had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know my comments won't amount to much of anything, and you could care less what I think, but I would still like you to know that I am very disappointed in the redesign, but even more so in how it was handled and how arrogant your complete disregard for
 an established user-base really is.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand users point of view regarding the interface of the new Skype. One main point of unifying the versions for all platforms is to deliver the services and features that are available&nbsp;on another platform to another. The new design may be confusing
 as of the moment, but our developers are working hard to improve the application experience that will benefit the majority of Skype users in the long run.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>User feedback and suggestions are main core of feature release and updates. Some feature may not be available as of the moment and we sincerely apologize for that. Our development and engineering team are working hand-in-hand to provide the best that Skype
 has to offer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your feedback will not be left in vain as we took note of it. We will pass it along to the appropriate support team so they can use it to strengthen the app and user experience.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>
<p>

<p>We apologize if you feel this way, however the reason why we users to upgrade to the new version is for them to be familiarized with the new interface. We are about to unify the interface across all supported platforms so the features will be available,
 not just to one but to all platforms. </p>

</p><p>If you are referring to paid call logs like calls to mobiles and landlines, you will be able to see your call logs and cost under

 I followed all of the steps to recover my email and I never was emailed any code like it said. I had to make a new email to make this post. It all started when I got the email that my email account about a security alert and that they thought someone was using

    <title>External Data Source&#58; insert entire row - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaq  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Data Source&#58; insert entire row</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Excel Query using a SQL server database as the data source.&nbsp; I have added 6 extra columns to the right of the returned data set for users to fill in (selecting values from drop-down lists).</p>
<p>The users will have the ability to refresh the data set if required and I have turned on the 'refresh data when opening the file' option.</p>
<p>When the data is refreshed I would like any new rows to be inserted thus moving down the entire row (including the 6 extra columns) so that the data in the 6 extra columns&nbsp;remains aligned with the relevant row.</p>
<p>The "insert entire rows for new data ..." option does not&nbsp; do what I require, as it leaves the data in the extra columns stationary (in the same row number as it was entered) and does now keep it aligned with its 'source' row.</p>
<p>I need a similar function when rows are deleted in the SQL database, that is, when refreshed the entire row is deleted, including the 6 extra columns to the right of the external data range.</p>
<p>Is there a way for me to do this?</p>

<p>When you refresh the SQL data, new data will be returned in whatever order is determined by your SQL query. All links to the data you have added in Excel will be lost. Sorry, that's just the way it works.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways around this.</p>
<p>One simple thing you could try is to include a unique identifier in the SQL data, eg ClientId. Then add a ClientId column to the Excel data, and add the six columns next to that. You would then need a macro to match the SQL ClientId to the Excel ClientId
 once the SQL data is refreshed.</p>
<p>Or, if you have admin rights on the SQL Server, enable write-back to the server table and include the extra columns there.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to display the exact value on the y-axis on a chart&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to display the exact value on the y-axis on a chart?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;we have values, lets say the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>January&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; February&nbsp;&nbsp; March ...</p>
<p>12345&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 54321&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11111</p>
<p>
</p><p>we&nbsp;would get by default the following chart: </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9e70838-36d0-4d99-95b6-5dc178113428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9e70838-36d0-4d99-95b6-5dc178113428" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we would like to see the exact value on the y-axis, namely, 12345, 54321 and 11111. Is it possible to display the true source data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We know that we can display the true data above the columns, but it should be displayed - for whatever reason - on the y-axis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nicole</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the article Andy linked to is not about showing categories. You can use the values of the bars as the Y values and pair them with the X value of 0. Then add that data to the chart as&nbsp;a XY&nbsp;Scatter chart series on the secondary axis. Add labels to the XY series
 and place to the left of the data points. Now you can remove the original Y axis labels and format the XY series to have no markers. This now looks as if the Y axis shows only the values of the data points plotted in the columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something like the screenshot below, where the XY series markers have not yet been hidden. You can see that if the data points are close together, the labels might overlap. Therefore, it might be a cleaner approach to show the data labels above each&nbsp;columns&nbsp;and
 don't mess around with tricked Y axis.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I really need help, I saved a lengthy document on WordPad and now all the text is invisible. The reason I know its invisible and not swiped is because I can still highlight it and scroll down the page, and the memory even states 24kb. However, I can't seem
 to get the writing to appear visible. I can't restore any previous versions as apparently I have none, despite working on it for 4 hours yesterday.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried changing the colour, sending it via email to another person, but no luck. Text appears when I type it but not when I try to open already saved work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is invisible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            This forum is for Microsoft Word. WordPad is a Windows Accessory. You'll need to ask in a Windows forum.

<h2>            Not getting Verification email</h2>

 accounts! Please help!
