<h2>            Desktop Icons completely gone</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my desktop is now completely empty now. I have tried many solutions but all have failed, I've tried right-clicking desktop&gt;View&gt;Show Desktop Items, but that was already enabled. I tried deleting my Iconcache.db file, I managed to delete it after several
 tries but it didn't fix anything. When I go into file explorer and click desktop nothing shows up, when I try to create a folder, it ends up not responding and a fully green screen comes up and then goes back to the way it was</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated :) </p>

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />

<h2>            How to properly license Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation</h2>
                    <p>I installed the evaluation edition because it was not available on the licensing portal. Now that we have KMS working and I also have access to MAK keys, I would like to license it properly. Every time I try to change to the KMS key or the MAK key, I get
 the following error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The product key you entered can't be used to activate this edition of Windows. Please try a different key."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked to see if there was an option to upgrade using the regular Enterprise media, but I only get the option to do a clean install and I don't want to re-install everything again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, I appreciate the help!</p>

            <p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the linked FAQ and cannot see how it applies to the question. After installing Windows 10 Enterprise Trial my Windows is now activated and valid for 90 days. But when trying to enter our MAK Key it errors with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We couldn't activate windows"<br />
"The product key you entered can't be used to activate this edition of Windows"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advice. </p>

<h2>            Windows doesn&#39;t have a network profile for this device</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello to all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have encountered an odd dilemma.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>I have (2) Polaroid A6 Link phones, both..</div>
<div>- Android Version 4.4.2</div>
<div>
<p>- Build A6_20151012&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>I have&nbsp;3 computer systems..</div>

<div>- Acer Aspire TC220 - Windows 10 (desktop)&nbsp; (** this is the only variable; it was&nbsp;purchased new a few weeks ago to replace an identical Acer Aspire TC220)&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Acer Aspire 5750-6425 - Windows 10 (laptop)</div>
<div>
<p>- Lenovo ThinkPad L510 - Windows 7 Home Premium (laptop)</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I am not sure when everything last worked properly as I don't normally have a need to connect the phones to the computers to access the internal storage; but, I could connect at one time (both phones/all computers prior to ** new desktop.&nbsp; However, today
 when I tried, neither phone connects to&nbsp;any computer.&nbsp; Neither phone shows up in the Device Manager or the Printers &amp; Devices&nbsp;sections of the Control Panel and every time I try to add the phone I get the subject message.&nbsp; I have many compatible usb cables
 and have tried all manner of combinations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Storage on the phones &amp; click the 3 vertical dots in top right corner, the 'USB Computer Connection' is greyed out.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>Both phones act similarly on&nbsp;all 3&nbsp;computers systems (I.e. They do not connect via USB) and for the life of me I am truly 'stymied'.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>Any thoughts on the matter?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
                </div>

<p>Hi &amp; thanks for reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only change would be the new desktop I purchased a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I know I could connect both phones to both laptops &amp; previous PC which was an identical model; but, don't know when I could last connect the phones.&nbsp; The PC is connected to the internet by
 ethernet cable; the laptops (&amp; phones) connect wirelessly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I reset my router but that didn't help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried soft reset of phones.&nbsp; Not sure how but I guess I can find out somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you mean by 'restarting computer'; it gets restarted at least once a day.&nbsp; Did you mean 'resetting the computer'?&nbsp; I haven't tried that yet but wonder how that would matter as the phones will not connect to either of my 2 laptops.&nbsp; But how
 knows??&nbsp; I went through all Troubleshooting categories on all 3 systems and nothing popped out as a problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many tries last evening I was able to get one of the phones to again show up when I&nbsp;clicked 'add a device' in the Device/Printers section&nbsp;but when I clicked the phone icon, I get&nbsp;the same error message:&nbsp; Windows doesn't have a network protocol for
 this device.&nbsp; A second try awhile later gave me the slightly different error message: Windows doesn't have a network profile for this device.&nbsp; Researching these messages led me to Media Transfer Protocol &amp; how it's related to Windows Media Player; but, this
 is all a foreign language to me.&nbsp; Is this something that might have something to do with my problem???&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any input.</p>

<p>Hi &amp; thanks for reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only change would be the new desktop I purchased a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I know I could connect both phones to both laptops &amp; previous PC which was an identical model; but, don't know when I could last connect the phones.&nbsp; The PC is connected to the internet by
 ethernet cable; the laptops (&amp; phones) connect wirelessly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I reset my router but that didn't help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried soft reset of phones.&nbsp; Not sure how but I guess I can find out somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you mean by 'restarting computer'; it gets restarted at least once a day.&nbsp; Did you mean 'resetting the computer'?&nbsp; I haven't tried that yet but wonder how that would matter as the phones will not connect to either of my 2 laptops.&nbsp; But how
 knows??&nbsp; I went through all Troubleshooting categories on all 3 systems and nothing popped out as a problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many tries last evening I was able to get one of the phones to again show up when I&nbsp;clicked 'add a device' in the Device/Printers section&nbsp;but when I clicked the phone icon, I get&nbsp;the same error message:&nbsp; Windows doesn't have a network protocol for
 this device.&nbsp; A second try awhile later gave me the slightly different error message: Windows doesn't have a network profile for this device.&nbsp; Researching these messages led me to Media Transfer Protocol &amp; how it's related to Windows Media Player; but, this
 is all a foreign language to me.&nbsp; Is this something that might have something to do with my problem???&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any input.</p>

<p>Hello to all,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Eureka!!!!!!</strong> <strong>Mystery Solved!!!!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Not something I would have thought of in a million years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the past couple days I have been in and out of everywhere trying to figure out why my phones won't connect to my computers.&nbsp; I was about to bite the bullet and&nbsp;reset the phones even though I couldn't back them up but thought I would take one more spin
 around the internet and came across an obscure article about someone bemoaning the fact that the usb cable that came with his phone was only for charging; it would not connect it to his PC.&nbsp; &nbsp;My spirits soared .&nbsp; Please Please Please.&nbsp;
<em>Yep, that is exactly what my problem was.</em>&nbsp; I have more mini-usb cables than I have fingers and figured if I tried 5 of them in various combination with my 3 systems&nbsp;and I&nbsp;couldn't connect then that would be a reasonable assumption that something else
 was wrong.&nbsp; Go figure??&nbsp; Anyway, I&nbsp;gathered together all I had&nbsp;and (I hate this part), the 6 I had&nbsp;not tried worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yippee!!&nbsp; my phones and my computers are happily talking to each other.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been mucking about with computers for many years but I must say it sure surprised the heck out of me to find out that some mini-usb cables can only charge and NOT transmit data.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to me at the time,&nbsp;I had 6 that transmit/charge and 5 that
 charge only.&nbsp; My bad luck was the 5 that I pulled out of my stash to troubleshoot my problem were 'charge only.'&nbsp; My middle&nbsp;name truly&nbsp;must be "Murphy".&nbsp; However, I am further surprised that this information is not on the top of the troubleshooting list when
 someone reports a similar problem (phone not connecting to PC).&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so easy to&nbsp;suggest trying different cables; but, to know that not all cables are equal (i.e. some only charge) would truly help to zero in on the problem.&nbsp; I was on the verge of resetting
 my phones which would have been disastrous because I couldn't connect to PC to backup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I know and I hope this information might help others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>

I cannot find the same option in Windows 8<b><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have&nbsp;you checked support.dell.com to see if they have a Win8 driver available, that should&nbsp;include that feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I checked the site for your model Dell, I see an APLS ELECTRIC-Driver dated 01/29/2013</p>
<p>But its under Win7 64-bit</p>
<p>I dont see Win8 listed as an OS for downloads, however you can try installing the driver and see what happens.&nbsp; Just make&nbsp;a system restore point before installing.</p>

    <title>Fullscreen games minimize, mouse goes to upper left of primary monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> super-moth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fullscreen games minimize, mouse goes to upper left of primary monitor</h2>
                    <p>Seemingly at random (haven't checked to see if it's at a regular interval, ought to start writing down times) any fullscreen window minimizes (as they generally do when they're not the active window) and my mouse goes to the upper-left corner of my primary
 monitor (which I would assume is 0, 0 for the system).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happens with just about any game I play. I've run the System File Checker and it came up clean, I've killed a few unnecessary applications that might be doing it (scanner software, OneDrive, MalwareBytes) but I haven't tried shutting avast down entirely
 (though I have tried fiddling with its settings a bit.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any window pop up and I don't know what window is selected after it gets rid of the fullscreen application. I'd post some system info but it's not possible to copy-paste the info I can find and I'm not sure what info would be helpful and what
 wouldn't.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update, including BIOS, Chipset, Sound, Network, USB3, Bluetooth and all others.  Compare to the ones present installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu..  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br /> 
<br />You mention Avast.  No expert in forums (where we see the most cases, by the thousands) has recommended Avast for 7-8 years since it bloated up and started causing issues.  I would uninstall it and default to built-in Defender which always offers best Windows performance with least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.  
<br />
<br />You also mentioned running Malwarebytes.  I would not run Malwarebytes Real Time protection with any other Anti-virus except Defender which it is known to play well with - and not even that if you don't get regularly infected and it is indicated to have the Real Time protection instead of just the on demand scanner.
<br />
<br />You can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Another thing you can do do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

    <title>Old Windows Media Player Sample Songs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roselefee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old Windows Media Player Sample Songs</h2>
                    I'm looking for a specific song that I believe was from Windows Media Player, from 2003-2005 or possibly from earlier. I tried the normal songs that everyone lists as being from XP &amp; it's not one of them. All I remember is a chorus of breathy female voice
 singing either Henri (French pronunciation) or ennui, stretched out for many beats. I also had iTunes around that time, I won a free first gen ipod shuffle, so it could have been one of their free songs. It got lost in the years &amp; changing computers, but I
 miss it. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know. I also have Out Of Reach by Cities of Foam, I believe they're from the same time frame, if that's helpful.

<p>Presume you have Googled? I tried, but not much luck apart from the XP stuff already eliminated... it may be worth trawling through

    <title>A third screen appears when trying to duplicate screen to a TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fawedenoir  say:</h3>
<h2>            A third screen appears when trying to duplicate screen to a TV</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing a weird issue when trying to project my screen onto a tv in Windows 10 (using HDMI cable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop detects the second screen (a samsung TV) and if I am under Control Panel/Display/Screen Resolution, I can see both screens.</p>
<p>From this same page however, I only have the option to extend my monitor or to show it only on screen 1/2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to do is to duplicate my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press Win+P, I get that little pop up menu where I do indeed have the option to 'duplicate'. However, if I select duplicate, the following happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-My initial second screen (the TV) stays an extension</p>
<p>-My laptop screen shrinks</p>
<p>-Under ControlPanel/Display/Screen Resolution a third screen has appeared. More specifically, what was previously screen 2 -the tv- is now listed as screen 3, and my laptop is listed as both screens 1 and 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press 'Identify' both the numbers 1 and 2 appear on my laptop. (They appear as "1|2")</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press Win+P again and select 'Extend', the screens go back to normal with the TV being 2 and my laptop being 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is for the my laptop screen to be displayed both on my laptop and on the tv. Any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p />

<h2>            I have 2 drives, but one is showing up twice..&#63;</h2>
                    Okay, so I have 1 SSD and 1 HDD and I wanted to make it so the windows "videos" folder was stored on my HDD rather than my SSD Where windows was installed, so i right clicked on the videos folder, and went to the "Location" tab, and then changed it from
 "C:\Users\Joe A\Videos" To "D:\" Because I just wanted it straight on the drive, not in any subfolers. After I did that, something strange happened, and my drive appeared with the windows videos icon rather than a drive or folder icon, under "This PC" and
 now when i click that, it just takes me to the "D" drive (HDD) I realised i should have changed to path to "D:\Videos" But it's too late to do that now, and I can't change the path of the windows videos, because it IS the hdd?! So now i can only change the
 path of the HDD?! Can someone please help me?

<h2>            Please advise how to stop windows 10 forced updates&#33;</h2>
                    Just spent hours and lost tons of $$$$ from the latest forced updates over 15 of my windows miners,&nbsp; and now my remote pcs that went into an update have also stopped mining and will not be able to be restored for a week, I have tried numerous different
 techniques going into services.msc only to be re enabled by windows (seriously),&nbsp; the new updates resets all the video card properties within the AMD software causing major issues, if any of the Microsoft techs on here have any sort of remedy I would love
 to here them otherwise I will no longer be using windows and you should be looking for another job since you will be losing thousands of dollars in licencing, here is a thought put a simple do not update nor ask for another 6 months for one as an option!&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />You can use Group Policy to block automatic updates. This ensures updates are downloaded/installed only when you want them:

            Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-windows-10-stopupdates10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-win...</a>

            Please note, Microsoft's approach to updates is very different that earlier releases. They are basically mandatory because of Microsoft's past history with customers sometimes failing to install important updates.
<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />You can create a stop and start script for Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />Create a Notepad file with each of the following and save them with the .bat extension.
<br />
<br />stop-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= disabled
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= disabled
<br />net stop dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />start-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= auto
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= auto
<br />net start bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= auto
<br />net start dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />Now you can simply right click on stop-updates.bat and select “Run as Administrator”

<h2>            Lips - I love 80s, and Party Classic not working on xbox&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have the game Lips (the first one,) as well as I love 80s, and Party Classic. When trying to play them today, the 80s &amp; classic, froze the xbox. The First lips, played as well as updated. I went through the processes of " my screen freezes" that I found
 in the help section. Can anybody else provide any information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Windows stuck in automatic repair&#59; Can&#39;t access BIOS&#47; boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kierramccullough  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows stuck in automatic repair&#59; Can&#39;t access BIOS&#47; boot menu</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, my computer started up automatically at 1am. I shut it down fairly quickly because it's loud enough to prevent me from sleeping (nothing wrong with the hardware, it's just close to where I sleep and loud by design). I'm assuming it was trying
 to update automatically. I've done this many times before with no issue, but not this time.</p>
<p>The next day, when trying to boot it up normally, it would either display the windows logo indefinitely or display the windows logo and the loading icon, only to later go to a black screen indefinitely. Either way, I couldn't get past the windows automatic
 repair screen during a normal boot.</p>
<p>I changed the boot order to a windows 10 repair usb through BIOS, but my computer would never load it, instead going straight to the windows automatic repair screen. I double checked the specs of the repair usb to be sure it was set up correctly; it is.
 I checked several of the boot options to be sure I wasn't just selecting the wrong one, but all of them had the same result.</p>
<p>Now, it won't load BIOS or the boot menu at all. When I turn on my computer, it goes to the normal boot up icon screen which displays the hot keys to access BIOS, the boot menu, or Post. Pressing any of the keys (or any of the keys recommended online) just
 causes the computer to start the windows automatic repair screen. Letting it boot without intervention causes it to go to the windows automatic repair screen. No matter what I do, my computer gets stuck on that screen.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to find a method that could fix this <strong>without access to the desktop, BIOS, or the boot menu</strong>, of which I have access to none. Is there any way, or is my computer officially dead?</p>

            If there is anything on the screen at all then the BIOS is functioning.  
<br />I believe you said it is not responding to the Key you'd normally press to access UEFI/BIOS setup?  
<br />
<br />There are other methods to reset the BIOS here:

            Hi AiBas,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.

<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options, is Delivery Optimization turned on?
<br />
<br />If so, click Advanced Options in Delivery Optimization and full all sliders to their minimum values
<br />
<br />That should restrict the amount of your data being used by Windows Updates . . .

<p>When I went to those settings, it's showing me that there is 0 gb that have been uploaded. Does this mean that the data was uploaded from a different device?<br />

<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Network and Internet - Data Usage
<br />
<br />Under Overview, what is the data usage for your PC

<p>Hey NDN,</p>
<p>What are you trying to do when you're getting this message?</p>
<p>I'm guessing because this is on the purchasing or downloading something forum, it's getting some DLC or something! There are currently service issues with the Marketplace, updates can be found on the service page
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-live-status</a></p>
<p>Hopefully this is the reason behind your problem (which if you're buying or downloading something, chances are it is). Once the team resolve the issue, you should be all set!</p>
<p>But if you're trying to do something else, and still having this issue please let us know

<h2>            Do cross-gen games have separate achievements&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've already played FIFA 14 and Battlefield 4 on my Xbox 360. However I'm awaiting the arrival of my Xbox One on Friday and was wondering...when my gamertag has been transferred and I start up either of these games will I have my current Xbox 360 gamerscore
 for these games or do my achievements start again as I'm now playing on a different platform?</p>

<p>There is an achievement in Fifa 14 which is to Complete all Manager tasks. I did this in Early access and the system didnt register it so I had to create a new club on Fifa 14 Retail which was annoying. I imagine I will have to do it again. I should hopefully
 have the full 1000G in 2 days or so from Fifa 14.</p>

<p>I have the same problem on FIFA 14 with that exact same achievement too! But I didnt want to restart my club as my team is awesome...I wonder what will happen with Battlefield 4 then? I'm already a rank 25 so I can't go and do that achievement again because
 I can't delete my soldier. I hope what you're saying isn't true....</p>

<p>I wish I had known that before buying the 360 version of ghosts. I was not going to get it as I was planing on getting rid of my 360 before launch and only decided to pick it up when the upgrade offer was announced. I only got x amount of achievements before
 getting rid of my 360 and thought I would finish the rest on the ONE ... oops :(</p>

<p>From what I was just reading it appears that game progress does not cross over either. Possibly with BF4 and CoD as they have their own player stat stuff your online ranks might remain but from what I can gather actual game progress does not carry over.
 So start campaigns from the beginning and repeat achievements :(</p>

<p>How could your game progress transfer? Of course you have to start over.</p>

    <title>Favorite armor&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bottrot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Favorite armor&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>With the new DLC coming out in a few hours Im hoping for some really awesome armor, I saw the 1911 already so Im sold but new armor would be nice.
</p>
<p>So what armor do you guys like the most?</p>
<p>I usually use the reinforced helmet from Dead Money with the Van Graff armor, or the non reinforced helmet with reinforced armor. Of course you cant go wrong wtih desert ranger armor either.</p>

<p>Reinforced Leather since it offers decent protection (<em>particularly when coupled with both ranks of the Toughness perk</em>) &amp; is relatively light.&nbsp; For headgear the NCR trooper helmet.&nbsp; When i saw how it looked I gave the rest of my squad the same thing,
 except for Arcade &amp; Veronica, I gave them the Heavy Armor &amp; Power Armor respectively.&nbsp; Now my crew looks like they're from the first Mad Max movie.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as weapons I haven't found a "fave" yet since I'm going for different builds based on the game.&nbsp; In my first&nbsp;I was going for unarmed so I got
<em>Love &amp; Hate</em> &amp; then <em>Pushy</em>.&nbsp; Now I'm concentrating on a Melee &amp; Energy Weapons type.&nbsp; I've got
<em>Chopper</em> for melee (<em>I gave <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Oh Baby!</span> to Lily</em>) &amp; Recharger Pistol, Modified laser Rifle, the Alien weapons&nbsp;&amp; the Crashed Vertibird Prototype that I'm trying to get to 100% condition (<em>Luckily
 I made 10 Weapon Repair kits</em>).&nbsp; While on this, does anyone have any good suggestions on energy weapons vs Deathclaws?&nbsp;

            No I did not yet...but have found the computer starts blinking everytime "Skydrive" updates files....which is like every 45 minutes, then unless I move the mouse it keeps blinking.&nbsp; Once it stops blinking I have been timing it, to see when it starts blinking
 again, and it is everytime it says "Skydrive" updated files....is there a way I can stop this....I don't even use Skydrive, nor do I want it, but understand if I uninstall it I lose my email?? Thank you for any help you can give.
