<h2>            BANG BANG Nokia Lumia 520 Windows Phone 8 &#33;&#33;&#33; Bogus Phone</h2>
                    <p>I have using L520 Windows Phone 8 &gt; but now I feel too much frustration with this because it has not found any better features then to Android Phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its Office 365 is not better then to Android Quick Office Pro.</li><li><br />
</li><li>Its 5MP camera quality is not better then to Samsung Primo 5610K as per price (for outdoor photography).</li><li><br />
</li><li>It cannot move files within a phone like any android phone even any non-Smartphone.</li><li><br />
</li><li>It has not any individual lock or hide feature for any individual file like android phone.</li><li><br />
</li><li>Downloaded files or downloaded videos cannot move to PC via USB cable directly, for future use, too much frustrating.</li><li><br />
</li><li>Email attachment features only for photos. Very bad features.</li><li><br />
</li><li>Older email can’nt be accessed or displayed after few days.</li><li><br />
</li><li>Downloaded office and pdf files are unable to use for printing purpose. <span>
&nbsp;</span></li><li><br />
</li><li>Phone software update required Wifi, unable through phone data plan.</li><li><br />
</li><li>Heat on backside after one hour use is another issue of L520.</li></ul>
<p>IT HAS ONLY HIGH CAPACITIVE TOUCH AND LOOK!!! </p>
<p>Therefore, I cannot continue with this<b> BOGUS NOKIA LUMIA 520 WINDOWS PHONE 8!!!</b> I just go to through it into the dark water…. BOGUS NOKIA LUMIA 520 WINDOWS PHONE 8!!!</p>

<h2>            Word crashes when opening any document</h2>
                    <p>I updated to Mac OS 10.14.4 and after the update finished I tried opening a Word doc and Word crashed upon opening. I restarted Word and tried opening a new blank document and it crashed again. It seems to crash anytime I open any document now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then updated to Word 16.25 and it's still behaving the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint and Excel are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. I did also customize Word to add dozens of functions to the home tab earlier today before I updated to Mac OS 10.14.4. Is there a way to restore Word's default settings incase it's my customization that messed it up? I can't edit the toolbar without
 having a Word doc open.</p>

<p>Hi Sheridan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience caused by the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, we would suggest you try the following suggestion and check the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Open the Mac in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Safe Mode</a> and check whether you can open documents without crash.</p>
<p>b. If it doesn’t help, remove <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">the </span><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">com.microsoft.Word
</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>to trash and check it helps from crash</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Quit Word application if it is opened&gt; Open Finder&gt; Shift + command+ G&gt; Enter
</span><strong><span><span>~/Library/Containers/</span></span></strong><span>&gt; select com.microsoft.Word folder&gt; Move to trash</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the both suggestions didn’t help, can you please try to create a <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US&amp;viewlocale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new user account</a> and check whether problem occurs or not.</p>

    <title>Office 2016 Quick Access Toolbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brucekenner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 Quick Access Toolbar</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new computer with Office 2016 and I wish I still had Office 2010 which was on my old computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I "drop down to 2010 version"?&nbsp; </li><li>How do I do so?</li></ul>
<p>The problem for me is icon size on the QAT.&nbsp; Previously I had 50 icons on Excel QAT and could see all of them when my spreadsheet used about half of my 27" monitor (1920x1080).&nbsp; Now with Office 2016 I can only see 27 in same space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really miss being able to have so many icons in QAT.&nbsp; What can I do?&nbsp; There is nothing I've seen in 2016 that is more valuable to me than the extra icons I could see in 2010 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VERY DISAPPOINTING!&nbsp; Just FYI, I think a lot of people still use a Desktop PC at work and the changes to enable touch, tablets and laptops have made MS Office products much less effective.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />This is a problem likely caused by the work to make Office Applications work on tablets and touch devices. I know it is a problem for Word as well.
<br />
<br />It is unlikely to go back.
<br />
<br />You can still purchase Office 2010 from third-parties online and it is not that expensive.
<br />
<br />See if you can switch from Touch Mode to Mouse Mode. I've done that in Word where I have extensive QAT modifications. You may need to put that control on your QAT. (grin-not). If you want, I will research to see if I can give you step by step instructions for doing that.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

            It didn't take that much research. Same method as in Word. See the screenshot.
<br />
<br />This will not give you back everything but should help. 
<br />
<br />Uservoice should be used, even though I don't think they will change it, they might give us two rows on screen.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be876ac7-8271-40ea-9e5c-22609d8ce2b1?upload=true" />

            <p>First thing I would do is get an image backup of the drive where the PST file was located before much of anything gets written to that hard drive. If the file was deleted - it would have been recoverable via the Recycle Bin but since it was over-written
 it would have to be reconstructed (if possible) using a low level file recovery tool.</p>

    <title>formatting issues when I cut and paste from word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            formatting issues when I cut and paste from word</h2>
                    Hello <br />
<br />
I am hoping someone can help me. I commonly write documents in Word and then cut and paste the documents into Outlook. Unfortunately when I do this the email system changes the spacing between the paragraphs. I had the same issue with Hotmail on three different
 computers so I believe it is a compatibility issue between outlook and Word. I had this issue with hotmail too and the issue remains the same with Doc and Docx documents.
<br />
<br />
for example if I write the following in MS Word<br />
<br />
Dear Sue<br />
<br />
How are you today?<br />
<br />
We are launching the xxx<br />
<br />
when I cut and paste the document it looks like the following in Outlook<br />
<br />
Dear Sue<br />
How are you today?<br />
We are launching the xxx<br />
<br />
AND when someone replies it often comes back as<br />
<br />
Dear Sue<br />
<br />
<br />
How are you today?<br />
<br />
<br />
We are launching the xxx<br />
<br />
I have also noticed formatting issues with the fonts. Sometimes when I add a word or phrase in the document already cut and pasted into Outlook the font is different and I cannot correct it in Outlook.<br />
<br />
If this issue cannot be fixed in Outlook is there a word setting (other than .txt which causes other issues) that I can save my documents in?<br />
<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t Open .docx Word Files</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a MacBook Pro, Mid-2014. Recently updated Word to Microsoft Word for Mac Version 15.16. Also, recently upgraded my OS to El Capitan (10.11.1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to open Word files created in Word for Mac 2011 with file extension .docx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error message reads:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Word can't open the file because the file </strong></p>
<p><strong>format does not match the file extension.</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;(Ford_F M--Good Soldier_4.docx)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Current project involves upwards of 850 Word files, which I must be able to open, edit, save, in short,
<em>use</em>. I can still open them in older versions of Word, but would, of course, like to use the new version to which I subscribe via Office 365.</p>

            <p>I think the clue to your issue is in your 4th paragraph: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I actually remember having to change every file name from .doc to .docx when I bought the subscription earlier this year." Changing
 the file name ending doesn't change the format of the file, that can only be done by opening it in Word and using File&gt;Save As.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now it appears that Word &nbsp;will not open your .docx files because they are really misnamed .doc versions. So renaming them back to the original ending now makes them readable by Word.</span></p>

<h2>            Office 2010 professional 1 pack English 269 14670</h2>
                    I bought this package last week on Amazon. It came in a box with all the labels and seemed to be correct. The supplier is going to send one to replace it. Installed it on my desktop and then tried yesterday to do the same on my laptop with no success -
 its supposed to be a three user licence. I have Office 2010 preloaded on my laptop, but there is no way of accessing it, as the shortcut was deleted because at the time, it kept popping up everytime I opened a word processing document. It appears as a disk
 on my drive.<br />
When I try to install the new disk bases version, it whirs the drive for a while and then stops.<br />
I also have 0ffice 10 starter edition of word and excell, which were pre-installed on my machine.<br />
Question - Is this version one from a bulk licencing pack that has been split or is it a genuine usable copy.<br />
Is there any way of installing it:<br />

Thanks for that.<br />
The version is Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010<br />
&nbsp;I only needed two copies, one for the desktop and one for the laptop.<br />
I have just spoken with Microsoft to validate the product, as it says three copies on the box. They tell me that it is illegal software, an I am now in the process of returning it to them for checking, together with the name and contact details of the seller,
 who was on Amazon Market place. <br />
Amazon were very helpful, and are sending me a refund and doing their own investigation. Hopefully I will be getting a new key from Microsoft so that my purchase will still work.<br />
If it all works out, then I will be happy, but it should not happen, and its wasted me a day sorting it out.<br />
<br />
Is there any way of removing the Q drive? I still want to install office on the laptop at some stage, though the starter edition has word and excel which will do for now.<br />

            <p>Yes I'm afraid the Office Pro Plus version is the one most often hacked/illegal.</p>
<p>Pro Plus versions are volume licences only available to qualifying persons, often through their employers HomeUse Program (HUP)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I checked on amazon uk for that version and see a number of sellers selling Office 2010 Pro for &lt;£100</p>
<p>All the sellers seem to have zero or only the single feedback, or are new sellers. I would suspect they are all illegal versions.</p>
<p>I would suggest you obtained a refund and reported the seller to Amazon for selling illegal software</p>
<p>Expect to pay IRO £200+ for a genuine retail version</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In order to remove the Q drive you uninstall MS Office Starter</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 for mac&#58; Mail delivery failed -messages.</h2>
                    <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am having some problem with Outlook (Outlook for Mac 2011, version 14.1.3); some of thouse emails I’m sending are not reaching recipients. This problem is more like irregular than a continual (From time: 20% not working
 / 80% working.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Two examles:</span></p>
<p><span>- I am sending an email to my client. She/he is not receiving it as well as I’m not receiving any error-notification. I do receive the messages he/she is sending to my Outlook-account (We made a test).</span></p>
<p><span>- I am sending<span>&nbsp; </span>some emails, and my email account seems to work as I'm also receiving answers. But then suddenly my email-account start to receive thouse ”mail deliver failed (blocked using zen.spamhaus.org...)”
 –emails. My internet is working as It should. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From time to time I manage to send some test-emails to my yahoo-account, but not every time. Quite often I receive thouse ”mail delivery failed” –mails in my Outlook Inbox, but not always even thouse.</span></p>
<p><span>The content of the messages is something like this: ”Connections not accepted from IP addresses on Spamhaus XBL”. I check out, that my IP-address is not listed&nbsp;</span>as error.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Backgroud: </span></p>

<h2>            Nokia 6300 themes</h2>
                    Hey<br />
I just bought a new black nokia 6300, but if i install a theme, not downloaded and pre-loaded to the phone, and then turn the phone off and on again, the theme changes back to the standard Optus(phone carrier) theme.<br />
Does anyone else have this problem and knows how to fix it?<br />
Or does anyone know how to fix it in general?<br />
thanks<br />

            Hi<br />
Well after many many phone calls Nokia said it is not a phone issue it is a Optus issue,Optus said they had never heard of this problem,i was left to sort it out myself<br />
and i did<br />
<br />
If you purchased a Black 6300 look at the end of the box it came in, if you see the words (OPTUS) in brackets after the<br />
Nokia 6300 BLACK then it is set by Optus and you will not be able to change screen savers or wallpapers<br />
NOKIA 6300 BLACK (OPTUS)<br />
<br />
So i have taken my Black one back and got a Silver 6300<br />
and they do not have the words (OPTUS) next to the discription.<br />
<br />
all working fine now<br />
i hope this info helps<br />
<br />

            Hi, thanks for your post.<br />
I just purchased a black 6300 optus model and have the same issue. Spoke to customer service at Optus, but of course the person answering the phone knows nothing about it (which is not their fault), thinks it's a Nokia support problem, transfers me to Nokia
 (Indian call centre). They take me through restoring factory settings on the phone, "Optus Ambient" theme still defaults on power-up. I tried to delete the Optus theme using bluetooth software on my computer but it came up "bad request" so the phone obviously
 won't let you do that. It seems like not such a big deal, but it is inconvenient to have to choose another theme every time you start up (and I'm not the type of user with a custom wallpaper picture, but many are). I think we should all try to get a response
 from Optus, either directly or through the store we purchased from, confirming that they have had the phones programmed this way. I think not only is it an unfair thing to impose on their customers, but it is also bad business. If I keep the phone, every time
 I start up I will have a bad feeling towards Optus and be less likely to stay with them in the long term. It's counter-productive to the free advertising they obviously wished to get from people looking at their "yes" logo and the little gecko crawling around!

            Are the themes being installed to phone memory or memory card?<br />
<br />
If there is something wrong with the memory card connection, even if only a temporary one, the phone would default to a theme stored in phone memory. The same goes for other settings like ringtones.<br />
<br />
I've never hear this issue yet on the 6300, but it has been common on the 6500 Slide so it could be a similar thing happening. It is worth having your memory card and the phone checked to see if there is a hardware fault with either.<br />

            Hi mccbleue.<br />
I have about 6 themes in phone memory (gallery/themes) and a few more on the memory card. Only 1 theme contains Optus in the title (Optus-Ambient) and this is the one that the phone defaults to after I've turned the phone off. Interestingly, when I browsed
 the phone using bluetooth on my computer, the only theme that was visible in phone memory was "Optus-Ambient" even though there are many more selectable from the phone. Other memory card files like my ringtone setting remain intact, just the theme defaults.
 The Optus-Ambient theme leaves the display on low brightness with a big yellow animated Optus logo on it for about a minute before the screen blacks out to standby mode, and I reckon they just want people to see it when your phone is sitting on the table etc.<br />
Haven't had confirmation from Optus or the store I bought it from yet but I'm still asking questions.

            If I can't blame the memory card, then it must be a software issue. I would make a backup of your personal data and use Nokia Software Updater to update your phone software (if you are already up to date, reinstalling the same software should iron out
 any bugs).<br />
<br />
If you aren't confident to do this yourself, get it done at a Nokia service point under warranty.

 and re-install efforts with a nokia " technician " over the phone. Took it back to place of purchase who claimed they'd never seen it before then had them open 2 new boxes in front of me to discover the same problem. Sent the phone off to a Nokia care centre
 then 3 weeks later received a brand new black 6300 phone from the centre, guess what? Exact same problem.<br />
It is obviously a software issue caused by Optus technicians programming the phones after receiving them from Nokia.<br />
I simply refuse to touch either companies products now as the time, energy and effort put in on my behalf has not been recognised. I took the phone back for a refund and chose a better company.

            Buy the bundle you are testing<br />
Uninstall it, and install a different one<br />
<br />
Office 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 all Work on Windows 8<br />
<br />
At this time MS only sells Office 2010 and 2013.<br />
<br />
Buying Office 2010: Summary<br />
<br />
This page has similar information: https://rstlaw.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/may-i-see-your-license/<br />
<br />
When home users and small businesses buy office, it is my personal preference to insist on the Boxed CD "FPP" or Retail license of your choice of the 3 Office bundles. In the Retail version you get the Installation disk built into exactly the same price you
 would pay for software only in the online download. And, it gives you the best set of user rights of the license. It allows you to install on 2 or 3 machines at the same time and to transfer the installation when you want to. The "PKC" or Product Key Card
 is slightly cheaper, but allows installation on only 1 machine and no transfer rights. If your brand new computer "melts down" in the hardware warrantee period, it will be replaced, but you will have to BUY another PKC license!<br />
<br />
An additional benefit of the Retail version is that by using the DVD for installation, you completely avoid the possibility of MS “sneaking” the “Click to Run” crapware to you.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp;&nbsp; no matter how you buy Office you need to keep "physical" copies of 3 pieces of information. The purchase receipt (credit card statement), Product Key, and the installation file on CD/DVD. With the first 2 you can get replacement copies from MS, with
 the last 2 you can re-install at your convenience without talking to MS (ie 5 years down the line when you retire this machine and get a new one).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When buying Office 2010 you have to make 4 decisions:<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which version of office you want to buy: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2010<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how you will buy the Product Key used to activate the license. <br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Full or Product Key Card license)<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What type of installation you want (“normal” install vs Click to Run)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: There are just four easy steps. If you’re not signed in to your Windows Live ID account, the site will first direct you to the Windows Live ID sign-in page. Next you’ll visit the Academic Verification page where you’ll take the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Verify or select your country from the drop down menu.<br />
2. Select your preferred verification method (3 choices)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. If you select “Get verified through my school”, you’ll be taken to the school search page where you can follow the steps to search for and select your school to complete verification.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If you select “I have a Verification Code”, you’ll be required to enter the activation code that was given to you by either your school’s administrator or Microsoft.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. If you select “I have an ISIC card”, you’ll be required to enter your student identification card number.<br />
3. Click “Continue”.<br />

On February 1, 2012, Microsoft quietly replaced the Office Professional Academic 2010 SKU with a new one called “Microsoft Office University 2010. ”<br />
<br />
https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/university/microsoft-office-university-2010-frequently-asked-questions-HA102802367.aspx?CTT=1<br />
<br />
It has a new verification process, which works as follows, according to the FAQ: http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.LearnMore?Icid=Student_Main_LearnMore<br />
<br />
Office University 2010 does not come with a product key. Your eligibility will be verified online before completing purchase. This product will not work without successful verification as you will not have a product key.<br />
<br />
You will be required to verify your eligibility online to use this software.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to www.office.com/verify.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign in with your Windows Live ID or create one using any e-mail address.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide your school e-mail address, sign-in ID, or international student identity card (ISIC).<br />
<br />
Once you pass verification, the online site displays the product key.<br />
<br />
http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.LearnMore?Icid=Student_Main_LearnMore<br />
<br />
Q: HOW WILL I GET MY SOFTWARE PRODUCT KEYS?<br />
<br />
A: Software product keys will be provided on the purchase confirmation page. They will also be sent to the .edu e-mail address used to confirm eligibility and purchase the product. Software product keys are also stored in the Windows Live ID account associated
 with your .edu e-mail address.<br />

2010 Academic discontinued<br />
<br />
The Academic discount is the next best Office deal you will find. For students who can prove they are at MS approved educational institutions can buy Office Pro for $100. Be sure to get the installation disk at the same time, even if you have to pay $10-15
 extra.<br />
<br />
Access , Communicator , Excel , InfoPath , OneNote , Outlook with Business Contact Manager , PowerPoint , Publisher , SharePoint Workspace , Word<br />
<br />
Academic is equivalent to Pro Plus. In theory your key should work on any Pro Plus installation file.<br />
<br />
http://microsoft-office-_professional-academic.en.softonic.com/ - Pro Academic<br />
<br />
If you purchased an Academic version, you can download the corresponding regular Office 2010 product from any download site. For example, if you purchased Office Professional Academic 2010, you can download Office Professional 2010.<br />
<br />
Pro Plus is a volume license version, Academic is one source for “general public” - return to vendor site for downloads<br />
<br />
USD100 + USD15 for backup disk (also can get Win7 Pro Upgrade for ~USD30)&nbsp; Some places the Academic offer is Office Pro and others it is Pro Plus<br />

2010 Academic 64-bit<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
Just opened my e-mail and had a message back from Digital River:<br />
<br />
"Thank you for contacting the Ultimate Steal online store.<br />
<br />
We understand that you would like to have the 64-bit version of your Microsoft Office Professional Academic 2010.<br />
<br />
We would like to inform you that 64-bit version is not available. <br />
<br />
However most users install 32-bit version of Office 2010 on both 32 and 64-bit Operating Systems because currently many common add-ins for Office will not function in the 64-bit edition. The 64-bit installation of Microsoft Office 2010 products is available
 for users who commonly use very large documents or data set and need Excel 2010 programs to access greater than 2GB of memory. There may be technical issues with the 64-bit version and in order to install a 64-bit version of Office 2010 product users must
 have a 64-bit supported operating system on their PC.<br />
<br />
We are glad to be of service to you."<br />
<br />
I have yet to reply to it but I'm already annoyed. I ordered this with the impression that there was going to be an x64 installer (just like the retail copies). They can either give me the installer or give me a refund at this point. Yes I know I can run the
 x86 version in x64 (which is what I'm doing now), but I wanted Office 2010 mostly because it was going to be the first true x64 version of Office.<br />
<br />
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
For some reason I was not presented with an option to download the x64 installer.&nbsp; There was just 1 download link and it was the old X16-32007.exe.&nbsp; However their download link: https://www2.buyoffice.microsoft.com/usa/unitdownloader.aspx?cache=XXXXXXX&amp;local_only=true&amp;receipt_id=XXXXXXX&amp;dname=O14.download.name.32&amp;id=XXXXXXX&amp;culture=en-us&nbsp;
 you can simply change the download.name.32 to64 and it will start downloading X16-31970.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The XXXXXXX are your particular variables in your shopping session<br />
<br />
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
Hi all. The Digital River backup disk DOES contain the 64-bit folder to run from. Remember you need to uninstall all remnants of any Office 32-bit components beforehand. Microsoft has very thorough unique version-specific uninstallers at the Office support
 website you can run if there is any problem with the usual uninstall.<br />
<br />
I tried pretty aggressively to get them to e-mail me the 64.bit exe file to run with the download but no one would. I guess you need to get to the right person. All their e-mails that said they didn't offer 64-bit installation were misrepresentations.<br />
<br />
The trial version workaround solution sounds pretty good if it works for everyone--saves having to buy the backup disk.<br />
<br />
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />

HUP, Home Use Program<br />
<br />
The Home Use Program is a deal where companies with a site or volume license activate part of that license agreement that allows their employees to get a copy of Office to use at home. The HUP is the best discount you can get. The price is current USD$9 plus
 extra for the “backup disks”<br />
<br />

I decided to take a chance and download the trial of Office 2013 Professional Plus from here:<br />
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/jj192782.aspx<br />
<br />
The 32-bit file is about 800 MB.&nbsp; I used the key I got from the HUP site (ignoring the evaluation ones provided by Technet) and Office activated fine.<br />

&lt;snip&gt; I purchased Microsoft Officer Professional 2010 un der the DOD Home User Program and installed on my Gateway.&nbsp; That laptop is no longer working and i purchased a MacBook Air.&nbsp; I want to install Mac Office Professional 2010.&nbsp; Can I reassign Office Professional
 2010 from Windows to Mac?<br />
<br />
ok, I know I can't run Office on Mac.&nbsp; According to the Apple web page I can "reassign" the program by getting a code and then deleting it from my system.&nbsp; Then to contact the technical manager to check my elegibility and reset it.&nbsp; I can then go back in and
 down load it again by paying the $20 again and install the Mac version.&nbsp; &lt;/snip&gt;<br />

Click to Run (CTR) Information<br />

MS will automatically give you CTR if it detects a High speed internet connection. My personal preference is to avoid CTR for home use. You have to look carefully on the page for the 'advanced' link to get the "normal" installation file.<br />

            This problem appears to have been caused by a recent Windows update. The current word from Microsoft (and some users) is that manually updating Windows and then restarting Office seems to clear this and similar problems.

<h2>            what are the following files, all found as suspicious or infected in various scans</h2>
                    firstly i ran norton power eraser , just in scanning mode, it found three suspicious files. i know what one of them was and it later confirmed that the file was clean when i clicked the cloud icon at the right hand end of the row. the other two were registry
 settings marked as bad. i have starred out parts of the number incase it is some sort of license key i need to keep private or such.

            <p>First, read this stuff:</p>
<p><a href="http://microsoft.com/endofsupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://microsoft.com/endofsupport</a> because XP is a potential security risk</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/en-us</a>&nbsp;to back up the registry in case the cleanup damages your PC.</p>
<p>Hopefully one of the two programs you ran is just a scanner and does not provide real time protection. Running two programs at once can cause conflicts and severe performance/stability issues.</p>
<p>As for the Norton and adware parts of your question:</p>
<p>If there is more than registry entries involved, you might as well remove them, if you don't trust/want/need the software. If there is only registry information involved, consider reading this: If you followed the instructions in the KB article, you will
 have a registry backup to fall back upon. If there are no files to remove, then it may not be necessary to remove these items, as removing obsolete registry information that doesn't do anything does not help a PC in any way.</p>
<p>As for the ESET part of your question:</p>
<p>Again, If that's a program that you don't trust, and/or you don't even want or need it anyway, you might as well remove it.</p>

            the only real time one is norton, all the rest just scanners. i have just created restore points but my previous attempts to use system restore to, for example, remove newly added programs and such have always failed with a pop up appearing at the end
 saying that the restoration could not be completed. is there anything more you can tell from the files involved?

            Very first question that arose in my mind- Why you started scanning your PC with these much scanners? Have you seen any symptoms of virus or something? Or just as a periodic task you ran Norton one and since it found suspicious entries you started scanning
 with all the tools you mentioned?<br />
<br />
Now coming back to your questions-<br />
Those two registry entries are startup entries for a user i.e. program's entries mentioned there will start when a specific user with that odd looking S number [I don't know what is the technical term for it] will start (and that number isn't a license key
 or private key that should be hidden). So, you can remove those entries, removing those will only stop those two programs from starting when that specific user log on. I don't think those two programs are malicious since they aren't detected in any scan. For
 me, Norton thought that those two startup items are odd and thus marked them as bad, and it is false positive as it happened with Norton's third detection.<br />
<br />
As for AdwCleaner, it only removes Adwares (unwanted toolbars, popups, etc.). So it will not harm any critical system file. You can safely trust its detection and removal. Don't get confused with the name 'protector_dll', it isn't a system file, rather a bad
 file. You can see 'bho' at the end of its name, 'bho' means 'Browser Helper Object' and is used by Adwares also. So I will trust AdwCleaner and clear all of its detections.<br />
<br />
Now coming on ESET, as long as a file is in zip (or in any archive) it is harmless (that's why, by default, antivirus don't scan inside archive). If that suspicious file is extracted, your antivirus will scan it and if it is malicious, proper action will be
 taken against it. Plus it may also be a false positive. So I will not worry about ESET detection if the origin of that zip file is trustable (trustable doesn't mean from a friend, it means from a legit &amp; reputed website or source).<br />

            <p>Now that you put the whole entire things in there:</p>
<p>The second entry you mentioned has to do with printer stuff, I think that utility probably wants to remove an entry so that things don't run at startup that don't have to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know anything about the \classes keys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the \installer\userdata thing I think has to do with add/remove programs in control panel. If you take a look at that key/value in registry editor (but don't edit anything), and you find that you have uninstalled that program and it still exists in add/remove
 programs, then you can remove it. Otherwise, if you don't know what it is, you should leave it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My final recommendation remains the same: If you don't want or need it, remove it.</p>

            <p>Just a note about that Norton Power Eraser utility which is what made the first two of those detections that you are asking about.&nbsp; The following excerpt is taken directly from the Norton Power Eraser page found at the following link and as you can see indicates
 that this tool can be overly aggressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Because Norton Power Eraser uses aggressive methods to detect threats, <strong>
there is a risk that it can select some legitimate programs for removal. You should use this tool very carefully. If you accidently remove a legitimate program, you can run Norton Power Eraser to review past repair sessions and undo them."</strong><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I don't conider this a security tool at all, but rather simply something that exposes virtually anything it finds that it can't positively identify.&nbsp; If you read my last sentence carefully you'll realize that this is nearly the precise definition
 of a false positive, so I don't see the value of this tool in the hands of someone not fully skilled in the components of their operating system, which includes you and about 95% of the rest of the computer user population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, I feel that this tool is basically worthless and simply creates confusion, which your being here and asking such questions completely enforces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the only reason others answering here seem a bit unsure is that virtually no one with knowledge of malware knows or uses this tool, since it adds nothing of real value to the clear detection of actual malware.</p>

it's just i wanted to run the most detailed scan possible. if it only detected those things can i be very sure that no other malware is lurking on my machine? false positives aside
<div><br />
<div>the fact i knew it had a reputation for removing legit stuff is why i didn't let it clean and just scanned with it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>eset it turns out also found the same exe file sitting outside of the zips. it was the cnet download installer for a program called wax2.0 . i installed wax years back and never got any warnings then or now about it's program files being infected, and
 yet the installer exe detects as a virus(the zip files were the same exe file found in the zip files from which i extracted it). i remember running this installer exe years back but other than that exe eset never detected a virus on my system. there were nk
 detections from wax program files or anywhere else on hard drive about this threat.what's going on there?</div>
<div>i allowed est to remove the infected exe though it did not remove the infected zip file which contaiend the exe for download.</div>
<div>thanks</div>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - Send Receive Hangs When Downloading The Offline Address Book</h2>
                    <p>Hello There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issues where the Offline Address Book (OAB) <strong>will not download if I have a USB VOIP&nbsp;headset&nbsp;amplifier plugged in</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the amplifier we use (Plantronics DA60): </p>
<p><a href="http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/da60?gclid=CK-77v__icECFYhefgodKYEAYQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/da60?gclid=CK-77v__icECFYhefgodKYEAYQ</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to "Send Receieve" tab, "Send/Receive Groups", "Download Address Book...", Uncheck the "Download changes since last Send/Receive" box, and then click "OK".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The send receive box comes up and it hangs on "Copying offline address book template file".</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67204b2a-3881-49ea-a961-1faf7fd6498f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If I unplug the amplifier the OAB will download with no problems</strong>. I thought it may be related to this knowledgebase article:&nbsp;
<a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2619347?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2619347</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which recommends upgrading the devices driver; the issue is that it doesn't use a third party driver, it uses built in windows drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the response I got from Plantronics regarding the driver:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(48, 48, 48, 1)">The drivers your Plantronics USB headset requires should load automatically when you plug the headset into your computer - no software is necessary. The drivers, which

            <p>Hi Shukfui,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have caused due to any browser or email client related issues as mentioned by ZigZag3143. I suggest you to check if the same happens on InPrivate browsing in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to know if you are using Outlook Preview, which is the latest Outlook version available in market.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Bullet point and extending bullet points</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I have Word Mac 2011 and have always had a problem with the bullet points extensions. Ill do my best to explain, the bullet point works, however on my last computer I could press enter and tab and a so called 'sub-bullet point' was created. Something similar
 to this:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>fdsafdsa</li></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -fdsafdsafsaa<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;dsfdsafas<br />
<br />
In my word all it does is this:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>fdsafads</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fdsfasdfsa<br />
</li></ul>
<br />
Anyone have any idea how to correct this? <br />

            1. Follow the instructions given on this page to make older programs compatible with Windows 10 - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. Review the response of E. Harter at following link where sharing has solved the problem - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/2010-office-docs-all-open-as-read-only-after/31a64e6b-60e1-4d51-a897-9f8958660859<br />
<br />
3. Install latest Windows 10 cumulative update KB3081438 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081438) which is released on 14-Aug-15. If you want to download standalone KB3081438 then you can download from http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Thanks.aspx?id=140.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
5. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Properties, In Compatibility tab, uncheck all options. Start the Excel again.<br />
<br />
6. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Run as Administrator<br />
<br />
7. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
8. Review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54<br />
<br />
9. Read the response of Try*3 &nbsp;(http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/windows-10-excel-files-changed-to-read-only/cba3c358-21b5-472d-b5e2-f690f1b0a49b). He has provided a link which also has solutions for problems.<br />
<br />
10. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.<br />

            <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've worked through your list and have had little success.&nbsp; I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Initially, Word and Excel (Office 2013 - Home and Student) opened but after a few hours it became impossible to open Excel from the link or by trying to
 open an excel document.&nbsp; All I get is the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Excel<br />
We're sorry, but Excel has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Excel will need to be closed as a result.<br />
<br />
Would you like us to repair now?<br />
</p>
<p>Repair only closes the application.&nbsp; It appears that I have the most current version of Windows 10 (10.0.10240 Build 10240) and last night I completed the steps using the FixIt tool to remove Office 2013 and then reinstalled it.&nbsp; Word appears to be fully
 functional but Excel refuses to open.&nbsp; I am very dependent on Excel and I would really like to get it back in operation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>

    <title>Word auto-highlighting, how to make it STOP&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeamerica  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word auto-highlighting, how to make it STOP&#33;</h2>
                    How do you disable this STUPID feature?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to highlight a single word or some part of a word for cut&amp;paste operations and Word auto-highlights the whole line and sometimes the whole paragraph or page.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can be using a mouse, I can be using the shift+arrow keys, it doesn't matter. The auto-highlight takes over.</div>
<div>it seems to be worse on any kind of bullets and numbering or any header/footer fields.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>=======</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>auto-indent is another evil feature. cut and paste from a notepad &nbsp;and the indent is changed on your bullets and numbering. pretty much control-v means indent text right -&gt;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

            In order to be able to select a portion of a word, you must clear the check box for "When selecting, automatically select entire word" at
<strong>File | Options | Advanced: Editing options</strong>. But that doesn't explain runaway highlighting such as you describe unless your mouse button has a hair trigger: double-clicking will select a word, Ctrl+click a sentence, and triple-click a paragraph.

            <p>Joe is correct, the feature is annoying.</p>
<p>The problem occurs in some Emails and&nbsp;a form to fill in in Word.</p>
<p>The ability to turn off this feature is not present.</p>
<p>If I click the middle of the word and drag to the right, the following paragraph is highlighted, drag left and the preceding one is highlighting. Double click highlights the entire paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider this a bug in the Word software, its a pity Microsoft do not. Control of the document should always reside with the end-user, anything that takes away this control is a fault, in my view.</p>

</p><p>The behavior in e-mails isn't controlled by Word. Check the settings of your e-mail program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If by "form" you mean a protected form with text form fields, then you are quite&nbsp;right: selecting part of the text in a field is tricky.</p>

            <p>You are quoting Stefan&nbsp;out of context.&nbsp; He&nbsp;said that in one particular case, trying to select part of a legacy formfield was&nbsp;tricky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean by "controlled entry"?&nbsp; Are you talking about a document that is protected for filling in forms?&nbsp; What version of Word are you using?&nbsp; This thread was about Word 2013 in which (and with 2007 and 2010 before it) you can use Content Controls&nbsp;instead
 of FormFields and then you do not need to apply protection to the document so that the restrictions that such protection imposes (such as no spell checking) are not then relevant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2817630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB 2817630</a> applies to Office 2013 which is not suitable for Mac OS , so I'd like to know

which version of Office you have installed on your Mac Book</a>.<br />
Besides, after doing some research,&nbsp;I found that currently&nbsp;it's not feasible to uninstall Office updates on a Mac, we have to reinstall Office if we want to discard a specific update on a Mac.</p>

<h2>            Licences for Resource accounts necessary&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have some basic questions regarding Office 365 and licences for resource accounts.</p>
<p>My company has set up three different Resource accounts for three different conference rooms and they all have Skype for business and Exchange online licences set to them.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to have one license for each of the rooms or is there a way to reduce the number of licenses?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to combine all three room mailboxes through aliases and just have one account with one Skype license and one Exchange license instead of having licenses for three resource accounts(rooms)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Henrik</p>

            <p><span>Hi Henrik,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Like I said, in Office 365, room mailbox doesn’t need any license. And room mailbox doesn’t have independent credential, it can only be opened by the users who are assigned the corresponding permissions. It’s a resource mailbox, not an
 account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, regarding “I was wondering if there is a way to just have one account for lets say Room1 and then assign Room2 and Room3 as aliases, and by doing that we can assign that account 1 skype license and 1 exchange license”, the answer is
 no. It’s not feasible to do that. Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,<br />
Mouran</span></p>

    <title>O365 Pro plus language packs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> virtualtech1  say:</h3>
<h2>            O365 Pro plus language packs</h2>
                    <p>With current Polish language pack version is 16.0.11727.20230 from the Portal below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current O365 Pro Plus is&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/monthly-channel-2019#version-1905-june-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Version 1905 (Build 11629.20246)</a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
We got an error 30182-39 (2) installing the Polish language pack. I suspect is because the O365 Pro Plus version is older. Is this correct?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your query in this community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you follow the official article to download the language package, I don't think there will be a version compatibility issue between the language package and the installed Office 365
 ProPlus.</p>
<p>But it's always recommended for you to update your Office products to the latest version. You could first update your Office and check if the language package could be installed successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, as the error message indicated, per my opinion, this issue is more likely related with the network environment, if it's convenient for you, could you change the network environment
 on your PC, for instance: Changing the Wi-Fi from cable or connect to your mobile hotspot.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex Chen</p>
