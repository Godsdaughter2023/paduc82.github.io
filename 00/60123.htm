    <title>Recovery partition in Win 8.1 after upgrade to Win 10.0 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> codingmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery partition in Win 8.1 after upgrade to Win 10.0</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Pavilion desktop running 64-bit Windows 8.1 with a 2-TB hard drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has a separate Recovery Image partition (D:). </p>
<p>My question is this. Will the existing recovery partition be destroyed after the upgrade to Windows 10, or will the upgrade preserve this partition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you </p>

            <p>The recovery partition will be intact after upgrade to Win 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 you will have following options to Reset your PC</p>
<p>1. Keep My files - this will re-install Win 10 but keep your data</p>
<p>2. Remove everything - this will remove all user data and reinstall Windows</p>
<p>3. Restore to Factory Settings - this will use the recovery image you have on the recovery partition and restore Win 8.1 your PC came with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps! </p>

            When I updated to 10 (insider) my partition was still there. I was playing around with reset and when I did my computer reset from my partition back to 8.1 and I had to start all over again &nbsp;to go back to 10 :) When I am able to do the clean install I
 will remove my recovery partition

<p>Started downloading GTA V yesterday at about 2:00 p.m. - download completed after midnight, but still couldn't play....needed to download MORE stuff....console shut itself off when left unattended (how dare I fall asleep!) so started over again this morning
 at 10:00 a.m.....it's now 9:45 p.m. and it's STILL downloading....WTH!!!!!</p>

<p>This game has huge files on it, it's really big that you need to install 7.8 GB even if you bought the game as a CD. Anyways, you can let it download over night while the Xbox is off. How? Follow the steps I'll give you:</p>
<p>1) Go to the system settings&gt;Console settings&gt;Startup and shutdown&gt;Shutdown</p>
<p>2) Click "Enable"</p>
<p>3) Go back, then turn off your Xbox.</p>
<p>You'll see that the green light will be flashing. The Xbox wouldn't fully turn off, and it also will download 1/4 speed than when the Xbox is on. But, you can go to sleep, and leave it download over night. I did the same thing to BioShock Infinite.</p>

    <title>The Xbox live SCAM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brothers345  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Xbox live SCAM</h2>
                    
<p>Cancel your Xbox live subscription right now. Microsoft has found a way to take away services you pay for with no refund. They achieve this by awarding people with the obnoxiously harsh punishments of the reputation system. I don't care what any one tells
 you, it is flawed. Microsoft believes that If you want to play with people you should NEVER invite them. This is punishable by giving you avoid me status which is an INDEFINITE BANNN from multiplayer play the very reason why people by the service. I invited
 my 300+ friends list every day 2 times a day for 2 weeks. You would think if people didn't what the invites they would l have blocked communications with me and I would be fine with that. I'm just trying to find some people to play with what ever. No, people
 report me for spam. And the way Microsoft goes about responding to the reports is by making me unable to play multiplayer and giving me avoid me status. I would have been ok if I was ban from sending notifications to people but no they take the Xbox live services
 I payed for away. If you think that is fit punishment for SPAM your STUPID. After finding out that this stupid scam of a reputation system existed I cancelled my Xbox live subscription and game preorders for all my accounts. Why would I pay for something that
 can be taken away from me simply by inviting people. I guess Microsoft wasn't not enough money and had to look for ways to scam people.</p>
<p>i stop sending notifications to people ever since I got the avoid me status it's been 3 weeks I've read that people have had "avoid me" for more than 7 months and still haven't gotten out of it still.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't get bann for sending invites on ps4. Your reputation system is just a way to take our money from us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is not an indefinite ban. &nbsp;Admittedly, it can be very difficult sometimes to get your reputation back to an acceptable level. &nbsp;Even so there really is not reason to come in the forums and spread false information. &nbsp;I have been using Xbox Live for years
 and I have never been scammed.</p>

<p>Point to note, just because you add others as friends, does not mean they added you as well. Best way to increase your friend count is to use a microphone in game to build rapport with other players. People are more inclined to be friends with you if you
 have already established commonality in game.</p>
<p>also if 300 is not an understatement, you got to understand that the law of averages says that a percentage of those players will view your communication as spam, especially if you have not established rapport.

</blockquote>
<p>Im going to paint a little picture for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original post sent 300 invites twice a day, so 600 invites total.&nbsp; If people just blocked him he would still be sending 600 invites a day, possibly even more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean its the equivalent of these automated phone calls that constantly call random people trying to sell them stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its even worse when you realise that these "friends" that he has added probably don't even know him and have never spoken to him.&nbsp; I only add people to my friends list that I know personally or are a "friend of a friend", but with the new friends system
 I could theoretically add you as a friend, and 1000 other random people.</p>

            <p>OK.. lets recap</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You had NAV on your old computer and you renewed the subscription 2 mo b4 you really needed to renew.</p>
<p>Then you got a new laptop, and after trying to install your copy of NAV,&nbsp;even enlisting the help of Symantec support, it has failed to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the above a fair statement of the situation so far?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the plan.. Imagine that you are installing NAV, but install this instead.. MSE</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5201</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you imagine that it is NAV, you won't feel so bad even though MSE is actually free. You get your own back on NAV next year because you will not have to pay a subscription for MSE, and you have a less invasive, just as effective anti-virus solution installed
 on your computer.. </p>

    <title>disk Error during bitlocker decryption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonbya  say:</h3>
<h2>            disk Error during bitlocker decryption</h2>
                    HI,<br />
<br />
I have a 2tb USB 3.0 Verbatim external HDD.<br />
It was encrypted using bitlocker in win7 64 bit.<br />
I wanted to transfer some files from an XP computer meaning I had to switch off bitlocker otherwise XP wouldn't access the hdd.<br />
So I went to bitlocker management and switched off bitlocker. At the time I didn't know there was a 'quick suspend' method which is actually all I wanted to do as bitlocker would be switched back on once the XP-win7 transfer was done.<br />
During about 49% of bitlocker decrypting the drive an error message occurred:<br />
'An error occrurred. this disk has one or more errors. run "chkdsk/r". if these errors persist.............."<br />
I was so angry because I thought it had ruined my drive with all my imprtant files. Fortunealy the drive still works and I can access files.
<br />
However, the problem is that the decryption process remains paused and doesn't go away. I can no longer decrypt/encrypt the drive. It opens as if not encrypted in win7, but in XP my only opiotn is to format.<br />
What should I do to get the drive back to a state where it can be encrypted by bitlocker, and then suspended for access in XP without damaging files?<br />
<br />
P.s. Microsoft should not ship software that doesn't have a cancellation feature.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Verify Email Address&#34; will not resend</h2>
                    I have recently had to restore a laptop to factory settings - once that was completed I applied the Win 8.1 upgrade.&nbsp;<br />
Everything *seems* OK except &nbsp;that when using the Store (or OneNote, etc) I get the 'Verify Email Address' challenge. &nbsp;I have used my existing outlook.com address (which is the account I use to log into the laptop) but no matter how many times I click the 'Resend
 Email' link on the microsoft challenge, nothing ever arrives, so I can't confirm my address to Win 8.1.<br />
<br />
I have confirmed that my outlook.com email account is receiving email from other sources.<br />
<br />
I have logged into my microsoft (outlook.com) account and checked all account details and the all look fine.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ???<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Karthik - Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully understand the principle of account/email verification. &nbsp;The problem appears to be associated with the restore/installation on my laptop affecting Microsoft apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the restore of my laptop I had been using it for almost a year using my Microsoft account (outlook.com) identity to log in and I used the Outlook.com App, OneNote and other apps successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After completing a factory reset I set up Win 8.1 to use my existing outlook.com account again to log in as it did before and then the problems began. &nbsp;The system issued the normal "Verify Email Account" challenge, &nbsp;but when I checked there was no new verification
 message in my inbox. &nbsp;I waited for ~ 30mins but still no verification message. &nbsp;I then went to another webmail account I have and sent a test message to my outlook.com account to check that this arrived - which it did, proving that the outlook.com account
 is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I logged into my Microsoft account, confirmed all details were correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran the outlook.com app and it displays a pop-up header telling me to open the email sent to my outlook.com account (the email account is spelt correctly and is the email account I'm logged into), but there is no verification message. &nbsp;I have also
 checked Junk folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted and retried several times - by now I have probably exceeded the security retry limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now see that it I attempt to access my outlook.com account via Internet Explorer on my laptop it immediately issues the 'Verify Email Account' challenge', but if I access the same account using Opera or Chrome browsers I can access the mail and send and
 receive emails - but no sign of the Microsoft 'Confirmation' message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the 'Microsoft Accounts trouble Shooter' which, of course, says that I should "Verify Email Address" Duh! &nbsp; However it also says that that there is a problem with 'Systems Registration' specifically "Live Provider is not initialized properly
 with the cloud services." &nbsp;It has created a zip file of the logs but says I don't have the privs to open or copy it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>???</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>You can get the drivers from the manufacturer. But make sure the scanner is compatible with Windows 7. It is not listed in the compatibility center so it is better you contact the manufacturer for information on this. If they don't have drivers for Windows
 7 then you may try installing the Windows Vista or XP drivers in the Compatibility Mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may want to look into the link for Compatibility Mode information-&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></div>

    <title>No ADI CODEC installed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnffoster3  say:</h3>
<h2>            No ADI CODEC installed</h2>
                    <p>During Christmas break in college, I decided to reinstall Windows XP in my desktop computer, a Dell Optiplex GX620, as it was beginning to slow down, but was still fully operational.</p>
<p>After fighting with the .net frame downloads for two days, I finally have the system up and running - EXCEPT for audio.&nbsp; I have looked this problem up and find that MS has a bad driver listed (R97809) for the audio.&nbsp; I have deleted this driver and allowed
 restart to reload the driver with no luck.&nbsp; When the driver is reloaded, I now get an error message stating No ADI codec install.</p>
<p>Is there a functional driver that I can get to fix this problem?&nbsp; If so, how do I accomplish this?&nbsp; I'm not the most computer literate person.&nbsp; For any help, I thank you all ahead of time.</p>

<p>It is something that Dell installs to aid with remote connections when giving getting support (presumably from Dell).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't like remote support and would install it if I had a Dell.. </p>

    <title>Windows 8 Update Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kylezeal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Update Bug</h2>
                    Alright, I installed Windows 8 in January. &nbsp;Right after installation I went to the Nvidia website and got a Driver for my Asus Geforce 550 Ti. &nbsp;This caused my computer to have a missing boot manager on boot up. &nbsp;To bypass that, I had to unplug my Storage
 drive (my 1tb drive) so just my SSD and OS were up. &nbsp;When I did that I was able to boot past the Win 8 loading screen, to a black Flashing screen, no lock screen, just a flashing mouse, and nothing else. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Come to find out that this Driver, which supposedly is Win 8 compatable (64 Bit, I did this a few times, made sure I got the right 1) is incompatable and will not let you do sht on your pc. &nbsp;I had to restore and start over each time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I was able to do, was just run Windows 8 Update and it installed drivers and all that stuff, so my Nvidia was working perfect. &nbsp;no problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows just put that driver from Nvidia in there optional Updates, causes the same problem. &nbsp;Luckily I set a restore point before testing the update. &nbsp;Just restored, but That update will mess up anyones PC who has the 550 Ti card, using windows 8. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know how to report it to windows, but yea, they are dishing out a driver that will crash pcs lol.</div>
                </div>

            <span>Yea I upgraded to 8 64bit in Jan. I ran a full update, my pc is running great! I hadnt touched my pc till a few days ago, so am trying to run windows update on it. I thought it was the optional updates, but that is not the case, its 1 of the mandatory
 updates that is messing up my pc. I just get a black flashing screen after windows loads up, with a cursor (flashing).</span>

<div><span>In order to bring my PC back up I have to boot to my USB Win 8 install, and run a system restore. I think the graphics driver updates will try o make my pc boot to my secondary harddrive. I am unsure of which 1 of the mandatory updates will make
 win8 un-usable till restore. I'd like to update but this is becoming a major pain in the ****.</span></div>

<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably<em>without</em> quoting this post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the Win7 </em>[I assume] <em>computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (<em>other than
<strong>Windows Defender</strong></em>) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer<em>
<u>when</u></em><em> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

But earlier you told me that you'd <em>upgraded</em> your Win7 computer to Win8. Which was it, an upgrade or a clean install?<br />

            Clean install...... When I said Upgrade i meant I upgraded my OS to the next version.  I dont ever use the actual upgrade feature its ****, more trouble than its worth better to just format and clean install.

<h2>            100&#37; Disk Activity when using Windows 10 Calendar</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I tried nearly everything on Google to fix my Disk Activity issue (Windows Search, Superfetch, Defrag, SysFile Scans, AV/Malware, Pagefile changes, hardware scans, etc). &nbsp;It turns out the culprit is the Windows 10 Native Windows Calendar. &nbsp;As soon
 as I start it, activity goes to 100% and back to normal when it is closed. &nbsp;I am not sure when this started happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have 5 different calendars accounts syncing to that tool, but that has never been an issue before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also running Outlook 2016, including calendar, with the same accounts, but please don't tell me that is the problem because it has worked with both over 6 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do use a conference call plugin on Outlook, but that has been installed for several months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: &nbsp;The reason I am using the native calendar instead of Outlook 2016 is because the Outlook calendar was not syncing new appointments or ones where the meeting was moved/rescheduled, but the native calendar was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response, but this is the solution that is all over the internet and it does not work for me as my system is using a different driver. &nbsp;Also, my event log only had "event 153" errors and there were 100's of them. It was happening about 3x

<p><span>So yah I ended up going into a hacked game, blah blah blah, and now my xp is like -14529 or something like that. It wont even let me play FFA or TD, which is quite sad if you ask me. I tried going on YahooAnswers and asking
 this but no one had an answer that worked, so figured I would try asking here. Does anyone know of any way i could possible reset my online profile &nbsp;for it or do something to get my xp back up without involving me having to play the game, since i cant play
 it at all? Any help would be awesome, thanks :)</span></p>

<p>Yeah, this happened to me about a year ago and I haven't been able to play the game since. I contacted XBOX and the developers. They all kept accusing ME of hacking and did NOTHING to help. My score is about minus 80 billion so I cannot play the game online.
 XBOX support doesn't even respond when I tried asking about this again. Seems to be no way to fix it. There should be, since being hacked like this is not the user's fault, and now we're stuck with a useless game that we paid good money for.

<p>Nothing happened. I contacted Xbox and Activision AGAIN in the last few weeks. Xbox said it isn't there problem, the data is on the Activision servers and that is where XP would need to be reset. Activsion has done NOTHING over the last year, this is what
 they said this week: "We are currently aware of this issue and are looking into it. In the meantime, you can still accept invites to games from your friends. If you are on a Playstation 3 then you also have the option of creating a new PSN account temporarily
 using that account to play online". Xbox told me to create a new account. Activision could reset my XP but all they keep saying is they are "looking into it". What a pile of garbage.</p>

<p>Wont work,, Stats are saved on their server, The ONLY way to play it is either get a freind to invite you or maybe look at your last played with list and &nbsp;join thier game, That itself could bring more trouble as you`d have no idea what sort of server they
 on..</p>
<p>iI got hit a while ago, Fourzero posted on here about messaging him, so most us did and got it reset, no idea if he would still do it for an old game..</p>

<strong>no longer possible to retrieve it. </strong></p>

            <p>If your console is set to "Instant-On", you're likely hearing your fan and/or your hard drive still spinning. This is how the console keeps itself ready whenever you decide to get back into the game -- it's normal, and nothing to be concerned about. The system continues to run while in this state, and it stays active in case it needs to update something too.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you want to disable this, just set your console to "Energy-Saving Mode" instead of "Instant-On". That setting should completely power off the console when you decide to turn it off. Please note that your console will need to a minute or two to boot up every time you power it on, and you'll have to sit through any needed updates.<br /></p>

<p>Hello there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. When the game crashes do you get an error code or message? If you haven't already, I recommend deleting and re-downloading the game to the Xbox one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further support from the developers you can visit <a href="https://support.gameloft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
