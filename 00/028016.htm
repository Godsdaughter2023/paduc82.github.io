<h2>            Where are all of my Outlook Tasks on my new Nokia Lumia 950&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've just moved over this week from a Lumia 635. On that, the Tasks were easily found by taping todays Outlook Appointment tile (Package from Ebay) on the home screen &amp; then just tap the ... icon in the lower right and pick Tasks in the pop-up list.
</p>
<p>So, where are all of my Tasks gone to on Windows 10 Mobile? I hope they aren't an available feature. That would be REALLY SAD &amp; ANNOYING.</p>
<p>In this image that was taken on my Windows 8 Nokia Lumia 635, to get to my Tasks, I'd tap on PACKAGE FROM EBAY on the phone's main screen,&nbsp;which is a link to the next appointment in my Outlook 2013 on my PC or a Calendar Event on my phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15921ffb-4d91-4ff9-a550-8192513a44a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15921ffb-4d91-4ff9-a550-8192513a44a1" /></a></p>
<p>Then I'd tap on the <strong>° ° ° </strong>icon in the lower right of this screen:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c113da67-1240-4896-924c-6dc0dd0e425c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c113da67-1240-4896-924c-6dc0dd0e425c" /></a></p>
<p>And this would pop up and the top item&nbsp;takes me to my&nbsp;Tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efe78bce-d75e-4476-8e70-1a937d0b3e4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efe78bce-d75e-4476-8e70-1a937d0b3e4a" height="742" width="485" /></a></p>
<p>I've always used Tasks a bunch since they're something that you want to do that isn't tied to a specific time (which would be done as an Appointment) and can have a Reminder. COOL, HUH?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's just the top of my list of Tasks as they were seen on my old Nokia Lumia 635. The same list was seen and useable on the main Outlook Today screne of my computer's Outlook 2013.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/494c1bf3-ea52-4407-86b2-c3a68a538942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/494c1bf3-ea52-4407-86b2-c3a68a538942" /></a></p>
<p>But there’s no such thing on my new phone with Windows 10 along with whatever newer version of Outlook Calendar APP (or whatever) that this has.</p>
<p>So are my Outlook 2013 Tasks accessible on my new phone? I sure hope so. That would be a REAL bummer if they're not.</p>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be best to send this concern to our Software Engineers and Software Developers by using our Feedback Hub as they're the best team to provide you with more details regarding this. To launch the Feedback Hub app on your Windows 10 Mobile, go to
<strong>App list</strong> &gt; <strong>Feedback Hub</strong>. You can create a thread or search for a similar issue and tap "<strong>upvote</strong>" to include this on the next update.

<p>Thanks. I hate to sound rude but this is annoying as he**. My&nbsp;feeling is that a user shouldn't need to be involved at such a late date in product development to help try to convince Microsoft that such a simple basic feature that simple customer surveys
 would show is popular, should be included in a new version.</p>
<p>I've tried that Feedback Hub thing twice recently. </p>
<p>The first time was since EDGE can't be set to automatically go to the new tab like IE has always been able to be set to do.</p>
<p>The second time was because Microsoft got rid of the Notes feature on the 2013 version of Outlook.</p>
<p>So I refuse to believe that Microsoft doesn't already know that Tasks is a desirable feature by many users. I also can't really believe that my telling them will make any difference.</p>
<p>If anyone can pass this frustration to anyone that matters at Microsoft, please do. I'm sure that I'm not the only customer that feels this way. I'm just one of few who's willing to do it.</p>

<p>I'm happy since I found an APP in the Store called OneTask and it is perfect. It is designed to let people like me who use outlook.com either online or by their Outlook desktop version being set up with a outlook.com email address in the Exchange ActiveSync
 setup method.</p>
<p>It's a free APP with some really nice features.</p>
<p>At first I thought that I might need to also have it on my desktop, as the APP's download page in the Store listed that they have versions for Mobile, Desktop or Hub.</p>
<p>Anyway, turns out I never had to add it to my desktop DELL.</p>
<p>There are some other APPs in my phone's Store that have to do with Tasks but OneTask seemed to be the best.</p>
<p>It would even sync your Google Tasks if you use those but I don't.</p>

<p>I did what Jeff suggested and really like One Task. It took a little "playing around" to figure it out but over all it is very good.</p>

<p>I wanted to tell you that I just went to that FEEDBACK HUB and gave 1 of the 2 related threads that I found a COMMENT &amp; UPVOTE saying:</p>
<p>_____________________________________</p>
<p>I'm a big user of Tasks since lots of your TO DOs don't have dates associated with them, so setting an Outlook Appointment won't work.<br />
And setting a phone Alarm is annoying since on Windows 8 Mobile, you could only have a limited # of Alarms along with they could only contain a certain # of characters.<br />
But at least on Windows 8 Mobile's the Tasks list was accessible even if it was somewhat hidden. ;-)<br />
A simple tap of the latest Appointment on the Calendar tile gave you the Calendar &amp; tap the ... icon in the lower right had TASKS as the first item.
<br />
Now at least I found the free OneTasks APP in the Store on my phone. It basically does the same thing as long as you use an outlook.com email address either online or in your Windows phone or you use some Google stuff. But why should we need an APP to do what
 was already handled internally in Windows 8 Mobile? </p>

<h2>            How to add a non-existant keyboard language on Windows Phone with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I'm learning the Cora language and have both English and Spanish on my phone. The problem is that I enjoy autocorrect in English and Spanish, but it also tries to autocorrect my Cora into something it's not because such a keyboard is not an option and
 I use Latin letters to spell Cora words. How do I keep Spanish and English but also have Cora?

<p>Hi Mr. John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's nice to have the auto correct feature while typing, in a way it helps you learn or spell the words correctly for both the English and Spanish language. However, having an auto correct function for a third language all at the same time is not yet available.
 What we can only suggest for the meantime, is to send your feedback through Feedback Hub app about this matter, and hopefully this feature will be included in upcoming software updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have more inquiries.</p>

<h2>            How to anchor drawings on screenshot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying out how I can anchor drawings on screenshot in OneNote 2016. So lets say I have a screenshot in OneNote. I want to highlight certain areas on the screenshot either with the highlighter or by drawing a oval around certain parts of the screenshot.
 The problem is when text or anything is inserted above the screenshot the screenshot is moved down but the drawings that were on the screenshot do not move with the screenshot. How can I anchor these to the screenshot so that they always move with it or are
 persistent?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

            unfortunately this is not possible with any version of OneNote (yet?). All you can do is fixing the image by define the screenshot as page background (right click on the screenshot and the corresponding menu command) to prevent it from being moved accidentally.
 &nbsp;You can't fix the drawings on the image in a similar way.

            Hi Hugo, 
<br />
<br />This is phishing scam, and they are hoping to gain access to your PC. Then most likely they’d hold your data for ransom... great job not letting them do that. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft will not call you, and other "tech" companies, or "experts" shouldn't be calling you either. Never give out your personal information, or give anyone access to your computer. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />- C

<br />Microsoft never calls their customers to fix issues, unless you make arrangements with them.
<br />
<br />Via Bruce Hagen's post from here:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/fdbk_commsite-mods/got-a-phone-call-from-microsoft-and-they-said/a13caf7d-65ba-4baa-b613-f4750953d145#LastReply">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/fo...</a>
<br />
<br />It's a scam that has been going on for years. Microsoft never makes unsolicited phone calls.
<br />
<br />
<br />Is that call from Microsoft a scam?

            Hi Hugo. well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a well known Tech Support SCAM Microsoft will NEVER cold call you

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer for your question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I'm using HP Pavillion 14' N010 ax, Processor AMD A10, with Ati Radeon Graphic.</p>
<p>2) This happened before on IE, and after I changed the Internet Option/Advance/use software rendering than GPU rendering it doesn't happen again. I only using IE and Project Spartan.</p>
<p>3) I just changing that setting on IE</p>
<p>4) This issue only persist on YouTube or page that contain video from YouTube. If I watch from daily motion or other video web it seems just fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another info, I'm using third party application like Tubecast and MetroTube. First time I play the video on the app it's tells me something like unsupported file problem ( I forgot the detail ), and after I changed the Internet setting like I mention above,
 every time I play the video the app immediately force close.</p>

            I am currently running project Spartan and comfortably running youtube videos without any hassles. i guess you need to check your pc setting again and undo any changes.

 profile and I got no idea where it's coming from, except maybe from old msn?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove this profile pic? It's really annoying me I spent two hours already trying to undo it. Also it's not linked to facebook to my knowledge.</p>

    <title>Mac Office Word - docx icon question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rbnomer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mac Office Word - docx icon question</h2>
                    Been using Microsoft Office (Windows version) &nbsp;in Windows 7, but couldn't resist buying MacBook Pro Retina. And I bought Office for the Mac now, Still a newbie with the Mac OS X and Office for the Mac, so forgive this silly question, please. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I hover over a Word (docx) file in iconographic view, I notice at the bottom of the icon, an arrow in a circle on the right side pointing right and an arrow on the left, also in a circle pointing left. I am not referring to the arrow symbolizing an
 alias, these are distinctly different. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I am hoping someone will tell me why these arrows appear, what do they mean, and how do they function, if at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div>Richard</div>

            Haven't used Lion, but to me it sounds more like the same <span style="font-weight: bold">
Preview</span> feature John's referring to, which is available in Snow Leopard... In a Finder window use Icon View or Column View [with Preview column visible]. It's also usable in a Get Info window. Quick Look focuses only on the 1st page of a document.<br />
<br />
When you hover over a selected multi-page PDF file's icon [as indicated by the bound left edge in Icon view], Left/Right arrows in circles appear at the bottom of the icon. You can click the arrows to "flip" through the pages of the PDF. I rarely use the feature
 for several reasons:<br />
<ul>
<li>AFAICT it works only with PDFs, PowerPoint &amp; Keynote files<br />
</li><li>It seems to be inconsistent</li><li>The content can't be read unless you're using an [IMHO] outrageously huge Icon dimension</li><li>If you "flip" too quickly it launches the PDF reader &amp; opens the file</li></ul>
<br />
Perhaps it's been improved/enhanced in Lion.<br />
<br />

Bob J.<br />

    <title>Cannot Automatically Refresh Data in an Excel Table that was built in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mtyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Automatically Refresh Data in an Excel Table that was built in PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>I have a PowerPoint Presentation in which I placed several blank Excel Tables (Insert Tab &gt; Table &gt; Excel Spreadsheet). &nbsp;Within the cells of the tables I have many formulas (VLookUps, Sumproducts, etc.) that reference several other excel workbooks and collect/summarize
 the data I need to present. &nbsp;Everything works fine and all tables are calculating correctly.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I close powerpoint and reopen, the tables do not update unless I manually double click on each table. &nbsp;Once I double click and activate the table for editing, then the formulas in the table work and recalculate the new data from the workbooks
 they are pointed to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way that I can have these formulas recalculate upon opening PowerPoint?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Excel and PowerPoint 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            microsoft mobile</h2>
                    <p>Windows os is better than android and ios in style but 1st fault for microsoft is lack of apps .users like apps that are popular,that is the app which are in other os also.for eg:torrent app,8 ball pool etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;secondly,storage space is low on windows phone as compared to others.most of the lumias have 8gb of storage.it should be raised upto 16gb and a user available of 10gb .</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thirdly,microsoft phones released last were very flop and the prices should be cut-off as new brands are stepping into smartphone markets.</p>

                    It is a shame that Microsoft can't keep the&nbsp;program that they come up with up front. I use mse for antivirus and it seems to work just fine, but Internet Explorer is pretty much trash and I have to use Firefox more and more everyday.

<p>Active x installs of third party products, yea that is a pity people don't understand it and microsoft just doesn't totally block changes of any kind to it's advantage.</p>

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeasterday i updated my Lumia 640 from WP 8.1 to WP 10. During the instalation i was aked to enter my PIN code (without the usual message: "remaining attempts"), so i entered it, but nothing happend, so repeted this like 3 or 4 times with the same result.
 I waited until the installation ends, then i was asked to enter my PIN code again, this time with the message&nbsp;remaining attempts - 3. I entered my PIN =&gt; pin was accepted, but i got message - "You have entered too many times wrong PIN. If u want to try again,
 restart your device." I had this message everytime i restart my device a enter correct PIN. I even pulled out my SIM and putted it into another device a SIM is ok, only the phone is locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone knows how can i unblock my phone?</p>

            <p>Hi TomSuva,<br />
<br />
You need to reset your phone back to factory settings. Here's how to do it:<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10666/windows-phone-reset-my-phone." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10666/windows-phone-reset-my-phone.</a><br />
<br />
Please take note that you would lose personal data when you reset your phone to factory defaults. Back up you data before doing a reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely, </p>

    <title>Outlook 2011 - Message Unavailable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> budweezy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2011 - Message Unavailable</h2>
                    I have a single user using an iMac running OS X 10.7 and Office 2011. Multiple times a day he gets a message that says "System Administrator - Message Unavailable. The message you're trying to view is no longer available on the server." I see that as a
 simple error stating the message has been deleted, or moved, or there may be a synching problem. As a test I made sure to not make any changes to the mailbox for a period of two weeks. Regardless of any changes to the mailbox the user may get one message,
 or eighty in a day. I cannot find a single error/problem anywhere. So I'm a bit lost on what the possible cause may be. His mailboxes are not setup to auto delete/prune messages. I've tried some web searches but cannot find any solid information on the problem.
 Any advice would be great. Outlook version is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">14.3.7</span>

<div>You can Ctrl-click it to get to the Properties and purge from there. This will force redownload everything clean.</div>

<p><span><span>The phone notifies you if the phone memory&nbsp;is getting low. To free phone memory you have the following options:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span><span>Move</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;data that you want to keep to an alternative memory (mass memory or memory card, if available) or&nbsp;to a compatible computer.</span></span>
</li><li><strong><span><span>Remove</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;data you no longer need.</span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use&nbsp;<strong>File Manager&nbsp;</strong>or the respective application in your phone to remove data or to move data to alternative memory as described in the user guide. Typically you first mark files to be removed or moved and then you&nbsp;select the corresponding
 option (<strong>Delete</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Move to folder</strong>).<br />
<br />
Use&nbsp;<strong>Nokia&nbsp;Suite</strong>&nbsp;to move data to a compatible computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To maximize free spaces to&nbsp;your phone memory, you can&nbsp;remove or move the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Messages from&nbsp;<strong>Inbox</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Drafts</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Sent folders</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>Messaging</strong></span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Retrieved e-mail messages from the phone memory</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Saved Web pages. Clear the web browser cache to&nbsp;free&nbsp;some phone memory (e.g. select&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Clear privacy data&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Cache</strong>).</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Saved images, videos, or sound files (in&nbsp;<strong>Gallery</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Photos</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Videos&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;Music player</strong>)</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Contact information (in&nbsp;<strong>Contacts</strong>)</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Calendar notes (in&nbsp;<strong>Calendar</strong>)</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Downloaded application packages</span></span> </li><li><span><span>If there are applications which are not needed any more, uninstall&nbsp;them&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>Application Manager</strong></span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Any other data that you no longer need</span></span> </li></ul>
<p><span><span>If you are deleting multiple items and any of the following notes are shown:&nbsp;<strong>Not enough memory to perform operation. Delete some data first</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Memory low. Delete some data</strong>, try deleting items one by one (starting
 from the smallest item). After deleting data, restart (power off/on) your phone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this will help you my friend.&nbsp;:thumbsup:</span></span></p>

            I also encountered this problem as most of the N8 users. With every update C: phone memory shrinks.<br />
<br />
What I did, additionally to what emilygreen said, is deleting not used applications and widgets. E.g. I don't use faceboor nor twitter, therefore I deleted all the "social" apps and widgets.<br />
<br />
And I have one additional question: Is it somehow possible to delete the default apps/widgets CNN Video, Movie Teasers, E!, Nat Geo? I have never used them, some of them aren't working anyway, but they are installed on C:.

<p>&nbsp;first we need&nbsp;to draw a picture about your situation: When you open Menu » Files, how many MB are&nbsp;free&nbsp;on drive C? Please, dial *#0000# and look-up&nbsp;the first line ‘Release’. If that is not ‘Nokia Belle Refresh’ = 111.0<strong>4</strong>0…, we your ‘Product
 code’. That way, we are able to determine together why you are not on the latest firmware.</p>

    <title>Colors in Shared Folder Calendars, how to change&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amanda_44  say:</h3>
<h2>            Colors in Shared Folder Calendars, how to change&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We have a shared calendar in public folders on Outlook 2007. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the calendar I put everything under the color category blue, my two coworkers do in purple and yellow. The problem is that the yellow color has now disappeared.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried making a rule that when she is the one organizing something (putting her appointments in) they will be yellow on my computer, but it is not working. Two or three of her appointments a week will be yellow everything else is colorless.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I fix this problem?</p>

            Have you checked your master category list? For the category your coworker is using there must be exactly the same name in your list. If you want to show that category in yellow, you must assign that color in your list. Outlook doesn't look up your coworker's
 list.

            <p>I renamed yellow color to "Brianne" and she did the same thing. Still the same, everything she posts is without color save one or two existing things. We have a new staff member joining us and I can see color coding being a problem if her posts are in random
 colors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is having the same situation where I am coding all my appointments in blue and no color shows in her calendar for me.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our third coworker, both of us show her purple on our calendars, so this does work with our system we are just having problems with us...

<h2>            Accessing hotmail account problem</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to recover a password for an old email account and the person not only put in wrong secondary email address but also wrong mobile phone number (correct last 4 digits). when we procede to add a different email address it just says "Session timed
 out" and login and start again.&nbsp; I pretty fast on a PC so the possiblity of it timing out is zero.&nbsp; Is there an email address / phone number I can get the person to use to recover their password?</p>

            <p>Didnt really answer my question as they all basically say the same thing which is use password recovery system which is exactly what is causing the problem because it constantly says session timed out.&nbsp; AS it takes me less than 1min to input required information
 how could the session possibly have timed out.&nbsp; My question was purely is there an email or phone number to help address this problem. I never intended publishing information on this site.&nbsp;Thank you for your response and this is not meant as sarcasm but just
 trying to clarify as it appears you did not understand the request.</p>

            <p>Account was last Accessed at least 2 years ago, but the person who owns it was a novice and not only put in wrong 2nd email address (to clarify they put in correct address but missed part of postfix e.g heden.net instead of henden.net) and also somehow wrong
 mobile albeit correct last 4 digits doh :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i enter address and robot check, because email and number wrong i go to "I dont have any of these"</p>
<p>
</p><p>it then asks for you to enter another email account thats valid and send a 4 digit code which you enter, on completing this you press next, at which point it states&nbsp;that "Your session has timed out. You can restart the session by signing out and signing

<p>
</p><p>It now says "You've requested too many codes today. Please try again tomorrow.":(</p>

            the session timed out error message is clearly not truthful, I had that too in the struggle to unblock email account. Just treat it as a general error message/ system refusal. I do agree it would be great to get human help. The end answer to get a new
 account &amp; ditch the old one ias about as unhelpful as you can get. Sympathies.

            <p>Glad I'm not the only one getting this error. It would also be helpful if the form for recovery gave you a free text box to allow supplementary information as I would then have been able to submit the correct recovery email address and mobile number which
 once seen would make it obvious that the person making the request was indeed legitimate&nbsp;</p>

            I'm marking as helpful because it basically the only answer I will get. microsofts answer is for her to "create a new account". Even though it was blatantly obvious that the user is the user they said they couldn't help, meaning it's software controls
 its staff not the other way around. &nbsp;By Blatant I mean if they corrected the postfix of recovery email eg added the .net or looked at mobile number she had which includes the correct last 4 digits (she messed up one of the other digits I'm guessing). Oh well
 hopefully Apple can help with her iCloud account instead.

<p>Yes, you can. The features in Office apps,&nbsp;in all versions of Office other than Starter,&nbsp;are identical.</p>
<p>The general name of the feature you are looking for is Mail Merge, as in the Mailings tab.</p>

<p>
</p><p>why the f does it have to run so often (ie all the time it can)</p>
<p>
</p><p>i don't even want to use my pc for photo's, it's total utterly useless APP taking much to many CPU cycles.</p>

            <p>You can remove the built in apps (mail, photo, etc) by using the Remove-appxpackage Powershell command would remove the photo APP:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bit convoluted but fairly easy</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You need to go to program files\Windows apps (here is how) http://www.urtech.ca/2012/11/solved-where-are-windows-8-metro-apps-stored/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find the photo app and copy the string name (it should be something like this)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft.Windows.Photos_15.618.18170.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the name go to start&gt;run&gt;type powershell&gt;enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>IN powershell type remove appxpackage and put the string from the above here</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ie remove appxpackage Microsoft.Windows.Photos_15.618.18170.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe&gt;enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should remove the photo app</p>

<p>After updating Office to 2016&nbsp;for Office 365 Business Premium my subscription (which contained onedrive for business&nbsp; cannot be installed The link in my software page still lists the previous one, related to the 2013 version and, when I try to install it,
 it tells me there is a newer office version installed. It is the same problem I had with Skype for Business, the web page updated the link for office but not the one for other application. What a a shameless mess!</p>

            <p>Hello pallavik_1988:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your missing phone.&nbsp; We are disappointed to hear your phone was taken from your friends house.&nbsp; There are a couple of options you should consider when it comes to tracking this phone down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you set this phone up on <a href="http://windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsphone.com</a> you can use Find My Phone to locate the phone.&nbsp; You will find more detail on using Find My Phone here,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp7/basics/find-a-lost-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp7/basics/find-a-lost-phone</a>.&nbsp; Using this service will require that you have the phone set up on the website, it has power and is currently
 connected via cellular data or Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cannot track the phone down with this above service, please contact your mobile operator.&nbsp; They may be able to help determine where the phone was lasted used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, contact you local authorities.&nbsp; I have seen reports of missing/stolen phones being recovered from local pawn shops and other third party sellers of phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

            <p>Hello pallavik_1988:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; I am afraid there is no additional tracking methods outside of those presented in my earlier post.&nbsp; We do have a system that allows you to track your phone online.&nbsp; As mentioned, this does require the phone have a connection and
 is powered on.&nbsp; It also required that you set this up when you got the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this was not done, we have NO way of knowing where your phone is.&nbsp; The only folks that could help do anything for you with the IMEI number is your mobile operator and the local police.&nbsp; The IMEI number is needed when trying to start a plan on a phone.&nbsp;
 If someone tries to add service to this phone, they should be able to have this flagged and stopped.&nbsp; The MO may also be able to determined where this phone was last used based on cell tower pings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

 If someone tries to add service to this phone, they should be able to have this flagged and stopped.&nbsp; The MO may also be able to determined where this phone was last used based on cell tower pings.</p>

<div>Hi Mark
<div><br />
<div>I also have the same issue. I did register my phone but the only problem is that I only found out about this service right now. My immediate response after my phone was stolen from me was to block it using the IMEI number. Then I blocked my phone number
 and did a sim swap a week later. I just got &nbsp;an email&nbsp;30 minutes ago with the following subject header:&nbsp;</div>
<span>You've connected Facebook Chat to your Windows Phone</span>
<div>correct me if I'm wrong but it seems to me that the phone is still active even though I blocked it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The "find my phone" service is not working and I suspect that it's because I'm using my old number on a new phone. When I call my service provider they tell me the phone appears to be blocked in their systems. But what's more important to me is finding
 the phone, so is it still possible to track the phone since it seems to be in use?</div>

<h2>            Why do I need to plug in my Microsoft Band after a Factory Reset&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It makes it a very inconvenient if your Band is not syncing, correctly, and you have to Factory Reset to get the Bluetooth to reconnect. &nbsp;I don't have my charging cable with me, so now I'm stuck with a bricked Band until I get home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight into why this is necessary?</p>

V1R4G3, </a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in the community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Was your Microsoft band low on battery when you tried to do a reset? </p>
<p>Have followed the steps <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/phone-app/reset#Step1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to reset your Microsoft Band? </p>
<p>If you follow the steps, you should not have to use the charging cable to reset. However, you will need to forget the Microsoft band under Bluetooth on your phone and repair it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards, </p>

            I did exactly that. I've noticed that I can check the battery and it'll read full or close to it on battery level. But after a factory reset, it seems like the act of factory resetting depletes the battery, significantly. Surely, that can't be.

            I did a Factory re-set and I was warned that I would&nbsp;need to connect my charging cable.&nbsp; I was at work and was a bit annoyed as I didn't have my charging cable with me, however, it all went off fine via the Health app on my phone and was back up and working
 within minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; My phone is on os W10TP.

<h2>            Outlook Vote Tracking - missing votes</h2>
                    I sent an email with a vote last week. &nbsp;I committed the cardinal sin of moving the email out of the sent items folder (habitual back-up). &nbsp;While it was moved, obviously, responses received were not tracked. &nbsp;I have since realized my error, moved it back
 to sent items, and new responses are once again being tracked properly. &nbsp;My question is: is there a way to force Outlook to recognize the responses received that were not tracked? &nbsp;Can I manually&nbsp;point it to the responses? forward them? re-receive somehow?

            <p>Well, that just doesn't make sense. In a Letter-type merge, every merge field you insert should return some data provided there is anything in the associated data field in the data source. I'm wondering if perhaps you've established a range in the Excel
 sheet (and have named that range as your data source) that excludes the CC column. In that case, however,&nbsp;I'd expect an error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Word should not care what or where your merge fields are; if you have a column called Fubar in your data source, and you want to insert it anywhere in the document, then a { MERGEFIELD Fubar } should do the trick. How are you inserting
 the merge field? And what is the name of the column in the data source? It's conceivable that you are using some reserved name that Word is choking on; if you changed the column heading (and then the merge field), that might make a difference.</p>
