<h2>            Turning off Field codes -Product - Microsoft Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Product -</strong> Microsoft Word 2007</span></span></p>
<p><span>Recently, by mistake I seem to have clicked on something and now all my word documents only show formulas behind some fields instead of the content –
</span></p>
<p><span><span>For instance – Page # now shows up as
<span>PAGE\* MERGEFORMAT</span></span></span></p>
<span>PAGE\* MERGEFORMAT</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Table of contents shows with the formula behind it and not the original content.</span></p>
<p><span>If I view the document in full screen reading I can see the proper fields.
</span></p>
<p><span>Also, if I select the word and click on “Toggle field code” – it shows the proper field instead of the formula behind it.
</span></p>
<p><span>Please let me know how to turn the feature off so that I can see the fields and not the formulas behind it.
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>Neeya</span></p>

<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have multiple accounts set up in the mail app and most seem to be working fine except for&nbsp;my Outlook.com and other live.com account.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>With the exception of the live.com account that I use to login to my device, the other 2 Microsoft email accounts will not Download New Email as it arrives. The login account, Gmail, Yahoo and an IMAP accounts all allow for "as items arrive" but
 the Outlook.com and secondary live.com accounts will only allow for "every 15 minutes" or more.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyone else experiencing this?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />

            <p>Hi Praseetha:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Got your email as well as the post. I ran the trouble shooting diagnostic software and that did not change the options. I also removed and the added the account and that, as well, did not rectify the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think that based on what you've written above it must have to do with the limit on the amount of accounts that can download as items arrive.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me change one of them and see if that frees up an account.... hold on...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yup, that did it. I told Yahoo to pull every 15 minutes and then when I went into outlook, it allowed me to change to "As items arrive."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What is the reasoning for this and there should be an indication perhaps somewhere noticeable for people to read to reduce the confusion.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p><span>Hi Les112,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Where
 exactly are you trying to create a System image? Is it on the hard drive partition or on a CD?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may run Disk cleanup utility in Windows 7 and check if you can create a system image. Normally while creating a backup it would use
 the temp folder in C drive to create temporary files before starting to create the image on to a different drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run disk cleanup follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open Disk Cleanup by clicking
 the</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button. In the search box, type</span></span><span><span>Disk
 Cleanup</span></span><span><span>, and then, in the list of results, click
</span></span><span><span>Disk Cleanup</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the<span><span>Drives</span></span>
 list, select the hard disk drive C: to clean up, and then click<span><span>OK</span></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the<span><span>Disk
 Cleanup</span></span> dialog box, on the<span><span>Disk Cleanup</span></span> tab, select the check boxes for the file<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>types that you want to delete, and then click
<span><span>OK</span></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the message that appears, click<span><span>Delete
 files</span></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer and check
 if you can create backup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to know more about using disk cleanup to delete files.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to check the VSSAdmin storage size and resize the storage and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open a command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type Vssadmin list shadowstorage</span></p>
<p><span>3. Take note of what the shadow storage allocation is on the drive you're having issues with.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Change the allocation by using the Vssadmin command, syntax: vssadmin resize shadowstorage /On=C: /For=C: /Maxsize=30G</span></p>
<p><span>5, Restart the computer after the command is complete and check if you can create a backup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Post back the results.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thanks and Regards,</span></p>

<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

At the same time, there are users who fall in love with a revision and never decide to upgrade again, simply because that version is good enough.

</p><p><strong>Will my Antivirus be compatible with Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely not. Windows 10 will require that you have a version of your Antivirus that is designed for Windows 10. It is recommended that you uninstall your current Antivirus before intiating the upgrade. If you have a subscription that has not expired,
 contact the developer to find out about Windows 10 support. Most Antivirus utilities should be upgraded by the time Windows 10 launches. If your subscription is still active, then you should be entitled to a compatible update for Windows 10.</p>

                    I tried to change settings on an Adobe program and wound up uninstalling it.&nbsp; Now I can't figure out how to undo my boo boo.&nbsp; Of course it was to easy to look in the recyclew bin.&nbsp; Not there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also how do you&nbsp; change the settings on a program.&nbsp; On the
 top it said "organize - change - uninsall"&nbsp; well the only things it&nbsp;did was uninstall - of course!

<p>The choices of "Organize/Change/Uninstall" are supported by the program's uninstallation routine. So if whatever program you're uninstalling doesn't have the option to change/modify in its uninstaller, you won't get that option. Programs &amp; Features calls
 the program's own uninstaller. Nothing goes to the Recycle Bin when you uninstall a program.</p>
<p>To reinstall the Adobe program, you would need to use its installation media such as a CD or get the installer from Adobe's website if the program is Reader, for example.</p>

    <title>In-game Sound and Microphone issue Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xprodigygamerx  say:</h3>
<h2>            In-game Sound and Microphone issue Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
I am having an issue since a Dell technician replaced my Motherboard and GPU under warranty, that is now when I play any game sounds through my Turtle Beach Z Sevens, I cannot use voice chat of any type, in-game or external (Ventrilo, Teamspeak 3, Steam Chat)
 unless I disable my turtle Beach as default device/communication device and switch to the poor quality onboard sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried following install guides and checked drivers for corruption, reset defaults etc. but I cannot get the in-game sound and mic working together on my Z Sevens, I can only have one or the other (sound or mic, not both together)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Format</p>
<p>-Fresh install of Windows 7 ultimate x64 SP 1</p>
<p>-Uninstall/Reinstall sound drivers</p>
<p>-Changed USB and Microphone ports from top front of PC to back panel</p>
<p>-Disabled SB Creative Recon sound device, HD sound devices and Nvidia WMV sound to exclusively use Turtle Beach (to avoid any incompatibilities, if any)</p>
<p>-Checked all USB ports and Microphone jacks all work fine</p>
<p>-Tested Sound and made sure it is enabled and set to default device</p>
<p>-Tested Microphone and made sure it is enabled and set to default communication device<br />
<br />
Some things to note:<br />
<br />
1) When I test my sound and open the sound manager, sometimes switching to "recording devices" to test my microphone will result in the window freezing completely and it requires that I use ctrl, alt, del and shut it down via task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I lose sound completely when switching between Turtle beach and Onboard and need to restart my PC to resolve this, it's usually when I switch from onboard to Turtle Beach sound.</p>
<p><br />
3) I have gone into the Advanced Sound Editor in the Turtle Beach Z Seven program and restored default settings and freshly updated again to no avil.<br />
</p>
<p>4) I have followed some advice and guides online that worked for other users with similar issues, but nothing I try has worked so far and I am now out of options but if I change any settings i always reset to default and reboot my PC before I continue so
 the changes are undone.<br />
<br />
I can disable my turtle beach headphones as default device and revert to onboard sound, which is a very poor quality and that allows me to hear in-game sounds AND use my mic to talk in game but as soon as I switch back to Turtle Beach, I gain awesome quality
 sound in game and lose the ability to speak in-game using my mic, the light or symbol doesn;t even register as speaking and no one can hear me.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
System Specs:<br />
GPU: Nvidia GTX 690 (Drivers: 353.30)</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i7-3970X 6 core @ 3.5GHz</p>
<p>Memory: 32 GB RAM</p>
<p>Resolution: 1920 x 1080, 60Hz</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Ultimate x64 SP 1<br />
Sound: Sound Blaster Recon3D PCIe (Turtle Beach Z Sevens come with their own control unit and inbuilt drivers)<br />
<br />
As a reference, I also tried MS help from these forums before I posted, to see if I could fix it myself before resorting to these forums for help, so I didn't waste anyones time but the instruction below did not help solve my issue.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Try to connect a microphone to your computer in this way.</p>
<p>After you've plugged a microphone into a microphone jack on your computer and turned it on (if the microphone has an on button), follow these steps.<br />
1.Open Sound by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type sound, and then click Sound.&nbsp;<br />
2.Click the Recording tab, click Microphone, and then click Properties.<br />
3.Click the Levels tab and make sure the Mute button looks like this . If the button looks like this , click it to turn on sound for this connection, and then click Apply.<br />
4.(Optional) To listen to microphone sounds through your speakers or headphones, click the Listen tab, click the Listen to this device check box, and then click OK.</p>
<p>"Connect a microphone, music player, or other audio device to your computer"<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer</a></p>
<p>(B). Check the lights if it glows when the speakers are plugged in.&nbsp;<br />
(C). Try connecting the headphones to the different slot (Front) or to a different computer and check.&nbsp;<br />
(D). It can be an issue with the slot itself where in the device is not getting recognized because of the hardware fault.</p>
<p>Hope it helps<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

            <p>Hello Isha,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply!<br />
<br />
I went ahead and checked my BIOS and Chipset drivers to make sure they were the latest versions.<br />
<br />
BIOS is A11 for Alienware Aurora R4 2011 (this is the most up to date BIOS version for my system)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chipset is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Aurora-R4_Chipset_Driver_9339N_WN_9.4.0.1026_A00.exe
 which was released on 4 Nov 2013 and is the latest I can download from the Dell support drivers section for my system.<br />
<br />
Other things I have tried.<br />
<br />
Updating my Soundblaster Recon3d drivers again and installing the control panel to check through options but this di don't help.<br />
<br />
I also installed and ran the Microsoft Fixit:&nbsp;</span>MicrosoftFixit.Devices.RNP.107360565350209426.1.1.Run which tells me to enable the disabled HD sound devices that are not connected (which I do not as it makes no difference&nbsp;and I do not want any incompatibilities),
 I only have Turtle Beach and SoundBlaster enabled with Turtle Beach as default sound and microphone but after running the Fixit I lose sound completely from Turtle Beach and onboard sound and have to reboot my PC to fix it.</p>

I tested the Turtle Beach Z Seven Unit in the top front USB 3.0 slot and cannot hear anything but my mic works and I can see in the Sound window that the Speakers have the green bar flashing next to them showing that they are picking up on sounds, I just cannot
 hear those sounds. Also, switching between Playback and Recording tabs, doesn't cause any lag or freezing, which usually it freezes on the recording tab, so that is some positive progress anyway.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">

<div style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
I can disable "speakers - Turtle Beach SEVEN GAME" in the Sound window and get the poor quality onboard sound to kick in without any trouble while still being able to use the mic but if I switch back to "speakers - Turtle Beach SEVEN GAME" I lose sound again
 but see the green bars still bouncing.</div>
<br />
Upon further testing, I switched back to using a 2.0 USB port and got full quality sound back but then lost microphone and the tab froze when switching from playback to recording to check the microphone and there were no green bars next to the microphone when
 I spoke, so for some reason I get the following results:</span><br />

            <p>I was able to finally fix this with help from the Turtle Beach support team.<br />
<br />
After doing another full format of my PC and starting from scratch, I installed the Turtle Beach Z Sevens into my USB 3.0 slot first before anything else and made sure it was the only device connected to that port/network and with some tweaking (sound/microphone
 settings/volume) I was able to get it to work perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, it did not work using the USB 2.0 slots. I hope this is useful to someone else in the future.</p>

<br />
<br />The folder appdata/local/packages is a Windows System folder, it contains all user configuration settings for all of the installed Modern UWP Apps (Photos, Movies and TV, Weather . . etc.)

<br />
<br />The appdata/local/packages does not contain any personal information, it stores data like the settings you change in Windows UWP Apps and things like Window location and size, there is however absolutely no personal information in that folder . ..

            Hello Tril645,
<br />I am Matt, an Independent Advisor and a specialist technician. I would like to assist you with this and hopefully I can help you to resolve this issue promptly.
<br />
<br />The files in the \%AppData%\Local\Packages store user configuration settings for the Modern UI Applications on your computer. Such as Windows 10 store apps.
<br />
<br />If this folder is taking up a lot of space which sometimes it does if you sort the folder by size it will help you determin which applications are using the most data. You can then open that application and clear cache or even remove the application if its something you don't use.
<br />
<br />I really hope this helps, let me know if I can be of more assistance. Have a great day.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards,
        </p>

<h2>            Haters Gonna Hate</h2>
                    
<p>The game hasn't come out yet and people are already trying to hate on this game, I personally think it's going to be epic but thats just me. but then again maybe a for a game that we don't even have a trailer for is unnecessary and will just cause the trolls
 to continue trolling on the people who are actually excited for this game. </p>
<p>i dont even know anymore, that's just my 2 cents&nbsp;</p>

<p>thats exactly the problem, people dont really know what a real call of duty game is, they would probably think mw2 or mw3 is the real call of duty and IW is king and Treyarch sucks blah blah blah. every time i play call of duty im always ashamed to be apart
 of the crowd that plays the game, complete idiots.</p>

 been saying here because its TRUE. if you cant see it then your clearly blind. we have a right to our opinion as much as you have an opinion to yours even if you dont like it. i dont have a problem with people that excited by the new game, i think they are
 just blinded by fanboyism and what not. </p>

<p>CoD4 was the first CoD that I owned myself (at quite a young age actually, thanks mom!) but I have played alot of the older CoD's with my cousins, (as well as Forza 1, Guitar hero 3, Halo CE, Soul Caliber 2, Mortal Combat on the nintendo 64 etc.) and i do
 admit they were very good games, but i also enjoy the newer CoD's as well. and whenever i hear someone talk at about MW2 their usually bashing it, the problem isn't the game it's the people who play the game, and if they annoy you there's nothing you can really
 do about it. and btw i like CoD but it isn't my favorite game of all time, go ahead and judge me all you want i really don't care, blame activision for the repetitive nature of the newer CoD's (a new one every year is a little much) I personally wish Call
 of Duty was never bought out by activision, bit of a mistake there. imagine what it would be today if the call of duty title was rightfully owned by infinity ward like it was back in the day. but then again, the offer seemed to good to pass up at the time.</p>

<h2>            GTA V Multiplayer Concerns - Lag and Modders</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I have some concerns regarding the multiplayer for the next installment of GTA. If you haven't played GTA IV recently, there have been a number of instances where a modder, hacker, or whatever you want to call them have been modifying the game. I borrowed
 the game from my friend as I sold my copy years ago, and wanted to play it before the next one came out. More to the point, I want to know if Rockstar will be keeping an eye on this in the next chapter. Granted, GTA IV has been out for quite some time now
 and I'm sure Rockstar is paying more attention to their recent releases, but GTA is arguably the company's biggest name. Will they let a handful of players ruin the experience for the rest in the next title?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Next is a less serious topic. My next concern is the map size. If you haven't heard, GTA V is supposed to be the biggest one yet. This is awesome, but when it comes to multiplayer, I want to know how this will work. In GTA IV the map is a reasonable size,
 and lag occurs every once in a while. With a bigger map and more content, who's to say that this problem won't be more severe? Just imagine that four players are running from the police, while two others are flying helicopters or planes, and a few others are
 just driving around. All of this on a bigger map with more vehicles, weapons, etc, and while digital civilians are driving cars and whatnot. I'd say lag is an issue that must be considered carefully.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) Yes, GTA: Iv has a BIG problem with modders, and both M$ and R* have shown that they won't do anything to stop it. Although it is a big problem in IV, it won't be in V. Why? Have you played Max Payne 3 at all? R* created something called "The Cheater's
 Pool", where, if you are caught cheating in multiplayer, you will be banned to a server reserved ONLY for cheaters. I predict that this feature will make its way to GTA: V. If it doesn't and we get the same "service" for V regarding modders as we do currently,
 this may make me rethink R*.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2) Of course lag will be an issue. Lag is always an issue. I don't think R* would attempt to put so much effort into this game if they were concerned about the lag. We can also assume that this is one reason why the release got delayed. Say what you want
 but lag can be a BIG game killer. I'll use CoD as an example: I was playing CoD MW2 once and the game was severely laggy. It got so bad at one point I was lag kicked out of the game. That's the biggest problem with lag thankfully. the other minor niusances
 are not being able to get a good shot on a player, being killed because the other player is lagging, getting run over by a vehicle half way down the block, etc, etc. Lag will always be an issue, but we should trust R* will be making it so that our gaming in
 MP will be enjoyable and with MINIMAL lag.</p>

<p><strong>Just pick up the GTAV port for next gen.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Before anyone jumps down my throat, I know, I know, R* has said, with interesting phrasing, that there is "no need" for a next-gen port.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>But let's just say I have a feeling that GTAV will be ported to the PS4 and next gen Xbox. In fact, call it more than a feeling...</strong></p>

<p>I will laugh when GTA: V on Xbox [Next] also gets hacked and modders start flooding in. No matter what, they will always find a way, so you can't escape them simply by going to another console. And yes, there won't be one for a next-gen console. R* has already
 mentioned "we are NOT a third-party company; we make games for the systems that WE want". It has been proven countless times why a next-gen port would be a bad business move:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1) Not everyone will run out and get a new system right away.</p>
<p>2) The PS3 and Xbox 360 still have "life" in them.</p>
<p>3) R* are making one last "hurrah" for this generation of consoles.</p>
<p>4) They recently received the dev kits for next-gen consoles (or was that Sony?)</p>
<p>5) They would lose sales if they put it on next-gen since just about EVERYONE will get it for current-gen.</p>
<p>6) With the Xbox 360 and PS3 still around, it is just not worth it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"<em>I have a feeling that GTA V will be ported to the PS4 and next gen Xbox. In fact, call it more than a feeling</em>". That made me laugh a lot! Unless you are secretly a developer for R* or a GTA: V game tester, it's best you stop now to keep yourself
 from looking like a complete fool when NONE of your predictions come true. Also, this "prediction" coming from someone who posts RUMORS of GTA: V. Please stop; I can't breathe!</p>

<strong>Overly aggressive, much?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Stranger things have happened. I'm not claiming that GTAV will LAUNCH on next-gen consoles. GTA San Andreas was ported to Xbox over a year after it was released on PS2.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>As for my GTAV rumor thread, yes, they are rumors. Let's just wait and see how many of them are accurate.</strong></p>

<p>I highly doubt there will be a version for next-gen. I've supplied so in my latest post.</p>

<p>In the very last paragraph of my post, I'm very suspicious of you claiming "call it more than a feeling". You sound like you work for R* or something. Plus, these rumors are nice and all, but still nothing is set in stone. And I REALLY want to see where

<strong>No prob.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I understand your skepticism about a next-gen port and I agree with your reasoning of why it's not likely. I'm still not budging from my position, however.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Again, I can understand your skepticism. I am not now, nor have I ever, worked for R*.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Yes, rumors are not set in stone.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Unfortunately, I will not be revealing my sources. I will say that not all of my sources are private, however. Keep your eyes and ears open.</strong></p>

<p>EightBall44 if you play any rockstar game you can see problem ( modding,hacking,lag......) in all games,if you have time in a quicky search in Youtube you can see this problems. rockstar are experts in making buggy software, the mod are house brand. you're

<p>@iAshHD, I wouldn't bother responding anymore to what this guy, dtejedor, is saying. It's the same old thing everytime. It's either "R* MAKEZ ZE MODZ!" or "R* GAMEZ SUX!". Either way, they are both wrong and I've said what I had to say on the matter. Mods
 are not made by R* but by "script kiddies" and petty little NLs who have nothing better to do than to take apart the very code of the game to "improve it". Since when did we, the legit players, ever say we wanted our game "improved"? Mods sure do improve the
 game alright: they improve the game by making us, the legit players and other players who do NOT have mods, suffer.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>That's enough ranting about mods for now. I could go on and on and on about it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>To add to your comments, ASH, there is a strong possibility that R* might implement "The Cheater's Pool" feature/system into GTA: V. Simply put, if a modder/cheater is caught cheating/modding, he/she will be placed into a server where nothing but cheaters/modders
 like him/herself will be present.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 HP Pavilion desktop blue screen upon wakeup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex134  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 HP Pavilion desktop blue screen upon wakeup</h2>
                    <p>My HP Pavilion p2 desktop PC running Windows 7 has been having a problem where if the computer is in sleep mode, I wake it up and it goes to where it's supposed to, then it goes to a blue screen. I have attached the picture with what it said.</p>
<p>I have tried&nbsp;<em>several </em>things to remedy this, including a factory reset (twice), SFC scan (which said that there were problem that Windows cannot fix, how do I fix those problems, and will it fix this problem?), disk cleanup/defrag, and a clean boot,
 which yielded no result.</p>
<p>This all leads me to believe that there is a problem with a crucial file within Windows. I read something about Microsoft Security Essentials causing a problem, which is what I was using on this computer, and I have since uninstalled it, and the blue screen
 is still happening.</p>
<p>The only programs I had installed before I can remember the problem starting were MSE, Ccleaner, and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>The computer runs fine otherwise. It seems a little slow sometimes, but everything else seems okay. I have opened it up and inspected everything, re-seated the memory, and blew out the dust. I don't think there is a problem with any hardware. I ran a scan
 in BIOS, and everything (RAM, Hard drive, etc.) came back as good.</p>

<h2>            command Prompt opens by itself</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 home version 1803 on my HP laptop, . 2 days ago the Command prompt box started opening when I start my PC and also during normal usage. The box opens for just a few seconds and then closes. What could be the cause of this and how
 can I stop this from happening?
