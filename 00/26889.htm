    <title>Remove light shading from text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remove light shading from text</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I created a list with Word, the text on it would get a very light but noticeable shading, especially when printing. I had tried changing shading to white and to no shading, changing the font, and changing paragraph shading to no avail. When I compared
 a regular paragraph to a list, I got the following difference:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd2b2405-4bda-4ead-a24d-24ae1275a9d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd2b2405-4bda-4ead-a24d-24ae1275a9d2" /></a></p>
<p>Online support was completely useless but I managed to find a solution. Get the Reveal Formatting pane (Shift+F1), then click on the SHADING link under "Font" (not the one under "Paragraph") and make sure you change the Fill color to white and then, on the
 bottom right corner, select "Text" on drop-down list as opposed to "Paragraph".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sharing this because it took me ages to figure it out on my own.</p>

            <p>You have posted on Insiders forum:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have free space available issue on local drive that keeps your netbook from upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I would advise not trying to do upgrade to Windows 10 on netbook. I would wait for some great deals on tablets/surface pro in January. Pick one that already has Windows 10 installed and get extra storage.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the response. I was able to resolve this issue. I used the media creator to create an USB installer. The install from USB installer was successful.&nbsp; My netbook is running great on Windows 10!

<h2>            Email label colors not getting updated for all users accessing a shared Mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use office 360/windows 10 in our office and recently our shared mailbox has been migrated from Lotus notes into Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>We are five team members accessing a shared mailbox. To assign a mail with particular team member I use category colour (created a customized color with name). But when I add a category to a mail that is not getting visible to other users accessing the shared
 mailbox. Rather it shows blank only. Could you please help me how to fix this or any other option to allocate the mails to each team member. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Selvapandy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, when one of members have assigned a color to the message in shared mailbox, others who can access the shared mailbox should see the assigned color. For others cannot see it under your scenario, please confirm some information as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(As you mentioned, you have five team members who can access the shared mailbox, for better analysis, we call them A, who assigns color. B, C, D, E who cannot see color)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, after A assigned color, let A sign in to <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a>, click the picture and then use Open another mailbox to open the shared mailbox and check if the message has been assigned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, let B, C, D, E sign in to OWA and open the shared mailbox also, and then check who can see or who cannot see the color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If A can see the assigned color in OWA and all of others cannot see it, to further investigate the issue, please provide us following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If the issue happens to all shared mailbox migrated from Lotus notes? If it's convenient for you, try to create a new shared mailbox in Office 365 admin center and check if the issue still occurs on the shared mailbox.</p>
<p>2. Try to assign a default color (such as Blue category, Green category...) and check the outcome.</p>
<p>3. Let one of B, C, D, E assigns a color to a message and check if others can see the assigned color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<h2>            Word 2019 automatically opens documents with center window layout</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Word 2019 documents open with a full window that has the cursor in the middle. &nbsp;Opening old documents same thing happens. &nbsp;They layout looks all munged. &nbsp;But then I got to layout and add view gridlines and remove and the layout returns to what it should
 be. &nbsp;Happens to evey word document I open. &nbsp;Even before messing with gridlines, printing the document the layout appears fine. &nbsp;Saving and reopening the document same bug, &nbsp;This on Windows 10. &nbsp; How do your force the documents to always open with margins in
 the view and the saved layout visually correct each time you open? &nbsp;A Brother 3270 printer is the default printer if that makes a difference.</p>

</p><blockquote>In Ms Excel, sorting a&nbsp;list alphabetically in&nbsp;English&nbsp;is&nbsp;OK&nbsp;but&nbsp;is&nbsp;this&nbsp;facility&nbsp;available if&nbsp;the&nbsp;list&nbsp;is&nbsp;in a&nbsp;language&nbsp;other&nbsp;than&nbsp;English(e. g.&nbsp;Nepali/ Hindi)?</blockquote>
<p>Not if you have an English system, the sort order is specified by the language (resp. settings) of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create your own sort order, but that is tricky and you need some expierience in VBA and sort in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The basic idea is to create a map table (any sort routine does that!) and encode a string into numbers and sort by this numbers instead of the original strings...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A sample: If you sort "a,b,c,A,B,C" in ascending order you get "a,A,b,B,c,C"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ASCII value of A is 65 and a is 97, so if Excel would sort by the ASCII value the result would be "A,B,C,a,b,c".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is how does Excel the trick? The answer is simple (to simplify for this sample):</p>
<p>
</p><p>An "a" becomes 1, a "A" becomes 2 and so on:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ac6a119-ed08-48e7-a4b9-22e39d728f69" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ac6a119-ed08-48e7-a4b9-22e39d728f69" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So Excel maps each char by this table and finally sort by this numbers. </p>
<p>But this tables are much larger in reality, an unicode char table has 65.535 chars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the sample: The word "Abc" becomes 235 and "aBc" becomes 145 and if you sort this words ascending you end up with "aBc, Abc".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it. No easy to accomplish, really tricky, but possible.</p>
<p>

<h2>            OneDrive for MAC-why are shared files in a different location&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My company IT department is trying to force everyone to migrate from Dropbox to OneDrive.&nbsp; So, I have installed OneDrive for Mac on my laptop and migrated one folder (my work in progress folder) to OneDrive as a trial.&nbsp; I also had a colleague do the same
 thing and then share his folder with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are now two folders in the finder window.&nbsp; One had a cloud icon and is called "OneDrive - (company name)".&nbsp; &nbsp;This one has my folder in it.&nbsp; Nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other folder has a folder icon and is called just "(company name)".&nbsp; My colleagues folder is in there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also been experimenting with various apps that mount cloud services as drives (CloudMounter, Cyberduck, etc..).&nbsp; These apps work perfectly for dropbox, google drive, FTP, etc...&nbsp; For OneDrive, they only show 'my' folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked and looked for a way to get the shared folders in the same place as my created folders.&nbsp; If there is no way to do so, well, then IT can go...</p>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to explain that the file you find in OneDrive Shared&gt;Shared with me page is actually a connection to the file itself. You will find your colleague's name/account on the URL after you click the shared file.
 That means you moved to that file's real location via the connection. That's the reason why you can't sync shared files to your folder directly. In short, the file is still located on your colleague's folder.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you really want to sync the shared files in your sync folder directly, I'd like to suggest you move to the shared folder from OneDrive online, select the file you want to save, click Move to and choose folders
 within "Your OneDrive" to save a copy of that file and sync them with your own files in the same location. Note: After that, your changes will not sync to the original file and your colleagues modify can’t update to your file either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any concern about that, I would like to suggest you post a new

<h2>            15048  Memory Exhaustion w&#47;HyperV feature</h2>
                    I've been running build 15048 for the past couple of days. As soon as I enabled HyperV I have been experiencing problems with memory allocation. As soon as the (host) computer memory utilization is &gt;50% the OS begins trying to forcibly close applications.
 These problems are occurring without a HyperV virtual machine being powered on.&nbsp;

            I haven't heard of this type of issue before. Have you done anything non-standard with configuring Hyper-V memory usage, or your host PC's Virtual memory, paging file size, etc.? How much RAM does your host PC have?

            There have been a couple of builds since then. 15058 is latest. There are some new Troubleshooting tools in Settings app. Have you tried an offline scan with Windows Defender to ensure that there is no malware?

<p>Hi Anita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zipping or compressing files help save storage space and transfer files more quickly than the uncompressed or unzipped files. These zipped files need to be extracted to be able to view the contents. If the files on your email are zipped and needed some extraction,
 follow the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Download the zipped files and save it on your device.</li><li>If it's a single file, open the zipped folder, select the file then drag the it from the folder to a new location.</li><li>To unzip all the contents of the folder, right-click the folder, select <strong>
Extract all</strong> and follow the instructions that will appear. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

<h3> lokiarmos_hawkenspire  say:</h3>
<h2>            media random freezes when playing tracks encoded from WMA lossless format</h2>
                    <p>I have all of my media in WMA Lossless compression, my problem is that when i transfer the songs to my phone they are recoded in 192KB which i am happy with.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I understand that WP7 does not support Lossless, that i can not understand but that is not the real problem. The real problem is my phone will randomly freeze when playing the music.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This has only happen since i did all my music is lossless format. If the source is already lossy in MP4, MP3 or WMA then they are fine it only happens to files that are lossless.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And it does not matter which encoder i use to encode them in, I have try Windows Media Encoder, the Encoder Built Into Zune and a third part library, they all have the same affect.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can get to the transcoded files via the cache and renaming them from .tmp to .wma and there does seem to be a problem with the content of the media files.. I believe that the encoder for the files have an issue and generate garbage in the files content.
 i notice that i would get stutters even though the system is run under load. and i get errors of &nbsp;C00D11CD when playing files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not quite sure what is used to encode it, it looks like a custom implementation of the Media Encoder SDK.. so will clear the cache and resynch and see if the files are the same. if they are it looks like there could be a bug in the encoder or my machine.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>The problems with the files seem to conditional, i can play the same song twice and have one that is clear and another that skips and crackles, and there does not seem to be any under lying performance issues, memory, processing, kernel time and disk queues
 are in acceptable paramaters.<br />
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I would like to solve this problem and perferrablily without having to recode all of my music again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Lokiarmos_Hawkenspire,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your contribution to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you tell us what is your phone Make, Model and operator, please? Also, can you let us know Which Operating system you are using, if it is up to date, if you have the zune software installed and up to date?</p>
<p>Does&nbsp;this appear only on the phone?&nbsp;If it happens through the zune software also I would try this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/957204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/957204</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also go to&nbsp;Settings, Phone, Conversion settings.</p>
<p>1. Try to only convert media files that&nbsp; aren't supported by the device.</p>
<p>2. If that doesn't work, try different qualities when a song exceeds quality defined.</p>
<p>3. Try Allowing and then not allowing media files to convert in the background.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Try to clear the cache folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about the error code 805a8011 that you are getting on your Lumia 520. To provide the appropriate troubleshooting, can you tell us when do you encounter this error code? Have you tried any troubleshooting steps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, you can perform a <strong>soft reset</strong> to refresh your phone. This method is safe to attempt in any situation especially if your phone behaves oddly. To do this, press and hold the
<strong>Volume down</strong> and <strong>Power button</strong> at the same time until the phone vibrates and restart. The process might take a little while to complete.</p>

    <title>Word 2013 stuck in draft mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2013 stuck in draft mode</h2>
                    <p>Yes, there are other posts relating to this topic...</p>
<p>I had/have this issue with one particular docx file.</p>
<p>It has a lot of changes tracked, and while performing a spelling &amp; grammar check, it stops showing the flagged item in the document.</p>
<p>Exiting the spell and grammar check, the doc sticks in Draft mode. The usual controls for changing view do not succeed.</p>
<p>If I save the doc and re-open, it opens in Draft mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I accepted a few of the most recent changes, the doc would then display in Page Layout or Web Layout views.</p>
<p>But then, attempting to run spell and grammar check, the problem re-occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ok - so it seems to be corruption, possibly related to tracked changes. I will pursue a cleanup - maybe perform a Maggie on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also - I saved it in .doc format, and it seemed to work in that format. The issue returned when I saved it back as a .docx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The resolution I found - created a new doc from suitable template, copied all but the last paragraph marker into the new doc.</p>
<p>Success - the new doc works fine. The tracked changes came along, and seem to be ok.</p>
<p>Maggie saves the day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to mention these factors, in case it helps someone.</p>

            Hi Sure,
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Can I make the @outlook.com personalized to be @FMS.COM for the business I am working for (they want to know)
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Either add the FMS address you were assigned as a connected account to your current outlook.com account or create a new outlook.com account and add it as a connected account.  
<br />
<br />This will allow you to use outlook.com on the web to send mail using that address. 
<br />
<br />You could make a microsoft account using the address (without an outlook.com address linked to it), but need to use a connected account if you want to send/receive mail via Outlook.com using the address.

<h2>            Suspended account due to incorrect date of birth</h2>
                    <p>Morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work for the NDIS and we have two staff members who have created Yammer accounts but inadvertently entered 2018 as tthe year in this Date of Birth. This has resulted in their accounts being suspended. We have tried recreating the account but is still recognises
 that their email address has been used before. Is there a way to delete their accounts so they can start again?</p>
<p>

            Hi Chris,
<br />
<br />If current account is suspended and can see it in system using signing option you can get an access back follow this guide <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4090274/microsoft-account-parental-consent-and-child-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/409027...</a> (add credit card or send ID).
<br />
<br />If account is not visible for signing option, but when you would like to recreate it you are getting an error that account exist, that mean that name is in recycling period (it takes 30 dates after deleting). It this scenario you should wait this time and later recreate an account.
<br />
<br />You always can choose different name as well.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have more questions       
        </p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>so you are saying after 30 days the account should be deleted and then they can recreate using the same email address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Chris,
<br />
<br />One more time:
<br />
<br />If on the sign in page you cannot use your account, because you have an error "account doesn't exist"
<br />and
<br />If on the sign up page you are getting an error "account already exists"
<br />
<br />that you should wait 30 days.
<br />
<br />How it work in general: a person creating a new account with wrong age, account is blocked for short time, later it is automatically deleted. After deleting starts 30 days recycling period and later name is again available for registry.
<br />
<br />If you have more question let me know       
        </p>

            Hi Chris,
<br />If you are using Yammer enterprise Network which comes with office 365 subscription than the Yammer administrator can activate the suspended user account within 14 days.
<br />After 14 days the user account will get deleted.
<br />For Yammer basic / free network we don't have Yammer admin control.
<br />lease refer the below Message in your Office 365 message center for more information on this.

<h2>            Plugged in, not charging.</h2>
                    I have a windows 10 home insider preview evaluation copy buil 10130, And I can't charge my PC. It says "Plugged in, not charging". I've tried the device manager trick, recalibrate trick, and all that stuff. It used to charge, Intill it stopped for no reason.
 Its not the plug-out, I've tried diffrent ones, even another family members house! Still not charging. Why do I want to fix this? My computer lags more when it's not charging. I have a rough time with it!

            When you buy Office, the license is permanent, not just for two years. Microsoft will release later versions (possibly even this year), but there's no requirement to upgrade. There are still people using versions of Office that were released 10 years ago
 or more.<br />

<p>First:</p>
<p>Thank you for your response, but I don't think you understand my question. What you suggested doing works to
<em>show</em> me the unread emails, unfortunately that has no effect on the <em>number</em> of unread emails next to the Junk Email folder. For instance, let's say I have 50 emails in my Inbox and&nbsp;3 of them are unread.&nbsp;The folders pane shows:
<strong>Inbox 3</strong>. Using the same numbers as above (50 total,&nbsp;3 unread) with the Junk Email folder, the folders pane now&nbsp;shows:
<strong>Junk Email 50</strong>. What I would like to see is <strong>Junk Email 3</strong>. Is this possible???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second:</p>
<p>I've noticed some issues with the way junk email is handled now: I have emails that 2 days ago (before the update) went to the Junk Email folder that are now showing up in my Inbox AND I have email that has a rule to go to a specific folder I created going
 to the Junk Email folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third:</p>
<p>When I mark an email as a phishing scam, I still get emails from those same&nbsp;addresses
<em>every</em>...<em>single</em>...<em>day</em>! What's the point of flagging them, when they keep showing up?!? I had this issue with the previous version of Outlook.com as well.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your reply and explaining that "by design" the total number of junk emails is represented. May I suggest two things?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>As a consumer of your product, it would be great if this "design" was explained in the Help section
<strong>anywhere</strong>. I looked all over that section for anything about this new "feature"; I saw nothing about it. There were hints about other new features, but not this.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Would it be possible for the end-user to decide if they would rather see
<strong>total</strong> or <strong>unread</strong> emails in their Junk Email folder? Quite frankly, I do not care how many total emails I have in the Junk Email folder, it would be more productive for me to see how many
<strong>unread</strong> ones were in there. Any particular reason the Junk Email folder is designed this way, and not like
<em>every other folder in Outlook.com</em> which shows <strong>unread</strong> emails?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">"I suggest you to refer to the section:<strong> Keep emails from specific people or domains from going into your Junk folder
</strong>from the following article on </span></em><em><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Filter-junk-email-and-spam-in-Outlook-on-the-web-db786e79-54e2-40cc-904f-d89d57b7f41d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">Filter

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In regards to your previous statement, let me reiterate my original comment:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>"Second:</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>I've noticed some issues with the way junk email is handled now: I have emails that 2 days ago (before the update) went to the Junk Email
 folder that are now showing up in my Inbox AND I have email that has a rule to go to a specific folder I created going to the Junk Email folder."</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your suggestion does not solve my issue because it is&nbsp;the
<em>exact opposite</em> of my comment: I have emails that <strong><em>were</em></strong> going to my Junk Email folder (because it is set to Exclusive)&nbsp;that are
<strong><em>now</em></strong> going to my Inbox! I <strong><em>want</em></strong> them to go to my Junk Email folder.&nbsp;I have had this account since 2000 (September, I believe) and have used filters and rules in Outlook.com (and Outlook in the Office suite)
 for years.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also noticed you made no mention of the issue with flagging emails as phishing scams. That tells me volumes about the direction Microsoft is
 heading.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are still confused/unsure about what I am trying to convey, please let me know.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before yesterday, I had not created any new rules for some time. The only thing that changed was the Outlook.com update on January 11th. As I have said before, my Junk Email filter is set
 to Exclusive -&nbsp;"<em><span>Only trust email from my Safe senders and Safe mailing lists, contacts, service announcements, and alerts I've signed up for."
</span></em>I checked the emails that <strong><span>were</span></strong> going to my Junk Email folder&nbsp;(that are now going to my Inbox) and they are not on any of those lists, so by Outlook.com's design they should
<strong><span>not</span></strong> be going to my Inbox. In addition, some emails which have&nbsp;rules&nbsp;for
<strong><span>Safe</span></strong> emails to go to folders I created, are
<strong><span>going to</span></strong> the Junk Email folder. Again, by this programs own design, they should
<strong><span>not</span></strong> be sent to the Junk Email folder. I could understand if they were&nbsp;going to the&nbsp;Inbox (since they are on the
<strong><span>Safe</span></strong> list) if the rule was not working.&nbsp;I even created a couple new rules yesterday (from companies that I have been getting emails for
<em><span>years</span></em>), and the rules did not work today!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is all well and good&nbsp;to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;preview, but to create a poor UX&nbsp;is not acceptable. Thank&nbsp;you also for telling me about
<strong><span><a href="http://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Uservoice</span></a></span></strong>; I did not know that existed until I read your reply. Technology is supposed to
 make our lives easier and more productive; ever since this update on January 11th my email experience has been the complete opposite.</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 email text disappears</h2>
                    <p>After scanning a document with my HP Printer (Officejet 6700), I select to attach the pdf file to an email.&nbsp; This works fine, and an Outlook 2013 email opens up with the pdf attachment.&nbsp; But when I then type in text into the email and send it, the text disappears
 -- both the receiver, and also when I review sent items in my Outlook.&nbsp; I am using 365 with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; This feature used to work, but now does not.&nbsp; My "normal" troubleshooting has not worked.&nbsp; Suggestions would be more than welcome - they would be fantastic!.</p>

            Hi schneiderschnei,
<br />
<br />To turn on Automatic Calculation in Excel:
<br />
<br />Go to File - Options
<br />
<br />On the left click Formulas
<br />
<br />On the right, under Worksheet calculations, set that to Automatic

<h2>            outlook 2010 won&#39;t toggle switch back to Online from Offline mode</h2>
                    Can't get MS Outlook to switch back (toggle) to Online from Offline.<br />
<br />
Tried ipconfig/flushdns but that didn't help.<br />
<br />
I can connect to my IMAP server and get e-mails OK,&nbsp; but I want to be able to work Online instead of Offline.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to solve this problem with MS Outlook 2010??<br />

            <p>It sounds like you have Outlook 2010 installed and not Outlook 2013 (where you've categorized your post).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is caused by update KB3114409 which causes Outlook 2010 to start in Safe Mode. Microsoft has already removed this update from Windows Update but you computer must have downloaded it before it was pulled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can safely uninstall the update and after restarting your computer, Outlook will start with your own settings again.</p>

    <title>Sorting and filtering of Lookup columns from other lists - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinmurphy6399  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorting and filtering of Lookup columns from other lists</h2>
                    
<p>I have 2 lists, we'll call them A and B. From A, I've added a lookup from B, with additional fields - some of them being dates.</p>
<p>When I am viewing list A with the lookup fields from B, the data is all there, but when I select column header from a lookup from B, mainly dates, I get a message at the top of the dropdown menu, "this column type cannot be sorted".</p>
<p>The real issue is when I try to filter on one of the choices. For instance, if the user whats to filter on "(Empty)", no results are returned. This is wrong as a scan of the list does show some dates that are truly blank.</p>
<p>Is this a MS bug? I've built another view of the same data and duplicated the results. If I go to list B, the dates are sortable and can be filtered correctly.</p>
<p>To add to my frustration, I migrated (rebuilt by hand) this site from an on-prem SP2010 installation to SharePoint O365. Lookup columns, such as dates, filtering worked perfectly in SP2010. This seems to have broke in the O365 implementation, unless I'm
 overlooking something.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

<p>hi kevin,</p>
<p>sorry for my delay.</p>
<p>1. i would like to explain that after allowing multiple values in the column, it will be an expected behavior that you get the "this column type cannot be sorted" message.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6d2f5374-59ab-4af2-83ea-99515d59ef46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6d2f5374-59ab-4af2-83ea-99515d59ef46" /></a></p>
<p>2. after doing some tests with the same settings, the checkbox should appear as the picture shows.
<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9e33218b-02f9-4866-aea4-01492b3f6b1d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9e33218b-02f9-4866-aea4-01492b3f6b1d" /></a><br />
<br />
for the issue that no results are returned, to narrow down if it is related to the list, please try to test with a newly created one.</p>
<p>if the issue persists, we would like to collect the list template for further investigation. you can click the link below to upload it to the workspace shared with you:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations&nbsp;</p>
<p>how to save list as template:<br />
go to list tab &gt; list settings &gt; save list as template &gt; tick include content &gt; go to list template galley &gt; select the template &gt; files tab &gt; download a copy.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
hale</p>
