    <title>Heading text cross-references - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris nh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Heading text cross-references</h2>
                    <p>Word 2013 does not manage cross-references to headings, or more specifically to heading text very well. If you put the insert point at the start of a heading that has been cross-referenced (using the Heading text option) and press Enter&nbsp;then all of the text
 that you&nbsp;subsequently enter into the newly created paragraph(s) will be appear in the cross-reference text.&nbsp;The simple work around is&nbsp;don't do this.&nbsp;In other words, always put the insertion point at the&nbsp;end of a heading&nbsp;before pressing Enter. But in my view&nbsp;placing
 the insertion point at the start of an existing heading and pressing Enter&nbsp;is a fast and logical&nbsp;way to insert a new heading&nbsp;at the same level,&nbsp;in both&nbsp;the Print Layout and Outline views. It is also by far&nbsp;the easiest and most obvious way to insert a new paragraph
 between a table and a heading. And in any case,&nbsp;the New Heading Before feature in the Navigation pane&nbsp;is impacted by this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have two questions. Is my understanding of this issue&nbsp;correct? And&nbsp;does anyone know if this issue will be&nbsp;addressed in Word 2016?</p>

            <p>You have understood the problem perfectly. This is an old problem in Word. In a document with cross-references (or manually inserted bookmarks), you mustn't press Enter, or add content, at the beginning of a bookmarked/cross-referenced paragraph, because
 whatever you add will be added inside the bookmark.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can't cancel it, as far as I know.&nbsp; You can ignore it, however.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way to truly get out of Insider is to hard reset your phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't as bad as it sounds.&nbsp; If everything is backed up, all will be restored.&nbsp; Just copy any pictures or other files that aren't on your OneDrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove the SD card, if you have one, to prevent it being formatted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this several times on my 1520 and Icon, testing various 10 builds.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is painless.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very sorry for the inconveniences this issue has caused. As I couldn't reproduce the same issue on my side, please try logging the
<a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 admin center</a> in the InPrivate mode of your browser to see if this is caused by the cache files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is not caused by the cache files, I would appreciate it if you could provide us your tenant information in the&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Messages</a>&nbsp;so that we could further investigate this issue
 for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please also try if you can access the services in the Office 365 admin center, for example:</p>
<p>SharePoint admin center:&nbsp;https://[your tenant]-admin.sharepoint.com/</p>
<p><a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center</a></p>

            <p>Gordon bet me to testing it, but that would be my experience. The Belarc app, save the file as an HTML file on your PC and opens the file in your browser. If you look in the address bar of the browser, it should say something like
</p>
<p>file:\\c:\Users\username\documents\belarc.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you don't need to save, but I would delete the product keys, then just use File&gt;Save</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, there is a topic choice when you post. It defaults to the Access topic if you don't change it, but you SHOULD select an appropriate topic. You just got lucky that both&nbsp;Gordon and I are familiar with Belarc.</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone Recovery Tool no longer supports Lumia 520&#63; Is an old version available&#63;</h2>
                    I have a bricked Lumia 520 and would like to restore it with the Windows Phone Recovery Tool. However, after clicking the "My Device Was Not Detected" button and looking at the list of Lumia phones, the Lumia 520 is no listed. I know that unbricking this
 phone has been supported by this tool in the past, so is it possible to download an older version of the software? I can't find a way to do that. Thanks.

</p><p>Just click it and you would see "<span>It works on Lumia, LG, HTC One, and HTC 8X phones running Windows Phone 8 or later versions as well as the Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL, MCJ Madosma, BLU WIN HD and BLU WIN HD LTE devices. For non-Lumia Nokia phones,

            <p>Thank you Bob</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did indeed do what you propose, but for some reason, when you move the folder over another computer, one have to relink the file manually. In other words, even if the file are in the same folder, Word does not save any link to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder what's the point of making this feature available if they cannot be saved with the document...</p>

            <p>Bob probably can explain it better than I can. But it sounds like you need use relative Links. Relative Links only depend upon the File or directory they happen to Reside at time of use, as opposed to Hard links which are set up to one specific Directory
 on a Specific Computer,&nbsp; when moved the links are broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bob can probably explain for you how to set them up.</p>

            <p>Hi Louis:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmmm... &nbsp;Sound files can be saved in Notebook View Word documents, but it is a seriously bad idea to do this. &nbsp;The idea is that you can record lectures and take notes in Notebook Layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The net result is that re-starting a recording has a bad habit of wiping out the previous recording. &nbsp;Not always, just when the recording is really valuable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the presence of a sound file in the document seems to make the document very unstable. By which I mean that instead of losing the recording, you lose the whole document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it seemed like a good idea at the time, but the feature was very buggy, and I am not aware of any fixes to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is that Bob's idea is the best there is: place the sound file in the same folder as the document (NOT a subfolder within that) and link them from there. &nbsp;The folder must be on your local drive, and the audio files must be at the same level
 as the .docx).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before working on such a document, turn OFF Word&gt;Preferences&gt;General&gt;"Update automatic links at Open". &nbsp;If you forget this step, Word will re-write the links to explicit links when you open, so the file can't then be used on anyone else's computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know what? &nbsp;I might be sorely tempted to try to meet your requirement in PowerPoint, perhaps placing the body text in the Speaker's Notes :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
        </p>

<h3> silver5624  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor&#47;Mouse issues</h2>
                    <p>I just bought new Mac laptop (OS EL X Capitan) 10.11.6. and full office package, etc. So frustrated with this issue (in Excel) I bought "Magic" Mouse since my wrists and fingers are too sore to swipe any more. Still can't get cursor to insert without breaking
 world record for clicking in one cell--not to mentioned the cursor not aligning in the font change box--Oh, and inserting one font size on top of another. I am naive I guess because I always thought issues with computers would be complex or something that
 could be easy to miss during testing stages. Unless an amoeba was used to test things out I just don't see how something like this could be missed or why it could take so long to fix. Someone mentioned earlier OS's didn't have this problem. I suppose installing
 an earlier version would only mess things up more?? Or is the OS I have now not current? Is there such a thing as asking for money back, especially for software that doesn't function properly?</p>

<p>Now try excel and see if some of the symptoms have gone away.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Exclude Certain Style from Wildcard Find and Replace in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timpub  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exclude Certain Style from Wildcard Find and Replace in Word 2010</h2>
                    Dear All, <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help! This community is one of the most valuable resources I've ever come across.<br />
<br />
I'm just getting to grips with the advanced Find and Replace functions in Word 2010. However, I've hit a bit of a mental block.
<br />
<br />
1. Is it possible to make a wildcard Find and Replace omit a certain style? It's possible using [!] to omit certain characters, but what about formatting properties (styles, alignments, indents, etc.)? I'm aware that there are various creative ways you could
 work around this problem. I'm just wondering if there's a direct solution?<br />
<br />
2. Is it possible to make a wildcard Find and Replace look for paragraphs that follow other paragraphs of a certain style? What I'm trying to achieve is to add an Answer style automatically to all paragraphs that follow a Question style. It's easy enough to
 find the questions because of their unique features, but the answers are otherwise indistinguishable from text that features elsewhere in the document.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Timpub<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I don't recall seeing a NOT STYLE search criteria.<br />
<br />
One thing that will help is turning on the "Style Area"<br />
<p>
Using the Style Area <a href="http://wordribbon.tips.net/T008024_Using_the_Style_Area.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://wordribbon.tips.net/T008024_Using_the_Style_Area.html</a> </p>
<br />
This way you will be able to see the style applied to every paragraph as you are editing in Draft mode.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I guess all you can do is be repetitive. Find the question style only, and look to see if you need to apply Answer style.

<p>I really enjoy using office lens however with these glitches constantly occurring it's frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help</p>
<p>I am trying to upload only 1 page (not a big file), I have already updated my IOS as well as my apps, force restart my device and I have tried deleting and reinstalling the app. Not sure what else I can do.</p>

            Hi Christie<br />
<br />
We tested from our side, but we did not encounter the same issue.<br />
There is some suggestion you could try:<br />
1. You could try to delete your account in Lens and sign is again.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46481851-c714-4ba2-8a56-577ad9f75dc1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46481851-c714-4ba2-8a56-577ad9f75dc1?upload=true" /></a><br />
2. Clear account settings of Lens in your device.<br />
3. What if you log in with a personal account too, will it let you choose which OneDrvie to export?<br />
<br />
To provide further support, could you also share the following with us?<br />
1. Could you share a screenshot of the error message?<br />
2. Your device type and IOS version.<br />
3. The version of Lens you installed.<br />
4. Could you login to Other Office Mobile apps such as OneDrive?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alex

<p>Hi Christie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't heard from you for a couple days. Does Lens still keep asking you to sign in when you uploading PDF? If you still need support on this, just come back to us anytime.</p>
<p>

Hello Alex</div>
<div>
I have tried clearing the settings and deleting and reinstalling the app. I do not have a personal Microsoft account and to be honest that is counter productive for our students. The app should work flawlessly every time for our little guys who rely on this
 type of app.</div>
<div>
When it works, it works great!</div>
<div>
<p>I have attached the screen shot I get. All my other office 365 apps are logged in, including One Drive</p>

            Hi Christie,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
The image seems not uploaded successfully. Could you share it again?<br />
And according to you, it seems to take you to a personal login page, could you share a screenshot of it too?<br />
Is there any error message? If it does, could you share it with us?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>Try typing System in the Settings Search. Then click System, then System Protection.</p>
<p>There is an option there that says System Restore.</p>
<p>This is on Win 8.1.</p>
<p>If the person uses Classic Shell for Start, then just click Control Panel and then System.</p>

            Yes it can--we should be able to search for it and find it immediately in one step! The same goes for File History, Backup, Recovery, System Image, and on and on. Search is better than windows 8 which never finds any relevant answers by searching the Internet
 instead of the computer but it needs to be simpler!

<p>For experienced users it's a minor inconvenience. Inexperienced users get lost quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a volunteer Tech Support, I advise people to run System Restore when they have problems, as a first step, for settings or initial malware problems, prior to scans.</p>
<p>But how do I guide them to System Restore in the different editions of Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to know which edition they have and guess how well they will search and follow instructions.</p>
<p>Start Search system restore&nbsp; should offer System Restore as an option across all editions and whether you are in Metro or Desktop, Settings or Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Create a Restore Point' should also be easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If 'Uninstall a program' is quick to find, why not these other features?</p>

</p><p>I'm fed up telling inexperienced people to press Windows key+R and type rstrui.exe (or press Windows key
<em>and</em> R and type <em>rstrui.exe</em>)</p>
<p>(Or Win+R <em>systempropertiesprotection</em>, because it's easier than them trying to find Restore or Create RPs themselves)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just not User Friendly</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people also believe System Restore is some sort of Factory Restore and they will lose files. More education is needed on what it means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"But how do I guide them to System Restore in the different editions of Windows?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try "Control Panel/Recovery/System Restore".&nbsp; It is the same in Windows 7, 8.1 and 10.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 ProPlus Device Based Activation Skip Sign In Screen</h2>
                    <p>I'm in a K-12 school district, and am attempting to move us away from the Office 2016 MSI model to O365 Pro Plus with DBA (device based activation). We have staff and students sharing computers, and would like for O365 Pro Plus to open for them without them
 having to sign in with their O365 credentials the first time they launch an Office application. This works fine for systems with Office 2016, but the Office 365 Pro Plus installation pop-ups up stating they need to sign in to set up Office. Need some guidance
 on how to get that sign in prompt to go away, and for Office to be activated automatically for each user on a computer.</p>

<p>I received assistance from the O365 EDU team. Here's what they had me do:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go ahead and set "Shared Computer Activation" to 0 instead of 1 in your configuration.xml file. That should give you the results you desire.
<strong>Shared Computer Activation actually breaks the DBA scenario, despite what the name suggests.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After I made this change in the configuration.xml file, I re-ran the OPPTRANSITION command without the -NoInstall or -NoUninstall switches, and it removed and
 re-installed Office 365 Pro Plus. Now when I open an Office program under any user account, they don't receive that sign in prompt.</span></p>

    <title>Mail Merge, Word 2013 &#47; File Maker Pro - merge extension - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smb1823  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge, Word 2013 &#47; File Maker Pro - merge extension</h2>
                    <p>I use FileMaker Pro, a database program.&nbsp;&nbsp; It allows me to export a select group of records which I set up to save as a ".mer" file.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Word 2013 I have my document and it used to work just fine to start mail merge, select from an existing list (finding
 my save .mer file) and that was it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several weeks ago it just stopped connecting my word document to the .mer file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use this a lot!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The steps I take are:</p>
<p>Open document</p>
<p>Start mail merge (letters, labels, etc.)</p>
<p>Select recipients - "use an existing list"</p>
<p>It opens the "select data source" window - I go to "documents" and find my .mer file (which is usually in the FMP12 file list for the client I am working on).&nbsp; I have to click on the file type so it shows "all files (*.*).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I select the .mer file.</p>
<p>NOW, it brings up a "confirm data source" and only shows OLE DB Database Files.&nbsp; If I select that, it does nothing.&nbsp; There is no link to my .mer file.</p>
<p>It had been working that I would do the "show all" for the "open data source", select the "All Word Documents" and it would start the mail merge.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now it brings up the "file conversion" for my .mer file", which shows Windows (default).&nbsp; I do OK and then it brings up the "Header Record Delimiters" and I can find no system that works for the "Field Delimiter" or the "Record Delimiter".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I tried
 them in every combination, i.e. field is "none" and record is ",".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually that does work but only gives me the first merge field, not the entire list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have so much work to do and merging from FileMaker Pro as a .mer file has worked for years!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one FMP12 database I have over 1,000 records, having 10 or more different merge lists, and sometimes just need to merge one record. &nbsp; So exporting to excel
 and creating an excel file is just too time consuming. &nbsp; &nbsp; I can export from FMP12 as a .tab, .csv, .txt, .dbf, .mer, .htm, .fmp12, .xml, .xls, .xlsx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having trouble with the merge function?&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned, I have done this for years and only lately has it become a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<h2>            MS Access and opening Windows 10 on screen Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I'm writing a database that will be used on a table out in the field. What I need to do is to find a way to open windows 10 on screen keyboard when a button is press on the form. I realize that it can be opened by pressing the keyboard icon on the task bar,
 but I need to simplify it for people who are mentally challenged&nbsp; to be able to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 10&nbsp; keyboard is located in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Ink\Tabtip.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried using the shell command but I get error File not Found or invalid procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for example this produced a file note found error, but if I use it to load windows note pad it works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim ReVal</p>
<p>ReVal=Shell("C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Ink\Tabtip.exe")<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I said if I use</p>
<p>Shell("C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe")&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help</p>

<h3> scott29732  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Domain-Migration</h2>
                    
<p>About 2 weeks ago I received an email from our Executive Director, that they had purchased a new domain(h****.org to h*****c.org).&nbsp; My question is I know that I need to migrate user information over, however I've searched TechNet, Community, and Office 365
 Yammer. with no real solution.&nbsp; Can any one recommend or point me in the right direction as to how to get user information from h****.org to h*****c.org,&nbsp; I've seen posts how to handle mail going from On-Premise, but not from Exchange Online to Exchange Online,
 the same with the other services.&nbsp; I know Skykick is out there, but really trying to handle this myself.&nbsp; I appreciate any constructive suggestions you may have.&nbsp; Thank you in advance.&nbsp; Respectfully, Scott</p>

<p>Good Afternoon Brook: &nbsp;I unfortunately already have created their email account, and users have been using them for about 1.5 weeks, so I just can not delete and start over. &nbsp;What can I do at this point to get the old information (OneDrive, Yammer SharePoint,

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>Changing the users’ primary email address with a new custom domain will not change the users’ information in SharePoint. The only thing users need to do is to use the updated user ID to sign in SharePoint Online. The files users stored in SharePoint libraries
 and OneDrive for Business libraries will not change.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>After a running transfer is done, a new transfer involving those devices can start.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that it works fine now. Based on my experience, it may be related to the add-ins, I suggest you clear the add-ins of the Chrome and check if the issue persists. If yes, I recommend you contact the Google support, I believe they can provide
 more professional assistance about this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Office Outlook insecure client for Gmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinkorn613  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Outlook insecure client for Gmail</h2>
                    <p>I work voluntarily for a charity which has recently set up its own email account, to be used by all volunteers.&nbsp; I'm told that as Outlook is an insecure client for Gmail the charity has taken the decision that in order to be GDPR (General Data Protection
 Regulations) compliant they cannot allow Outlook to be used for the charity's Gmail account (I've been using Outlook for about 20 years in total).</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest a way round to enable me to convince the charity that I can continue using Outlook and at the same time the charity will remain compliant?</p>

<p>Thank you and for the others who replied to the other thread which I created by mistake</p>
<p>It seems that Gmail states clearly that Outlook program is insecure.&nbsp; I can understand therefore why the Charity will not allow Outlook to be used, only Gmail.&nbsp; They are concerned that if they were to allow Outlook their security might be considered not
 to be appropriate (inadequate) and therefore they would be potentially in breach of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPRs).</p>
<p>What I cannot find is anything detailing Microsoft's stance (or advice) on this.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; If Microsoft agree with Google they should say so (and presumably they will lose a lot of sales) and advise what they are doing to put this right and in what timescale</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If they don't agree with Google they should say so and fully detail their reasons and detail what action is being taken by Google/Microsoft to help the user to decide what to do</p>
<p>

<p>No, Gmail considers using your regular password for Basic Authentication insecure. If you enable 2-Step Verification and use an App Password to authenticate with Outlook against Gmail, Gmail accepts this as secure and won't block your connection.</p>

<p>You have already posted this Q and being replied to, with the answers.</p>
<p>Whoever is in charge of GPDR's either doesn't understand it, or its a third party trying to sell compliance&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gmail does not actually comply with the IMAP published standards, does its own thing and obviously sells data it gleans from it users.</p>

<h2>            Onenote synchronization- and moving&#47;copying failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Somehow all my files from my notebook in Onenote ( not 2016 version) got placed in the "misplaced section". I wouldn't mind it if it weren't for the fact that i can't edit the files anymore. I checked for the regular solutions with moving/copyingh the
 fiules to Another notebook but that doesnt work becuase apparently I can't move/copy the files until I have synchronized the files which i alsa can't do since when I try the error code 0X0000063 bv8w5 pops up. To clarify: The notebooks are empty and all the
 files are in the misplaced section from where I am unable to move, copy or synchronize the files. I did a backup and thought of trying to reset the program but i don't know how to find the OneNote files on the backup drive. Any help in resolving this issue
 would be much appreciated!</p>

    <title>Nokia DC-16 only gives me half power - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia DC-16 only gives me half power</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, just got Nokia DC-16 portable charger and noticed that it only gives around 1000 mAh despite the fact that it has 2200 mAh battery inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charged it in full and then connected it to my phone with 1800 mAh battery. When Nokia DC-16 was discharged my phone was charged only 50%. Tried that two times with exactly the same results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i wonder is my unit faulty or this is the performance i should expect?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Found this in All About Symbian review:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DC-16's capacity is rated at 2200mAh, which is equivalent to less than two full charges of most smartphone batteries; it is also guaranteed for 500 charge cycles. Nokia say the output current is 950mA, which is quite high for a battery of this class.
 Anecdotally, it can quickly recharge our Lumia 800 to full (from empty).</p>

<p>Hello @karabulev,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With my DC-16 it takes something like 50-70 mins to recharge my Lumia 800 and after that the DC-16 has only little power left to use. And I have to say I am very satisfied with the quality and performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-vvaino</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. One thing I must say, usually I notice my phone is getting emphy when I pick it up from my pocket to do something urgent, so I quickly take the DC-16 and there is some heavy use at start with the DC-16 plucked in.</p>

<p>Made another test with my HTC One X and DC-16 still managed to charge only 50% of 1800 mAh battery in the phone.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that lithium ion batteries require a few charge discharge cycles before it attains optimum performance. You should notice an improvement over the new few cycles.&nbsp;</p>

            It took my DC-16 around five charge/discharge cycles before it was capable of charging a Lumia 800 from &lt;5% to full. That was with not using the phone during charging.

<p>When using the phone during a charge with the DC-16 its capacity will be divided between powering the device and charging the battery.&nbsp;In real life this would probably mean that by the time the charger itself is empty it the device charge will be around
 50%.</p>

            I have also noticed that my DC-16 is not up to my expectations.<br />
If a charge Nokia 700 from 5% left it should be able to charge the phone more or less 2 times fully. Will tesy this on a Nokia 700 which have a battery of 1080 mA. Will not use the phone in the meanwhile, just checking my DC-16.<br />

<p>Ok, here is the result;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drained the battery of Nokia 700 which have 1080 mAh. Started to charge the phone. Didnt use the phone at all during the charging.<br />
Drained the battery after that completely again.</p>
<p>Charged the battery but could only get the battery to charge up to approx. 35% the second charge. The DC-16 dried out after approx 25-35 minutes the second time.<br />
Perhaps I have to do this procedures a couple of times, but I am not impressed at all.</p>

<p>You won't be able to completely drain the battery in DC16 and transfer it all into the phone battery and here is the reason why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the current to flow, there has to be potential difference between the 2 batteries. In simple terms, the DC16 starts with double the power of the Phone battery. After the first charge, both batteries will have roughly the same amount of power left eg
 around 1050. After the second charge equilibrium will be achieved at 525 at which stage charging will cease becase there is 525 in both batteries and there is no potential difference so no current flows. However if you run down the phone battery again and
 plug it in again, it will probably charge to around half that again. Only way to fully run down the DC16 is to keep it connected to the phone to power the phone till it runs down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using mah figures as a simplified way to compare the batteries but potential difference is measured in volts. Currently will only flow from higher voltage to lower. No current will flow when the voltage in both batteries is at equilibrium, hence no
 charging. The DC16 may not necessarily be empty when charging stops.</p>

<p>Hi Mark</p>
<p>I was replying to the same address I had been getting emails from Outlook Support for weeks. &nbsp;Or it may have had an added section to it. Bottomused line is, I had asked a question in Outlook Support regarding my junk mail. I got a reply through my email
 identifying themselves as the Outlook Support Team and they would help me figure out what was going on. &nbsp;Then they told me to install a link to a screenshot program to get pictures of what was going on. I installed the program and took a few. Then I used my
 own program to take a few. All were sent in a reply to the email. I kept getting requests for more involved manipulations. So jump ahead to 10/3/18 when I deleted all the junk mail and 30 minutes later I found the 217 junk mail messages. I checked my inbox
 and saw a message saying because I have not responded they were closing the ticket. &nbsp;I started a reply to say what I found but stopped, checked the return address and saw that phrase ' in supprt' and immediately wrote my SOS! &nbsp; Since then I am currently connected
 with a support tech fixing my PC. I signed up for the personal package and John Snow is in my PC right now fixing it. &nbsp;Thank you! &nbsp; &nbsp; phrase "</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><strong><em>I have sent these emails I received directly from "Outlook Support" Because, before I copied them part of the address you can see here from the sender had the words at the end "In support of Outlook Support" as I mentioned
 in my first post.&nbsp; But as soon as I copied the email, that portion disappeared.&nbsp; Also, as you can see, they do not come in a message like I am used to getting, which says 'XXXXXperson has answer to your question'.&nbsp; From the very beginning of this nightmare,
 I always received direct emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't exactly understand the formatting here, but what I thought is a very important part, the senders address is there except the part I talked about.</em></strong></p>

 impression he was a Microsoft Technician. Your 'virtual assistant' directed me to their phone number, the phone was answered "Hello, Microsoft Support. How can we help you?"&nbsp; He had a program running all night long, he showed me all of the terrible red alerts,
 and how each red flag showed the status of 'shared', which meant I had thousands of IP addresses who had been in my computer for months!&nbsp; I sure was happy this microsoft technician found all these problems and is cleaning my computer.&nbsp; I was so exhausted,
 I sat down to look at the television schedule, and woke up at 1930 hours. When I looked at my computer, there were two small windows above the taskbar with Red Logos I didn't recognize. To which I mumbled "WTH???"&nbsp; I opened one to find a timer running, and
 it continued to run until I closed the window.&nbsp; Someone, or thing was in my computer either looking around or gathering data, or maybe timing how long I was on my computer.&nbsp; I have already removed everything they left on my computer, and am fighting the $500
 charge I agreed to pay Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>With the information that you've provided there's a high possibility that your computer was hacked.</p>
<p>What I suggest to you is try to access your email account using a different device or computer and try to secure it by
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
adding security information</a>.</p>
<p>And for your computer, I recommend that you contact your local computer technician to check your computer if it's infected by virus&nbsp; just to make sure your computer is clean before you use it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

</p><p><strong><em>Mark and Gil</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If this actually makes it to you intact, I have finally been able to catch one of the many emails that I got most of the time with that little phrase at the end, that I drew the red box around. "On behalf of Outlook.com Support"&nbsp; I never paid
 it any attention, because they were trying to help me figure out why I was getting junk mail that was already marked as important, and were flagged.&nbsp; But they kept asking me to do more and more things, and I was really just too busy to sit down and figure
 out what they wanted.&nbsp; Until the night I had deleted all junk mail from my three email accounts, and my hotmail was the last, so I left the window open while I took a shower. That was when I came back in, sat at my desk and saw the 217 junk mail messages,
 with every single one flagged and marked important. You could see they must have all been sent at the same time because of the times of arrival.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I had received an email earlier that day basically saying if I couldn't be bothered to help investigate the problem, then the ticket would be closed. I was writing back as fast as I could to tell them NO! Don't close it! Then started telling
 them what happened when I just started thinking, and got that feelin that something was not right.&nbsp; I looked back at the email address i had received with their latest email, and first thought it was a really long address and noticed that "on behalf of", and
 I knew something was up.&nbsp; I looked back at all the messages I had received, and noticed some had the prase and some didn't.&nbsp; So, I started to send them to wherever I could to preserve the return addresses.&nbsp; But I noticed that most of them I attempted to forward,
 the screen would kind of flash, and then the address would be changed.&nbsp; Which is why I started feeling like I had lost my mind!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>So, this one I was able to send in an email to myself, and it still had the ridiculously long return address with "on behalf of".&nbsp; My computer has been completely cleaned, and Windows defender is back online and I am installing 360 Total Security
 right now.&nbsp; BTW....as soon as I told the people emailing me I was done trying to figure out what they wanted from me, I am still getting junk mail already marked as important and flagged, but not as much.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If you want any or all of the correspondence&nbsp; I had from these support people, I will get what I can.&nbsp; I am quite angry with Microsoft right now, but that is another matter.&nbsp; I want to thank you both for telling me that maybe I might have a computer
 hacking problem.&nbsp; But, I want to point out, that if my PC had a problem, then maybe there are some support people in Outlook who knew how to escalate the problem for me. Just sayin'!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Thank you again!&nbsp; I'd buy you beers if I could. ;-)&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
