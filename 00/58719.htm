    <title>How do I reset the default file association for .bat files on Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firewoodtim  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I reset the default file association for .bat files on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Windows 8.1 allows the user to change the file association for .bat files. I made the mistake of using this facility to change the default file association for .bat files to Notepad++. Now when I attempt to run a .bat file, the script for the .bat comes
 up in Notepad++, instead of its being run as an executable file! &nbsp;All my .bat files are now useless. I tried finding a way to change this back to the original executable setting, including deleting Notepad++ from my system, but nothing has worked.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are discussions that I found on the Internet about this problem, and the solutions to which I was led have not worked either. There are a few solutions that purport to apply to Windows 8 and 8.1, but they do not work for me. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(Disconcertingly, some of the solutions presented for the problem apply to Vista or Windows 7 and are dated as early as 2009, so this problem has apparently been around for some time, but Microsoft still keeps .bat files on the Control Panel facility that
 enables the change to be made. I cannot see why, but there it remains.)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone please help me change this file association back to the original setting for Windows 8.1?&nbsp;</div>
</div>

            Anil,
<div>
<div>I searched all over the page where your link took me, and I found no way to submit my question to a forum. After searching around I eventually wound up at a page where I would have to pay to get the answer to my question. Can you please send me a more
 direct link to the page where I can enter my question - without paying?</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, this problem seems to be&nbsp;Microsoft's error and something they should correct in an update to Windows. No editing file association should be allowed for .bat files, because they are executables. Just like .exe files are not on the file association
 list for Control Panel, so .bat files should not appear either.</div>

<h2>            Microsoft changed this&#58; I would like a straight forward, no BS answer to this&#58;  ---&#62; Windows 10 License &#60;--- I didn&#39;t write that&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title : I would like a straight forward, no BS answer<br />
<br />
First let me make sure it is incredibly clear, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE FREE UPGRADE</strong></span>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, now that that is out of the way.&nbsp; As I have said many times in previous posts, I build my own PC's.&nbsp; I had a Microsoft Technet account and loved it.&nbsp; I know that at some point I am going to upgrade my current build and probably want to install Windows
 10.&nbsp; I will only do that once I am 100% certain it will work with the programs I use.&nbsp; I run Engineering Design programs to build FPGA's on my home computer, I also use various Development Environments to write programs in multiple languages: Java, Javascript,
 C, C++, C#, Python, PHP, etc.&nbsp; I also am a very avid gamer and have a very high end PC that I built.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read various "facts" about how Windows 10 will handle licensing and "re-installations".&nbsp; Like I said above, no interest in free upgrade, that also means I have no interest in downloading the ISO that is associated with the free upgrade.&nbsp; I have seen
 the OEM version of Windows 10 for sale on Newegg.com.&nbsp; I have been using my Technet purchased Windows 7 Ultimate since it was first released 7 years ago.&nbsp; I am quite happy with Windows 7 and honestly have no reason to change it any time soon.&nbsp; I have rebuilt
 my PC several times and re-installed Windows 7 Ultimate several times without any issue using the same license key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason I would even consider upgrading to Windows 10 is because Microsoft decided to be a jerk and limit DirectX 12 to Windows 8 &amp; 10.&nbsp; There is no physical/electrical/logical limitation that is preventing Microsoft from making DirectX 12 available
 on Windows 7 other than they want people to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; That is just a selfish and greedy reason, 100% based on money and not one bit based on anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, back to my question.&nbsp; The only way I will install Windows 10 is if I can purchase a license that gives the rights and protections afforded me by United States consumer protection laws.&nbsp; So, once I am able to do that, and I have to re-build my computer
 (either because I want to or something broke, shouldn't matter to Microsoft), will I be able to re-install Windows 10 or will I be required to purchase a "new license" every time I change a piece of hardware and have to re-install Windows 10?</p>

            <p><em>"they want people to upgrade to Windows 10."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yeah!&nbsp; Monopoly$oft is pushing Win10 HARD. I've read reports of people being 'upgraded' without</p>
<p>asking, but that may have been due to user error of some sort .</p>
<p>At least you are aware of the potential issues. Many people, particularly with 'outdated' laptops, are being</p>
<p>seduced into Win10 because of the 'free' concept, and deeply regretting their decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"or will I be required to purchase a "new license" every time I change a piece of hardware"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You never had to buy a new license for Windows with every hardware change/upgrade.</p>
<p>The motherboard is what the license is linked to. </p>
<p>While the official stance is that you need a new license with a new motherboard, in practice people often</p>
<p>(often being the operative word) are granted a continuation of their current license key if they use phone
</p>
<p>activation and&nbsp; explain that their motherboard failed. Sometime you need to speak to a supervisor.
</p>
<p>The success of this may be contingent on your region and the workers on that site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding doing a Win10 'upgrade'. It's difficult to know if software 'A' will be compatibile with Win10,</p>
<p>but generally speaking any software compatible with Win7/8/8.1 should be OK on Win10.</p>
<p>If you cannot find out from a forum specific to the software in question, you may need to experiment with Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am only interested in DX12, and have no need for the froth and bubble such as Cortana and</p>
<p>the inbuilt Store, but did do a Win10 upgrade to find out&nbsp; if I would like it.
</p>
<p>Well, about the only time I use Win10 is when needing to reference something particular about it</p>
<p>for these forums. Win7 is top dog&nbsp; imo, at least until DX12 becomes fully realised .</p>
<p>I haven't done an in depth study, but games seem to have very similar performance as Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to try what I've done. Clone your current OS to another HDD/SSD. Do the upgrade on one</p>
<p>of the HDD/SSD's and dual boot . This give you a chance to find out how much you may love or hate Win10,</p>
<p>and if there are any issues with your software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw - My Win7 install goes back to Jan 2010 and is still runs well. It has been cloned from another machine</p>
<p>with entirely different components - AMD cpu w/ Nvidia gpu &gt; Intel cpu w/ AMD gpu and back to Nvidia -</p>
<p>I obviously had to purchase a new license key for the new machine (OEM disk), but as a gamer with over</p>
<p>80 games installed from disk, I dread ever having to reinstall Windows. </p>
<p>This unfortunate day will probably come when I build a new machine and convert to Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you are not already aware of it, MS introduced their own malware with Win10 -
<em>DRM Blocking - </em></p>
<p>which prevents many older disk based games from loading. </p>
<p>They have also introduced this malware to Win7/8/8.1 via Windows updates&nbsp; ( KB3086255 &amp;&nbsp; KB2919355 )</p>
<p>With Win10 the only way to circumvent DRM Blocking is to use a noCD fix/hack.</p>
<p>- As with pushing the Win10 upgrade path I reckon MS is trying very hard to make disk based games,
</p>
<p>well any disk based software, redundant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>( hope that wasn't a BS, or too off track answer. But on persons.... )</p>
<p>.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Just so you know IF you were to upgrade Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 the<br />
resulting Windows 10 carries the same exact capabilities and rights that the<br />
qualifying OS did. Of course you can't use both the original OS and the Windows<br />
10 upgrade at the same time on the same or different computers.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 carries the same licensing rights that Windows 7/8/8.1 did and<br />
is available in two flavors to the consumer.<br />
<br />
1. Retail license - can install to any machine or hardware as long as only one<br />
machine at a time per license.<br />
<br />
2. Home OEM builder - tied to whatever computer it is first installed on and <br />
can't be installed on another computer even if removed from the original<br />
one. Some hardware changes may require you to call the activation center.<br />
This license is supposed to be for someone building a computer they intend<br />
to sell and not for themselves.<br />

            <p>I did hear/read that is was tied to the Motherboard.&nbsp; That has only been since Windows 8, right?&nbsp; I was also told by a Microsoft representative when I asked about the upgrade in one of my other posts (I was a little annoyed about it back then) that as far
 as the free upgrade was concerned that if for any reason any piece of hardware changed (hard drive, cd drive, anything) that it would invalidate the "free version" and I would have to purchase a license at that point.&nbsp; Hence why I asked about the "new license
 every time I change a piece of hardware".&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had to get a new license for any of the numerous re-installations I have done on my Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; I have Windows on a 256G SSD, Programs on a 1TB SSD, and Documents on a 2TB HDD.&nbsp; Even when reinstalling Windows I don't have to re-install my programs,
 especially the ones that I have through steam.&nbsp; I just tell Steam to "install" to the same directory as before and it automatically finds everything.&nbsp; Other programs like Visual Studio, Office, Adobe Suite, Xilinx Software (FPGA Design Software), I re-install
 those anyway.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Zig-zag&nbsp; confirms (while I wasn't looking ;) during the time I was doing my many edits)</p>

<p>I worry that some may have an issue if there is a required registry entry, but that would probably be rare .
</p>
<p>I do keep all games on separate HDD's from Windows, so as with Steam games I suppose there won't be any</p>

<p>I was a bit worried early on that I had to make a decision within 30 days and risk loosing Win7.</p>
<p>- Oh! One more thing - Some (not common) Steam games need the 'verify games cache' tool to be run
</p>
<p>when changing between Win10 and your current OS or they don't launch. Happens in both directions.</p>

            <p>Hi spirit, and honestly no that doesn't help. &nbsp;I was aware of that "new" practice by Microsoft which was never applied to Windows 7. &nbsp;I have built about 5 completely different PC's using the same Windows 7 license which I bought from Microsoft. &nbsp;There is
 no reason that I should not be able to do the same with a license purchased for Windows 10 from Microsoft or a licensed third party reseller. &nbsp;I also think the bold underlined letters stating that I am not interested in the "free" upgrade should have been
 sufficient enough to let people know, I am not interested in the "free" upgrade. &nbsp;So, don't bother bringing it up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the reason's why I am not interested in the "free" upgrade. &nbsp;Because it is free. &nbsp;By giving people Windows 10 for free to people Microsoft (as far as I understand it) is no longer under the laws that protect consumers in the USA. &nbsp;So, Microsoft
 essentially retains ownership of Windows 10 and is just letting you use it. &nbsp;They have no restrictions on what information they can and cannot take from your computer. &nbsp;So, anything and everything you do is open for them to log, store, analyze, sell, data
 mine, redistribute, and keep without your consent or knowledge. &nbsp;How do you think they are able to release a major operating system for free? Out of the kindness of their own hearts while taking a huge hit financially? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know there were a lot of people who were involved in creating Windows 10 and I bet a significant portion of them have high paying salaries (as in six figures). &nbsp;Even a small program will cost a million dollars to create. &nbsp;Look at any AAA game, they go
 into the hundreds of millions, and that's a game. &nbsp; I would guess the cost to Microsoft to create Windows 10 was well into the 100's of millions to create. &nbsp;Microsoft is making money off of you, you just don't know how.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The most likely way they are making money is by selling information to marketing companies. &nbsp;Don't be surprised if you start seeing adds on your desktop. Microsoft could be keeping track of your financial information, health records, families private info,
 your preferences in "adult entertainment", etc. &nbsp;I don't trust it, I won't use it even if Microsoft comes out and says they aren't doing that. &nbsp;I would want to see a court order banning Microsoft from invading people's privacy with harsh punishments of serious
 jail time for anyone found involved, especially including executives. &nbsp;No slap on the wrist fines of pocket change for them. &nbsp;I have a right to private and anonymous usage of my personal computer. &nbsp;No one has a right to know what I do on it or how I do it.
 &nbsp;If I get caught doing something illegal, then so be it, but I got caught. &nbsp;Someone didn't invade my privacy to find out if I was doing something or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Oh, by the way I own a cyber security company (a small one) which is why I take privacy very seriously.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Changing a piece of hardware might disable the Digital Entitlement for the<br />
Windows 10 upgrade which will prevent automatic activation. However <br />
activation could still be authorized in many cases by calling the activation<br />
center.<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>concurrently on one OEM license key. I was of the impression that there were retail versions that allowed up</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>"By giving people Windows 10 for free to people Microsoft (as far as I understand it) is no longer under the laws that protect consumers in the USA."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>They do seem a bit worried about this, as they have a statement right at the top of the EULA to the effect of</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"They have no restrictions on what information they can and cannot take from your computer. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Free or pay. There will be no difference. The main reason it is free to current users of Win7/8/8.1&nbsp; is because even after a long 'insider preview' period Win10 is still BETA, and will be going through lots of changes and major updates.</p>
<p>That, and they want to wind down the 'older' OS's and get as many people on to the one platform as possible.</p>
<p>People who build a new machine do have to pay for a copy of Win10 already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The telemetry thing is not going to change. They have options to disable much of the information gathering,</p>
<p>but everything in PC land is gathering info. </p>
<p>Our gov here in Oz has started forcing isp's to retain meta data for two years (one of several laws initiated</p>
<p>here in the past 20 odd years that would never happen in the land of the Bill of Rights).
</p>
<p>PC's and full&nbsp; privacy are no longer compatible, unless you stay off line.</p>
<p>- Speaking of telemetry. Are you aware of the other Windows updates that may already be on your Win7 ?</p>
<p>Check&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-update-no-longer-available-forces-windows/8bf124e4-dfc2-4c4f-8ae9-f987e849db89">

<p>
</p><p><em>"The most likely way they are making money is by selling information to marketing companies"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Doubtless. Why else is there now a Windows Store on the Start menu. Win10 <em>

            Yeah, I am aware of the "updates" that are really forced upgrades to Windows 10. &nbsp;I turned off automatic updates a long time ago. &nbsp;Now I scrutinize each one and make sure they are not trying to slip a forced upgrade as a mandatory patch.&nbsp;

            <p>The license I have, and am currently using, is from a technet subscription that cost me several hundreds of dollars to purchase.&nbsp; It gave access to the entire Microsoft library with multiple licenses for each product.&nbsp; It was only good for a year and you
 had to repurchase it every year if you wanted to keep it.&nbsp; You would get a small discount if it was a renewal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many programs that uses licenses to activate them, none of them are permanently tied to a specific piece of hardware (unless the hardware and software came bundled with the license, i.e development board).&nbsp; Even then, if I need to install the software
 on a new computer I just invalidate the old one and install it on the new one.&nbsp; As long as the license isn't active on more than one machine at a time I can do what I want with it.&nbsp; Microsoft's point of view seems to be that a license is tied to one piece
 of hardware (motherboard) and if that changes then a new licenses is required.&nbsp; What happens if a motherboard gets fried?&nbsp; I have had it happen in a thunderstorm.&nbsp; I had a server running in my home, we lost power and when everything came back up my server's
 motherboard was done for.&nbsp; The electrical surge was enough to fry the circuitry so it wouldn't work anymore.&nbsp; If I had to re-purchase a Windows Server license just so I could re-install it on a new server, I would never use Microsoft products again.&nbsp; Server,
 workstations, home pc's, laptops, everything breaks at some point.&nbsp; What if you had to repurchase all the software you have every time you change RAM on your computer, or any time you add a PCI-E card, upgraded your hard drive, bought a new monitor?&nbsp; That
 would be completely ridiculous.&nbsp; That seems to be the road Microsoft is going down.</p>

The licenses for TechNet/MSDN Subscriptions as well as those for Server Editions<br />
are entirely different than those for the OEM and retail consumer. Please check<br />
with TechNet or MSDN.<br />

<br />
<br />
I can't find the setting to make it use the NEW skype from now on...(so it will actually WORK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and there's apparently no way to chat with support (very weak support)</p>
<p>
</p><p>extremely frustrating support, probably one of the worst support systems I have ever encountered in my career.</p>
<p>
</p><p>even this form is frustrating (the REQUIRED sub topic and subject below are entirely irrelevant to my question and yet I am required to select&nbsp;<br />
"calling" and "audio and video" just so that I can select SOMETHING, which is required)<br />
<br />
how can little fly by night HOSTING companies manage to have LIVE CHAT running almost 24/7<br />
while MICROSOFT SKYPE can't even provide a way to CONTACT support at all??</p>
<p>I can't even send a MESSAGE to support???</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh and now, it doesn't even know that I'm already logged in and I have logged into some other account of mine with some other email</p>
<p>that I almost never check...in order to post this..</p>

            If you have classic Skype installed, the first thing you should do is uninstall it. 
<br />
<br />This will make the new Skype for Windows 10 the default. 
<br />
<br />Also try the following:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Skype
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates

<h3> steveyv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Forefront Client Security</h2>
                    My old laptop contains two security programs: Avast (free download) and Microsoft Forefront Client Security (It just appeared one day, don't know where it came from). The MSFCS really burdens my processor slowing the computer down quite a bit. Should I
 keep it to run along with the Avast or am I okay dumping it.?Prior to it appearing I believe the Avast did a fine job for me.

            The issue with performance is due to running two real time Anti-Virus (Avast and Forefront). You should remove either one. Forefront won't come up out of blue and you should approve to install something, my guess is that if you are part of orginisation,
 your company using Forefront and remotely install it , if that is the case, then contact your IT department.

<h2>            Cortana voice recognition not working</h2>
                    <p>I am in Australia and have had issues with Cortana for months.&nbsp; The "Hey Cortana" function is not available and it will not learn my voice, even though I have downloaded the Australian language pack (including speech).&nbsp; It also has issues allowing me to
 configure my microphone on a Surface Pro 4, even though all the hardware is working fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; To me, Cortana seems to have a long way to go before it will be any good.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I bet it is your mic..... <br />
<br />
More methods you should use :<br />
<br />
Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
<br />
Note if that shows uncorrected errors - continue regardless.<br />
<br />
When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - continue regardless.<br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Be sure you are running the latest available <strong>BIOS, Chipset Drivers&nbsp;</strong>and
<strong>The major drivers</strong>.<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
To better assist you, we would like to know the following information: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does this issue only occur when opening games via Steam?</li><li>Does it occur for all your downloaded games?</li><li>Did you make any recent system changes? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, kindly download and install any pending updates that need to be installed on the computer through Windows Update and check if it helps resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to restore from a system restore point. This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Refer to the Restore from a system restore point on the following link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>We recommend that you perform <strong>clean boot</strong> and then try to open downloaded programs again. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software and driver conflicts.
 For steps on how to perform a clean boot, check the following link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you also performed <strong>System Restore</strong>? If you have already restored from a system restore point, kindly try restoring again from an earlier date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you can reset your PC. This is equivalent to reinstalling Windows. However, it
<span>lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them. Kindly refer to the
</span><strong>Reset this PC</strong> section on the following link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery options in Windows 10</a>.<br />
<br />
Note: Resetting your PC will remove <span>apps and drivers you installed,
</span><span>changes you made to settings, and
</span><span>any apps your PC manufacturer installed. (If your PC came with&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;10, apps from your PC manufacturer will be reinstalled.)</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to be quick at power on/startup to Boot into BIOS by pressing the required Keys.</p>
<p>It normally flashes on the bottom of the screen at&nbsp;power on&nbsp;as to what Key/s to press.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting into BIOS to change Boot Order, Settings, etc&nbsp;happens before Booting into Windows occurs, so there is no way to enter BIOS from within Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about the BIOS of your machine, contact the Motherboard Manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            Two possible solution<br />1 aspect ratio/zoom on the tv, some TVs have settings where you can adjust the aspect ratio depending on the manufacturer if you go thru the settings and find those particular things you can get the whole picture on your screen.<br />2 you can adjust the display setting on the laptop, right click the desktop and go through the display settings adjust custom scaling and hopefully that resolves your problem.<br /><br />The problem you are experiencing is call overscan and if you google the model of your tv they will likely have a solution already figured out<br /><br /><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.maketecheasier.com/fix-overscan-on-tv/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.maketecheasier...</a><br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Yomi Thomas<br /><br />Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

1 aspect ratio/zoom on the tv, some TVs have settings where you can adjust the aspect ratio depending on the manufacturer if you go thru the settings and find those particular things you can get the whole picture on your screen.<br />
2 you can adjust the display setting on the laptop, right click the desktop and go through the display settings adjust custom scaling and hopefully that resolves your problem.<br />
<br />
The problem you are experiencing is call overscan and if you google the model of your tv they will likely have a solution already figured out<br />

<p>Thank you very much for response. Have tried all suggested without success maybe due to age of TV. Wanted to do it to display photographs but can use alternative of putting them on a USB memory stick and inserting that in&nbsp; TV.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

                    <span>We used to have a family pack on the Xbox 360.</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Microsoft disbanded this and our family pack was split in to 2 adult and 3 child accounts.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>2 of my child accounts and unable to login to our xbox one.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>On the Xbox one, it asks me to login as a parent account to accept the terms of use for the child accounts.</span></div>
<div><span>I log in as a parent and it tells me that it will charge my card $0.50.</span></div>
<div><span>It then asks me to add a card, I try but it says that card is already on my account so I can not continue.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I tried to accept the terms of use on a PC.</span></div>
<div><span>I log in with my child account, it asks me to login as an adult to accept the terms of use.</span></div>
<div><span>I log in as an adult but am told I can not continue with the child account.</span></div>
<div><span>I get the message 'This Account is missing a full name or birthdate' so I can not continue.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Xbox support tell me that my child accounts are in a different region (?!) and I need to change them by logging in to account.live.com which I am unable to do as I get stuck in the loop above.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I've loved xbox over the years, but this issue appears to be going nowhere at all.</span></div>
<div><span>Is very frustrating that support have asked me to log this issue on a forum!</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Please can someone help</span></div>

<h2>            Unable to open COM1. Please check your port settings,,,XP SP3</h2>
                    <span><br />
                    <span><br />
Hello,<br />
</span>I have some XP SP3 workstations that are utilized in the plant.&nbsp; The Load shell is attached to COM1.&nbsp; When I test the unit to make sure all devices work, the Load shell test will not open COM1.&nbsp; When I use Hyper Terminal to test COM1, I get the message
 "Unable to open COM1. Please check your port settings."&nbsp; I've checked the BIOS of a working station and compare it to the non-working station.&nbsp; All information matches correctly.&nbsp; When I check COM1 property resources, the problem station looks identical to
 the good station, and not conflicts.&nbsp; IRQ 04 is the current setting.&nbsp; To get the reemerged workstation to open COM1, I open COM1 properties, resource tab,
<b>un-check</b> then re-check the "<b>Use automatic settings</b>" box with out applying the un-check status.&nbsp; After re-checking the "Use automatic settings", I click OK.&nbsp; I then go back to see what the settings are.&nbsp; It has changed to IRQ 07.&nbsp; This change works
 until the workstation has been <b><span>rebooted</span></b> then these steps have to be applied again.&nbsp; Also, if I perform these same steps on a workstation, I get the same results with the IRQ change.&nbsp; I do not have the problem with any com ports except COM1.&nbsp;
 We're using canned software.&nbsp; Changing to use a different com port is not an option.<br />
<p><br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
MANISH</p>

    <title>Edge Browser tab tear-off functionality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pabloinla1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge Browser tab tear-off functionality</h2>
                    <p>In all browsers up to Edge, including IE10, I could click on a tab, drag it to another monitor, drop it and it will open there. Then when I want to return the tab the original browser I could do the same click, drag and drop in reverse to recombine the tab
 to the main browser.</p>
<p>I often want to research using multiple tabs, multiple monitors. EDGE seems to have gone backwards, being released before these now BASIC functions are working. Please fix this weakness in EDGE!</p>
<p>Also, as found in other threads, we all need to be able to go back several pages as we can with IE10, with Firefox, with Chrome, by right-clicking on the back arrow and choosing which page we wish to go back to. This feature has become quite necessary for
 various reasons in browsing. I don't need to justify the need, please! Again, p0lease restore this needed functionality in EDGE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without these functions, EDGE does not provide the needed abilities found in competitive browsers. I have to use other browsers for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there are plans to release improvements for EDGE including those mentioned above! Thank you!</p>

</p><blockquote>Disk Cleanup says that I have 3.99 TB of Windows Update files to be cleaned off of a 256 Gig solid state drive.&nbsp; How is this possible and what can I do about it?
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>After reading all 7 pages of the replies, I decided to post the best answer I found:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.askvg.com/windows-10-bug-windows-update-files-taking-3-99-tb-space-in-disk-cleanup/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like Windows is just doing it's thing.&nbsp; AskVG has been around a long time and is quite amazing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I proceeded to run Disk Cleanup with the 3.99TB of Windows Update Files to be cleaned.&nbsp; The progress bar reached 100% after just 3 minutes (SSD with M2 connection) but Disk Cleanup did not finish.&nbsp; After waiting 4 more minutes with the CPU and memory almost
 maxed out the whole time, I closed Disk Cleanup and started it again.&nbsp; The Windows Update Files were not listed to be cleaned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, this will be fixed in a future&nbsp;update as someone else mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like I usually start at the end of the question and answer sessions and work my way backwards to find an answer.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; EW</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This is a new instance, after the previous one was fixed, which appears in 14393.953. Added this time it may indeed not just be cosmetic as there have been a few reports of It causing "Inaccessible Boot Device" which is a very serious issue.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we will know very soon how serious this issue is.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reporting!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<p>No, it is not yet been fixed !</p>
<p>To-day I ran the Disk-cleanup and am enclosing the pic.</p>
<p>In pursuit of profits, Microsoft seems to have employed engineers of dubious merit, even in forums, they are not able to read the questions, they give readymade answers that don't help anyone.</p>
<p>Till they have monopoly, this will continue, I think.</p>

<p><span>Microsoft </span><em><br />
</em><span>1)</span><em><span>“the display of 3.99T is just a calculation error”</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hardly so. Others said “a cosmetic issue”. Hardly so. It is a very serious issue — the intent of the virus creator(s). Yes, I strongly believe it is a
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>virus</span></span><span>. Users still waste a lot of time — I am referring to all those who haven’t discovered these Microsoft forums dedicated to the
</span><em><span>KGB 3.99TB </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>virus</span></span></em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
“Calculation errors” or “cosmetic issues” should be </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>very easily</span></span><span> solved by programmers who deal with such a complex undertaking as an operating system. Viruses, on the other hand, are
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>very difficult</span></span><span> to solve.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2) </span><em><span>“we have fixed this in the Creators update”</span></em></p>
<p><span>The same statement was made before. In reality, the issue was not fixed. It was only
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>hidden</span></span><span> in the
</span><em><span>KB3211320</span></em><span> update. The </span><em><span>Windows Update Cleanup</span></em><span> was simply hidden in the
</span><em><span>Disk Cleanup</span></em><span> utility. I used a third-party utility that found over one gigabyte of files that had to be removed. Those files were unnecessary, I allowed the utility to delete them — my PCs worked with no problem thereafter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I posted earlier, the </span><em><span>KB4013429</span></em><span> (</span><em><span>Pie Day</span></em><span>, 3.14, 2017) update brought back the
</span><em><span>KGB </span><strong><span>3.99TB</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>monster</span></span></strong></em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.
</span></span><span>But NOT for all computers. I have two desktops and one laptop. Apparently, this virus behaves the same way as the original Windows 10 upgrade (July 2015).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) The laptop was upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1. The Windows 10 upgrade of July 2015 went smoothly, without any problem. Again, the
</span><em><span>KB4013429</span></em><span> (</span><em><span>Pie Day</span></em><span>, 3.14, 2017) update did not affect my laptop… apparently. The
</span><em><span>Disk Cleanup, Clean up System Files,</span></em><span> does not show the dreadful
</span><em><span>3.99 TB</span></em><span>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2) The two desktops were upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. They were affected by the Windows 10 upgrade of July 2015. There was no
</span><em><span>Start</span></em><span> button, no </span><em><span>Cortana</span></em><span>, no
</span><em><span>Notifications</span></em><span> button, etc. Similarly, the </span>
<em><span>KB4013429</span></em><span> (</span><em><span>Pie Day</span></em><span>, 3.14, 2017) update brought back the
</span><em><span>KGB </span><strong><span>3.99TB</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>virus</span></span></strong></em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do wish Microsoft good luck in solving this grave issue. (I know what the Russians can do… BRRRRRRRRAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!)</span></p>
<p><span>Seriously, now. I do need my computers work properly, instead of making me waste a lot of time… and nerves.</span></p>

<p>Axiomatic Ones:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good news… again? The March 20, 2017 update <strong>KB4015438</strong> (OS Build 14393.969) apparently fixed the dreadful
<em>KGB <strong>3.99TB</strong></em> issue/virus. The lengthy update no longer shows
<em>3.99 TB</em> in <em>Disk Cleanup, Clean up System Files</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, the ghost will never come back — I mean, NEVER!<br />
<br />
The last time it disappeared (February), I suspected it maybe hid the <em>Windows Update Cleanup</em>. Because I did a disk cleanup in a third-party utility and it found at least 1 GB of files that should have been deleted
<strong>KB4015438</strong> update, I used the same third-party utility again. This time around, the utility found 2 GB of extra files that I deleted. In both cases, my PCs functioned normally after the extra deletions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be the end of this ghost story that started in the month of <em>Shocktober</em> 2016. C’mon, Mixcrosoft! If it was meant to be a joke — it was a bad one. If it was a real problem, your programmers are much better than that. They should have fixed
 the problem in a month, in the first update of November 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, the nightmare is over now. People lost a lot of time waiting for the completion of a much-needed, yet benign, computer operation…</p>

            <p>It is a nightmare! Just released today, <strong>KB4015217 </strong>(OS Build 14393.1066) brought the bug back, although in a different form. The
<em>Disk Cleanup</em> no longer reports 3.99 TB for <em>Windows Update</em> (in <em>
Clean up system files</em>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I reported in my previous post, <em>Windows Update Cleanup </em>did not show up in the report. Now, it shows up again, but reports a reasonable figure. It was 54 MB on my desktop. I was glad to see that. My joy didn’t last long. I did a
<em>Disk Cleanup</em>. I saw <em>Windows Update Cleanup</em> quite early in the operation (visually estimated some 25% of the progress bar). During the<em> 3.99 TB</em> debacle, the
<em>Windows Update Cleanup </em>was at the end of the progress bar — and stuck there. Now, the operation stuck again at the 25% mark. I waited 40 minutes, but the progress bar did NOT move.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I resorted to the same trick as in the case of the<em> 3.99 TB</em> virus. I canceled the
<em>Disk Cleanup</em> operation and I restarted the computer. I checked <em>Disk Cleanup</em> again, including the
<em>Clean up system files</em>. The <em>Windows Update Cleanup </em>no longer was there. Actually, the
<em>Disk Cleanup</em> did the operation. But there is a bug in the <em>Windows Update Cleanup</em> function that prevents the operation to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it possible for a company of the magnitude of Microsoft to be so blind? The management should know the programming team responsible for that function. If Microsoft already fired the culprits, other engineers should read the source code and fix the
 severe issue. Why is it so hard to fix an issue introduced in October 2016? Go back to the archives and find the older function, the last one that worked correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop did not encounter this problem. Or, maybe the <em>Windows Update Cleanup</em> was hidden. I use a third-party utility for disk cleanup. Unfortunately, it does not clean up the
<em>Windows Update</em> backup files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two desktops were upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. They were affected by the Windows 10 upgrade of July 2015. The laptop was upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1. The Windows 10 upgrade of July 2015 went smoothly, without any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A curious thing is that this update is a lower number (KB4015217), so it appears to be older than the previous one (KB4015438). Does it make sense? It doesn’t. And makes no sense to have different behaviors on different computers. The update is the same:
 KB4015217.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 BSOD after Upgrade from Win 7 Home Prem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjblodg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD after Upgrade from Win 7 Home Prem</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with my Toshiba Portege Z935-300. I had Windows 7 Home Prem installed and recently upgraded to Win 10. I had a lot of problems getting it to work in the first place. It took me several days because the install would download 3 GB, try
 to install, get most of the way done with the Win 10 update, then throw a BAD_POOL_HEADER or BAD_POOL_CALLER error and revert the OS back to Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried disabling McAfee Virusscan but that didn't help (the latest 8.8 ver or whatever it was that is Win 10 compatible). I eventually uninstalled McAfee completely and was able to complete the upgrade so it boots to Win 10 now. However, I constantly get
 BSOD with BAD_POOL_xxx errors again upon booting up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The &nbsp;machine will usually boot to the login screen and once I have logged in, it would BSOD seconds or minutes later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have isolated the issue to a probable network adapter conflict. If I disable (in device manager) both the wired (Intel&nbsp;82579v) and wireless (Centrino N 2230) adapters, the machine will boot and stay up indefinitely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go back in to Safe Mode with Networking (as I'm logged in now), I can use the network adapters just fine. If I boot in normal mode with the adapters disabled it works fine. If I enable one of the adapters (wireless or wired), the machine will BSOD usually
 within seconds or a minute or two later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the latest version of the Intel drivers directly from Intel to no avail.</p>
<p>

<p><strong>I just purchased a 2 TB hd for one of My computers because the 200 gb one was too small. &nbsp;I am running Ubuntu as well as xp on it. &nbsp;I have partitioned it to a partition size of about 981 GB for the windows xp partition but the system recovery disks
 that I made when the computer was new will not install the os or anything else. &nbsp;The discs did work before, but the motherboard has been replaced a couple times, not sure if that makes a difference. &nbsp;Is there a maximum size that windows xp will work with as

<p>The motherboard will make a difference as the recovery CDs you have will be designed to work on the original system only, i.e. motherboard, processor, IDE or S-ATA hard disk drive, etc. &nbsp;Windows XP if using the NTFS file system supports a maximum of 2 Terabytes
 (currently), source:&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc938432.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc938432.aspx</a></p>
<p>Also you will have a problem with using recovery CDs when there is an existing Ubuntu installation on the hard disk as the recovery CDs will try and use the entire volume.</p>

                    The Windows Live Mail e-mail client (e-mail program) purports to support blocking of individual e-mail addresses or domains.&nbsp; But when I try to enter something like *.info as a domain (meaning that I want to block any address from dot-info), the program
 won't let me do it.&nbsp; What is the proper procedure, please?

            <p>Hi again Jim.</p>
<p>The <em>Blocked senders </em>feature of WLMail is a bit limited, and judging by the complaints about it here in the forums, it doesn't work very well. You can ostensibly block individual sender addresses, you can block some domains (e.g. spam.com, junk.org)
 but not others (e.g. hotmail.ca, gmail.com) and you can block country-specific Top-Level Domains (e.g. .cn, .ru) but not other TLDs (e.g. .com, .info).</p>
<p>For a POP3 account, you could use a message rule to, say, not download messages where the sender's address contains ".info". The
<em>Message rules </em>dialogue is accessed via a button on the <em>Folders </em>
tab. </p>
<p>You could apply a similar rule in webmail for HTTP or IMAP accounts, where the server allows rules like this.</p>
<p>I find that the <em>Safe list only </em>option works best. Then only mail from safe senders (and contacts, with that option selected) gets to the inbox and everything else is consigned to junk, where it's quickly dealt with.
</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
