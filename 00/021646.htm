<h2>            Multilevel list styles lose indents</h2>
                    I have seen this happen consistently in documents but am not sure if is one of those "by desgin" things.<br />
<br />
I define a multi level bulleted list.&nbsp; No problems so far; the list looks great and indents are where I want them.&nbsp; Such as below.&nbsp; I have used dashes instead of bullets for the purposes of posting to this board.&nbsp; I have saved this format as a style in my document.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;-item 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sub item 1.1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sub item 1.2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sub item 1.2<br />
-item 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sub item 2.1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sub item 2.2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sub item 2.2.1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sub item 2.2.2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sub item 2.2.3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sub item 2.2<br />
<br />
Now, lets say I decide I would like to make a change to the multi-level list style.&nbsp; Change the bullets, or even the indent spacing.&nbsp; As soon as I touch this feature, it does save the new definition and update the style, any place in the document using this
 style loses all of its indenting.&nbsp; The list goes left justified such as below.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;-item 1<br />
-sub item 1.1<br />
-sub item 1.2<br />
-sub item 1.2<br />
-item 2<br />
-sub item 2.1<br />
-sub item 2.2<br />
-sub item 2.2.1<br />
-sub item 2.2.2<br />
-sub item 2.2.3<br />
-sub item 2.2<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how and if I can avoid this behaviour?<br />
<br />
Thanks/<br />

            Are you using the same paragraph style for all list levels?&nbsp; If you modify one of the paragraph indents and then update the style, the settings for that level will apply to all levels.&nbsp; Instead, adjust the indents for each level-- or change the number/bullet
 style-- in the define new multilevel list dialog and leave the paragraph style settings alone (zero indent).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Better still, link each number level to a different paragraph style, such as the built-in List Bullet series for&nbsp; regular text or the built-in Heading series.<br />
<br />
You don't mention autonumbering in your post, but if that's what you want, instead of bullets, linking a different style to each number level gives more reliable results.<br />

            Ruwin.B, in the latest version I keep toggling to 'do not show my presence" and it's enough to minimize/maximize that the toggle goes back to the 'show' default. This is very annoying -- just me, or is this MS insisting that we be public at all costs?
 I just want the toggle to stay put forever, across PC and phone.

<p>Hi Ruwin,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that I need to put my phone into invisible mode first then toggle the 'do not share my presence' toggle to on so it is green.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it stays on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i did it the other way around it keep toggling back off.&nbsp;</p>

            Paul, how do you set the invisible mode on the phone? In the new interface if I click the 'bell' icon I only see the 'turn notifications off' icon, and that is not the same as being invisible. If I look into the menu, the 'show my presence to others' is
 turned off. And still the PC version doesn't keep the setting (I just tried).

<p>Hi, this doesn't work as there is only an option to select 'Do not share my presence' but even that switches itself back to showing the presence all the time - quite violating really... no privacy!</p>

<p>Hi Kent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern. However, we acknowledge that the first CD&nbsp;rip worked fine and you are facing issue with second CD rip. Could you please check and let us know, if you are&nbsp;facing&nbsp;similar issue&nbsp;with different CD album other than the second CD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend you to follow the methods mentioned below to convert oriental language displayed to English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open <strong>Windows Media Player</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Right click on the album cover and select <strong>Find album info</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Check if you are able to find the album information on right pane.</p>
<p>4. If yes, select the right album from the results and click on <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>Finish</strong> and check if it gets updated.</p>
<p>

    <title>Voice transcription for PowerPoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pauljobe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Voice transcription for PowerPoint</h2>
                    Rather than a question, this is a combined question and idea for a product enhancement for PowerPoint. &nbsp;I give a lot of presentations, and get a lot of slides from peers, and a huge frustration can be creation of, &nbsp;inadequacy of, or complete absence of
 slide notes for each individual slide. &nbsp;Recording oneself, then transcribing the speech into the notes section below each slide is a huge and cumbersome pain in the neck process. &nbsp;Is there a way to build in a voice transcription for PowerPoint, so that once
 slides have been finalized, a presenter can sit at his/her desk and run through the presentation as they would in front of an audience, and have their "verbage" transcribed into the slide notes for each individual slide? &nbsp;When it is all said and done, quite
 literally, each slide would have the presenter's intended message captured, so that he or she doesn't have to go through and type out everything they were planning to say. &nbsp;This would provide absolutely immeasurable time savings, as well as true knowledge
 sharing, as the intended message would be communicated, rather than simply what someone took down in notes. &nbsp;Quite often, note taking, even at its best, can distract the note-taker from what the presenter is continuing to say.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is an enhancement I would greatly welcome in PowerPoint.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers!</div>

    <title>N93 Display Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pacmania1982  say:</h3>
<h2>            N93 Display Problem</h2>
                    Hi guys:<br />
<br />
I'm posting this message in hopes that someone out there will be able to give me a hand with my N93.<br />
<br />
I'll start the story RIGHT from the begining and in future will send people back to this location to read it as I'm fed up repeating it to different people.<br />
<br />
Approx 1 month ago, my sister received some fans on eBay she had bought, but was away, so I thought I would take a pic and MMS it to her. I turned the phone into photo mode and took the a couple of pics, then chose the send picture icon from the camera screen.
 It went into the MMS editor, so I then turned the phone back to portrait mode to start to type in some text. Here's where the problem started. The phone I thought had got 'stuck' in landscape mode. So I thought I'd do a restart. The outside screen turned on,
 displayed Nokia, then the internal screen turned on, the Nokia hands with the familiar ding ding ding ding ding. Finally - to the active standby screen. Cool I thought, just a glitch. I work in IT, I know these things sometimes happen. A couple of seconds
 later, the screen rotates landscape again but opens up the camera. I think it must somehow have remembered I had the camera open before, so ignore this and exit the camera application...The screen stays landscape. OK - so I want to send the picture to my sister,
 I'll struggle texting with the display in landscape. I go to the Images folder on my memory card, and then send via mms. Again the MMS editor opens and I start to try to type in some text. The keypad doesn't work again. Whats going on??! Perhaps one of the
 apps I had installed had messed it up (at the time only the Gmail, Google Maps and Opera 4 Beta), I'd to a full reset - so I tried, but I couldn't enter the pin code as the keypad didn't work. I'd updated the firmware a few months previous to all of my problems
 and, I had backed everything up so I thought I would try again. I connected up the N93 to my PC, downloaded the phone software updater and started the process. It wasn't as scary as it was the first time I did it as its a relatively pain free (or what I thought
 painfree) process. It recognized the phone, downloaded the update then started to install. Nothing to do now but sit back and wait for it to finish. About 5 mins later panic set in...The firmware updater told me an error had occured. It suggested removing
 the battery and power cable on the phone, then put the battery back in and the power cable back in and reconnect the USB cable. So I did it. Once again the firmware updater recognized the phone, and proceeded to install the firmware again. 5 mins later, the
 same thing happened. I tried what it suggested again, but same problem. Damn! I disconnected it, left it a while and tried again, but didn't have much faith. Yes, it did it once more. So now when turning the phone on, it did nothing. The external screen lit
 up, but no Nokia logo. So I was thinking perhaps the phones ROM couldn't find a boot image as it hadn't been written properly. I browsed the Nokia website for a local repair center and took it there. I explained what had happened, and they said that it was
 covered by a 25 month warranty. I got it in September 2006, and was covered until November 08. Great I thought, they took down my details and then asked me to phone the following Monday to see the status of the repair. I called up to find out if my phone was
 ready, it was. Hurrah I thought, they'd somehow forced the firmware to load. I asked when I could collect it and they said at lunch time. So I asked if it was fixed, 'No sir, the engineer has stated that there is liquid damage and is therefore not covered
 by the warranty'. ??! So we've gone from a software problem to a hardware problem now. I go back to the store during my lunch break and collect my phone. I ask to speak to the engineer who looked at the phone. I asked him to show me the liquid damage. He removed
 the housing from behind the main display and pointed to something. OK - so I'm no phone technician but I couldn't see anything. He states that it probably got wet some time ago, but water is like acid and doesn't break the phone immediately, but over time.
 He's bullsh*tting me now...I try to keep calm as the closest my phone has ever come to water was when I left it in my bag on the shore when diving one day. It has been my pride and joy for so long I have kept it in very good condition and away from anything
 that could have damaged it. Besides - this was a software issue initially...why on earth did he have to open the phone up in the first place? Surely he could see that yes, the phone turned on, but couldn't see any firmware to load and just sat there? Oh they
 do it to cover themselves. Ok I thought, perhaps they do check as not everyone is so honest when they send in their phones. So anyway - I get the phone back and its useless to me again.<br />
<br />
A co-worker who went with me to pick up my phone can't believe what he is hearing either. He then offers to take my phone to another repair guy he once used who was very good. He looks at it, and tries to reinstall the firmware but no luck. He sends it 30 miles
 away for one of his co-workers to look at, he tries to reinstall the firmware, nothing.<br />
<br />
Finally - thinking my phone is a brick, I look on the Nokia website once more for some help. There is a freepost repair service that I can send my phone to for Nokia to fix. Brilliant - Nokia will know what to do! They'll see its a firmware issue, they'll reinstall
 the firmware. I phone them up to ask if my reinstalling the firmware and it failing would constitute voiding the warranty. The guy on the end of the phone states that no, sometimes it happens, but its 'most likely to be down to virus' on the PC and they get
 into the phone and cause problems'...As I stated earlier, I work in IT and have done for the last 9 years since I left school. I'm not saying I know everything about everything, but I know that PC Virus' can be transported from PC to PC via a phone if there
 was say an infected file on it, but a PC virus onto a phone? Come on! Its a different operating system and its a completely different architecture!!! I'm doubting any virus code designed for x86 PC's would run on an ARM chip. So I decide to sent it off anyway.<br />
<br />
So - the reason I'm posting this, is because yes Nokia did kindly reinstall the firmware. Hurrah I thought. But after a few seconds, the screen flips to landscape. It seems the original problem is back again. AND they have printed out a photo with an arror
 pointing at some resistor or something and a lable stating liquid damage. Now either the Authorized Repair Center updated some database I don't know about stating that my phone had a problem and how to find it, or they did look at the phone and find the this
 'liquid' damage.<br />
<br />
I just can't see how they say its liquid damage. I've been so careful with it. I can't see how its been working flawlessly since I received it last September to all of a sudden refuse to rotate the screen to portrait and for the keypad to stop working.<br />
<br />
OK. so the question I'm asking is...Is there anyone out there that can look at this video:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8twaFYswu0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8twaFYswu0</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/F8twaFYswu0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/F8twaFYswu0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div><br />
<br />
And give me any advice what to do except put it on eBay for spares. It looks like the S60 OS is booting up now, but there is some app that is launching at startup to activate the camera, then not gracefully quitting the app once you choose Exit. I can't seem
 to find any way to browse the filing system on my phone except the File Manager which doesn't show hidden files. I also can't install anything on the phone at the moment as whenever I try to transfer any software over via bluetooth it ask for a passcode and....you've
 guessed it....the keypad doesn't work, so I can't do it that way. I've tried doing it via USB but I get permission not authorized when I copy over any .sis or .sisx files.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading!<br />
<br />

            Quick update:<br />
<br />
I've just restarted my phone and the keypad works before the screen rotates, so I typed out *#0000# and found its running firmware 20.0.058<br />
<br />
Thought this might help and prove that the keypad isn't broken either.<br />

            I've got a similar problem with my N93. It occurred on Sat 29th September.<br />
<br />
I was using the phone in camera mode and then flipped it round to close. Since then it will only display in landscape and the camera modes no longer function.<br />
<br />
If you reboot, then for a brief few seconds it starts up in Portrait mode and then rotates to the landscape mode.<br />
<br />
The phone is pretty much useless to me in this state.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            Has this worked for your phone? I have the same problem except that I am in the US and the Nokia US won't repair an EU Phone.<br />

<h2>            error code&#58; 8004883</h2>
                    <p>I'm so frustrated with this Windows 8 Phone, I regret ever giving Microsoft a chance on this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like everyone else, I'm having many issues. I keep getting messages that phone storage is low, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>After freeing up what I could, phone storage reads: music 98 MB, apps 220MB, <strong>
<u>Other 784 MB</u></strong>, system 158 GB, free 868 MG. </li><li>Everytime I attempt to download an app or even just update a couple already installed, I get a message:
<strong>Error Code 8004883.</strong> Nothing happens. I've searched this code on all the sites I can find without a match.
</li><li>Using phone on my wireless network so connectivity not an issue. </li><li>I have re-formated the SD card, did not resolve anything. I was able to save music, pictures, and videos to the card before reformatiing so I dont think there anything wrong with it. There appears to be no way to move anything from the phone to the SD card
 - only save new music, pictures or video... What sense does that make?</li></ul>
<p>So this "smart" phone does not even do anything as well as the cheapest cell phone&nbsp;of&nbsp;5 years ago. Had I realized Microsoft doesn't even&nbsp;offer much real support, I'd have never bought its product. Its not the phone (Huawei) becuase i'm reading of these same
 problems across different brands of Windows phones. So I'm hoping someone will have answers, otherwise I'm going to get busy writing letters and making phone calls. When I pay for a product, I expect it to work or my money to be refunded - I don't expect to
 spend hours and hours researching its problems over the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the kind soul who may be able to help me, please excuse my frustration (sorry, anger). Just tired of dealing with tech problems from a product I'd thought would be reliable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got the same issue and I just needed to complete the info of the Xbox profile to access to Marketplace. Then once completed, they told me to restart the phone and it was working.</p>

<p>Diego,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for fast reply. In fact, I have already reinstalled all the apps (I did check and the entire office suite was gone!) though it took 20 -30 minutes, and now the reinstallation is complete everything appears normal - as if the problem never
 happened. It was a very scary moment as I have to travel to clients tomorrow and things were looking very bad indeed,</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

    <title>WMDC Outlook 2003 and HTC PRO2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ffrikki  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMDC Outlook 2003 and HTC PRO2</h2>
                    I hope someone can help as following hours wading through the Internet and even more hours playing with my PC I am just not having any luck. &nbsp;Situation is this, brand new HTC PRO2 and recently upgraded Windows 7 PC (From XP Pro) using Outlook 2003, have
 downloaded WMDC. &nbsp;It just does not sync with a very generic statement saying "ActiveSync encountered a problem on the desktop" from WMDC and the phone advising "ActiveSync encountered a problem on the desktop, code 0x85010014". &nbsp;Short of re-installing the
 OS I have carried out the following:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Set the USB connection to turn off faster data synchronisation </li><li>Uninstalled and reinstalled WMDC </li><li>Uninstalled, deleted old .pst files and reinstalled Outlook 2003 </li><li>Run Detect and Repair </li><li>Run scanpost </li><li>Run a command to re install the mapi32.dll </li></ul>
<div>And still absolutely nothing! &nbsp;I am pretty sure the problem is with my Outlook installation but have hit a block with investigating thsi any further and the fact that I have un installed and re installed the application would make me think any problems
 should be solved.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really am tearing my hair out with this now and would appreciate any help new innovative help which hopefully will stop me wanting to throw everything away. &nbsp;One thought, if I upgraded to Office 2007 would this solve the problem? &nbsp;I would be willing
 to do it but only if everything worked OK. &nbsp;I tried to download the 60 day trial software from online but halfway through installation it requested a CD to be inserted - which obviously I didnt have!!</div>
<div><br />

            Rikki, I have the exact same problem and I think that many other users have the same frustrating problem.<br />
<br />
See my previous post http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsmobileactivesync/thread/3139b9ba-1038-4fce-858b-0f305df68a5a for further details.&nbsp; I frequently check the forums to see if anyone has posted a solution to this problem as there are many other
 threads. See http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/windowsmobile<br />
<br />
I upgraded to Windows 7 about two weeks ago and since then, my HTC Touch Pro 2 will not sync.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have wasted numerous hours/days trying to get the Generic RNDIS driver to install properly.&nbsp; I tried everything and have finially given up.&nbsp; I was thinking about restoring my system back to Vista as their was no problems syncing with the phone with Vista.<br />
<br />
Microsoft need to get there act together or they risk alienating users migrating to Windows 7.<br />

<p>Try running Office Diagnostics (or Detect and Repair) to fix any error in Outlook.&nbsp; If that does not help, then the "standard" fix that has helped many folks out is ifyou are seeing the error 85010014 (a general error) then try uninstalling
 and reinstalling Outlook. The error in ActiveSync is actually from the Outlook APIs.</p>

<br />
I see that you have tried the correct troubleshooting steps to solve your issue. However, it is advised to always installed Outlook first, then WMDC. Therefore, I recommend that you uninstall WMDC and Outlook and restart your computer. If you have an existing
 partnership on the device, remove it and restart.<br />
<br />
Install Outlook first and link it to your PST file. Do not re-install WMDC. Connect your device to the computer and Windows 7 will use Windows Update to download and install it for you. This will take some time before you see some activity on the screen.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps.<br />
<br />

Here are some tips on using MODI. Although some of them are for 2003, or 2010, the general process is the same<br />
<br />
Adding MODI to Office 2007
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-office_install/installing-microsoft-document-image-writer-in/2d979d2a-3294-44dc-8cfa-6fedc7423669"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-office_install/installing-microsoft-document-image-writer-in/2d979d2a-3294-44dc-8cfa-6fedc7423669</span></a></p>
<p><span>MODI is still part of Office 2007, but not installed by default. You can get it by doing a custom installation of the MS Tools. Make sure to “uncheck” everything but Tools, or you’ll be installing all of Office.<br />
**********<br />
MODI works, MODI Writer is missing, that's the difference.</span></p>
<br />

    <title>Nokia N73 Black - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farmski---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N73 Black</h2>
                    i recived an N73 Black phone from orange...<br />
<br />
i was under the understanding that the N73 in the BLACK is infact the music edition!!<br />
is this correct???<br />
<br />
has the standard N73 been bough out in black??<br />
<br />
my nokia n73 has none of the aditional features of the n73 music edition..<br />
<br />
the prduct codes etc under the battery are as follows..<br />
<br />
<br />
Type. RM-133<br />
Model: N73-1<br />
<br />
Code: 0546349<br />
FCC ID QF XRM-133<br />
IC: 66 1z_RM133<br />
<br />
is this the standard edition or is it the music edition??<br />
<br />
when i update the software via the Nokia N73 updater wich works for both N7 and the N73 music edition it doesnt update it to the music edition..<br />
<br />
i uderstand that this works by retrieving the Product code from the phones memory and retrieving the update pending on what the phone model is..<br />
<br />
but even tho the phone is black.. it apparently seems to be the music edition.. and to what i understand.. N73-1 is the music edition.. and the code 0546349 which the updtaer uses to update the firmfare accordingly to product type is that of the N73 music edition!<br />
<br />
how can i get the aditional features of the music edition on my phone?? without invalidating my warrentee...<br />
<br />
as this is what i have payed for....<br />
<br />

            You can always change the product code to the stock ME and use the NSU, this however will result in the loss of guarantee.<br />

<h2>            Problem creating Sharepoint 2013 online bookmark to other bookmark in other web page or sub-page.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>i'm making a sharepoint 2013 webpage with user manual for the use of our entreprise website, but i can't creat bookmark (anchor) for a #tag in other webpage.</p>

<p>Exemple:</p>

<p>Created new webpage call "Geral.aspx" and tag a text somewhere in the webpage and call it "faqs"&nbsp;by making the creation of link from address.</p>
<p>Main Page, i've an image saying "FAQs" and i've configured like i was making a bookmark in the same page, but it gives me "page Not Found". Also tried to add the URL &nbsp;"...\Geral.aspx#faqs"&nbsp;of the other webpage with the bookmark at the end in the URL: field
 &nbsp;but only opens the webpage and is not going to the bookmark point. Also tried to and the link "&nbsp;...\Geral.aspx#faqs" in the "Bookmark" field, but it opens my Site Pages.</p>

<p>There is any solution to open other webpage and forward it to bookmark point that we want?</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>José Correia</p>

<p>Hi Jose,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When creating a bookmark pointing to another bookmark, we need to use the format:
<em>PageURL#bookmark</em>, like <em>Geral.aspx#faqs</em>.<br />
<br />
Regarding the situation, I suggestion you check if the bookmark <em>#faqs</em> is able to be visited from the same webpage.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I found an article on how to create bookmarks or anchors in Office 365:<br />
<a href="http://365.webbrewers.com/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create An FAQ Page For Your Office 365 Sharepoint 2013 Site</a><br />

    <title>Line spacing in Word 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidaustralia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Line spacing in Word 2011</h2>
                    Is there any way of of altering line spacing in Word 2011 without having to repeat this procedure continuously: &nbsp;
<div>1. &nbsp;Go to the 'Paragraph' dialog box. &nbsp;</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Select the spacing you THINK will work. &nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Click 'ok'. &nbsp;</div>
<div>4. &nbsp;Check effect. &nbsp;</div>
<div>5. &nbsp;If guess was out, go through steps 1-4 again &nbsp;..... and again, and again..... &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank-you. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Developers: &nbsp;Please add a 'slide' you can drag. &nbsp;As you drag the slide,</div>
<div>you SEE the lines closing up or opening out. &nbsp;It's much quicker and</div>
<div>it eliminates guess work. &nbsp;(eg. See Apple's program, 'Pages.') &nbsp; Thank-you. &nbsp;</div>

            You also have the alternative of vertical justification. Try it with different parameters (Space before, Space after, Line spacings). You'll find it in
<i>Format &gt; Document &gt; Layout</i>&nbsp;tab, and then <i>Vertical alignment</i>. The dropdown menu to its right controls the range where you'll apply it, so to do it only on select portions, you'll have to use Sections (see
<i>Insert &gt; Break</i> for various options).
<div><br />
<div>Are you up to installing macros? These will work with single paragraphs only. If you like them and want them to work on several paragraphs, its a simple fix. Let me know.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub IncreaseLS()</div>
<div>Selection.ParagraphFormat.LineSpacing = Selection.ParagraphFormat.LineSpacing + 1</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub DecreaseLS()</div>
<div>Selection.ParagraphFormat.LineSpacing = Selection.ParagraphFormat.LineSpacing - 1</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once you paste them in your macro editor (<i>Tools &gt; Macro &gt; Macros &gt; Edit</i>), you can assign them keyboard shortcuts through
<i>Tools &gt; Customize Keyboard</i>, choosing <i>Macros</i> on the left list and the above macros on the right list. (Most
<i>Control</i> combinations are available, like Control + and Control –. At any rate, Word will let you know if the combination you choose is already in use.)</div>

            Line spacing is a paragraph formatting attribute. As with any formatting, it's handled most precisely, most efficiently &amp; most consistently by the use of Paragraph Styles as opposed to applying individual direct changes throughout the document. If you're
 not familiar with the use of Styles you might want to review the information in Word Help on the topic:<span style="font-style: italic">Apply, change, create, or delete a style</span>.<br />

            Hi Lindsey,
<br />This is a bug and Microsoft is investigating. It should be fixed soon. 
<br />
<br />This is from the service advisory at <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/servicehealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/s...</a> 
<br />
<br />Users are unable to view the name of the sender within search results for the Outlook client.
<br />Latest message:
<br />Title: Sender name not appearing
<br />
<br />User Impact: Users are unable to view the name of the sender within search results for the Outlook client.
<br />
<br />More info: As a workaround, users can use Outlook on the web.
<br />
<br />Additionally, all email search results may appear as unread, even if the emails had been previously read.
<br />
<br />Current status: We've completed initial testing of the fix and we're preparing to deploy the solution to the affected infrastructure. We expect that the deployment process should begin within the next 24 hours.
<br />
<br />Scope of impact: This issue could potentially affect any of your users if they are routed through the affected infrastructure.
<br />
<br />Start time: Monday, January 7, 2019, at 7:37 AM UTC
<br />
<br />Preliminary root cause: A recent update inadvertently introduced an issue that is causing the sender name to not appear within the User Interface (UI) when performing a search. 
<br />
<br />Next update by: Wednesday, January 9, 2019, at 10:00 PM UTC       
        </p>

            If you purchased office 2013 online you will have been provided with a 'Redemption Key'. This is not the Product Key and can only be used once to install your office. If you are attempting to reinstall Office then you need to go to
<a href="https://stores.office.com/myaccount/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
My Office Account&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; You will need the email address and password you used when you first installed your office.

            The problem is that I purchased in on Ebay and there wasn't any Redemption Key. For about two years it was working perfectly fine and suddenly it told me the key isn't valid.

<p>
</p><p>okay, maybe I misunderstood what you actually meant by Redemption Key. Do you mean the product key for activating MS Office? As I said I got that but now after two years it suddenly was defined as not valid...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I forgot to say is that it was a "second hand" license of MS Office 2013 Professional Plus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I purchased a pirated copy then why was the product key accepted for so long?</p>

            <p>Yes, there is some confusion caused by Microsoft not explaining the difference between a Redemption Key and a Product Key. The Redemption Key can only be used once to redeem your office online. But keep it safe because it is your proof of licence. (Sometimes
 a Product Key is provided for example if Office is provide on a DVD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next question is what are you trying to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you first installed office 2013 you would have been prompted to enter the email address and password for a Microsoft Account. You can use that email address and password to access
<a href="https://stores.office.com/myaccount/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
My Office Account</a>&nbsp; which was setup when you first installed your office (Something else Microsoft forgot to tell you) You can reinstall office as many times as you like from your office account. You can also find the actual Product Key there as well.</p>

            <p>Ok, thanks for the information! Good to know ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that I installed it about two years ago, and all I had to do was to enter the product key. It worked fine for two years, but after there was some safety update for office the key was suddenly not valid anymore and I obviously can't use office
 because it says it's an unlicensed version. Office isn't registered with my MS Account. And if I tell the program to check for the key through internet it says it's not valid. I haven't tried to register it through telefone, but I believ that the result will
 be the same.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 64-bit displaying HTML as text.</h2>
                    Outlook is no longer displaying HTML messages in HTML format. This just started a week ago and I had not made any changes to Outlook. I have unchecked all the display boxes in the File-&gt;Options section and turned off all the Add-Ins and still no HTML.

<p>Hello Kevin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post in the forum. It is a known issue after updating to Version 1906 Build 11727.20210 that emails in your POP3 account are shown as Plain Text rather than HTML as expected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our related team was aware of it and the issue has been fixed in Version 1906 Build 11727.20230. Please check update to the latest version to fix it. Here is an article for your reference:

<p>Hello Dipal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know if you have finished migrating data from the original mail server to Office 365 cloud? If so, please let your admin set the MX record of your domain point to the Exchange Online Protection
 (EOP). And, it looks like: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt595791%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
&lt;domain&gt;.mail.protection.outlook.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when you complete the migration, you only need login to the Outlook client with your new Office 365 account via the Autodiscover service which will setup everything automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything is misunderstanding, feel free to let us know with the detailed information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>
        </p>
