<p>That means you have your keyboard set to the wrong country. &nbsp;In some countries (like the UK) the position of the @ and " marks are reversed (I don't know why Britain does things different from USA, that's just how it is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it, open up your Settings app, go to Time &amp; Language, then click Region &amp; Language on the left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the middle of the screen you'll see a line that says English, click that and then click the Options button that shows up. &nbsp;On the next page, you'll see your keyboard listed. &nbsp;Mine says "US QUERTY", for example. &nbsp;Click the +Add button to add the correct
 keyboard, and remove the wrong one from the list.</p>

<h2>            Windows will not boot.</h2>
                    I can't reach the Windows 10 desktop.&nbsp; Error messages scroll to fast to read, and go on for hours unless stopped.&nbsp; I can start the computer with a Ubuntu live CD, but it says the Windows system partition contains an "unclean file system."&nbsp; That means I
 can't mount the disk for farther troubleshooting.

            <p>The answer didn't address specifics, and may have been automatically generated.&nbsp; It asked if there was an error message.&nbsp; I already said there were multiple error messages, but they scroll by too fast to read, and do not provide useful information.&nbsp; When
 the operating system isn't started yet, usual tricks like pause and screen capture are not available.</p>
<p>In any case, I use Ubuntu by preference, and boot Windows only when a school assignment requires it.&nbsp; (I'm a student technician.)&nbsp; That means I haven't tried to start Windows in several days.</p>

            I asked about error message, to see whether by any change you observe any error code or warning, while you said you couldn't see the message because it was too fast. What you are saying is wrong, when Windows won't boot, you may still boot into BIOS and
 some case, it may open Windows Automatic Recovery.

            <p>I apologize for over-simplifying the situation.&nbsp; This computer is triple-boot: Windows 7, Windows 10, and Ubuntu.&nbsp; I focused on Windows 10, which is the one that won't start.&nbsp; When I select Ubuntu, it starts and runs normally.&nbsp; (This is my favorite OS, and
 I would use it for everything if I could.&nbsp; As an Information Technology student, I have assignments that require Windows.)</p>
<p>If I select Windows 7, the computer asks to run diagnostics on the partition that contains Windows 10.&nbsp; "Touch any key to cancel."&nbsp; If I cancel the diagnostics, Windows 7 starts and runs normally.&nbsp; If I allow the diagnostics to run, error messages start
 scrolling by fast, and I can't read them.&nbsp; This can go on an hour or more, until I force a shutdown with the power button.&nbsp; Nothing else works, ie: Esc, Alt-Ctrl-Delete, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If I select Windows 10, a mouse pointer appears on a black screen, and it hangs that way indefinitely.</p>
<p>I don't see any error messages in BIOS.&nbsp; This is legacy BIOS, not UEFI, so some information simply isn't there.</p>
<p>I know that multi-boot is challenging, but as a student it's a necessary evil.&nbsp; This computer is not powerful enough to run VMs without serious performance degradation.&nbsp;

            <p>It actually depends on which OS managing the booting. </p>
<p>If booting is being manage by Linux, then there would be a lot of problem, Linux is unable to handle boot well and normally it cause more problems. If you manage to boot into Windows, then create repair disk and boot with it and then try to repair your Windows
 boot.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure which OS is managing the boot.&nbsp; When my instructor helped me set it up, he said that first OS installed would be on the active partition, and contain the boot settings, including the option to start a different OS.&nbsp; If I'm right about that,
 Windows 7 is managing the boot, which is what I intended.&nbsp; Windows 7 is a mature, stable OS that rarely has a problem.</p>
<p>However, Ubuntu (which was installed last) is the default boot.&nbsp; (If I hit the start button and turn away for a minute or so, Ubuntu starts as if it was the only OS.)&nbsp; Before that, the boot options appear against a purple background, which experienced Linux
 users associate with Ubuntu.&nbsp; Does that mean Linux is managing the boot?</p>
<p>I can start Windows 7, but that doesn't allow me to create a Windows 10 repair disk.&nbsp; Windows 10 will not start.</p>

            If possible, would you mind post back screenshot of the booting menu, you may take phot and save it and when you reply to this message click on image icon on the top and upload it. Then I could say which one is managing your boot. As for Windows 10 issue,
 do you Windows 10 installer media?

                    I seem to have two Skype accounts. &nbsp;I would like to merge them into one. &nbsp;However, I am not sure of the user name associated with the second account. &nbsp;I really would like to talk to a person to resolve this issue as I have money in both accounts. &nbsp;How

<h2>            Keyboard not working properly</h2>
                    I have a computer that had several viruses, spyware, and malware&nbsp;cleaned out and now the only keys that work on the keyboard are the speciality keys. ie: mail, internet, calculator, etc. It is running Vista home Premium. One file infected was kbdclass.sys.
 The file on the machine is 38k in size. I have a laptop using the same OS and its file is 41k. Is this file my problem file?

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Scan your System&nbsp;to make sure that the Malware is removed:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>

<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />

<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />

<h2>            &#91;Win10 - b1809&#93; Regular network adapter disconnect - No network found</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the weekend of 30/11 a fresh Windows 10 Pro installation (b1803) was performed on my machine. Since that moment my network adapter randomly disconnects, usually after a period of inactivity and states that no network was found. My first assumption was
 that this was related to Power Management and this was disabled for both network adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/061b69ba-6295-45c9-b9b7-9caba0edbfb9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/061b69ba-6295-45c9-b9b7-9caba0edbfb9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This did not resolve the issue. The only way to enable / start up the adapter is by either physically plugging the cable out and back in or restarting the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternate solution would be to update the drivers, but this network adapter (RealTek 8122L) is part of an older motherboard (<a href="https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/P7P55DE_Deluxe/specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="ASUS website">Asus
 P7P55D-E Deluxe</a>). And for this model there are no Windows 10 drivers available from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea what is causing this and how this can be resolved? Any tips are greatly appreciated! (-:</p>
<p>

<p>- Updated title to include windows build number (OS build: 17763.134)</p>

<p>I also want to clarify that physically pulling the ethernet cable out and plugging it back in:</p>

<p>- in the second NIC slot immediately recognizes / triggers my network and internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition: when the 'network not found' issue has occurred, Windows will not properly shut down or restart. The Shutting Down/Restart animation keeps on spinning for 5 minutes before I manually force the system to shut down.</p>

<p>- Unchecked all checkboxes in the <strong>Power Management</strong> tab.</p>
<p>- Disabled both on-board LAN devices in motherboard's BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two hours later: network connection lost with a '<em>no network found</em> <em>
(!)</em>' message and again unable to shut down / restart the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes me believe this is not really a driver-related issue, but more of a Windows b1308 specific issue. Especially since this occurs on a network card that is supported with Win10 drivers.</p>
<p>

    <title>update 3000850 &#40;service pack&#63;&#41; failed- error code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph zorzin  say:</h3>
<h2>            update 3000850 &#40;service pack&#63;&#41; failed- error code C0000034- system wouldn&#39;t boot up- had to restore boot drive with Acronis backup program</h2>
                    <p>update 3000850 (service pack?) failed- error code C0000034- system wouldn't boot up- had to restore boot drive with Acronis backup program</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it in a nutshell. It blew up my system. After it tried to install this update- I saw a brief message that the update failed- I tried to restart- but the system wouldn't come up- I saw a black screen and "system starting" or something like that. But
 nothing happened. After about 15 minutes, I turned it off then back on and got nothing but a black screen with that error code. I kept trying with no luck. It trashed my boot drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't feel too bad because I have backups with Acronis True Image program- but I had trouble restoring with that- I did eventually, but it was a nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I later read the associated file at: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000850?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000850?wa=wsignin1.0</a> which says that there is a prerequisite- which is to install update 2919355.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, the update that failed is called the "November 2014 update rollup....." and the prerequisite is identified as a similar update from April 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why did this latest update not stop in its tracks if the older update wasn't installed? Rather than blow up my system!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updates set to manual - but what if it was set to automatic? Would it have tried to install the Nov. 2014 update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this Dell in November. I'm surprised that the update system hadn't seen the need for the April 2014 update and installed that prior to downloading the Nov. update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what now? Will it be safe to download the older April update, then try again with the November update?</p>
<p>Joe</p>

</p><p><span>It is unfortunate that you have issues with your computer after the update was applied and you were unable to boot the computer. You can change the update settings to manual as you have already.

<p>Niranjan, I appreciate very much that a MS support engineer is in this forum. Please stick with me until I get this really big problem resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why downloading the "stand-alone update package" for this particular update will be any different than what Win 8.1 automatically downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I will give a&nbsp; more&nbsp;detailed description of what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I'll back up some weeks. Several weeks ago, I a problem with MS updates- when it was set to download and install them automatically. One day there was 18 updates to install. Meanwhile, I also have Acronis True Image backup program installed- at that
 time it was setup to do a backup whenever I shutdown or restarted the computer. But, this failed to happen for the shutdown but I noticed one day it did succeed when I did a restart. So, for some reason, the backup program had trouble realizing that a shutdown
 was occurring. I presume the problem is with Acronis, not MS. I should have turned off the request for Acronis to do the backup that way. Then, when the 18 updates occurred- I let them install, then did a restart from the Win 8.1 Start screen. However, a problem
 occurred. Acronis first began by doing the update from the restart command- when I saw that, I thought, "oh no, this might cause a problem" and it did. The system tried restarted but failed- it just locked up- well, on the screen it just said, "restarting"
 but nothing seemed to be occurring- every several seconds I saw my hard drive light flash briefly - and the screen did NOT say, "do not turn off the system" as if often does during upgrades. So, after about 10 minutes- I powered down, then powered back up-
 this time, the system booted up but everything was running extremely slow- After I see he big Dell logo, I see a series of dots turning in a circle- but they were turning very slow- I knew I had a problem. Then when the Start screen came up, it was very slow.
 When I tried to open any windows- they would come up very slow. To get out of this dilemma, I finally realized that I should load a Restore Point which I&nbsp; had made a few days earlier. That fixed the problem. I then did the 18 upgrades one at a time, making
 another Restore Point after each- successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, a few days later I noticed this huge upgrade, which I presume is a service pack. (3000850). I don't usually read the associated web site for further information but this time I did, since I was now paranoid about MS updates. It warned that if it failed
 to not use a Restore Point made previous to the installation of the update. That really got my attention since I had used a Restore Point to get out of the previous problem. That file also said that there is a prerequisite, "you must install first update 2919355"
 (which goes back to April, 2014). Well, I didn't notice that after a quick reading. If that really is necessary, why didn't that update load into the update section of the operating system? Why did I get 3000850 first? This new Dell was purchased last November-
 when I first turned it on- I saw numerous updates and I've been installing them ever since, but I never saw &nbsp;2919355.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I went ahead and tried to install update 3000850. After it ran the process- I saw a message saying it failed- probably because 2919355 wasn't installed first. But, if my updates had still been on automatic, would the system have tried installing 3000850
 anyway? If so, who is responsible for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I then did a restart- but it wouldn't come up- the screen just said "restarting" but failed to restart- so after about 15 minutes, I powered down then back up- then I saw the error code "C0000034" followed by something like "on 291 of 33333"- those
 numbers I just made up since I didn't them down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 8.1 Recovery Disk- tried that- but I remembered that applying a Restore Point wouldn't work according to the MS associated file- but I didn't have that option anyway, because in the recovery options- when I asked to look at the possible
 Restore Points- I got a message saying that it could show them because my drive's "protection mode" (or something like that) needed to be enabled and I didn't know how to do that with the drive, which is a SSD. I didn't want to restore back to the day I first
 got the computer nor did I want to ask it to try to fix the problem because I assumed the problem was bad- it probably wouldn't succeed and might mess things up even worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So--- then I tried to boot from the Acronis recovery disk- but had difficulty with that because it has a p poor user interface and I had read on the Acronis forums that many people were unable to access their external drives with the program from the recovery
 disk. It turned out that that problem is mostly for people with Seagate external drives and mine is a Western Digital- so, I did finally managed to figure out how to recover my full system form the external drive and then I breathed again, after being in a
 chat session with Acronis tech support for hours!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now I'm back to a system running just fine but don't know how to get caught up with the updates without messing up the system again. Is the solution to first install &nbsp;2919355&nbsp;as that KB file suggests? Will it succeed? Or will I be tearing my hair out
 again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>These really big updates (service packs) are a nightmare. What should I do now? I suppose I can try first installing &nbsp;2919355 then 3000850 since I have the Acronis backup program- but that's like doing brain surgery for those of us who are not IT professionals.
 I have my business on this computer- so it would be a catastrophe for it to be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, what the heck is that error code C0000034 mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me fix all this as I don't like to skip updates but I will if I means risking my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I could wait until Windows 10 is released. When that happens, will it be an upgrade for Windows 8.1? If so, will it install over Win 8.1 without me having to reinstall all my programs, including Office 2013, and many other programs?</p>

<p><em>Assuming Win8.1 64-bit...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Did you purchase the computer in November of <em>2014</em> or...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 (or Win8.1) preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8 (or Win8.1), or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. When (exact date) did you create the Acronis image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite (i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription
</em>(if any)<em>&nbsp;expire?</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Is KB3032359, KB3030377, KB3032323, KB3035131, KB3034344, KB3035126, KB3035132, KB3039066, KB3033889, KB3046049, and/or KB3025417&nbsp;listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)<em>?</em> [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE11's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 11.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v17.0.0.134 </strong><em>for Internet Explorer</em> installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; Glary Utilities;&nbsp;AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC;
 PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner's
<em>Registry Cleaner </em>component)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip =&gt; KB3000850 is an optional, non-security update (yes, even though it may be offered as an

            <p>PA Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. I purchased this Dell in Nov. '14.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. it came with W 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. I created the Acronis image on March 19 and attempted to install 3000851 the next day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The Dell came with McAfee Live Safe and it's always current- every time I check it. It will expire 1 year after I got the Dell, that is, in Nov. '15</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The McAfee program is the anti- malware program and firewall, since it turns off the MS firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. No other anti virus/maleware program has been installed - only McAfee, as it came from the factory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. McAfee free-trial came preinstalled and it was activated immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. all of those are installed- but, I just happened to notice in the "update history" that the same day the big one (Kb 3000850)&nbsp;failed to install- another also failed to install- KB2934520 (MS .NET Framework.....) - I also notice that the big one tried
 to install the next day but also failed- though, I wasn't aware of this second try!</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. 11.0.17 (KB3032359)</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. Firefox is installed, but not Chrome or any other browser</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. I went to that link and saw, "You have version 17,0,0,134 installed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. I don't use registry cleaners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I do see in the KB article associated with this big update- that there is a prerequisite, which is the also large update from April of 2014. What's bothering me is that- why the heck didn't the update program inform me of that first. This would
 be especially important for those who do the updates automatically. I've seen in other forums that this big update has caused problems for many people. And, I will for now take your advice of just hiding it- because I intend to install W10 when it's available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was very brave, I'd install the prerequisite first, then 3000850, knowing that I could (in theory) recover with Acronis, but I was so traumatized with that experience, I'm in no hurry. I was traumatized because the Acronis program's user interface isn't
 user friendly for doing a restore- I finally figured it out, after a 5 hour chat session with an Acronis tech- who failed to lead me to the correct solution.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>After about 15 minutes, I turned it off then back on and got nothing but a black screen with that error code. I kept trying with no luck. It trashed my boot drive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>15 minutes may not have been long enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the real problem IMO with updates:&nbsp; lack of cues about what is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp; It warns us not to do what you did but it doesn't give us enough confidence to believe what it says.&nbsp; Also obviously it is not
 fault-tolerant.&nbsp; However, I suspect that if instead of "turning it off" (which may involve the firmware later telling the OS "Hey!&nbsp; You're broken!") if you had just pulled the plug--thus simulating an expected contingency--power failure--you might have had
 a different result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW when I did this update on my TouchSmart it took at least half an hour.&nbsp; If it hadn't been for cues such as occasional drive light flickers and (especially) fan noise, I might have wondered&nbsp;about giving up sooner too.&nbsp; But if I would have given up I
 definitely would never try to use a "hard reset" first.&nbsp; BTDT GTTS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW another advantage I would have on my TouchSmart is having a boot selection menu to start from.&nbsp; It gives you more options when the update really makes your system "unbootable".&nbsp; In fact, that would be a possibility for anyone even if they don't have
 a multiple partitions to boot.</p>

            <p>RHETORICAL QUESTIONS (no need to answer):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any particular reason you think optional, non-security update KB3000850 needs to be installed, Joe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any particular reason you think you need .NET Framework 4.5.2 (KB2934520) installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Win8.1 includes a built-in (free) anti-virus/anti-malware application (Windows Defender) as well as a firewall, do you really need the McAfee application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Assuming both updates are still being offered when you run a manual check for updates, uncheck KB3000850 but leave KB2934520 checked then see if the latter will successfully install as a standalone.</p>

            <p>Robert, in my case-- after the attempted installation- there was a message indicating the installation failed. I then, without a particular reason, decided to restart- then, the screen just said, "restarting" and that went on for maybe 15 minutes- but there
 wasn't the usual, "don't turn off computer"- or I wouldn't have done so. I did notice that the drive's light would flash briefly every - maybe 15 seconds, but no other clue on the screen what was going on. I realize I should had more patience. Then when I
 turned it back on- I got the error code. Luckily, I have a good backup program (Acronis) which I recovered from.</p>

            <p>PA Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to why attempt the update- I don't know- I had previously had it set up to update automatically, but after a previous problem weeks before (that's a long story)- I had updates set to manual. When I saw it, I just assumed it might be useful. As for the
 .NET Framework, I don't have a clue what it is. As for the McAfee, it came with the system- I had read some negative comments about Windows Defender- that it was a lightweight program. I'll probably remove McAfee because I have a multiple installation purchase
 of Norton, but I haven't gotten around to installing on the new Dell- more because I want to check it out- it seems way better than the version I had a decade ago, which constantly pestered me with pop ups. I will try installing KB2934520 because it's apparently
 a requirement to install W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I bother with the .NET Framework upgrade? I suspect KB3000850 will install after I install KB2934520 because the latter is a requirement of the former. If I have success with all this- I'll report back here.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you run into problems with your PC, a USB recovery drive can help you troubleshoot and fix those problems, even if your PC won't start.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your PC might have come with a recovery image that’s used to refresh or reset your PC. The recovery image is stored on a dedicated recovery partition on your PC, and is typically 3-6 GB in size. To save space on your PC, you
 can delete the recovery image from your PC and use a recovery drive instead. Windows 8.1 includes a built-in tool to create a USB recovery drive. Windows will let you know how big the recovery partition is, and you'll need a USB flash drive at least that big.</span></p>

            Thanks for your kind support and help. Accidentally, I had already deleted that recovery drive installed by the manufacturer. That is why I need to backup and made recovery disk in DVD. So that in future, if anything happens to my applications, I can reboot
 from recovery DVD disk. Can I recreate recovery drive now? Please suggest me, I would thankful to you for ever<br />

            That does not work. Before LAST YEAR, I could duplicate screens just fine. Now I cannot. Someone fouled up big time. It is unacceptable to call something an update when it breaks things that used to work just fine. It HAS BEEN A YEAR! FIX THIS PLEASE!&nbsp;Extended
 screen works fine for some reason, but I need to DUPLICATE the screen for others who use this PC. Using monitor cable to 2006 or 2007&nbsp;Samsung LCD TV, by the way.

<h2>            ITunes update left Windows 10 not recognizing my keyboard or mouse. Now I am stuck at the start screen on my Dell computer.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I installed the latest itunes update and now my Dell computer with Windows 10 will not recognize my wired keyboard or wireless mouse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck at the start screen because it will not even allow me to get to the part where I would enter the PIN. &nbsp;I can’t even get to the system screens to see if the BIOS is having issues. &nbsp;I have tried hard restarts and nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened to two of our computers (the other is an HP All-In-One). The HP is at the computer shop (because we didn’t realize the cause) and then I unknowingly did the update on the Dell (a week apart) and the same thing happened.&nbsp;</p>

I know people who send death threats and walk away freely. This was my first time sending messages to someone. The only thing I said to him was that he was bad, absolute trash.

            Hi Paul, that screen is called the LockScreen and it depends on how you have it set up
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Personalisation - LockScreen
<br />
<br />If it is set to Picture, you should see the old picture below the current one, and you can just click on the old picture to set it
<br />
<br />If it is set to Windows Spotlight, then the image you refer to is one of the random images Microsoft put up on Spotlight
<br />
<br />If it is a Spotlight image, you might be lucky and be able to find it on the Web, just Google 'Windows Spotlight Images' and then click on Images, to see if you can find it . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 Hardware Error Message Question</h2>
                    <p><span>I built my own PC for both school and personal use. It uses Windows 10 64-bit. During this Christmas break, I decided to clean up the computer and reset everything to default settings before the semester starts. I try to keep on top of my
 computer's health. While looking at Problem reports under Security and Maintenance (which is listed below), I get a hardware error message. So far, my computer seems to be running fine. I have received no error messages or blue screens of death. Security and
 Maintenance has listed no issues, with the exception of a message of a device driver needing an installation, which has been accomplished. Problem Devices under System Information only listed my USB WiFi antenna as being disabled, which I know about because
 I had to disable it to test an Ethernet power line adapter, but no other problems were listed in that section.</span><br />
<br />
<span>The only issue that I had after the reset was Windows 10 freezing once during its initialization process after powering on the PC, but the software from the manufacturer of the SSD where Windows 10 is stored says the SSD is in good condition
<span>The only issue that I had after the reset was Windows 10 freezing once during its initialization process after powering on the PC, but the software from the manufacturer of the SSD where Windows 10 is stored says the SSD is in good condition
 and I have encountered no other start up freezes. The only hardware issue that I have had is with my external hard drive where I have to disconnect and reconnect it to my USB port in order for Windows 10 to detect it. The only hardware change that I have made
 to my PC is sampling and testing internal sound cards for a suitable replacement due to a problem with a previous sound card that I had last month. Again everything seems to be functioning as normal. Is this hardware error message something that I need to
 worry about or is it common to have Windows reports list hardware error messages? If it is an issue, I would like to fix it before school starts up because the last thing that I need is for my computer to fail during the middle of an online class. Thanks in
 advance. Here is the message listed below:</span><br />

</p><p><span>Update 1/4/18:</span></p>
<p>I have done the following troubleshooting checks.&nbsp; I scanned both my SSD and two hard drives and Windows detected no problems.&nbsp; Problem Devices under System Information had previously listed my USB WiFi Device as being disabled.&nbsp; Resource and Performance
 Monitor listed critical warnings related to my USB WiFi antenna, which I suspect is due to the WiFi being disabled.&nbsp; When I both disconnected the WiFi antenna from my machine and removed its software, there are no issues listed under Problem Devices and no
 critical warnings are listed under Resource and Performance Monitor.&nbsp; So far I have seen no other hardware error messages listed under problem reports after 12/31/17.&nbsp; Security and Maintenance has detected no issues. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I Did three&nbsp; troubleshoots with Hardware and Devices.&nbsp; The first two required me to update drivers and software and restart the computer.&nbsp; During the third round, Troubleshooting under Hardware and Devices said it could not identify problems
 and listed "Issues not present" under both Hardware and Devices and Potential Issues that Were Checked.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Right now I suspect that the hardware error was due to my USB WiFi antenna.&nbsp; As far as I can tell my computer is running normally, but I would appreciate input as to other possible causes to the problem as well as whether or not I could encounter
 this problem again.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My only other question is with Windows 10 Automatic Maintenance.&nbsp; I ran Automatic Maintenance as part of my effort to find out if there were any additional issues related to my hardware error.&nbsp; I noticed Maintenance switches back and forth
 between No Action Needed and Maintenance in Progress just before the maintenance process is completed.&nbsp; Is it normal for Maintenance to switch back and forth between those two messages when it is almost finished with its maintenance process?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks. &nbsp;</span></p>

            From the event logs, I see the CDROM device has some issue-SL says the CDROM has a bad block which is being treated as a hardware error by the PC.
<br />Do you have a CD inside the CDROM?

<p>I am actually using an LG Blu Ray Disc drive on my computer. &nbsp; I am currently ripping my audio CD collection to iTunes.&nbsp; I have been using an error correction feature on iTunes to properly rip my CDs and avoid issues such as playback skips and audio pops
 and clicks.&nbsp; I ripped most of my 300+ CDs for the last 4 or 5 days and will be done with the ripping process by either tomorrow or the day after.&nbsp; There were only 2 CDs so far that gave me ripping issues.&nbsp; 1 CD could not be fully ripped because either my CD
 repair kit could not properly repair the scratches on the disc's surface or there may have been a manufacturing defect on the disc.&nbsp; The ripping process on that disc appeared to freeze despite iTunes stating the rip was in progress, but the Blu Ray drive was
 able to fully rip a spare copy of that CD without trouble.&nbsp; The other CD made a scratching type sound during the ripping process.&nbsp; I aborted the rip and inspected the CD.&nbsp; That CD appeared to&nbsp; either have a film or thin string of its outer covering or surface
 hanging off the side and I decided to not attempt to rip that CD again.&nbsp; So far all of the other CDs appear to be ripped properly&nbsp; because iTunes has listed green check marks for all of the tracks on the discs that have been ripped.&nbsp; I have not had time to
 listen to all of the tracks, but I have an audio analyzer program to inspect my audio files after I finish ripping my CDs which is capable of detecting corrupted audio tracks.&nbsp; With the exception of ripping my audio CD's and using CDs and DVDs to load computer
 software, the Blu Ray drive is empty.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, from your analysis, are you saying that the hardware error may be coming from my Blu Ray drive?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second,&nbsp; are you saying that there could be a hardware problem with my Blu Ray drive even though iTunes states that it is properly ripping most of my CDs?&nbsp; If yes, what kind of problem may I be looking at and would it likely require me to repair or replace
 the drive? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            I forgot to mention that when I was resetting my operating system, I also reinstalled the drivers and software for hardware components including the motherboard and internal USB expansion card, as well as Microsoft Office via CD and DVD.&nbsp; The motherboard
 in particular required multiple computer restarts for its software and drivers to take effect.&nbsp; I hope this info helps as well.&nbsp;

            Absolutely, the error is the CD Drive itself.
<br />The event log says
<br />\Device\CDROM has a bad block (In reference to the CDs which you said it didn't work)
<br />Looks like Windows considers CD to be a hardware itself that is why you got that message.
<br />I would not pay attention to it if it was a one-off only.

<p>First, I just want to make sure that I understand your information correctly.&nbsp; From your analysis, the hardware error originated from my Blu Ray drive?&nbsp; The problem from the Blu Ray drive was due to either a CD or DVD being present in the drive?&nbsp; Windows
 would treat the CD or DVD that is present in the Blu Ray drive like any other computer hardware component such as a sound card, video card, or PCI-Express WiFi antenna during start up or other Windows operation processes?&nbsp; The hardware error problem is actually
 the CD or DVD disc itself due to it being scratched, damaged, having a manufacturing defect, or some how not agreeing Windows itself?&nbsp; If it is the CD or DVD itself, does that mean that my Blu Ray drive is actually ok and in working order? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I just did another system check on my computer.&nbsp; Security and Maintenance has detected no issues.&nbsp; Reliability Monitor has so far listed no other hardware error. &nbsp; System Information has nothing listed under Problem Devices.&nbsp; Resource and Performance
 Monitor states that no problems were found on my computer in the Warning subsection of Informational and Results are listed as Passed under Basic System Checks.&nbsp; Based on this information, am I correct in understanding that all of the hardware components on
 my computer are most likely fully functional and operating as normal?&nbsp; Again, is the problem the CD or DVD itself and not my Blu Ray Drive or any other computer hardware component?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, my motherboard had a lot of software and drivers that needed to be installed from the disc that it came with when I reset my computer.&nbsp; The computer had to restart multiple times in order for the software and drivers to take effect.&nbsp; The disc remained
 in the Blu Ray drive during the computer restart processes so that software and driver installation processes could resume after each restart.&nbsp; If my computer has to restart for software and drivers to take effect for a hardware component such as a motherboard,
 printer, or video card, and the disc has to remain in the drive for the installation to resume after restart, could I receive the hardware error message again due to the CD or DVD being present in the Blu Ray drive during Windows start up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, in relation to the results mentioned for system checks from my second question, does it also mean that my add-on software such as iTunes, Steam, and Guild of Gamers are most likely operating properly under Windows 10.&nbsp; Also, excluding the common
 bugs and updates present on Windows 10, do the system checks also indicate that my operating system is most likely functioning properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. &nbsp;</p>

            Firstly, yes what you have understood is correct. I see no other cause of the hardware error message and it is better to conclude.
<br />Secondly. yes If the reliability monitor isn't reporting any problems then your system is working fine.
<br />Third, Nope the hardware error shouldn't come up again unless the CD/DVD is corrupt like the earlier case you reported.
<br />Fourth, Reliability monitor should tell you if the system is having problems.

<p>hi joy, thanks for replying. I ran the troubleshooter and it didn't find anything wrong. I also made sure the"&nbsp;show notificatioin the action center" was turned on, it was . I added a new e-mail account in the mail and calendar app and sent an e-mail and
 it worked fine. the problem must be with the email account that I added first, its an old sprintmail.com account from earthlink which is what I use mostly. it did work fine on my 8.1 computer&nbsp;when I upgraded to windows 10. don't know what the problem is on
 this new computer. if you have any other suggestions I would appreciate it. thanks again.....dennis</p>
