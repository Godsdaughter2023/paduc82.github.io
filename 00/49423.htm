<h2>            Vista won&#39;t run, Startup Repair can&#39;t fix it, System Restore can&#39;t fix it.</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron with Windows Vista. On starting up, it says, "Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause." then offers to "Launch Startup Repair" or "Start Windows normally".<br />
<br />
When asked to start normally, it tries to start, but fails, returning again to this page.<br />
When asked to launch startup repair, it opens the programme, scans the system for several minutes, and then says "Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically".
<br />
<br />
When clicking on the diagnostic and repair details, it says:<br />
<br />
"Last successful boot time: 10/3/2011 3:42:52PM<br />
Number of repair attempts: 8<br />
<br />

<br />
Otherwise one can view the advanced settings:<br />

Windows Complete PC Restore = "a valid backup location could not be found. Windows cannot find a backup on this computer."<br />
Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool = didn't solve anything when scanned<br />
Command Prompt<br />
Dell Factory Image Restore = haven't tried but am avoiding wiping the whole harddisk clean for as long as possible..<br />
<br />
It will not go into Safe Mode, and I don't know what's going on. It happened when I shut it down (by holding down the power button) mid update as it had frozen.<br />
What should I do? Thanks.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> I would suggest that you perform startup repair using the Windows Vista installation disk and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a Windows Vista installation disc, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the installation disc. If you do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to repair your computer will not appear.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Insert the installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart your computer. </span>
</p>
<p><b><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></p>

<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the System Recovery Options menu, click on Startup Repair.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Refer: How do I fix a boot (startup) problem?</span></b></p>

</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> If above mentioned method fails then run chkdsk command from the WinRE (Windows Recovery Environment) and check if it fixes the issue:</span></p>

            I think it's a think pad, it doesn't have a windows logo. If it turns on (which normally it just has a blank screen and never starts) it brings me to the sign in page. I put in my password and then it says "log In not sucessful, logging out" which it never
 ends up logging me out. It brings me back to my page and the same thing happened over and over again

            <p>Hi Ramsey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get the "Windows" welcome screen when the computer is booting up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned it is a Think Pad, then I would suggest you to try to boot your computer in Safe mode and check if you are able to boot the system. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode,
 and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed. </p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode

<p>
</p><p>If you are boot to your system in Safe Mode, I would suggest you to clean boot the system to rule out the possibility of a third party software intervention.</p>

<h2>            Epson L355 printer connection problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have been running my new Epson L355 wifi printer for a few weeks now via my virgin media router/hub. I have recently upgraded the Virgin package for faster broadband and needed a new router/hub. The instructions for re connecting/synchronising the two
 are easy "Press the wps on the router and then press the wifi on the printer and they should find each other”.
<span>&nbsp;</span>YES! However this is not the case. The virgin engineer has been out and cannot find out why the two will not mate. He has tried another router/hub but to no avail. The printer will work ok if I connect it via the cable to my usb. Can anyone help?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to use any other Wireless device on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to use your Wireless printer wirelessly but can use it with wired connection, after updating the Virgin media router/hub.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of your wireless device is working then there might be a chance that wireless service is not running on your computer and if they are working still try to check that service and for that please follow the steps mentioned below. Let's first try to
 start the <strong>wireless service </strong>i.e. <strong>WLAN AutoConfig </strong>
service manually. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type
<strong>Services.msc</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Locate <strong>WLAN AutoConfig service</strong>, double click on it to open its
<strong>properties</strong> window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Under <strong>General tab</strong>, change the
<strong>Startup type</strong> to <strong>Automatic</strong> and click <strong>Start</strong> button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then
<strong>ok</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Try to connect to the wireless connection and check the result.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Also refer:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
For more information about the wireless settings, check this link: </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff802404.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><strong>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff802404.aspx</strong></span></a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be a chance that some updates which has been released by manufacturer of your printer is not installed on your computer due to which you are facing issue. So, I would suggest you to
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">check Windows updates</a></strong> if there is any updates available for the printer either&nbsp;under
<strong>Recommended </strong>or <strong>Optional</strong>. If there is any updates available try to install them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after installing the Windows updates issue persist try to install the latest drivers&nbsp;and web installer from the link provided below and see if it helps to fix the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<p>Hello intensejames,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to see that you cant Manage your Gold membership. To turn Auto-renewal off please login with the account you wish to change. At the website please click Continue:
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/Subscriptions/AutoRenewal?titleId=0xfffe07d1&amp;productId=00000000-0000-4080-8000-0008fffe07d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
live.xbox.com/.../AutoRenewal</a> To manage your Billing information you can do that at:
<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub/Help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">commerce.microsoft.com/.../Help</a> Please not that in order to change you cards you will first need to Add a new one and then go back and switch the Gold membership over to the new Card.
 Then you may remove the old card. Please keep us updated.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hey there Gaga thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the frustration this can cause but rest assured we are here to help, we suggest a bit of troubleshooting on the account itself such as Removing and Re-adding it to the console&nbsp;by following our

How to add or remove a Microsoft account on Xbox One page</a>&nbsp;since it could just be a simple glitch on the system. Also we suggest looking into the
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders?refd=www.bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Order History</a> on the Microsoft Account to make absolutely sure the payment went through. Finally the correct way to get in contact with one of our Xbox Support Specialists is to

                    <p>Original title : Who is Windows35 Technical Company </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I received a scam phone call from an Indian sounding male claiming he worked for Windows 35 Technical Company and that my computer was sending out messages to Microsoft indicating a serious issue with viruas and trojan horse issues.&nbsp; He tried to convince
 me that my CLSID number was unique to my computer and that his company was the only one capable of getting it, etc. etc.&nbsp; He then tried to get me to sign into teamviewer.com to allow his technician access to help me fix my slow computer.&nbsp; After playing along
 for a while I was able to get a phone number from him (800-525-2818 - not sure where this number rings) where I could call him to resume his efforts to help me.&nbsp; Be aware of unsolicited help with viruses and slow computers using this version of social engineering.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Professional - get on the internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike.white.nz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Professional - get on the internet</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a new laptop:&nbsp;
<div>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2450M cpu @ 2.50 GHz&nbsp;</div>
<div>Memory: 12.0 GB&nbsp;</div>
<div>System 64-bit OS&nbsp;</div>
<div>I purchased this with Home premium installed I then purchased a Windows 7 Professional disk Product ID: 00371 OEM 9045012 84119 and installed. Because I could not upgrade from Home Premium I had to do a full install and I now have Windows professional
 running.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem is that it will not connect me either via wireless or direct from my modem as it tells me that "no connections are available"</div>
<div>&nbsp;I presumed from this that maybe I had to load different drivers for professional so I first contacted Microsoft NZ who advised me to contact the manufacturer (Samsung) who sent me to there website for downloading the correct drivers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did this however no change it still will not allow me to connect. I called the manufacturer back and they helpfully advised me that there was nothing further that they could do and for me to contact Microsoft. I can not beleive that in 2012 and the expense
 of Windows 7 Professional that I should be having so much trouble connecting to the internet, I had no problem with Home Premium and I am still conected on another machine under XP - the problem appears to be Home Premium - meantime I am sitting here with
 a lot of work to do but am unable to do anything because I cant connect to the network. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone help. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            Samsung is responsible for the hardware and drivers. The same drivers for Windows 7 Home Premium should also work with Professional&nbsp; -make sure you download the 64 bit drivers since you have 64 bit. You coudl also try uninstalling then reinstalling the
 network drivers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Samsung Drivers:<br />
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/support/</a><br />
If you can't access the internet use a different computer and save the driver to a CD/DVD/flash drive.

<br />
If your network is wireless, run the Set Up a Network wizard on the computer attached to the router.<br />
<br />
1. Open Set Up a Network by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type network, click Network and Sharing Center, click Set up a new connection or network, and then click Set up a new network.<br />
<br />
2. The wizard will walk you through the process of adding other computers and devices to the network. For more information, see:<br />

<h2>            Cross mark at the bottom of the Start screen tile</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Very annoying problem, need help when possible!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, when I turned on my computer, i unlocked it, and looked at the Skype icon on my start screen, and there was a small black 'x' in the bottom right corner, in a white circle. When I tried opening the app, it just game me a red screen - the same
 colour as the backdrop I chose. I couldn't pull down fom the top to close the app, I had to use the windows key. The desktop works, and all of the desktop apps I've pinned to my start screen will open, but any Modern UI apps will not - but the only app with
 the 'x' in the corner is Skype. I can't update anything because I can't open the store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I need help!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I have Windows 8.1 if that helps.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could face this issue due to licensing or if there are pending updates to be installed. I would suggest you to follow the steps given below and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Run the App Troubleshooter. </strong><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Reset store cache and check.</strong></p>

<p>If you are unable to install any apps, you can try resetting the store cache and then try to install and check. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press <strong>Windows key +R,</strong> type “<strong>WSReset</strong>” and press enter.<br />
b) Check if it takes you to a store page which displays that the cache has been reset<br />
c) Now try to install the app and check.</p>

<p>You can't officially buy parts for the console, as Microsoft doesn't distribute them to end-user stores. Only certified repair centers can order replacement parts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no user serviceable or user replaceable parts that Microsoft intended for the customer to replace.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will therefore have to find sources for these parts yourself, or have Microsoft officially service your console.

<h2>            Network Error - There is a problem accessing...&#60;server path&#62; when copying folders from Windows 7 to Windows 2003 Server</h2>
                    
<p>When trying to copy a large folder from a laptop running&nbsp;Windows 7 Enterprise to a Windows 2003 server I get the following error part way into the copy (after several folders already copied successfully):</p>
<p>Network Error</p>
<p>There is a problem accessing Z:\&lt;path to files&gt;</p>
<p>Make sure you are connected to the network and try again.</p>
<p>Same error when trying to&nbsp;copy to 3 different Windows 2003 servers. Some files are copied - it often fails on the same file or folder, and sometimes those files can be subsequently&nbsp;copied individually. No problems at all when copying the same folder to a
 Windows 2008 R2 server.</p>
<p>This laptop was recently upgraded from Windows XP Professional and I never saw any of these issues in the past few years when running under Windows XP. AI had the same problem after moving a copy of&nbsp;my hard drive onto another drive in another&nbsp;laptop.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Windows explorer issues windows 7 x64 sp1</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, <br />
<br />
For a while I have had problems with explorer. Everytime after I startup windows explorer works as it should for about 5 to 10mins sometimes more depending how many times i open it and close it, sometimes after a while it starts working again. After this period
 of time explorer navigation page only shows three places; libraries, favorites and Homegroup and Libraries. To manage to see the full navigation pane I have to right click on a folder in library and choose "Open with new window" then a new window of explorer
 opens with the navigation pane working.<br />
When the explorer navigation pane is visible, it does not update when i put new usb pen drives. And usually the progress bar in the address bar stays on forever when updating my computer.
<br />
Usually after a while all icons in folders are white also, it does not distinguish file types either. All this seems to be corrupted files.<br />
<br />
I have used sfc tool, done chkdsk on all drives, checked for hardware issues,etc, done full antivirus checks, etc.<br />
I have also removed most of the index folders, and rebuilt index that didn't help either.<br />
I cant find nothing, and as a developer it is very annoying to have to format a hard-drive and install all tools recompile stuff etc.
<br />
<br />
I am using windows 7 x64 sp1. <br />
Does anyone have a clue on how to fix this. Btw this does not happen in the file choosers in word, etc.</p>
<p>Dont know if it helps but i have visual studio 2008 and 2010 installed also.<br />
</p>

            I have created another user account and up 2 now everything seems to be working fine. I have started migrating everything up 2 now everything is working fine. Hopefully this will do it.<br />
<br />
***EDIT: Explorer is again doing the same thing. Anymore ideas?<br />

</p><p>"Delivery Optimisation downloads the same updates and apps that you get via Windows Update and the Windows Store. Delivery Optimisation creates a local cache, and stores files that it has downloaded in that cache for a short period of time. Depending on

    <title>Lock screen default picture &#34;Needle Tower thingy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angelocamillos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lock screen default picture &#34;Needle Tower thingy &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; that I don&#39;t like&#34;</h2>
                    <p>The relevant file is protected even from administrator and frankly a waste of space on my hard drive along with all the other files I have to choose from. I prefer, blow me down I just happen to be the bloody customer who paid for this OS, to use one of
 the plethora of photos I have taken as my back drop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hang onto to your charge bright eyes, I know you can use your own pictures and a lot of the time they are the only thing that comes up but there is a time delay while Windoze puts up a blank screen to the default tower and then presents you with your choice.
 Another waste of resources. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't imagine whose ego is so big that they must have their choice of pictures inflicted on other people like it or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not help that the operating&nbsp;system is so good that if you have had to remove a driver and reinstall it or some other forced reboot occurs that that bloody spire will actually be visible before it allows your picture to come up. The only good thing
 in this case is the time delay is smaller than when it works properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely by now Windows users are adult enough to be allowed to change default pictures etc. without them being told they don't have permission to remove a file from their hard drive. With XP, in spite of the early days blue screens after an auto update, you
 had the run of customising the screen appearance without penalty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone out there has removed these works of art without killing Windows I would appreciate some assistance with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Well 6th of June and their ego's must be huge because there is still no answer, looks like the customer can go get ......! so far as Microsoft is concerned and don't worry&nbsp;the day is coming when we can have the same attitude to them.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may think I am a hater of Windows but actually without criticism nothing ever gets fixed. I have actually moved to 8.1 now so we get a pictorial lookalike of a movie theme and yes it still pops up occasionally. The OS is far more robust than V8 and works
 much better in respect of systray icons however there are a lot of processes that take space and resources, not just hard drive space though there is one that takes&nbsp;13.9gigs on my computer which is irritating me. All this automation is designed to separate
 us from what is going on but when the new computer drops dead from overload, or all your files disappear because your hard drive has had one too many hits we all blame the computer manufacturer not the real culprit, the OS manufacturer for putting the strain
 on the system mechanicals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly I personally&nbsp;don't need any automation, I have a solid hard drive imaging system and would prefer they market just a clean operating system so for those who want they can forego it on installation and the majority can have their automation and tablet
 style computer with touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason no one is posting a reply, is a little more diabolical than you think. It is like in UBUNTU where if you can hack in and change the root password the OS collapses and I suspect that these pictures that accidentally come up and are protected are
 related to piracy protection and if removed would probably collapse the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for no one posting a response I have had more than one response, indirectly in respect of Windows 8 when I pointed out that I bought a new computer to multitask and they turned it into a single task machine with the way they organised the apps so naturally
 they released an update to make it possible to multitask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst we are on the subject of poor quality control if you use Citrix receiver you will have issues trying to get it to work on Windows 8 and 8.1 you need to scroll down to the app and run it as administrator even though you are the administrator and signed
 on as such before it works properly. So half the apps work without this and Citrix needs you to execute the file as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go on believe me there is lots more wrong with the OS and the way it knits with the available software and again you will accuse me of frothing off at the mouth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of comments at the store from people who have downloaded citrix receiver rating it at 1 because it doesn't work have a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response anyway and if more people knew what is possible if people go to work inspired to do better rather than just go to work we might just start to fix this mess we have created.</p>
