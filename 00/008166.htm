<h2>            Validation rule in query parameters for report &#40;end date must be later than start date&#41;</h2>
                    <p>How do I test if the user has entered an end date that is before the start date, and if so, prompt the user to enter a different end date?</p>
<p>I have a query which runs when a report is opened. In the query's Invoice field, I have the parameters set up in the criteria as: Between [Start Date] And [End Date], as per below pic.</p>

<p>Create a Criteria form where user will specify the dates and click the Preview button. You can then validate the criteria before DoCmd.OpenReport.</p>

            <p>Steve,&nbsp; No, this is not a recent install of MSE.&nbsp; The only other "security" program still on this computer is the installed system that came as part of the MS incorporated programs in Vista...the "Windows Security Alerts" and&nbsp;it is turned OFF.&nbsp; As far as
 I know, it is not removeable by itself.&nbsp; I have been running MSE exclusively from day one!&nbsp; This problem has only recently occurred.&nbsp; It is not a long standing problem.&nbsp; I have run MSE on both of our computers(laptops) since it came out and used "OneCare"
 prior to that.</p>

            This requires advanced troubleshooting and creation of a dump when the scan hangs at said file. Probably an engine issue. It bogs me why an MS tech rep isn't stepping in. You can't depend on your users to help other users with this stuff. MS wake up. It's

</p><p>Wake up and get a clue, this is a Community support forum and as such is not officially monitored by Microsoft technicians other than the occasional first level tech with minimal access and knowledge of the product.&nbsp; In most cases some of the longer term
 users in these forums have far more experience than any of these typically contracted&nbsp;Microsoft employees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Direct Microsoft support for MSE was ended over a year ago and the current support avenues are covered by the following document.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Support for Microsoft Security Essentials</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/ph/15931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/ph/15931</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the MVPs helping here have limited access to the Microsoft teams responsible for the consumer security products and will use these when significant issues occur and are recognized here due to large numbers of posts and/or the ability to verify the
 issues by testing.&nbsp; However, this is only intended to resolve significant application issues and not the individual issues of users, virtually all of which are related to fundamental problems on the specific user's PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only&nbsp;individual assisted support service&nbsp;available is via the Answer Desk, which is a pay service designed to aid in malware removal, but not the Microsoft Security Essentials product itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you are lamenting is something that hasn't existed for over a year and in fact isn't available at this point even for most 3rd-party products without paying an added fee or using their similar user supported forums to report such issues.</p>

            <p>Sure this is a community support forum, but MS shouldn't ignore it. It's still a forum (by them) for their product. It's not a fanbase's nor unverified forum. If the volunteers know more then why hire 1st level techs? The techs will be redundant. Better
 invest in higher level techs. If MS is too stingy for that then at least ask their 1st level techs to forward issues to be investigated and fixed however isolated those may be. Those 1st level techs are even selective when replying. I see quite some of unanswered
 threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If limited communication is an issue, MS should coordinate more with their security MVPs as theyre the front for the security product's support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you're saying MSE is a product with no guarantees? If it doesn't work for you, move on? MS being the largest software provider providing an unguaranteed product. Wow. I know resources prioritization. They wouldn't be having that problem if their executives
 haven't been overpaid for years. For what? For scheming to sell more? But there shouldn't be majority-minority discrimination here. The fact is, user paid for the OS software - that includes assurance that it's bug-free and secure until its EOL; secured through
 patches and a working MSE not only for the majority. Not to mention, support for everything that came with it. Well, I guess that applies to WD only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haha. Then why have MSE if there's Answerdesk? MSE should have been preventing infections in the first place. Why should people pay if it failed to do its job? For Windows 8 users, they paid for the OS with WD. Why should they pay again if they already paid
 to be protected and for WD to remove the threat?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I beg to disagree. Lots of free products offering freemium support. They're more than happy to receive reports why their products don't work and offer the possibility to fix them. It doesn't matter if it's widespread or isolated. Isolated cases may be treated
 slower but are not totally ignored like in this case. Why release a product working for some users only anyway? The dev should find out why that is the case and fix it if plausible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bet you're thinking Norton. Haha. And at other 3rd party AVs' forums, at least they have dedicated support reps, gathering info and samples for the lab's and devs' perusal. Don't see that here.<br />

            <p>adwbust,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you clearly still&nbsp;don't understand&nbsp;I'll try to help you get some idea how Microsoft looks at support of&nbsp;MSE and Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't say Microsoft ignores the forums, just that the only official regular&nbsp;posters from Microsoft itself are either forum moderation personnel or first level techs.&nbsp; That also doesn't mean that higher level or at least specialized tech personnel aren't
 lurking and/or collecting information, they simply don't post as often as they used to in the past.&nbsp; This is also how some of the MVPs aid in the forums as I mentioned earlier, by helping to focus Microsoft's attention on larger issues when they flare-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you guessed the fairly obvious reason for this is resources, since these are very limited, especially for a product provided completely for free.&nbsp; Initially Microsoft had provided phone support for MSE, but over time they moved away from this, which any
 sensible person would quickly realize must have occurred due to cost.&nbsp; Spending&nbsp; just a few days perusing any of the popular malware removal forums will quickly show that many foolish people are&nbsp;doing the same things wrong and often the same people return
 to these forums time after time, which would quickly monopolize and saturate a free support system no matter how large it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Microsoft moved to the support structure laid out in the link I included above, with the usual online knowledgebase and these community based forums as the first level support with some backup monitoring by Microsoft first level techs when questions aren't
 being answered as quickly as they'd like, though I don't know their time&nbsp;thresholds for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case the consumer security products (MSE &amp; Defender) are provided "as-is", free and are optional products that no one forces you to use.&nbsp; They can be either not installed or disabled either manually or automatically by installing a fully&nbsp;compliant
 3rd-party anti-malware free or paid product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has always provided MSE and Defender as fallback products to provide basic antimalware protection when a user would otherwise install nothing else, either due to cost or simple apathy.&nbsp; They have never&nbsp;attempted to replace all other antimalware
 products or even truly compete with them directly, other than to help set a baseline&nbsp;that customers should expect any such product to provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along with the above the recent economic conditions combined&nbsp;with the semi-related move to mobile devices by consumers and corresponding reduction in PC sales are affecting Microsoft's bottom line, which has resulted in significant reduction in personnel
 at all levels.&nbsp; You can talk about executive pay and other issues if you wish, but the reality is there are less resources available to go around.&nbsp; So the obvious direction within Microsoft has been to place more resources into the development of new products
 to aid in growth, since that's what's required to maintain better support for all current products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So rant and moan as much as you wish, but it will change nothing.&nbsp; MSE and Defender support are what they are and the effort with these within Microsoft is focused on maintaining the products themselves to perform as they are defined and not on support of
 individual users beyond the parameters I've outlined.&nbsp; That works fine for most including knowledgeable users and even many of those less technical users with relatively simple needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there will always be those who require more support and if they can't find what they need either in these forums or online, and aren't willing to pay for the Answer Desk help, then there are many other 3rd-party options either free or pay available
 to take their place.&nbsp; This isn't Microsoft's responsibility since only updates to the currently supported&nbsp;operating system itself were ever guaranteed, possibly with a partial exception for Windows Defender since that's included in the os, though I've never
 looked closely&nbsp;at any licensing specific to that sub-product.&nbsp; (See the following).</p>

<p>Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost missed your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are willing and able and your system will support Windows 8 (I assume what you meant), then by all means that would be your best course of action.&nbsp; From a security standpoint it is far better than even Vista or Windows 7 and will add other abilities
 that were typically add-ons in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, make certain that your hardware is capable and also that you are ready for the significant changes to the way Windows 8 operates, since some have had difficulty adjusting to the new methods of operation it includes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to scare you off, but I also don't want you to assume it's simply a newer version of Vista, since the handling of the desktop has changed significantly without the full traditional start-menu and the initial default tiled screen.&nbsp; It took me
 some time, but once I [un]-learned the archaic methods for accessing apps and files and took advantage of the much better search and other new tools, I finally realized this is how Windows should always have worked if it had been technically possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if you try Windows 8 out at a store and don't like it at all, there is a new version 9 planned for release in&nbsp;mid-2015, though I don't know what the hardware requirements will be.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Office 365 MSO 16.0.11029.20045 32 bit&#58; Rule Error</h2>
                    <p>After one of the recent updates(last week of December was when it started) the rules I set up to keep my inbox clean have stopped working.&nbsp; When trying to manage these rules I get "The operation failed because of a registry or installation problem.&nbsp; Restart
 Outlook and try again.&nbsp; If problem persists, reinstall."&nbsp; Restarting does not work and this is a work laptop so I have no installation tools.&nbsp; Are there any other options to correct this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <blockquote>I need to create a series of numbered labels on an Avery 5167 labels with the same number repeating three times.</blockquote>
<br />
<div>This is a little bit difficult because you want to be repeating <i>three times</i>&nbsp;on the Avery 5167 labels which are ½in × 1¾in. This would mean that there are 4 columns × 20 rows of labels which is not directly divisible by 3 so a little extra work is
 required.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>First set up a page with a &nbsp;table of 4@ 1¾in columns and 20@ ½in rows or use a template based upon the Avery 5167 label format.</li><li>Put the blinking cursor in the top left cell of the table and press <i>Ctrl+F9</i>. This will open a set of
<i>field braces</i>. Type the following into the braces,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>{</b>&nbsp;SEQ nmbrs \R 1 \# "0000" <b>}<br />
&nbsp; </b>... which will start a <i>sequence</i>&nbsp;called&nbsp;<i>nmbrs</i>&nbsp;at <i>1</i>&nbsp;and format the numbers with leading zeroes. You can change that to start at a different number and/or change the number format.</li><li>Tap <i>Tab</i>&nbsp;so the blinking cursor is in the next cell to the right and press
<i>Ctrl+F9</i>&nbsp;for a new set of field braces and type the following into the <i>field braces</i>,<br />
<b><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>{</b>&nbsp;SEQ nmbrs \C \# "0000"&nbsp;<b>}</b></li><li>Tap <i>Tab</i>&nbsp;to get the next cell and repeat the previous step.</li><li>Tap&nbsp;<i>Tab</i>&nbsp;so the blinking cursor is in the next cell to the right and press&nbsp;<i>Ctrl+F9</i>&nbsp;for a new set of field braces and type the following into the&nbsp;<i>field braces</i>,<br />
<b><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>{</b>&nbsp;SEQ nmbrs \N \# "0000"&nbsp;<b>}</b></li><li>You now have&nbsp;<i><span><i>sequence&nbsp;</i></span>start, sequence continue</i>&nbsp;and a
<i>sequence next</i>&nbsp;fields.&nbsp;Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 until you fill the table. <i>
Hint:</i>&nbsp;if you use <i>Tab</i>&nbsp;or <i>Shift+Tab</i>&nbsp;to navigate into a cell already containing a field you can copy then use
<i>Tab</i>&nbsp;to move forward and <i>Paste</i>.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fblufiles.storage.live.com%2fy1puyBkYLUnGNPuivkXV-RDTC4bxNm2R7i_vYBFjyk0MJ_IxBHcRwywAqj7-CDYQeFSGssUVR41NhU%2fWord_Seq_Labels.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></li></ol>
<div>If you do not need to start at a number other than 1 you can use the field from step 5 in step 2.</div>
<div>When you are done press <i>Ctrl+A</i>&nbsp;(e.g. <i>Select All</i>)&nbsp;then <i>F9</i>&nbsp;(e.g.&nbsp;<i>Update Fields</i>).<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fblufiles.storage.live.com%2fy1pRfmXsypLFBEzg9PfQMr_rY_PruQuG8aZ32FDg2z6EKF0zCndmX9TEWmgdus42Ej8pQ3emWqBfcY%2fWord_Seq_Labels_Nmbrs.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>If the field code are still showing, tap <i>Alt+F9</i>&nbsp;to <i>Show field values</i>&nbsp;instead of
<i>Show field codes</i>.<br />
<br />
<div>An alternative method would be to set up a <i>Print Merge</i>&nbsp;with an Excel worksheet that uses a formula like,</div>
<div>=INT(ROW()/3)+1</div>
<div>... to populate a large number of rows. In that case the contents of the table's cells would be something like.</div>
<div><b><span><b>{</b>&nbsp;MERGEFIELD nmbrs&nbsp;<b>}</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b>{</b>&nbsp;MERGEFIELD nmbrs&nbsp;<b>}</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>{</b>&nbsp;MERGEFIELD nmbrs&nbsp;<b>}</b>&nbsp;<b>{</b>&nbsp;NEXT

<h2>            Migrate Windows OneNote Files to Mac OneNote Files without OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I have several OneNote notebooks on a Windows desktop that I need to move to a Mac Desktop on a different network. &nbsp;The problem is that the network that the Windows desktop is on blocks OneDrive, Google Drive, DropBox, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows version of OneNote has the option of exporting notebooks. &nbsp;In fact the option says it's for exporting to the Mac version of OneNote; however, there's no way on the Mac to import the files. &nbsp;I also tried uploading the extracts to OneDrive, but
 the Mac version of OneNote doesn't show the uploaded files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add insult to injury, this was a change made to OneNote Mac that has negatively impacted users since 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a OneDrive-less way to migrate these files?</p>
<p>

<p>There is <strong>no other option</strong> to open OneDrive notebooks on a mac than opening them from OneDrive or OneDrive for business. The OneNote for Mac app (nor any other OneNote version except for OneNote 2013/2016 for Windows) is
<strong>not</strong> supporting notebook files (ONE and ONEPKG).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you have to transfer the notebooks to OneDrive or OneDrive for Business first
<strong>using a Windows PC and OneNote 2013/2016 for Windows</strong> using its internal method (File - Share).
<strong>Copying OneNote files to OneDrive another way won't help</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, but that's how Microsoft has designed it (for now?).</p>

<p>Hi PaulNicklin7177,</p>
<p>For migrating 3<sup>rd</sup> email system to Office 365, it’s possible to achieve that by using
<b>IMAP migration</b>. Only items in a user's inbox or other mail folders can be migrated. You can’t migrate contacts, calendar items, or tasks. A maximum of 500,000 items can be migrated from a user’s mailbox. Besides, the maximum message size that can be
 migrated is 35 MB.</p>
<p>For your reference the detailed information: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj874015(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj874015(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>If there are only a few POP3 accounts, we also suggest you use Outlook clients to migrate your data to Office 365. Here’re the detailed steps:</p>

import the data to a pst file.</a> </li><li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-in-Outlook-for-Windows-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up Office 365 account in Outlook client via Exchange</a>.

<p>After that, these data will be synced to Office 365 online server.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When creating a "Received from" inbox rule, it appears that we can only select individual contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if there is a way to create an inbox rule for an entire contact group using the latest Outlook Web App rather then applying the inbox rule individually for all contacts.</p>

            <p>Hi Amrita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not too familiar with the specifics, but I believe the email is a HTTP, non custom domain account (@live.com). It is my personal email which I access via outlook.com. Hope this helps :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be a bit more specific, my inbox consists of duplicate "move message to folder" rules for a number of email addresses. At the time, I thought I could simplify the list of rules by creating a contact group containing all the email addresses, and then specifying
 a single rule for the contact group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I cannot seem to specify the condition "It was received from" if the condition refers to a contact group rather than a specific address. I have referred to your link, and unfortunately cannot find information on inbox rules for contact groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jason</p>

    <title>Excel 365 does not exit when a workbook is closed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jsquareg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 365 does not exit when a workbook is closed</h2>
                    <p>Running Office 365 under Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try close any of my workbooks by choosing File/Close or Clicking on the X in the upper right corner,&nbsp; the workbook closes but Excel remains&nbsp; open showing what looks like a blank workbook.&nbsp; I have noticed when I open a workbook from the desktop there
 are two instances of Excel shown in the taskbar.&nbsp; One remains after I close the workbook as above.&nbsp; Versions 2007 and 2010 did not exhibit this behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The results of searching for a solution to this problem in this forum yielded this as a solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File|Options|Advanced|Display group|Un-Check 'Show all windows in the taskbar'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find the 'Show all windows in the taskbar' in File Options.&nbsp; Perhaps that doesn't apply to 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will someone please tell me how to correct this unwanted behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h2>            Can I add photos to a Works 9 database</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
I understand that MS Works 9 has been discontinued but I hope someone can answer this question anyway.<br />
I just upgraded to Windows 7 (love it!).&nbsp; I want to create a database for a botany project.&nbsp; Can I add photos to a Works 9 database?&nbsp; (I haven't purchased it yet.)<br />
Is there a size limit on Works databases?&nbsp; (i.e. Is there a limit on how big they can become?&nbsp; I expect to document lots of plants.)<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Hi JeremyLyne,<br />
<br />
I'd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Does the issue only occur to the Word client? What about Excel or PowerPoint?<br />
2. Does the issue only occur to the old documents? How about saving the old document to a new copy via Office 2016?<br />
3. To confirm if the issue is related to Office application corrupted, could you try repairing the Office client according to the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>?<br />
4. To exclude the impact of the older version Office, could you try uninstalling the Office client completely via this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-Windows-computer-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-NZ&amp;ad=NZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>and reinstalling to see if there is any improvement?<br />
5. Here is a KB about a similar issue. Please try the steps in it to see the outcome.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ADFS accounts can also map a network drive. First, I would suggest you follow the steps in the KB below to configure the mapped network drive.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2616712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2616712</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Untick Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone when you add the site to the Trusted sites in Internet Explorer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following information for further investigation.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What are your OS version and Internet Explorer version?</span></li><li><span>Which URL do you use as the network drive location? If it is your OneDrive for Business library, the URL should be https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/username_contoso_com/Documents.</span></li><li><span>Are there any error messages? Please share some relevant screenshots with us.</span></li></ol>

<p>Hi T Wag,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, if your requirement is like what KelseyE’s said above, you can refer to the steps below to add multiple alias for an Office 365 account.<br />
1. Login to <a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Admin Portal</a> with an admin account.<br />
2. <b>Admin</b>-&gt;<b>USERS</b>-&gt;<b>Active Users</b>, select the user and click <b>
EDIT</b> on the right.<br />
3. In <b>Email address</b>, click <b>Add new</b> under <b>Other email addresses</b>, type in the alias, and then save.<br />
In this case, emails sent to the primary address and the alias will all be received by this user. However, when this user send emails to others, the recipients will only receive these emails with the primary address as the from address.<br />
<br />
If you want to merge two Office 365 email account data to one account, it is not feasible to directly do this in Office 365. If you have Outlook client to keep emails, you can export one user’s email data to a PST file and then import the PST file to another
 user’s mailbox in Outlook client. Please refer to the two articles below about exporting and importing a PST file.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ca/article/Export-or-back-up-messages-calendar-tasks-and-contacts-d791fe88-5c67-44c5-a3f6-a484508082a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Export or back up messages, calendar, tasks, and contacts</a><br />

<br />
If your requirement is not the same as above, please provide us with&nbsp;a detailed example about the current situation and requirement.<br />
<br />

<h2>            E52 - Hard Reset&#63; Does any key-combination really work&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my new E52 got a new firmware about 2 weeks ago, but has quit work once again yesterday. As my nearest Nokia Service point didnt work this saturday, I am trying to hard reset the phone by myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone has switched off, didnt do anything. Now it doesnt start anymore. Vibration comes, but no display or keypad light nor any further actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the Green+*+3 and Camera+3+* hard-reset options and actually any other one i could find on the net. Was pushing these buttons for one whole minute after and before the vibration came, but it didnt work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me and give me a working option?</p>

<p>here is the codes you need</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rad 24 for credit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With all these operations I recommend you&nbsp;<strong><em>TAKE OUT MEMORY CARD</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><strong>DO A BACK UP OF YOUR STUFF!!!</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE: In front of the hash key ( #) there is also a STAR key that people often miss and state that the
<strong>code</strong> does not work.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><font color="#800080">1</font>.</span></strong>.<font color="#0000ff"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>*#7780#</span></strong></font>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>Restore
 factory settings</strong>&nbsp;- <strong>resets</strong> all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data) Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default
<strong>code</strong> for ALL operations listed here is&nbsp;<strong><font color="#ff0000">12345</font><font color="#993300">.</font></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><font color="#0000ff"><span><font color="#800080">2</font>.*#7370#&nbsp;</span></font></strong>-<strong>&nbsp;<strong>Reformat</strong>&nbsp;</strong>your phone (out of the box, tho keep in mind that most
 newer <strong>nokia</strong> phones at least n series, e series and s60 based phones have udp - user data preservation so not ALL data may be lost. still it is a good idea to always do a back up of your stuff.)3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing
 else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with <strong>hard</strong> formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default
<strong>code</strong> is&nbsp;<font color="#ff0000"><strong>12345</strong></font>)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span><font color="#800080">3</font></span>.
<strong>hard</strong> <strong>reset</strong></strong>&nbsp;- hold the following buttons</span><span><font color="#339966"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>* (star key),</span></strong></font></span><span><font color="#339966"><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>3&nbsp;</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>(number
 button) and&nbsp;</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>talk/green</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>&nbsp;key</strong></span></font>. turn on the phone and do not release
 those buttons until you see the <strong>Nokia</strong> boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding all three buttons ( for
<strong>Nokia</strong> 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a <strong>hard</strong>
<strong>reset</strong>, /<span>GREEN/<span><span><font color="#993300">RED</font></span><span>/<font color="#0000ff">CA</font><font color="#0000ff">MERA</font><span>&nbsp;keys
 pressed all at once on power up. this will only work on 5800's that have firmware version 20... and up. ) For
<strong>Nokia</strong>&nbsp;<strong>N97</strong>&nbsp;(unofficial version but works) is&nbsp;</span><font color="#0000ff">SHIFT /SPACE BAR / BACKSPACE</font><span>&nbsp;while holding the power button. Again do not let go until you see the handshake screen.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If these <strong>codes</strong> are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your
<strong>Nokia</strong> Care Center/Service for assistance.</span></p>

<p>I did try all all three method. The phone recognized all of them. I am not sure if the phone did what these commands suppose to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked to set my phone at the very initial state and I thought that the third method&nbsp; (hard reset) will do this. But, if fact it didin't. My phone was reset not to the very initial state (from factory). I understood this because my new phone keeps after</p>
<p>hard reset the new FW (which I did install earlier) instead of returning the the older FW.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have two questions:</p>
<p>- how to set E52 to its very initial state (from factory)</p>
<p>- there is any place where to download the data of the 1GB SD card&nbsp; coming with E52? This SD card have some themes that I accidentally deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your phone will NOT revert to old Firmware because of a Reset. FW is burned into the phone and will stick,untill you flash it with some other (older or newer) firmware.</p>

            About the default themes in your microSD, I think I could help. I will upload the four default themes somewhere sometime. I got their installation files from some site. I just couldn't recall what site that was. I will keep you posted.

<h2>            I don&#39;t understand RSS feeds and CFL</h2>
                    <p>How the heck is this supposed to work? Even though I set Outlook to sync with the Windows CFL, the feeds in IE are never marked as read and stories are constantly being doubled up. It seems that only at first does Outlook copy the feeds over from IE, then
 just takes care of itself afterwords.</p>
<p>Above all else, the multiple copies of stories is annoying and I'd like to at least solve that.</p>

            Okay, I seem to have solved the duplicating story issue. In Options&gt;Advanced&gt;RSS Feeds, there's an option called "Any RSS Feed item that is updated appears as new". Turning that off stopped the duplication. Now, for the CFL integration. Should marking
 these feeds as read in Outlook mark them as read in IE or not?

            <p>Hi, Rosalily. Have you tried if it also happens to the other apps? You may try rebooting your phone by pressing &amp; holding both power &amp; volume down keys simultaneously for 10-15 seconds. And also, you may check if there's an app update by going to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Phone </strong><strong>update</strong>. Let see if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Font Problems</h2>
                    <p>About a week ago, my Outlook fonts all got much smaller.&nbsp; Smaller as in eye-strain smaller.&nbsp; Other applications (Excel, Word, other non-Microsoft programs) are not affected, so I don't want to reset the entire Windows display size.&nbsp; It's not the reading
 pane (which I know I can zoom), it's the main panes for Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, and Memos.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ultimately been able to manually make some of the function displays larger using view settings, but can't adjust the task display no matter what I try.&nbsp; I also have to resize each mailbox separately -- resizing the inbox doesn't help the sent box, etc.&nbsp;
 With 6 email accounts, this is pretty tedious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Outlook via Office 365 subscription, Windows 10, Dell PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this problem, anyone have a solution?</p>

<p>Hi Missy Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, it seems that all in Outlook look much smaller including Toolbar. Please try following to repair Office applications to check the outcome:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Besides, to determine if it's add-ins issue, please try to open Outlook with <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> to check again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after you tried above, please provide us following information for better understanding your scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Please provide us a screenshot about your Outlook client.</p>
<p>2. The <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
detailed version</a> of your Outlook.</p>
<p>3. When did the issue happen? Is there any other users in your organization who also encounter the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

                    <p>I am using Excel 2013 and sometimes when I select cells to copy it bounces to other files I have open.&nbsp; Then the cell I want to copy into does not highlight and I end up closing out the file and reopening it.&nbsp; Also sometimes the file does not auto back up
 thus I lose recent activity.&nbsp; I am not sure if the problems are connected or not.&nbsp; Very frustrating.</p>

<p>WestminsterFarms,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when it does this, is the cell you are trying to copy have a formula that links to the other file and do you go to the cell that is linked to in that other file?&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, then you can try enabling editing directly in cells in options.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, then disregard
 this suggestion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            MAIL MERGE - MORE THAN ONE MAIL IN THE SAME CELL</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>During mail merge, I saw that it is not possible to send the same mail to more than 1 mail address that are written in the same "to" section.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if there are 3 mails of the same person and they are all written in the same cell even though there is a ";" between each mail, mail merge does not work and I receive an alert.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, there may be more than one person that should receive the same email together in "to" section.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, how can we put more than 1 email address in the same mail in "to" section? (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>If you use the Merge with Attachments utility on my Merge Tools Add-in, it will handle multiple email addresses in the one field where the addresses are separated by a semi-colon and it will also handle CC and BCC addresses where fields for those addresses
 are present in the data source. &nbsp; The "merge" can be executed so that the result of the merge is sent either as the body of an email message, or as a Word or PDF attachment to a message, with, or without other attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Merge Tools Add-in is contained in the MERGE TOOLS ADD-IN.zip file that

<p><span><span><span>to see how to install and use the various tools.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Using those tools, it is possible to perform the following types of merge that cannot be done with Mail Merge “out-of-the-box”:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to e-mail messages either with or without attachments, with the documents created by the merge being sent as either Word or PDF attachments or as the body of the e-mail message.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to individual documents in either Word or PDF format with the filenames being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Many to One type merges, which can be used for creating documents such as invoices where there are multiple records in the data source that have common data in one of the fields</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a document that will include a chart that is unique to each record in the data source</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document with Content Controls</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document that contains Legacy FormFields</span></span></span></p>

</span>Duplex Merges</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a printer that will collate and staple the output created from each record in the data source.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letters type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message where relevant.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an
 Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.<span>&nbsp;
