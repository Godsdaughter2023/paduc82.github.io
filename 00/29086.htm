<h2>            Cisco vpn client minimized to taskbar and stays in status&#58; disconnect</h2>
                    I used 5.0.07.0240 cisco client vpn for 1 mth with my windows 7 -64 bit pc. Worked fine for 1 mth. Suddenly today when I double click on the icon to start it up, VPN automatically minimizes down to the task bar with a status of Disconnected. It does not
 give you the option to hit connect or anything before it minimizes. I have not seen this before and made no changes..but now it just doesnt work. Any solutions??? Did windows just patch automatically breaking cisco?<br />
Unfortunately, cisco does not provide world class technical service....called them up but no use.

<p>No need to upgrade. The problem can be found in the file vpnclient.ini, probably located in the directory "C:\Program Files\Cisco Systems\VPN Client".</p>

</p><p>No high values in logwindX and logwindY but very high values in these lines:</p>

<h2>            Lumia 920 bluetooth pairing failure</h2>
                    <p>First off,</p>
<p>I never had to pair devices just to share a photo before I updated my windows phone to 8.1,</p>
<p>but even before that update I have never been able to pair my computer and phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 8 (can't upgrade for driver reasons) and WP 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, when i tap to pair to PC-</p>
<p>
</p><p>my phone says: <em>"make sure that this PIN ****** matches the PIN that your PC displays"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>my pc says: <em>"Add a device- tap to set up your windows phone"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If i tap that it says: <em>"That didn't work - Adding your device failed, remove it from your pc first then try again"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>and this is a loop which repeats itself until the end of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>So I really messed up my hard drive upgrade and now I am trying to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            So I really messed up my hard drive upgrade and now I am trying to return my system to the way it was.</h2>
                    <p><span>The story behind this is a bit long but bear with me here:</span></p>
<p><br />
So this all started about 2 days ago when I wanted to upgrade my 120GB SSD to a 256GB one. I had heard somewhere that you could clone a hard drive and not have to reinstall your programs so I figured I would give it a shot.<br />
<br />
The first clone attempt was with macrium reflect and just gave a "can't boot" type error. The second attempt was with a data migration utility that came with the drive (Samsung SDM) it also was a failure. Now at this point I probably should have just called
 it quits and gone for a clean install, unfortunately I am not one to give up so easily.<br />
<br />
I did some more digging and found out that there is a difference between a clone and a boot-able clone. The third attempt almost worked, I downloaded Clonezilla onto a USB and made a boot-able clone. Everything went off without a hitch windows booted into the
 new hard drive and all my files where there. There was just one problem. The cloned drive had kept the same partition size as the original and the boot partition was on the right side of the disk, in between the usable and unallocated space. Now this drive
 was working and I probably could have just left it where it was and made a new partition. But I really wanted to have just one partition so I tried to do some re-sizing.<br />
<br />
I used EaseUS Partition Master to try and get everything working. I should have done things one at a time but I am impatient so I tried to do everything at once I resized the boot and the primary partition together. Windows was not happy with this and immediately
 threw a boot error.<br />
<br />
After the third boot failure things started to really go wrong. I don't know if it was Clonezilla or the multiple failed windows boots but my computer started throwing post code errors on every other boot or so. The one I kept getting was 1 long 3 short which
 according to Asus (my motherboard manufacturer) indicates a display error. The display also started randomly loosing video signal in the middle of operation. I would be in the middle of something and it would black out and then the monitor would say "no video
 signal" while the machine was still running. I would then have to perform a force restart.<br />
<br />
So I tried using Clonezilla again. According to Clonezilla the cloning was a success but when I actually tried booting I found that neither drive was working. I did manage to get the 256GB drive to boot in safe mode but it wasn't at all stable. I tried to repair
 the 120GB disk to get it to boot but I don't know enough about using CMD to repair disks and I couldn't get it to work.<br />
<br />
So now I tried just doing a clean install on the 256GB SSD everything was working except I couldn't connect to my network I tried installing drivers, changing IP addresses, restarting my router, and a bunch of other suggested solutions I found online. Nothing
 was working so I did another clean install. Still not working, I assume it must be an OS issue since I have gone through about 20 different forum posts and none of the suggested solutions has worked. All the clean installs and clones up to this point have
 been done with windows 10 but I did have a windows 7 disk on hand so I tried installing that to see if it was an OS issue. Still couldn't connect. I tried connecting the Ethernet cable to my laptop to see if I could get a connection from there, I did. I then
 plugged it back in to my main computer and it just worked...<br />
<br />
So now thinking that I have finally solved all the problems I try yet another windows 10 install. Everything seams to be working alright, I then installed my graphics driver and... it starts crashing every thirty seconds or so. I couldn't even log in long enough
 to uninstall it. This brings us to the final clean install. The machine currently is running windows 10 a slightly older version of Nvidias drivers and a few basic programs (chrome, skype, extra). It is in no way stable; the system will freeze up; the display
 driver will crash (although less frequently now); the monitor will sometimes loose signal and not come back on while the rest of the machine is still running; it sometimes just restarts without warning; and It seams to throw a boot error every couple of boots
 and I can't figure out why.<br />
<br />
So basically I tried to upgrade my hard drive and I skrewed it up... I tried to clone the drive 4 times--all unsuccessfully--I have tried clean installing 5-6 times. My machine will no longer run stably, the display will sometimes just looses signal, and the
 machine randomly restarts. <br />
<br />
I have come to the realization that I have likely killed my new drive. Now I just want to try and return the machine to the state it was in before I tried to upgrade my hard drive. The old drive will not boot but the data hasn't been wiped and I was smart enough
 to back it up to a different computer before I started.<br />
<br />
If I could get this drive to boot that would be ideal because I'm a little scared of clean installs now. The boot process seams to be working but it is a bit finicky I figure I may have to flash the bios. I am hoping that this hole ordeal hasn't killed any
 other components.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be nice.<br />

<p>Hi Belen, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Outdated or incompatible driver is one of the usual reasons why you're experiencing this issue. You need to install the latest audio driver that is compatible with the model of&nbsp; your laptop from your manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly click this <strong><a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to check it. Just type in the
<em>exact</em> model number (<span> e.g.</span><em> 310-14IAP</em>) of your laptop on the search bar under the
<strong>Find Your Product. </strong>Upon choosing your device from the list of options, choose
<strong>Drivers &amp; Software. </strong>Under it, look for <strong>Audio </strong>and you will be able to find a driver that you can download from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance in checking or downloading it , it is best to contact the manufacturer of your laptop so they can further assist you in installing the sound driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you've other queries.</p>

<p>I have had this ongoing problem with my desktop computer for several years now. It used to be about every other month, but recently it's been every update that Windows decides my HDMI audio is not connected, and switches to using the computer's internal
 audio, which has no device attached to it for sound. I play my audio through my TV where my high-quality sound system is connected. Worse, when I do reinstall the correct drivers that Windows keeps replacing, Windows sends a neutered signal with no bass that
 sounds HORRIBLE! I waste an average of five hours A MONTH re-re-re fixing the SAME PROBLEM! I have gone months booting to linux just to avoid the frustration, but eventually I have to boot to WIndows, because two key applications I use don't run well (yet)
 under Linux. It is this continued unfixed audio problem that is driving me to Linux.</p>

<p>Let's try these methods :</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>

<h3> johnmcc_ump  say:</h3>
<h2>            PHP 5.3, MySql, Apache 2.2 interfacing with localhost</h2>
                    I am learning PHP and MySql programming on my Vista laptop using a Sitepoint book entitled "Build Your Own Database Driven Website using PHP &amp; MySql" by Kevin Yank (4th Edition).&nbsp; In the book it has me using PHP 5.3, MySql and Apache 2.2 on my own computer
 set up as a "Localhost" server.&nbsp; Everything was going fine until I created a PHP file where in it Explorer called for a mysqli_connect("localhost", "root<em>", "password"</em>) to interface with mysql.&nbsp;I tried everything including mysql_connect, changing the
 "localhost" to 127.0.0.1 and more.&nbsp; When I researched the PHP website, I&nbsp;found that others had similar problems in both Vista and Windows 7.&nbsp; One found that stated:<br />
<br />
"I've looked into this further and tested with PHP5.2.6 on the same setup<br />
and get the same problem.<br />
<br />
I've seen a few bugs in the database which refer to this same<br />
localhost/127.0.0.1 issue.<br />
<br />
I agree that it's not a PHP issue.<br />
<br />
However, it will become a serious enough issue for people when they move<br />
to 5.3 from a previous version as many PHP-based open source software<br />
packages use "localhost" as their default database server host.<br />
<br />
A lot of people will waste a lot of time unless it is made prevalent<br />
somewhere that:<br />
<br />
"127.0.0.1" should be used instead of "localhost" on Vista<br />
<br />
OR: <br />
<br />
the line "::1&nbsp; localhost" should be commented out in the hosts file for<br />
Vista: "#::1&nbsp; localhost"<br />
<br />
"<br />
<br />
Another said to go into the localhost path file and delete the ::1 Localhost leaving the 127.0.0.1&nbsp; Localhost which I tried to do, but find that even though I am the sole user and listed as the administrator, I can not change it (I have to get system permission).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how I can finish my book and learning PHP/MySql?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            <p>You can download the 8.1 DVD to repair it for free, just search Bing for "create recovery media windows 8.1" to find the official download link to the Windows 8.1 install files.&nbsp; You can use that to repair your install.</p>

            <p>Most&nbsp; laptops include factory recovery utilities. Check the system documentation on how to invoke hdd recovery or how to make recovery DVDs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keys contain the product ID of the version of Windows it is for. The disk would need to be the correct version for the key you want to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manufacturers use specific keys for the Windows installation from the factory, using a keyfinder program&nbsp; on a factory build will produce a key that cannot be used for an installation from DVD.</p>

            <p>If its an OEM System Builder license that was never in use, yes. If its an OEM License from another computer, no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted, the laptop should already include factory recover options that can let you reinstall the operating system from scratch.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>

</p><p>I still see many PDP-1, UNIVAC 1101, PDP-1, Windows 1,&nbsp; 3.1, 95, 98, 2000, NT, and XP. These are still operating at governments, banks, casinos, business, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These old systems are still alive in 2016 and will go on for many more years. Some of these old machines last better than this new stuff that breaks done once the warranty ends. Plus they might our last me. I wonder who will fixes them when I fully retire.
 I should ask for more money next time one of these breaks down and I get the call to come fix them. Will be able to retire soon this way.

                    Update KB4056892 keeps requiring a restart to finish installing, and even worse my windows 10 version 1709 keeps restarting itself randomly to comply with this updates requirement, I have tried uninstalling the update, running the update troubleshooter,
 I have tried all of this on and offline, last I was trying to disable the reboot on the task scheduler but it would not allow me to based on security permissions, please help.

</p><blockquote>Hi,<br />
<br />
One possible reason why an update may fail to install is due to missing update components. To better assist you, we would like to know what specific error message are you getting.
<br />
<br />
Since you have already tried most of the troubleshooting steps we would have recommended, we suggest that you try to download and install the update manually from the
<strong><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=kb4056892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Catalog</a></strong> and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response. </blockquote>
<p>I tried this "solution" and when I tried it did not allow it stating that the update was already installed, then I proceeded to uninstall it and the tried again, this time it installed with no issues but message keeps appearing on the update page, furthermore
 the real problem is not that there is a restart pending message, the actual problem is that if I leave the PC on it would restart by itself as normally scheduled by any update... so I decided to just hammer down the HDD and purchased an SSD, reinstalled Windows
 and now everything works perfect, just did every update before installing drivers or programs, plus I disabled the Windows Update Service completely to avoid future hassles. So in the end I guess that, no... The issue was never solved...</p>

    <title>Mouse Pointer does not hide when typing, even with box checked. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hilltopcomputing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Pointer does not hide when typing, even with box checked.</h2>
                    Hello everyone.&nbsp; I turned on the checkmark in Mouse Properties "hide pointer while typing".&nbsp; However, the mouse pointer does not hide while typing, but instead remains visible all the time.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why this happens?&nbsp; In previous versions of Windows, the pointer should simply disappear when keystrokes are typed, then reappear when the mouse is moved.&nbsp; Not happening here!<br />
<br />
Thanks for any information!<br />

<p><span>Welcome to the Windows Vista Community.</span></p>
<p><span>1.
</span><span>Which application are you working on when you experienced this behavior?</span></p>
<p><span>The hide mouse pointer option only helps you to remove the mouse curzor from
<br />
the focus at a working window so that the cursor does not cover the text or pitcure that you see.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure the mouse curzor is placed inside the application you type, as it will not hide the mouse if it is outside the application.</span></p>

            After Windows 10 1709, you might need to update you webcam driver as well. Go to HP driver support page and download the latest driver.  You can find the webcam driver in "driver-Keyboard, Mouse and Input devices" Category.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a> 
<br />
<br />I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709. If updating the driver does not resolve the problem, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

    <title>Any way to tell if File History backup is working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Any way to tell if File History backup is working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to keep my files backed up regularly (weekly).&nbsp; First, I cannot set an automatic weekly backup.&nbsp; Secondly, when I set the backup to run I can't tell if it's working (so a few times I've cancelled and&nbsp;started again, probably needlessly.&nbsp; Thirdly,
 can I sign out of the PC so another user can get on while my backup is running?&nbsp; Fourthly, during one backup I viewed the event log which indicated errors had occurred.&nbsp; If I hadn't looked at the log I wouldn't have known until the end (hours later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best solution to all the above would be a third party application which is easier to set up, which shows it's progress and which is incremental, so perhaps someone can recommend a reliable one.&nbsp; I really don't have time for all this fiddling about.</p>

<p>There's only one way to know <em>for sure</em> whether your backup is working: Try restoring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows doesn't have a supported image backup utility. Instead, they recommend we use a third-party image backup application. Macrium Reflect is popular, so are Acronis TrueImage and EaseUS ToDo Backup. You'll find plenty of good choices on the internet.
 To help with choosing, look for reviews by professionals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has only one file-and-folder backup utility, and that's File History, but it's awkward to use and limited in its capabilities, as you have discovered. That's because File History was intended to backup individual files, not all your files at once.
 To backup all your files at once you'll need third-party file and folder backup software, although many image backup utilities can also do a file and folder backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a complete file and folder backup you can also use a file compression program, like 7-zip or PeaZip. The same advice applies: look for reviews by professionals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you see how convenient and flexible third-party backup software is, you'll wonder why you wasted time with Windows' own offerings.</p>

            Hi Alan
<br />
<br />The information below I provide is thorough and verbose, but its the truth regarding Backup in Windows 10. and the alternatives you will need to consider. 
<br />
<br />File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

    <title>very high disk usage under windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flyingdutch06  say:</h3>
<h2>            very high disk usage under windows 10</h2>
                    Till about 2-3 weeks ago, my windows 10 laptop was running smoothly. But than suddenly disk activity became very high. And the disk was rattling the whole day long. So after 3 weeks I decided to figure out what was going on. First I searched a couple of
 forums and with what I read there, I did the following:<br />
<br />
-check for any viruses or other suspicious software. Nothing found . Notice that, apart from the disk rattling problem, my system performs "normally". No high CPU usage, or blue screens, or strange popups.<br />
-disabled all notifications<br />
-stopped windows defender<br />
-checked the AHCI issue (was ok on my computer)<br />
<br />
Than, after restarting (and let finish the startup), disk usage dropped till about 20% on the process tab in task manager and under 5% on the performance tab. problem solved... I thought... BUT, despite the fact that according to the taskmanager disk activity
 was close to zero, my disk kept rattling on as before. The whole day long (with the accompanying led blinking)<br />
Than I ran a chkdsk. Nothing found.<br />
Than I downloaded windows performance monitor and ran that. But I cannot really draw any conclusions out of that data.<br />
<br />
Than I decided to do a "clean boot" by disabling all non-MS services and disabling all startups.<br />
<br />
Restart. The rattling goes on for about a minute or so and than... stops!! But..... disk activity under task manager is back to close to 100%! and I see the led blinking, and I hear my disk , but the rattling sound is gone. And after a couple of minutes, finally,
 disk activity drops to close to zero . Both on the performance tab and the process tab and I do't hear any disk activity anymore and the led doesn't blink anymore. Looks like the problem is solved.. But than.. every now and than, disk activity starts again,
 and the rattling is back. For a couple of seconds (10-20 secs) and than silence again. The top I/O processes on the detail tab are&nbsp;<br />
<br />
-runtimebroker.exe<br />
-avguard.exe<br />
<br />
At his point , the problem seems half solved. The rattling is not continuous anymore, but still comes back about every minute or two.&nbsp;<br />
Now I decide to run windows performer again. I start the recorder and wait till the rattling starts again and start recording. The 2 minute recording is here:<br />
<br />
https://www.dropbox.com/s/rgl3pb1fgi6cjee/TIMO-ACER.02-23-2016.10-46-47.etl?dl=0<br />
<br />
That's where I am at the moment. Have no idea what to do next. If anyone would be so kind to have a look at it, and tell me what's going on.<br />
<br />
Thank you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>In the trace the problem did not appear as drastic as you described but the largest process was related to avguard.exe (an antivirus app) and
<span><em>mscorsvw</em>.<em>exe</em> is precompiling .NET assemblies in the background. Once it's done, it will go away.

<p>

            <p>Thank you. I will do both and report back here. But before that I ran into another small problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the "clean boot" didn't really resolve the problem, I wanted to set it all back as before. So I started the configuration tool, ticked of "normal boot" on the general tab and went to the services tab. Now it states "clean the MS services tick box
 and click on "enable all". But the "enable all" button is greyed out. So how do I get it back in "normal mode". I haven't kept a list of all things that were running/stopped before I did the "disable all"... :(</p>

            <p>So I uninstalled avira , no change. Rebooted in safe mode, no change. Did a couple of more recordings and disk activity was close to zero. And than I a light went on in my head. What if this noise wasn't the hard disk, but the fan?? And indeed, by listening
 closer to the fan outlet, the noise seemed to come from there. And by tilting my laptop a bit, the noise changed. So it clearly is the fan...&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I have to open it to replace it. Which is another story. Just one last question, how do I get my PC back into "normal mode" after having done a "cleanboot" because the "enable all" button is grayed out??</p>

<p><span>This will check for any integrity violations</span></p>
<p><span>Restart your system</span></p>
<p><span>I would also&nbsp;suggest you to perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span> </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>

            It would seem to be the steps you are proposing to take to attempt to remedy this problem would be those steps taken by a technical specialist. &nbsp;I might add that no where is there stated a guarantee after having taken the time to go through all these steps,
 that it will solve the problem. &nbsp; Since this issue started subsequent to the Windows 8 download and I have seen several questions regarding dll exception errors wouldn't it be more prudent to release an update which fixes these errors? &nbsp;Either that or should
 the myriad of us who are experiencing problems with the upgrade just take measures to get our old operating systems back and request a refund for our purchase of Windows 8? &nbsp;

<p>I recently resubscribed on my debit card as i finally got a job and got a paid.</p>
<p>However on my Statement i got charged 3 times from Xbox Live.</p>

<p>As you can see , one is a double charge and one is just for the month i just subscribed to..&nbsp; Is there an explanation for this?</p>
<p>I also have another account i used to be subscribed to which i've forgot the email for and the account isn't on my Xbox so i can't check if that is paying for membership..</p>

<p>Hope you can help,</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hey mate, have you also tried a different port on your router, or a direct connection to the modem? If so, it sounds like the ethernet port on your console needs to be repaired. You can call phone support to set that up, or do so

    <title>Change the colour of the Charms Bar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grogsternz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change the colour of the Charms Bar&#63;</h2>
                    Hello everyone. :)&nbsp; I have Win8(not 8.1), and want to change the colour of the charms-bar from red - which I selected during the install of Win8 - to something else, but there does not seem to be any option to do this that I can find. :(<br />
<br />
I did find the standard DESKTOP/PERSONALIZE/COLOR options, but this only allows me to change the window border colours, not the background colour of the charms-bar.&nbsp; This is also the same colour you get in the background when Win8 is booting up.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the right direction please?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any replies.<br />
<br />
<br />
