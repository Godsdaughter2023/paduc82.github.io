<h2>            HELL STUPID WINDOWS 10 AUTO UPDATE - HOW TO STOP THIS FROM DISTURBING MY LIFE &#63; - PART &#35;2</h2>
                    <p>Well, i made this as part #2 as my first post has been locked and i'm not able to reply to that post anymore :</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/hell-stupid-windows-10-auto-update-how-to-stop/b66c58b4-5d5d-4014-82e3-a5fab5df08d3?page=3</p>

<p>Hi Kelvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Totally removing Windows Store under your child's account has no way; however, you can restrict/block inappropriate apps, games &amp; media. Another thing is that if you're worried that your children may download paid apps, you have a way to restrict it so whenever
 they try to download paid apps, the system would be asking for your permission. See this "<strong>Block inappropriate apps, games &amp; media</strong>" and "<strong>Require kids to ask a parent before buying stuff in Microsoft Store</strong>" sections on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12439/microsoft-account-set-child-restrictions-windows-10-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any questions.</p>

    <title>Windows MOBILE 10 Store - no &#34;automatic&#34; updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joostverhoeks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows MOBILE 10 Store - no &#34;automatic&#34; updates</h2>
                    <p>My Windows Mobile 10 store app remains on version 2015.7.15.1 (indeed 2 updates behind current version).</p>
<p>The "check updates" button/function seems not to work any longer (since July 2015). NOt the Store App, but also no other App will show as update available when I check the update button.</p>
<p>When I go to an App and open it in the Store, it will show update and allows me to update.</p>
<p>BUT I get tired of searching manually "the whole time" which App will be updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions how to get the update function back ?</p>
<p>As well as getting me in the current version of the App store on my Mobile ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run since today Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview build 10536.1004, which I hoped would update my store, but it did not happen :-(</p>
<p />

</p><p>I have the same issue, no more "Check Updates" working. I did discuss the issue in another thread (that I don't find at the moment). It might have something to do if you language/regional settings set to outside US (or somewhere in Europe), of if your Microsoft
 Account is connected to a not-US&nbsp; Windows Store (like some applications are only available in some countries). I have tried to change my settings a lot of times, no luck. Still can't get "Get updates" to work.<br />

Wish you luck, tell me if you figure something out!<br />

            <p>Hi Pawan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the advise, however a soft reset did not bring any difference in my situation :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>I have a Lumia 930</p>
<p>No error messages appear whn I press the "check updates" button. The button tunrs grey (as it should), the time turning wheel starts (as showing I am busy, as it should), but after a relatively long time the "check updates" button turns blue again, but NO
 updates show up....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading last week to the newest built has also not resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can give me other suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Joost</p>

<p>Sorry, I overlooked the essence of your remark on September 16 :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the most recent version of the store now to my mobile phone.</p>
<p>I hope the update button now will work as it should. </p>
<p>Can not really test this, since I downloaded this morning manually a few programs.</p>

            <p>I think my installation started to download updates when I got the 10549 build. But it took some time before I realised, because I do not get any notifications when an app has been updated. Then I upgraded direct to 10581. The updates still gets automatically
 updated, and still no notifications.</p>

    <title>Genuine copy of Windows 10 not activating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david george uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Genuine copy of Windows 10 not activating</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I own a digital download copy of Windows 10 purchased from their online store which I've been using for about a year. I've only just recently rebuilt my computer from scratch using the two existing hard drives on with all my files and programmes that I didn't
 want to get lost, re-loaded on and didn't need upgrading or replacing. Now that these hard drives are in my upgraded machine it has the grey ghosted text saying "Activate Windows" in the bottom right corner of the screen and it won't recognise the licence
 key I originally purchased anymore stating&nbsp;"Windows reported that the hardware of your device has changed. Error code: 0xC004F211"<br />
<br />
Is there anything I can do to get my Windows activated and working again without needlessly purchasing another licence or copy?<br />
<br />
I've already gone through the troubleshooting tool found under Settings and it says "We can't activate Windows 10 on this machine - try again later" and "Troubleshooting has completed - we weren't able to activate windows on this device" and this was done by
 clicking the link "I recently changed hardware on this device".<br />
<br />
The online assistant tool gave a number to call for help, but it doesn't work from the United Kingdom.<br />
<br />
Also, strangely my Windows 10 Home is now showing as Windows 10 Pro and it's requesting another £200 for me to purchase a new genuine licence, which I don't want to do because I will have just wasted the £99.99 for the Home version I originally purchased. I
 believe Windows Update may have done something to make my machine now show it registering as Windows 10 Pro but I don't know how else this might affect the activation process, other than making purchasing another licence key twice as expensive.<br />
<br />
I read an article that said I should be able to transfer my licence key to this newly built machine because it is a genuine one purchased from the store, but I'm yet to work out how to do this.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated, especially if you've had experience with an upgrade issue or a new machine, thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
David&nbsp;

            Hi David
<br />
<br />You mention - strangely my Windows 10 Home is now showing as Windows 10 Pro 
<br />
<br />That then is the problem, if your licence is for Windows 10 Home, you cannot activate Windows 10 Pro on your system
<br />
<br />You need to re-install the Home edition on that PC, and it should then self-activate . . .

            Hi David.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You'd never need to purchase WIndows again and can reinstall it as often and in any way you want.  But you must have the correct licensed version for it to activate and it seems you have Pro installed instead of Home
<br />
<br />Unfortunately this requires doing a Clean Install of Home  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is a workaround here which others are reporting working to downgrade Pro to Home so you can try that first from the media created to do the Clean Install: 
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/downgrade-from-windows-10-pro-to-home/345f5464-cb7a-44b3-8856-237cbec072c8">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then do the Home Clean install skipping the Product Key during install and it will activate after connecting to the internet after confirming the correct version.
<br />
<br />To create the latest Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your responses. <br />
<br />
I purchased Windows 10 Home 64 bit in December 2018 and then created a media disc for it using their media creation tool so I can't understand why my new system shows as Windows 10 Pro now as no software or the OS should have changed? I still have all my existing
 programmes installed and I don't see how someone could have removed the Home version and then upgraded it to Pro without losing everything already installed or without purchasing a genuine Pro licence which I've never asked for.<br />
<br />
In any case, I've decided to contact the company who built the new machine for me to see if they've done anything to the operating system and if I can't get it activated I'll probably just bite my tongue and do a fresh os reinstall using the media disc I made
 to see if this solves the problem. I'm irritated because it takes at least a day wasted to load everything back on to the machine again and I thought swapping a ssd with everything I need already on it would be a piece of cake.<br />

            David, that's why I gave you the downgrade work around which is reported by many to be working and will keep everything in place while it downgrades. So you could try that first. Make sure all your files are backed up

            Thanks for the resources and trying to help, but that's far more than I was expecting to do as a home consumer and should not be expected of people, especially without IT backgrounds. Automatically changing a legitimate copy of Windows Home to Windows
 Pro without asking and invalidating the licence key in the process&nbsp;is not only rude and ridiculous but then asking for an extra £200 for a new licence is a seriously bad practise. With serious issues like this in Windows and no official channels of support,
 people will resort to their own methods of resolving things.

            Hi David -
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />It is not possible for Home version to change to Pro without someone's intervention.  Did you take it to a shop or loan it to a friend?
<br />
<br />I gave you a workaround that isn't even official so you'd have an easier way to change it back to Home version.  Did you try that?  
<br />
<br />Otherwise the only way back to Home is to reinstall  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I am sorry you find yourself in this position but it cannot possibly in this case be due to Microsoft's actions.  In fact Microsoft is providing this forum where you have gotten the most cutting edge solution available and the offer from an experienced volunteer to guide you.   I am standing by here if you need me.

<p>Thanks for getting back to me. I have tried to find the driver from Intel website for AV Camera 2500 which I think is the camera on the Surface Book but no luck. I also downloaded some drivers from Microsoft website and tried installing those without any
 luck. The next step I was thinking of was to take my Surface to the nearest Microsoft store for consultation with a tech rep.</p>

<h2>            Surface Studio Locks After Sleep</h2>
                    <p>I think I had these same issues with my surface book. Machine won't wake from sleep unless i do a hard shut down.&nbsp; Then when i do a hard shut down, Windows Diagnostic will pop up and try to repair windows.&nbsp; Any ideas or is this simply more pain with a new
 machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one else having these issues?</p>
<p>

            There is supposed to be a "special" phone number for support for Studio - via an email that was sent to Studio purchasers. There aren't a lot of people with Studio posting here yet. You might want to call that number and see what they have to say. (And
 report back on the experience with that dedicated support path).

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear you're having this issue. As Barb mentioned, there are a few dedicated avenues for support for this product, including visiting
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us</a>. I would encourage anyone having issues with the Surface Studio to try those avenues in addition to Community support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a few questions so that we can better understand this issue.</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Has this happened more than once? </li><li>Does it occur every time the Surface Studio is put to sleep?</li><li>When it occurred, how long had the Surface been sleeping?</li><li>How did you try to wake the Surface from sleep? (i.e. Keyboard, Mouse, Power button)</li><li>What, if any, peripherals are attached to your Surface Studio?</li><li>Has this been occurring ever since you received the device or is this a new issue?</li></ul>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have called and now working with a surface studio tech person but to answer a few questions of yours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes, it has happened several times.&nbsp; In addition, i have had several blue screens and random reboots.&nbsp; I have performed a refresh of the system as well.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It doesn't happen every time but i really don't know because I've changed the power settings to avoid the machine going to sleep.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It general happened when the machine was asleep for a few hours or more.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I've tried waking it with all of the above</p>
<p>5. Nothing attached other than the keyboard, mouse and surface dial.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I've only had it a few days so since I've received it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get Kernal Error for the reboots and today received a new BSOD with Page_fault_in_nonpaged_area due to aiStory.sys or something like that.</p>

<p>I didn't receive such email and there is no such number that I could find. I received my Studio this Tuesday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if someone would post the phone number that I can call. I have the same issue on my Surface Studio - sleep of death problem - just like the SP4 or Surface Book. I have to force reboot it since the system won't wake up. I was like - NOT AGAIN!!!
 (this almost happened on every Windows tablets/laptops that I have owned)! What a joke that a desktop should also have this issue because there is no connected standby to begin with.</p>

            Just as an FYI, I'm not seeing any sleep issues whatsoever with my Surface Studio. It consistently goes into sleep mode, and it instantly resumes back from sleep no matter how many hours (or even days) it has been sleeping. Sorry to hear that you're having
 the issue.<br />
<br />
BTW, I know it's probably not the answer you want to hear, but you might want to run the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimagehttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Studio recovery image</a>, to put your Surface Studio back into its "out-of-the-box" configuration, and see if that fixes the issue for you. If it does, then you can probably attribute the sleep issue you're having to either a configuration change that
 you made to your setup along the way, or even to software/drivers that you might of installed.

            I've only had my Studio for a couple of days, but I've the same issue where I could not re-awaken the computer after it went to sleep. &nbsp;Only thing different I have with my situation is that I have a second external monitor connected...not sure if the second
 monitor has anything to do with it...

    <title>Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver Integrated Driver Issue. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sam_urie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver Integrated Driver Issue.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have recently been searching through forums and have not been able to find someone who has quite the same issue as me. I am running Windows 10 Pro Version 10.0.14393 Build 14393.<br />
<br />
So my problem is that I have the Xbox 360 wireless adapter and I was able to pick from a list of drivers that are already on windows, however yesterday I noticed my controller was not syncing properly to the adapter. So I went into my device manager to reassign
 the driver to the device but there was only one driver there labeled "xbox 360 controller for windows" (which I did hear that with the latest update Microsoft did make it so there is only one driver). I set the driver for the device to the xbox 360 controller
 for windows driver that was my only option and my adapter no longer works. (By not works I mean that I sync my controller to the adapter and instead of displaying what controller number it is, the controller continues to flash until I remove the batteries.
 I have also tried several different controllers and adapters that all work on my brothers computers but not on mine). I am suspicious that some of the integrated drivers in windows 10 have become corrupt. Does anyone have any ideas what may be wrong? If something
 is unclear I would be happy to clear it up for you.<br />

<h2>            xbox 360 controller causing issues with windows how can i turn it off</h2>
                    <p>since i put a fresh install of windows 10 on my pc ive had problems with my wired official xbox 360 controller the issues ive found are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i open a picture it just zooms right in and tries to keep going&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i search on start button for example this pc then i try to right click it it wont let me it just flashes then goes away&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i go into settings the scroll always goes to the bottom i cant get it to stay at the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i disable the controller and reboot or if i unplug it from the pc all these problems are gone!<br />
<br />
i dont want to have to unplug it or disable it! so dont tell me to do that.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
ive spoke to microsoft support half a dozen times (including xbox support) and done everything they asked installing windows again startup repair uninstalling drivers etc etc none of it works and i really dont think this is the correct approach! i need a way
 to turn it off or something so i can leave it plugged in because its very inconvenient to unplug it</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i didnt have any issues with this on windows 7 it worked fine the only issues i had was conflicts with keyboard when i was in a game however disabling it sorted that but again that was annoying.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
it would be nice to have a feature to turn it off i mean i dont play all games with the controller only some and its pretty stupid it likes to fight with the keyboard and mouse controls like for example one of the buttons may be pressed onto something. for
 the record i have no games on this pc yet or steam or anything like that, ive seen solutions for steam but nothing for windows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
i cant be the only one with these problems we should be able to switch it off and switch it back on when we want it. holding down some buttons to do this would be ideal but it all depends on the developers and the software made available for the xbox controllers
 in windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;TDDI178,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing these observations that you experience with you Xbox controller on your Windows 10. In order for me to better determine the right troubleshooting, I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tested if the issue persists when connecting your <strong>Xbox 360 controller
</strong>to your <strong>Xbox 360 console</strong>?</li><li>Are you experiencing the same issue when using a different user profile on your
<strong>Windows 10</strong>?</li><li>Can you still recall the drivers that was updated for you on your computer?</li><li>What is the version and build of your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?
<ul>
<li>You can have this checked by pressing the&nbsp;<strong>Windows button + R</strong>&nbsp;on your keyboard to open the&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong>&nbsp;box, then type&nbsp;<em><strong>winver</strong></em>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime to isolate the issue further, I recommend that you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>create a new user profile</strong></a> and name it as <strong>test</strong>. This way, we'd be able to check the integrity of your current user profile ensuring that it is intact. If you've already performed this, you can also perform the steps indicated
 on this article about&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot your Xbox 360 controller for Windows</strong> under the section&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/accessories/xbox-controller-for-windows-help#bcde2a4eadd6415ca2296f7729e4e0c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot
 any problems</a></strong>. Be advised that the steps indicated for <strong>Windows 8.1</strong> should still be applicable for
<strong>Windows 10</strong>. Since you've mentioned that you've already re-paired your controllers, you might want to run the
<strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</a></strong> to automatically detect and have Windows fix issues that it detects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your response, for me to assist you further.</p>

<p>i dont have an xbox 360&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes same issue</p>
<p>what do you mean recall? if you mean roll back ive tried that</p>
<p>1803</p>
<p>
</p><p>profiles make no difference i already tried. the controller is working as if it can control windows which is pretty stupid if i dont want it to its not like i can easily turn it off the drivers are basic no options for features. you should include something
 so we can switch the controller on and off without having to reach around the back to plug it in and unplug it when im not using it</p>

<p>Is your 360 controller an offical MS controller, or another brand using the XBOX&nbsp; layout and XInput
</p>
<p>(vs the older DInput that uses profiling software) ?</p>
<p>- I always have either an 360 or Logi F310 connected, but I never touch them when not playing a game, and hadn't tried using</p>
<p>them with Windows until now. My Win10 is up to the minute (KB4343909 installed half and hour ago) and the only interaction</p>
<p>I get with my 360 controller is in the Start Menu. Even then I have to click on Start with the mouse to open the menu.</p>
<p>My DInput Logi controller does nothing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Have you tried using another USB port ?</p>
<p>- Have you installed the XBOX 360 Accessories v1.2 software (Note. Link defaults to 32bit version) ?&nbsp;
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-in/products/gaming/xbox-360-controller-for-windows/52a-00003#techspecs-connect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 Controller for Windows | Microsoft Hardware</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If another USB port does not help your controller, perhaps the cable is faulting. The sticks often go off centre when
</p>
<p>worn, and early on may centre after disconnecting and reconnecting, or flicking back and fourth, but over time they tend to stick
</p>
<p>off centre and do things such as the auto-zoom effect.</p>
<p>I don't thinks the buttons would engage without pushing, but a shorting cable could.</p>
<p>

<p>its official i said that in the first line of my post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it only happened when i installed windows 10 onto a blank hard drive and its also genuine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes changed the port&nbsp;</p>
<p>what's accessories? and why would i install them? will it let me turn it off without having to disable it and reboot? or unplug it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the controller is pretty new and has had very little use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had a problem on windows 7 it wasnt the same but if it&nbsp; was plugged in and i went in a game and used the keyboard it would flash between the keyboard keys and the controller keys like they were fighting for control on some games but not all. but i could
 simply disable the controller without a reboot on 7 but when not in a game on windows 7 i had zero problems with the controller probably because there isnt an option to control windows with it in windows 7 and windows 7 lists it differently to windows 10 in
 device manager.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>"what's accessories? and why would i install them? "&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The 360 controller is an accessory/peripheral. Just an odd shaped keyboard. The download is on the 360's page, and even</p>
<p>though I installed the software while still on Win7, I <em>still</em> don't have any issues with the 360 controller conflicting with the keyboard,
</p>
<p>or interacting with <em>anything</em> on it's own with Win10, so I thought installing the software
<em>may</em> fix your problem. Just a wild guess. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, due to your unusual keyboard/controller experience with Win7 in games, I'm inclined to think there has been something
</p>
<p>wrong with your controller from the start, assuming the software provided by MS for the 360 does nothing on either Win7 or 10.</p>
<p>

<p>In Win10 mine shows as, <em>Xbox Peripherals &gt;&nbsp; Xbox 360 Controller for Windows.</em><br />
I had a look last night, and it does get listed with a different title in Win7, but it's sill an XBOX 360 specific item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Logitech F310 also shows as an <em>Xbox 360 Controller for Windows </em>when it's set to XInput mode.</p>
<p>Switch to DInput and it shows in <em>Human Interface Devices</em> as<em> Logitech Dual Action
</em>(two entries).</p>

maybe its not available for windows 10? or its probably called something different knowing microsoft!&nbsp;</span>

<p>&nbsp;When you did the clean Win10 install did you also download and install the most recent drivers for your motherboard from the mfg ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Win7 version of the Accessories software works on Win10 too.&nbsp; 7&amp;10 both have the same XInput&nbsp; files that the 360 uses,
</p>
<p>so the OS version shouldn't matter in this case.</p>
<p>If installing the 360 software does not help, you may have another software installed that is conflicting with the keyboard and 360.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If not, I don't know where to look other than the hardware, especially as you had the situation on Win7 with the keyboard and controller</p>
<p>interacting. I use both keyboard and controller in games that have both foot and vehicle modes,&nbsp; so I keep a controller plugged in most</p>
<p>of the time, but have never noticed what you describe on either Win7 or 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever the cause I doubt MS is going to add a 360 on/off switch to Win10. They would need to hear from hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p>users with the same problem. Next best, maybe less tidy option for quick disconnect, is to use the USB&nbsp; at the front of the case</p>
<p>(or on a monitor/keyboard if available) rather than a back panel USB.</p>

    <title>Surface pro 6 heating up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miriam adkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pro 6 heating up</h2>
                    I have had the Surface Pro 6 for about two days now. As far as I am aware, this is a fantastic device. But there is a flaw I am concerned about. As a student entering college, I am worried my computer might not last. It has been heating to very hot temperatures.
 I am concerned it might over heat and die on me early. This is very expensive and I cannot afford to have it die on me. Does this generation of surface pro have this common of a problem? Is there a way to cool it down and fix this problem? I am going into
 art school and need this laptop for drawing and it almost hurts my hand when I run any sort of drawing program. Any advice or answers would really help me.&nbsp;

            <p>Usually when these are brand new, they are downloading tons of updates and<br />syncing with OneDrive and very active. However, it should not burn your hand.<br />These devices are supposed to shut down when too hot and would display a<br />thermometer icon when in that state. Which drawing programs are you running?

            I haven't downloaded any art program yet. I have just been experimenting with the 3D Paint app that came with the device. It has just gotten to the point where it feels uncomfortable to hold and draw with it in tablet mode because it gets so hot.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. The issue is resolved now. The problem is due to the VPN client software due to which Wireless adaptor had problem. I switched back to Windows 8 and uninstalled the VPN and upgraded to win10 again which resolved the problem.</p>
<p>

<h2>            BSoD win32kfull.sys &#63;&#63; Need some help please.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm having a problem that I cant quite figure out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently started having some BSoD's, it started not very often, but now its around once per day while having no pattern at all. I can play games and it happens, I browse the net and it can happen. I cant pin down a reason for when it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when it does I get this error</p>
<p>
</p><p>system_service_exception win32kfull.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to figure out how to access my BSoD dump files but I'm a bit new to that so its kinda confusing me. in my startup and recovery settings it is set to write an event and auto restart, its also set at "automatic memory dump" and the dump file is
 %systemroot%\memory.dmp and will also overwrite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is I cant figure out where that is!, there is no file called memory.dmp. I have a minidump folder which has some .dmp files in it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 pro, and its up to date as well. </p>

            <p>Hi Josh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing more info about the issues you are facing. Your win32k.sys file has been&nbsp;corrupted in the debugger memory and it does not work correctly. Do the following</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Did you added new hardware like RAM, Sound CARD or any other peripherals try removing it manually from system, if problem persist check for the hardware driver&nbsp;updates on manufacturer website.</li><li>If you use more than one slot for RAM (2x2 or 4x4) in this pattern try removing one of them and switch.</li><li>Check your system for viruses.</li><li>Unfortunately you have a driver for you graphics adapter that assumes that the old bugs in the windows were fixed with the updates that you failed to install. Basically, install the fixes or your system will bugcheck sometimes .</li><li>run chkdsk /f /r (CMD)&nbsp;on your drive<br />
</li><li>run system file checker, sfc.exe /scannow (CMD) to fix corrupted OS files.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a try and let us know if it helps.</p>
<p>

    <title>CANNOT CONNECT TO INTERNET VIA CABLE ONLY VIA WIRELESS&#59; VISTA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b.2.0  say:</h3>
<h2>            CANNOT CONNECT TO INTERNET VIA CABLE ONLY VIA WIRELESS&#59; VISTA ISSUE</h2>
                    I have vista home premium on my laptop.<br />
<br />
I am able to connect to the internet via my wireless connection.<br />
<br />
I am unable to establish a connection however, using an ethernet cable and modem.&nbsp; I have tried using different modems and cables at friends and family's houses.&nbsp; None of them have problems connecting via their equipment, only I do.&nbsp; Thus I know that is is
 not a cable or modem issue.<br />
<br />
It recognizes that there is a modem when i go to "connect to" screen.&nbsp; However, every time I click on the modem and select connect, it says, connection failed.<br />
<br />
What the ____ is wrong with&nbsp; my VISTA?<br />
<br />
And yes, I have downloaded all updates!

<p>Hi B.2.0,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;What is the type of Internet connection? Is it dialup or DSL?<br />
•&nbsp;When was the last time it was working?</p>
<p>First I would suggest that you try running the Network Diagnostics on the computer to check where the problem is occurring.<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;Open <strong>Network Diagnostics</strong> by right-clicking the network icon in the notification area, and then clicking
<strong>Diagnose and repair</strong>. <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/The-doctor-is-in-Using-Network-Diagnostics-in-Windows-Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/The-doctor-is-in-Using-Network-Diagnostics-in-Windows-Vista</a></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Make sure that all wires are connected (for example, make sure your modem is connected to a working phone jack or cable connection, either directly or through a router).<br />
•&nbsp;Reset your modem and router. Remove the power cord from the modem and/or router, wait at least 10 seconds, and then plug the modem and/or router back in.<br />
•&nbsp;Check your router. Because of the new networking features in Windows Vista, some older network routers are not fully compatible with Windows Vista and can cause problems. You can test your router to see whether it is fully compatible with Windows Vista by
 running the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=111382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Internet Connectivity Evaluation Tool</a>. Or, for a list of routers that are compatible with Windows Vista, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=92749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Logo’s Products List</a> website.</p>
<p>For more information refer the below link.<br />

<p>If the above step does not fix the issue then I would suggest that you visit the network adapter manufacturer website download and install the driver update.<br />

<p>My xbox is making a buzzing noise only when in games when its on a loading screen of a game the buzzing goes away. It sounds like this.</p>

<p>It is a little quieter than this. The only way I can describe it is the sound of crickets, or a sonic screw driver</p>

<p>Onto the actual problem - if it's that quiet, it's not necessarily an issue (they'll typically make a faint hum) but try doing a complete power cycle and see if it's improved at all after that.</p>

<p>It sounds like you have a loose fitting for your drive or something is inside your console. It shouldn't sound like that, mine doesn't.</p>
<p>Does it make that sound when you play digital games without a disc in the drive?

<p>Could be a bearing/loose plastic near the fan if it does it when under load (games). It shouldn't sound like that and you should contact Microsoft Support for a potential replacement or back to the retailer if you still have the receipt (based on your Gamertag
 you are in the UK so you may be covered by return laws).</p>
<p>If you bought online it is 7 days to return it, if you bought it from GAME etc then you have longer and may be quicker than going via Microsoft.</p>

<p>You sometimes hear the fan or disc starting up or spinning up but that lasts about 3 seconds.

<p>Other then that I have to put my ear pretty close to the top of my X1 to hear a low hum kind of sound.

<p>I have a similar noise (sounds like a faint laser like sound) coming from my console. It was not there several months ago. I first noticed it around the time the March update came out. Happens during loading screens usually.

<p>There's 2 main sources of noise in the Xbox One: -</p>
<p>1. The fan. In the video the OP linked to, that sounds like a fan issue to me as it's making a kinda metallic sound. It definitely shouldn't sound like that. It should just sound like a very quiet whooshing of air - exactly as you'd expect a quiet fan to
 sound.</p>
<p>2. The hard drive. Because the fan in the One is so quiet, you can more easily hear the hard drive activity.</p>
<p>You're never going to get an Xbox One that is truly silent and when people say "mine is silent" they just mean that it's extremely quiet, but if your fan sounds like the one in that video then it's faulty.</p>

<h2>            Windows Action Center is Not Responding in Windows Explorer....</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have the little Action Center toolbar icon and everytime I try to click it to take me to the Action Center main window&nbsp;nothing pops up, and when I click a drop down menu Windows Explorer responds that Windows Explorer has stopped working. Please help!
 I've tried everything I can think of. I've scanned with Norton and Defender and done other virus scans as well and nothing has popped up. I have also checked other forums and this problem does not seem to have been sufficiently solved in any of them. Thank
 you!

<h2>            Qt platform plugin issue -- What is this&#63;  Is it self-fixable by the common person&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I turned my laptop on, and after signing in, this message appeared:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "windows" in "".&nbsp; Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am fairly tech-savvy for someone with no official training, but all of the resources that I can find to try to help solve this problem are much above my level.&nbsp; I've tried reinstalling OneDrive and Google Chrome, but that isn't the root of the problem.&nbsp;
 I've also tried to re-update Windows 10, but it said it was already fully updated. &nbsp; Is there anything that I can do to try to fix this problem, or do I need to seek out the help of a professional?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any and all advice.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Concerning your original issue with QT, try booting in to <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong></em> and run your QT application.
 If everything works without the error code:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "windows" in "".&nbsp; Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, we suggest contacting the developer of the problematic application and verify with them if the version you have will work with your version of Windows 10.<em>
</em></p>
<p>To confirm your exact version of Windows 10, just press <strong>Windows</strong> key +
<strong>R</strong> &gt; type in <em><strong>winver</strong></em> &gt; <strong>Enter</strong>.
</p>
<p>A window will appear like the one below.</p>

            My experience wasn't exactly like yours, Meghan, but it may give you a start. I am working in Python in the PyCharm IDE. By default PyCharm 2018.1 gives you a project with a virtual environment (q.v.). The setup didn't copy the missing file to the venv;
 I solved it by switching to the global interpreter: File/Settings/Project:&lt;name&gt;/Project Interpreter. In the drop-down selection at the top, select the interpreter that is not in the venv. This removes much of the protection of the virtual environment, but
 that doesn't matter to a patzer like me. Hope this helps somewhat.

 It is&nbsp; a safe and trusted file from a safe source,&nbsp; Simple record-keeping program. &nbsp; How do I get past this Windows 7 automatic, "no-option to continue" type of block?

            thank you --&nbsp; I tried saving the attachment as a download and then opening it.&nbsp; still no luck. "Windows has found that this file can harm your computer."&nbsp; I have asked the person who sent me the file to re-send it so that I can try another attachment --
 maybe there really is something wrong with the one initially sent?&nbsp; will let you know after receiving and downloading the attachment and trying to open.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Connect 10 Tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hayleebernet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connect 10 Tablet</h2>
                    <p>Hello there, im really hoping that someone can help me. We have just been bought a Windows Connect 10 Tablet for our daughter. I set it all upp the other night and it was working fine. After a couple of days i have gone back to use it and for some reasons
 i now cant get through the log in screen. I have read about the updates that caused issued with log ins so followed the steps to restore it factory settings (Shift and Restart, troubleshoot etc etc) but when it gets through to the Reset this PC screen (where
 it shows accounts to choose/forgot password link) everything freezes and i cant touch anything or select an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to reset the tablet to factory settings or anything else that anyone can advise please!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desperate mother of a little girl that wants to watch Teletubbies on her tablet :-)</p>
