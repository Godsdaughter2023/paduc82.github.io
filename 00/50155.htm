<h2>            TEAC CD-224E</h2>
                    I Have XP with 3 service pack and have recently purchsed a TEAC CD-224E USB CD-Rom. My computer reconizes the device, but when I put in a CD of any kind, I cannot play or read it. My USB is not 2.0 -&nbsp;Is that the problem? I am using Nero Ahead software
 and have had no other problems with any USB devices (printer, old CD-Rom, Flash Drives, etc.) Any suggestions?

<h2>            Please give me solutions to why my extended monitor is not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    Please give me a real solution to this problem. &nbsp;I am sick of trying everything out there when the solution did not work. &nbsp;MY hdmi cable is plugged in and yet it doesn't recognize a second monitor and won't give me option to extend. &nbsp;It works fine on my
 work computer so please explain why it doesn't work on this brand new dell all in one. &nbsp;I am so sick of people telling me bogus answers or thinking they know what the problem is. &nbsp;MICROSOFT - this is your issue - please respond and don't tell me to make sure
 my computer is plugged in and don't tell me you have a solution and it will cost $200. &nbsp;This is 2017 people, this should be a no brainer so why is it not working.... I know you know what the issue is but if I have to hear clean boot, safe mode -- bs... just
 fix it because it never worked and the computer is new and you don't get to blame it on anything else except your own incompetence. &nbsp; SOOOOOOOOO &nbsp;FRUSTRATING!!!!!!! &nbsp;Windows 10

    <title>Changing default location for windows folders, appdata etc. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> infernonightfire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing default location for windows folders, appdata etc.</h2>
                    With the SSD drives it makes sense that an update be issued to make it easy to change the default location for documents, appdata, temp files etc. All that stuff that clutters our c drive.
<br />
<br />
I have seen the other posts that had info on this but none of it worked and as they were a year or more old probably finished lol. More importantly, it appears changing the location of these files will cause problems with updates.<br />
<br />
Also, I never use the new&nbsp; "metro apps" as they do not fit into the way I use my computer. As I usually have multiple apps running on a dual monitor system and actually LIKE the desktop I see no reason to switch to metro apps. My favorite programs are not metro
 apps lol.<br />
<br />
Isn't it time for Microsoft to recognize that the boot disk should be just that? A boot disk. The other things that are necessary to a system such as temp files, documents, appdata, user files etc should be something that is managed at install and/or from the
 control panel. <br />
<br />
If there is a way to not break windows, that isn't more complex than a linux install to do this perhaps someone could do a step by step for dummies?<br />

            <p>You can relocate a great number of things, including all user shell folders (including Contacts, Documents, Downloads, Favorites, Music, Pictures, Searches, SkyDrive, Videos, Saved Games, and more), as well as other items you mentioned such as Temporary
 cache, and more.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The easiest way to relocate is just right-click any one and choose Properties, then change the location on the Location tab.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft also provides a 1-click switch to move all your personal documents to another storage center when one is detected. For example on a Surface, there is a 1-click switch to specify you want all your shell folders to be stored on the SD card instead
 of internal storage.&nbsp; Options like this will only grow more and more as the operating system matures.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PS. I don't use Metro either really, I'm here using my Windows 8 PC just as if it was Windows 7. You'd be hard-pressed to even notice a difference. Just a regular ol' desktop here.</p>

<h2>            Starting Gears of war 4, hangs at the start-up splash screen</h2>
                    <p>just recently re-installed it for about the 5th time, first time after the official launch of the game though, at least it isn't telling me it failed to start then telling me to re-install this massive game... however right now all it is, is a hard drivesink
 for me which i can easily fill with other games. So since windows 10 has all the directX visual studio files etc built in, why is this not running for me? i re-enabled that INCREDIBLY annoying UAC because i heard microsoft apps dont work with it off but no
 results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Also once it crashes it prevents my start menu from opening anymore, and i can't find it in the process list during or after it crashes so i need to reboot to fix the issue.</p>

    <title>PC wakes up every 8th minute of every hour when Wake on LAN is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justice ranger  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC wakes up every 8th minute of every hour when Wake on LAN is enabled. How do I stop it without disabling Wake on LAN&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Alright. I've been fighting this for a week straight and I'm not giving up!<br />
<br />
Basically, I turned on Wake on LAN because I need it. Ever since, my computer will wake up at exactly every 8th minute of the hour (6:08, 7:08, 8:08, ...). If I disable that setting or just turn off my WiFi the problem goes away, but I lose Wake on LAN.<br />
<br />
I have a detailed post of what I've done to troubleshoot and gather info <a href="https://redd.it/6rcyvs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. I already contacted Intel and they said everything seems to be working with my wireless card. That post also contains log info, what I've tried that doesn't work, and what stops the problem but prevents Wake on LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm leaning on the idea that this might be a bug, but I can't know for sure. Any help would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
Edit:&nbsp;Go here to see my solution progress in more detail:&nbsp;https://redd.it/6rcyvs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good enough workaround for now: Increase your Access Point's "Group Key Update Interval". I found that setting in the same place as defining the wireless channels to use for each band. The dev's were lazy and set a limit to the number of seconds between
 each key change to be the same value as the maximum port number you can use. That equates to a little over 18 hours. So I set it to 12 hours and reset the router at a more convenient time so it's more predictable.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you provided, it looks like this issue is occurring because of the motherboard being incompatible with this networking feature. You may be able to use the feature but the fact that it is not compatible means that there are issues
 that may arise. It would be best to contact your device manufacturer for recommendations of motherboards that is compatible to be used with the Wake on LAN feature.</p>
<p>

<p>Hey Katrina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for this to be a bug on the software side? If all it takes for me to fix this is me disabling Wake on LAN on my WiFi device, then it sounds like it could be Windows not filtering which packets it should correctly wake up and respond to. Also,
 whatever the problem is, somewhere in my system or access point is a timer set to every 8th minute of every hour. If I can prevent whatever that timer is or actively ignore whatever it is, then I'm in the clear. I just need to know what that could possibly
 be.</p>

            I connected to a different AP and the computer didn't wake up on the 8th minute! As a separate test, I reconnected to my WiFi and put my PC to sleep. I unplugged the power from the AP and my PC turned on! What could cause this?&nbsp;

<p>These things happen because the motherboard that your using is not supported. While some features of Wake on LAN may work, as long as the motherboard doesn't support it, it won't work as expected. We suggest that you upgrade to a motherboard that fully supports
 this feature.</p>

<h2>            So my account was hacked, is there anything else I can do&#63;</h2>
                    First things first, I honestly don't use Skype. Haven't used it in a long time anyways. Well, earlier today I've received some emails stating that currency was converted, Skype delivered an order and then "I have a refund from Skype" with the total amount
 listing PLN75.00. I have no idea what PLN is, but I assume it stands for Poland?
<br />
<br />
Either way long story short, I've since changed my password. I noticed an unusual Visa card still registered to the account, as well as a strange billing address and name. I've removed both. Is there something else I should be doing or am I good? I just don't
 want to get into some trouble due to the fault of some hacker. <br />

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />
<br />I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />You have done the right thing :-), which was to change the password and remove from the account the info that was not yours.
<br />
<br />Additionally, I would recommend that you check this pages which include relevant recommendations from Skype regarding the safety of your account:

<h2>            Windows 10 does not load properly</h2>
                    <p>Good Grief!!! Even when I tried to send a question the program froze!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having the same problem every day with my BRAND NEW CCOMPUTER. I downloaded the Windows 10, (because really, the computer warning said I had no choice), and just like that, my computer started to freeze up. Every time I turn it on, every time
 I have to do a hard boot (because it's froze again), it just tells me that Windows 10 did not load properly then it promptly freezes. In the event that I do finally get online, within five minutes, it freezes up again. Did I mention that this is a BRAND NEW
 COMPUTER???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell me what the heck I need to do to enjoy my computer???</p>
<p>

<h3> tlee212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft License Verification Process</h2>
                    <p>We received an email from a woman who has in her signature:&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(127, 127, 127, 1)">

<p>Her email address has a *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>We are a small organization with 2 people, so I am surprised that this was sent to us - "Your organization has been selected to complete a Microsoft License Verification process.&nbsp; This process is designed to review the Microsoft software you have deployed,
 comparing that to the corresponding license entitlements"<br />
</p>
<p>Is this something we should ignore?&nbsp; My suspicions are that this is a sales scam or something we should ignore.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

            No, you will either need to first copy of the contents of the DVD disc to a folder on the local drive, the copy the content of the folder to a DVD using the DVD burning wizard.

<br />Otherwise, a third party free program such as ImgBurn can do a direct copy to another DVD for you.

<p>That just means that the port is ready to be used for optical audio purposes. It is there by design to make finding the port more accessible. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>There should be, but if for some reason it broke off and the light is bothering you, feel free to put some electrical tape over it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the port itself.&nbsp; Someone else has said it better than I can:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"I am guessing you are talking about a TOSlink output for your SPDIF. It is the visible carrier beam and is modulated with the digital data. It means it is turned on and likely working."</p>

            The light on you other console may possibly not be lit due to the audio setting on the other console being different to this console and as others have said there is nothing to worry about this is perfectly normal.

<p>
<span>If you bought a computer with Windows preinstalled there should be a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker somewhere on your computer, on some laptops it’s in the battery bay. It will
 have a 25 character alphanumeric code on it - that is your product key. If it's not on your computer look in your paperwork or on any CD/DVD cases that were included with the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you bought a retail copy of Windows 7 the key should be included in the box.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you bought Windows 7 online and downloaded it the key should have been sent to you through email. If you bought from the MS Store you can log in to your account to view your key.</span></p>

<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ -
 check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it
 must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</p>

    <title>Cannot &#34;open&#34; or &#34;explore&#34; a dvd or CD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terry franklin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot &#34;open&#34; or &#34;explore&#34; a dvd or CD</h2>
                    For both commerically burned or home burned CD's or DVD's, I cannot open them in explorer. Basically, nothing happens. When I go to a command prompt and cd to the drive's directory (E: in my case) I can see the files with a "dir" just fine. Just not in
 windows itself.<br />
<br />
Another symptom of probably the same problem, is when I pop in a blank DVD the Autorun options pop up. If I select to burn a dvd using windows explorer, the first window pops up where it asks for a name for the disk to burn and lets me select which way to burn
 it, but when I click next nothing happens.<br />
<br />
It's not a hardware problem as if I select to use another utility to burn the DVD from the Autorun options list, the other software is able to burn the DVD fine.<br />
<br />
I don't care as much about the burning problem -- I just want to be able to open and explore cd's and DVD's and can't except from the command line.

            Hello Zezlot and DeathStalker,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; I've taken the direct quotes from one of the links that was given in answer to Zezlot's problem.&nbsp; This is going to be the correct&nbsp;answer that can be&nbsp;supplied on<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Windows Vista forums</span></em></strong>.&nbsp;
 Please read carefully as it describes who should give you a replacement cd-key and the proper way to get&nbsp;one.&nbsp;
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This was originally given by Sreekanth47 in the second post.&nbsp;</span></em></strong>

<br />
<br />
<span>There are solutions for
<em>some</em> copies of the game. This problem is caused by new copies of <em>Age of Mythology - Gold Edition</em> being shipped with the same CD-Key. Since a CD-Key can only be logged onto ESO once at a time, this causes these copies to never or almost never
 work online.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em> </em></span>This is a very common problem that many new users have been facing ever<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em> since Microsoft gave the distribution rights for Age of Mythology to other

</span><span>BDKRJ-HFRHW-8W3YV-*****-*****</span><span><br />
<br />
Luckily, our users have found that these sellers are able to give out new, unique, CD-Keys. Firstly you'll need to check the box of your recently purchased game to find the vendor. The following vendors are known to sell
<em>Age of Mythology - Gold Edition</em>: </span><span>Valusoft</span><span>,
</span><span>Ubisoft</span><span>,
</span><span>That's Hot</span><span> and
</span><span>Xplosiv</span><span>. Once you find your vendor, follow the directions under
 the corresponding header below:</span>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Ubisoft</span></span>

<a href="http://forums.heavengames.com/redir/http:/ubisoft-en.custhelp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>this page</span></a>, asking for new CD-Keys for online play. You will probably have to provide certain information from your CD or box. For more information,

</span><em><span>Recently people have reported that Ubisoft were only given a certain amount of new CD-Keys from Microsoft and have now run out. At this point, there
 is nothing you can do except try to get a refund and find another copy of the game from a different distributer.</span></em></p>
<p><span>Microsoft and Ensemble Studios is printed on all versions, because they released the original game. If you have
 a shared CD key, then "Ubisoft" or "Valusoft" can definitely be found on your cover or manual somewhere.
</span><span><br />
The only other alternative is that you still have an "original" game from Microsoft. This can only be the case if your copy is old, or you bought one that has been rotting on the shelf for over a year. In that case, your CD-key is unique and should work. Unless
 you bought it second hand, and the original owner is still using it, that is.<br />
</span></p>
<span><br />
Below is an example of the how a owner got repalcement cd-key<br />
I FINALLY GOT MY NEW CODES!!!<br />
<br />
I had to send the original codes (keep a scan or photo copy for yourself) to this 'snail mail' address:<br />
<br />
I sent mine registered/return receipt. Cost about 5 bucks.<br />
<br />
email them first and establish a case number.<br />
<br />
Here is what I sent them via email<span> </span>MAKE SURE YOUR GAME INFORMATION IS SPECIFIC TO THE GAME YOU PURCHASED) I have blanked all the numbers I used. Feel free to copy and paste the text.<br />

Greetings,<br />
<br />
I am one of the lucky purchasers of the "everybody has the same CD Key as me" <br />
release.<br />
I consistently get the error message: "YOUR CD KEY CANNOT BE VALIDATED. PLEASE WAIT A FEW MINUTES AND TRY AGAIN"<br />

    <title>Answer Found&#58;&#58;The System Image Twlightzone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> escapedaweb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Answer Found&#58;&#58;The System Image Twlightzone</h2>
                    <p>&lt;insert Rod Sterling's Twlightzone tune here&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello MS Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today's episode of Twlightzone is restoring my system image from BIG DRIVE to small drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a system image of my old drive (1T drive) stored on a 500gb USB drive, and then I bought a 250gb SSD (thinking that I am gonna live on the fast lane on a Ferrari).&nbsp; I fed my CD drive with a Windows 7 Recovery disk.&nbsp; When the Recovery disk menu popped
 up, I plugged in my USB (500gb) drive.&nbsp; A few seconds of waiting, the Recovery program found my system image (Yayeee).&nbsp; I was all smile at this point.&nbsp; I felt some goose bumps.&nbsp; I was excited.&nbsp; But that turned to "Boooo" when I saw the next pop up.&nbsp; The message
 said:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>"</strong>No disk that can be used for recovering the system can be found.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Details"</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I checked my 250gb SSD SATA connections to make sure that my little Frankenstein was getting enough zolt of electric smoothie.&nbsp; I rebooted and tried the same step again and again.&nbsp; I was living the life of the Groundhog's day.&nbsp; And
 I was getting better though--improving upon my prior steps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I even re-imaged my 1T drive by shrinking the partition size of my C: drive because I read in this Community that shrinking and dropping partitions help with restoring system image to smaller disk.&nbsp; I put my drive on the FASTEST Biggest
 Loser diet.&nbsp; Speedos, here it comes!&nbsp; I had 3 partitions:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Partition 1 ---&gt; C: (my OS) ---&gt; partition size 120gb ---&gt; OS used 85gb</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Partition 2 ---&gt; D: (my games, yes I play them sometimes) size 500gb&nbsp; ---&gt; I dropped this Partition</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Partition 3 ---&gt; E: (my files/junks/hoarder files) size 3gb ---&gt; I dropped this Partition</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">After dropping Partition 2 and 3 (unallocated--invisible to my OS), my 1T drive was left with the C: drive (85gb used out of 120gb).&nbsp; 820gb+ was invisible to my Windows 7.&nbsp; I re-imaged my OS along with its little EFI partition buddy
 (100mb). and I was, once again, excited for my Frankenstein to come ALIVE!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I encountered the exact same error message and my SSD was lifeless.&nbsp; I would have given it CPR if someone in the Community had a success with it.&nbsp; OK, I wanted to be the first person, so I gave it a shot.&nbsp; Folks, CPR didn't work,
 so please don't try it.&nbsp; I must really like my computer</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">This Twilightzone is total idiotic.&nbsp; Is my restore system image not working because the system image cares about the real size of a hard drive?&nbsp; It seems to me that MS' system image restore doesn't care about the size of the partition
 because after dropping Partition 2 and 3 there are only two partitions are left on my 1T drive.&nbsp; It is like my new skinny me doesn't impress the MS' Restore program.&nbsp; It still remembers how I was when I was bigger.&nbsp; My new skinny me looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">EFI partition ---&gt; uses 100mb</p>
<p style="text-align: left">C: partition ---&gt; uses 120gb (OS used 85gb)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">unallocated partition ---&gt; invisible to Windows 7</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Pretty impressive right?&nbsp; Logically, this drive partition set up should work.&nbsp; But the system image restore has an interesting rule where:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong><em>The restored drive (the system image's new home) must be equal or BIGGER than its current home.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">This criterion is quite odd.&nbsp; Since I created my system image from 1T drive, I MUST get another hard drive of equal in size OR something bigger.&nbsp; What if I were to created a system image from 2T drive?&nbsp; What if I created a system
 image from 3T drive, or 4T, or 5T?&nbsp; I would have to buy a Hard Drive equal or bigger in size.&nbsp; Will it ever end?&nbsp; Sooner or later, my hard drive would be so HUGE, I would be sleeping on it.&nbsp; I would hate to see someone without knowing installing an OS on 10T
 drive and create a system image.&nbsp; Now, that would be a fun face to see.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">As of today, my Ferrari is in my garage sitting pretty and no where else to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I guess...&nbsp; I will have to live another day of Groundhog's Day.&nbsp;&nbsp; HELP!</p>

            <p>Hi Frederik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is true that the tools could be better and user friendlier.&nbsp; After trying several times and different ways, I was able to transfer the system image from a large hard drive to a smaller hard drive with success.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But first I must apologize for my rant.&nbsp; My lack of understanding of how partitions can affect a system image restoration to a new smaller drive caused my failures.&nbsp; The transfer problem of a system image from a larger drive to a smaller drive also &nbsp;exists
 in Linux and MacOs worlds, not just MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how I did it and what I used to do it:<br />
- an external USB drive (500gb) ---&gt; stores my system images<br />
- MS' Disk Management (search for "partition" at Windows Start button)<br />
- my 1T drive (current home for my OS)<br />
- my SSD 250gb (my new home for my OS)<br />
- a Windows recovery disk (mine is Windows 7 Recovery for EFI); the BIOS version of Windows 7 Recovery disk doesn't work on the EFI based system images and vice versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>0&gt; Your system is OFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&gt; leave only your OS hard drive connected and disconnect the rest of your hard drives.<br />
--In my case, I have two 1T HDD: one has the OS and the other one has files.&nbsp; I disconnected my 1T file drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&gt; boot up and run MS' Disk Management app.<br />
-- I found it by typing "partition" in the Start button's search box.&nbsp; You should see only one disk which is disk 0.&nbsp; If you see anyother disks, shutdown and remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&gt; on disk 0, keep the following two paritions and remove/drop/delete the rest of the partitions.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 1 --&gt; 100 mb EFI (no drive letter assigned to this)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 2 --&gt; your OS partition "c:" drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- In my case, my disk 0 has four partitions:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 1 --&gt; 100 MB EFI (no drive letter assigned to this)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 2 --&gt; my OS "c:" drive (500gb allocated here but used only 86gb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 3 --&gt; "d:" drive 200+gb allocated here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 4 --&gt; "e:" drive 290+gb allocated here</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I backed up my partition 3 and 4 and then dropped my "D:" and "E:" drives.&nbsp; DO NOT FORMAT YOUR UNALLOCATED block of space.&nbsp; Leave it as "UNALLOCATED".&nbsp; It is VERY important that there must NOT be any active or accessible partitions&nbsp;on the right side of&nbsp;your
 "C:" drive, your OS drive.&nbsp; If you were to create a system image with an active partition on the right side of your OS "C:" drive, your transfer to a smaller drive will fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My disk 0 looks like this after dropping D: and E: drives:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 1 --&gt; 100 MB EFI (no drive letter assigned to this)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 2 --&gt; my OS "c:" drive (500gb allocated here but used only 86gb)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A HUGE UNALLOCATED BLOCK</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&gt; shrink your OS "c:" drive to the size which will fit your smaller drive.<br />
-- My new SSD is 250gb; therefore, I shrunk my 500gb "C:" drive to 150gb.&nbsp; Now, I ended up with more UNALLOCATED block of space on my disk 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After shrinking my OS "C:" drive, my partitions looks like this on disk 0:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 1 --&gt; 100 MB EFI (no drive letter assigned to this)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 2 --&gt; my OS "c:" drive (150gb allocated here but used only 86gb)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A HUGE UNALLOCATED BLOCK</p>
<p>
</p><p>5&gt; reboot your PC to clear up the old/removed partitions</p>
<p>
</p><p>6&gt; run Disk Management and check your partitions.<br />
--I found one hard drive (disk 0) with two active partitions and one HUGE unallocated block of space.&nbsp; There should not be any other hard drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; disk 0 has:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 1 --&gt; 100 MB EFI (no drive letter assigned to this)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; partition 2 --&gt; my OS "c:" drive (150gb allocated here but used only 86gb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A HUGE UNALLOCATED BLOCK</p>
<p>
</p><p>7&gt; Now, connect your external USB hard drive and create your system image<br />
--Windows 7 automatically selects two partitions "EFI" and "Windows (system)" drives for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: At the system image back up screen, where EFI and Windows System drives are preselected for you.&nbsp; You MUST make sure that there isn't any other drive/drives in between EFI and Windows System.&nbsp; For example at the "Confirm your backup setting" screen,
 this is good:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EFI Systems Partition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows7 (c:)(System)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, this one below is NOT GOOD--your system image tranfer to a smaller drive will fail because it failed for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EFI Systems Partition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;some drive name&gt; &lt;some drive letter&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows7 (c:)(System)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you have only one drive (disk 0) connected to your PC and followed step 0 to step 6, this will not happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8&gt; when asks you to create your Windows Recovery Disk, make one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9&gt; shutdown and connect your new smaller drive (do not make it the bootable/master drive; add it as an extra drive). Your new smaller drive should be DISK 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10&gt; reboot and run Disk Management<br />
--At this point, I have two disks: the disk 0 with my OS and the new drive (disk 1).&nbsp; If your new disk is offline, make it online by right clicking on it and select "Online"</p>
<p>
</p><p>11&gt; format your NEW smaller drive (disk 1)<br />
--If your system is GPT, it will format your new smaller drive to GPT; otherwise, if MBR then it will format to MBR.&nbsp; You should be able to access your smaller drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: ONCE AGAIN, DO NOT format the HUGE unallocated block of space on the right side of your "c:" partition on disk 0.&nbsp; LEAVE it as UNALLOCATED.&nbsp; If, for some reasons, you would need to recreate another system image because something had gone wrong, you
 could create one again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12&gt; shutdown your PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>13&gt; DISCONNECT YOUR OLD OS BOOTABLE HARD DRIVE</p>
<p>
</p><p>14&gt; MAKE YOUR NEW SMALLER hard drive the MASTER/bootable drive (disk 0)<br />
--In my case, I disconnected my old SATA bootable OS and then connected my NEW smaller drive to the SAME SATA port where my OLD drive used to be.&nbsp; At this point, my PC is connected to two hard drives:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&gt; my new smaller drive (disk 0)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&gt; an USB external drive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>15&gt; Insert your Windows 7 Recovery Disk (your external drive is still connected)</p>
<p>
</p><p>16&gt; Go through the usual recovery steps; The Recovery program will detect your USB drive and find your latest system image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>17&gt; At this point, automatically, the Recovery program will start transferring your system image to your new smaller drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>18&gt; If everything had gone well, the transfer would finish and the recovery program would automatically reboot your PC off of your NEW smaller drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: At step 17, if you were to get an error message saying something in regard to "...No disk can be used for recovering the system disk can be found..."&nbsp; You may try one of the following two options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a&gt; click "cancel" which takes you to the menu; select "Startup Repair"--the first choice; and reboot and go back to step 16<br />
or<br />
b&gt; click "cancel" and shutdown; you would need to reformat your new smaller drive by reconnecting your OLD OS drive so that you can boot (disk 0); and reconnect your new smaller drive as an additional drive by connecting it as a non-bootable hard drive (disk
 1); AND THEN go back to STEP 10 and try the rest of the steps.</p>
<p><br />
These steps worked for me each time I tried.&nbsp; And I have tried in many different ways.&nbsp; However, I cannot claim that these steps are the bullet proof since there exists so many different PC set ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this could help you.</p>

            Hi Jackin,
<br />
<br />While the books say that 160.X.X.X is not a valid IP Address
<br />
<br />For many years I used a Xerox Digital Press attached to a PC and its IP address was locked onto 169.254.X.X as was the PC it was attached to, and while both the maintenance engineers and myself could not understand it - everything worked fine

            Hi Malcolm
<br />
<br />Do you mean the alphabetical list of applications?
<br />
<br />If so:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (Windows Key + I or click the gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Personalization - Start
<br />

<p>Thanks Rogelio,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have followed your instructions, there are now three small tiles in the top left of the screen,&nbsp; one showing start!! and the other two one says Apps which when triggered gives a full page of the apps instead of the list down the left hand side, the other
 shows the pinned tiles which seems to be self generating? I now can see the Apps but they now take up all the screen&nbsp; in Panoramic style instead of list!</p>

            To resize desktop icons 
<br />Right-click (or press and hold) the desktop, point to View, and then select Large icons, Medium icons, or Small icons.
<br />
<br />Tip
<br />You can also use the scroll wheel on your mouse to resize desktop icons. On the desktop, press and hold Ctrl while you scroll the wheel to make icons larger or smaller.

<p>Hi Dave</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now got the apps on the screen , I do not know if this is part of an update from Windows because the only way I seem to be able to raise is by the start icon top left and apps, then I have a screen full instead of a list, I can't&nbsp; seem to be able
 to recreate it in list down the left side at all</p>
<blockquote>Hi Malcolm <br />
<br />
Do you mean the alphabetical list of applications? <br />
<br />
If so: <br />
<br />
Open the Settings App (Windows Key + I or click the gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />
Go to Personalization - Start <br />
