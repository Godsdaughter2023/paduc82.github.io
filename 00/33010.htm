    <title>Certificate Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davespr1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Certificate Error</h2>
                    <p>On returning from a trip my computer decided to do an update at the same time that the time was changing due to daylight saving.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My first indication of a problem was that the update was shown to be done hours in advance of the actual time (eg. showing it was done at 19:00 when it was only 16:00). The clock was corrected quickly and eventually the update time corrected itself.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, when I went to use a number of my favourite websites such as Facebook I get the error: "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID". This is happening on Edge and Google Chrome.<br />
<br />
I have check the clock is OK, cleared brouser caches, flushed DNS, turned Defender off and on, uninstalled and reinstalled the update, etc to no avail.<br />
<br />
Where can I get new certificates from?<br />
<br />
Is it dangerous to just delete all certificates?<br />
<br />
I've spent 24 hours on this so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Problem solved.</p>
<p><br />
I discovered a few settings which were different between my computer and my wife's (which was working):</p>
<p><br />
1. Firewall was set for a Public computer not Private (I never changed it).</p>
<p><br />
2. The DNS settings on my computer were set to the OpenDNS addresses not 'get automatically'.</p>
<p><br />
I have never used OpenDNS nor made those changes. The mystery now is how it happened. Was it added by a program, the update,...?</p>

            We appreciate the information that you've provided and we’re glad to know that issue regarding the certificate error is already resolved. The possible reason why the DNS settings changed may be caused by some configuration made by other programs on your
 device. These changes are hard to determine since there are multiple applications installed on your PC.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One X TV issue</h2>
                    Hi guys, im having a problem with my xbox regarding my tv and possibly 4k/hdr issues. when im playing a game ever so often the screen will cut out and re-appear randomly. it will re-appear within seconds. and sometimes it will re-appear and the color will
 be dimmed significantly. i thought this might be an issue with the game i was playing, but it does it with every game. also if you open the xbox guide the colors in the guide are dimmed as well. if you go to the home xbox screen the colors go back to normal
 and when you open the game back up the colors go back to normal. my tv supports all 4k/hdr settings that are shown in 4k tv details. i originally thought maybe this was a console issue. i had an xbox one s for a year and it recently started happening. i was
 looking to upgrade to the one x anyway so i bought one a few days ago and i still have the same problem happening. does anyone know if this is a console issue or possibly a tv issue? i have a samsung tv model # UN58MU6070F. i hav

<p>Hello AutoSnipeRid3r,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Are you using the HDMI cable that came with the Xbox One X? The HDMI cable that is included with the Xbox One X is designed for 4k televisions. If an HDMI cable that does not support 4k is being used, it
 could cause issues with the video feed. Is this console enrolled in the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Insider program</a>?&nbsp;We recommend utilizing the article entitled <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/troubleshooting-4k-and-hdr-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshooting 4k and HDR on Xbox One X and Xbox One S</a> in order to resolve this issue. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>

            thanks for the prompt feedback. ive checked all the settings for troubleshooting 4k and hdr. my setup is set how they suggest. and yes i am using the cable that came with it, which is why i am able to get 4k and hdr. it looks amazing, its just when the
 screen flickers and goes dim is bothersome. thats the only issue. 4k and hdr work fine and all the 4k games and those available with hdr support all show there working fine. i will sign up for the xbox inside program as well

<p>Hi AutoSnipe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation you are describing sounds like the TV stops detecting the HDMI cable briefly and when it re-establishes a connection it brings it back in a low resolution mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I would check your TV's settings and see if the firmware needs to be updated. That is the main thing that can cause it to not detect the full resolution capable from the cable and console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your TV is up to date then&nbsp;I have seen a troubleshooting step that may be helpful: Open up your settings and go to Display and Sound&gt;Video Output&gt;Video Fidelity and overscan. Under the column listed as Display, you should see TV connection with a drop
 down menu. By default it should say Auto-detect (Recommended). Select that and switch to HDMI. Select the option to override your TV settings.
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hard reset and power cycle your Xbox</a>. Once the Xbox is back on, go back to the TV resolution and you should be able to set it to what you want and what your TV can handle (4K) and then play your games to see if the issue continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that helps!</p>

            After setting it to HDMI and resetting the console when i select 4K it says my TV doesnt support it. But on Auto Detect it does.&nbsp;

<p>Hello AutoSnipeRid3r,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for keeping us updated. We were asking if the console is enrolled in the Xbox Insider program because the Xbox Insider program can cause issues with the console. This is due to the Xbox Insider consoles receiving the beta or alpha version
 of the operating system. If your console is not enrolled in the Xbox Insider program, we can move forward without referring you to the Xbox Insider support articles.&nbsp;As XBF Diego M stated,&nbsp;it is very important to make sure all the hardware is up to date. Is
 the Samsung TV up to date <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/update-xbox-one-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
as well as the console</a>? Does your Samsung TV have more than one 4K HDMI port? If the television does have a second 4K HDMI port, we recommend utilizing the other port. Please let us know if the screen continues to flicker once the console is plugged in
 to a different 4K HDMI port. Thank you again, and we look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<h3> wired2code  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell 1600n Printer goes Offline after Shut-down &#47; Restart</h2>
                    I have a Netgear 802.11g wireless router with an HP 6840 printer &amp; a Dell MFP 1600n printer attached via ethernet cables.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My various Macintosh, Windows XP and Vista computers have been printing to these priinters via wireless connections without problems for the last&nbsp;several years.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I got a new Lenovo T410 notebook, with Windows 7, in January 2010.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;I can install both remote printers on this system, and then print to them via the wireless router.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
However, when I Shut-down or Restart the T410, the 1600n printer shows up as "Offline".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I must then "Remove" this printer, and re-install it (via "Add Printer") on the T410.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It seems to lack "persistance" across a system&nbsp;Restart with the Windows 7 system.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The HP printer works fine, showing "Ready" status after a Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Both printers work fine&nbsp;after Shut-downs and Restarts on the Mac, XP and Vista systems.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I use a static IP address for the 1600n, and have the latest Windows 7 driver from Dell.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
One other piece of data: <br />
During the "Add Printer" process, the HP printer is automatically discovered, I select it, and then add it.<br />
The Dell printer is not discovered, and I have to add it as a TCP/IP address,&nbsp;"generic device", of type "Dell Network Printer", then specifically "Dell MFP Laser 1600n".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Any ideas would be appreciated - Lenovo and Dell&nbsp;tech support refuse to help troubleshoot&nbsp;- both say it is a Microsoft problem.<br />

            It means that the machine did not recieve a response to an SNMP query to the network card on the printer and when the resonse is not received the printer is marked Offline.<br />
<br />
Uncheck SNMP on the Ports tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; When SNMP is not checked there will be no SNMP query to the device and Standard TCP/IP Port will not mark the printer Offline.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the network cable is unplugged from the printer, the port monitor will still schedule the
 print job and the job will enter an error state rather than not print until the device responds to the SNMP query.<br />
<br />
Since the device supports the LPD Print Service you could add the LPR Port Monitor, add&nbsp;Windows Feature and setup the LPR Port using the information supplied by Dell.&nbsp; The queue name supported by the LPD service running on the network card of the printer is
 lp.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
There is also a command line utility when installing the the LPR Port Monitor feature.&nbsp; lpq.exe<br />
<br />
lpq -S IPofPrinter -P lp<br />
<br />
this will query and return the status of the service on the device.<br />

<h2>            I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t send message to people not on my friend list</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone. I post this under this category because it is the most accurate I could find. I have a problem where I cannot send messages to people not on my friends list. I have to keep spamming the send message button for it to go through. A lot of people
 think this affects xbox only but it doesn't. I ran a test where I used my account to send a message to&nbsp;my other&nbsp;account on xbox.com and even though the message seemed to go through because it didn't display any kind of error message, when I went and checked
 the inbox of the other account, it wasn't there, so this affects all devices. I also used the same test to&nbsp;find out that using a different network doesn't let the message through either.&nbsp;Let me give you guys the&nbsp;details of my problem.everyone. I</p>
<p>All my ports are open, my connection is fine, my privacy settings allow messages through, I have not been communications suspended or banned,&nbsp;&nbsp;and my other account can send messages just fine.&nbsp;Troubleshooting doesn't work. In short, there is nothing wrong
 with anything on my end. This is clearly a bug affecting&nbsp; accounts individually and no matter what device or network you use the same thing is going to happen. If more and more people complain to Microsoft about this, the more likely that they will care.</p>
<p>The first time I noticed this was in February, around the same time other people started to have this happen to them including some of my friends. I have been trying xbox support since day&nbsp;one of this problem and they refused to help. I also tried xbox ambassador
 chat and they didn't know what to do. This is my last stop before I give up on xbox live altogether. Does anyone know a way to fix this yourself? Or why/what is the reason for this? Please help me!</p>

<p>I haven't got an answer, why so many users are having problem sending messages.</p>
<p>It seems that the majority of affected users are still able to send messages through their console, but only to those users on their friend list. They can also send messages through xbox.com.</p>
<p>FYI, I've spun this up to the Microsoft/Xbox global escalation team last week. For them to start an investigation.</p>
<p>I hope this will be sorted out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If anyone does have this problem, it would help if they complained about it to Microsoft. It might make them care. However, I don't think xbox customer will help me on my own. If they cared, they would have done it already. Since February, they lied to me,
 promised to send me emails and then didn't send them, were rude to me, the advocacy team closed the case in my face without it being resolved. The advocacy team also told me the same advice again, so if they did care, they would be a bit more open minded than
 that. The only people that can help right now are the people who fix service alerts because they fix them very quickly. Do you think you can contact the service alert team? Thank you so much for replying to my post as well!</p>

<p>I hope I will be able to send messages to my friends soon. It could be 24 hour communications block which I think is ridiculous. I get it, they try to stop spam, but it doesn't work because everyone gets spam. Then when you actually try to fill up a lobby,
 you get blocked for a day. By the way, thanks for replying to my post!</p>

<p>I hope it will resolve for you as well. I can now send messages again because my 24 hour block is up, and I can also send messages to everyone. This problem might have fixed for me because the ban might have reset something but I can't be too sure because
 it supposedly resolved before and then started happening again.</p>

            <p>Hi there AfraidCannon642.</p><p><br /></p><p>To take advantage of Xbox Play Anywhere with games such as Ark: Survival Evolved, you will need to have installed the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update on your PC, as well as the latest update on your Xbox One console (if you have one). Then, simply log into your Xbox Live/Microsoft account and your Xbox Play Anywhere games will be available to download. On your Xbox One, games will show as “Ready to Install” under “My Games and Apps”. On your Windows 10 PC, games will appear in “My Library.”</p><p><br /></p><p>Let us know if that helps :)</p><p><br /></p><p><span style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br /></span></p>

            <p>If you used the "reversion" function in Win10, it is unlikely you have a clean Windows 7 installation.&nbsp; You can try to fix the result, but when all is said and done, you may not have succeeded and you may have spent a lot more time trying to do it then simply
 re-installing Windows 7 as if it was a new hard drive.&nbsp; That is what I recommend.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Re-install Windows 7</strong></em> </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; You may have to remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed.</strong> Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first.
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.&nbsp; This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Windows Update fix (new)</strong></em> </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong><em>The following procedure applies in the case of install (re-install) of Windows 7.&nbsp; It does not apply to usual, normal updating.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid you are going have to do the re-install again.&nbsp; Not a terrible penalty to pay.&nbsp; Usually takes way less than an hour.&nbsp; Then, immediately proceed with the following procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is strange, but it really does work and a lot of people have proven
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>BEFORE you start the re-install, download (32 or 64 bit) KB3083710 and KB3102810 in advance, and store on a USB stick</li><li>Start and complete the re-install of Windows 7 SP1</li><li>BEFORE the newly installed system can go online for the first time, <em><strong>disconnect
</strong></em>the computer from the Internet.&nbsp; This timing is critical.</li><li>Manually install KB3083710 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3102810 and restart.</li><li>Restore the Internet connection and launch Windows Update as normal.</li><li>After a few minutes, you should have&nbsp;plenty of updates to download and install.</li></ol>

</p><p><em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em> </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.&nbsp; I have done this on 150 client computers and it works flawlessly, and has continued to that since Spring,
 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of “important” updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>

<p>Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January, 2020.&nbsp; Most of your current computers will last that long.</p>

</p><p>The Windows 10&nbsp;installation promises to allow return to Windows 7 within 30 days.&nbsp; That return process is flawed and sometimes requires re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; For some owners without a re-usable Microsoft product key or a factory restore partition
 on their computers, it results in a useless thing that used to be a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people have tried Windows 10 and decided they want their Windows 7 back.&nbsp; If you are one of those, once you have Windows 7 back, you will need to take steps to keep it that</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>

</p><p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;on&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, they receive an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically labeled Security.&nbsp;
 In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015, there was not a single update that&nbsp; improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>

 Woody calls the Windows 10 download “crapware.”&nbsp; Woody’s advice is that if you have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 files.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer&nbsp;shortly anyway. &nbsp;Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download and run GWX Control panel.&nbsp; <a href="http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove all of Microsoft’s spyware that is&nbsp;already installed&nbsp;on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The following process will remove those features which you do not need.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time. You need to wait till you see the number at the bottom of the search window exceed a few hundred.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed (the number at the bottom again exceeds several hundred), enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC.&nbsp; It may take a long time to process this.</li></ol>
<p><em>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>

<h2>            &#34;We are unable to create or save new files in the folder in which this application was downloaded&#34;</h2>
                    I am experiencing big problems trying to install Windows 7 onto my laptop. I will try and be as clear as possible in explaining.<br />
<br />
My laptop is currently running Windows Vista Home Premium 32-Bit. I have purchased the Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit Upgrade from the Microsoft Student Offer.<br />
<br />
I was led to believe that upon downloading, I would get an .ISO file, which I would then burn to a DVD. Then I would boot from this DVD and do a clean/custom install.<br />
<br />
This has not been possible. Upon downloading from the Microsoft Student Website, I get 3 files. These are:<br />
<br />
Win7-P-Retail-en-us-x64.exe<br />
<br />
setup1.box<br />
<br />
setup2.box<br />
<br />
I double click on "Win7-P-Retail-en-us-x64.exe" and I get the message "Unloading the Box". Once the status bar reaches the end, I get the following error:<br />
<br />
"We are unable to create or save new files in the folder in which this application was downloaded. Please check the folder properties to make sure that you have security<br />
permission on the folder to write files and that the folder is not read-only".<br />
<br />
I click on OK. Regardless of the fact that I received the above error message, I now have a new folder called "expandedSetup".<br />
<br />
Within this folder are lots and lots of complicated looking files, stored within many other sub folders.<br />
<br />
However, in the root of "expandedSetup" is a file called "setup.exe". I double click on this file, and I get the following error message:<br />
<br />
"The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check you computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit)
<br />
or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher".<br />
<br />
This is as far as I have managed to get. I cannot find an .ISO file anywhere within the download, so I am unable to make a bootable DVD.<br />
<br />
Please can anyone advise me on how to successfully install Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit onto my laptop using the download that I have purchsed.
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance :)

            <strong>* * SOLUTION * *</strong> <br />
<br />
There is a way to create an image file dispite recieving this error we seem to be all recieving.<br />
<br />
1. You will need to use an additional Microsoft command-line tool, called Oscdimg.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749036(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/general-discussion/32382d1256189124-make-bootable-iso-student-d-l-oscdimg.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download the .zip file and extract it. Then cut and paste the Oscdimg.exe file into your
<strong>C:\Windows\System32</strong> directory <br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; <br />
2. You now need to start up your command prompt, which can be done by <em>Start-&gt;Run</em> then enter 'cmd' into the prompt. (Run as administrator if in Vista!)<br />
<br />
<br />
3. You should now have the command prompt open, now you need to use the Oscdimg tool to create the image, by entering the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Oscdimg.exe -u2 -bC:\<em>&lt;YOUR DIR&gt;</em> \expandedSetup\boot\etfsboot.com -h C:\<em>&lt;YOUR DIR&gt;</em> \expandedSetup C:\<em>&lt;YOUR DIR&gt;</em> \Win7.iso</strong>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For example: <em>Oscdimg.exe -u2 -bC:\Users\James\Downloads\expandedSetup\boot\etfsboot.com -h C:\</em>
<em>Users\James\Downloads</em> <em>\expandedSetup C:\</em> <em>Users\James\Downloads</em>
<em>\Win7.iso<br />
</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It will now scan the source tree then begin creating the image. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
PLEASE</span> note: you must replace '<em><strong>&lt;YOUR DIR&gt;</strong> </em>' appropriatly as to where you have downloaded the files.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. You should now have an image file, called Win7.iso, in the same directory.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. You can now burn this .iso file to a blank DVD using appropriate software. I personally use
<a href="http://www.poweriso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PowerISO</a> (You dont need the paid version to burn the image)<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Viola! You have your not so shiney Windows 7 disk. Restart your computer and install away!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- I take no acknowledgment for this, I dug about and found the info at: http://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/30470-make-bootable-iso-student-d-l.html<br />
&nbsp; Thanks SIW2 :)

<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>It should be noted that that there are two types of operating system installations:&nbsp; an Upgrade Installation and a Custom or Clean Installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 An Upgrade Installation is a type of installation where the new operating system installs itself over your current operating system, keeping your existing files and programs intact.&nbsp; There are certain scenarios where an Upgrade Installation option is possible.&nbsp;
 For example:</span></p>
<p><span>Upgrading from Windows Vista 64 bit to Windows 7 64 Bit</span></p>
<p><span>Upgrading from Windows Vista 32 bit to Windows 7 32 Bit</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>However, if you want to&nbsp;move</span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>from
 Windows Vista 32 bit to Windows 7 64 bit, or if you are running Windows XP, you have to do a Custom or Clean Installation that must be started by booting off the&nbsp;Windows 7 64 bit DVD.&nbsp; This means that you wipe the current operating system completely from your
 system, and install the new operating system from scratch.&nbsp; To perform a Custom or Clean installation, please contact Digital River,&nbsp;unless&nbsp;you have&nbsp;already ordered a Backup DVD with your initial order.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>This includes error messages reported during the download phase and during the unloading phase.&nbsp; The most common are:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Error <strong><em>“We are unable to create or save new files in the folder in which this application was downloaded.”</em></strong>&nbsp; This error occurs when you are in the unloading phase of the 64-bit Windows
 7 download process and are running a 32-bit version of Windows such as Windows XP or Windows Vista 32-bit.&nbsp; This is by design as you cannot launch setup for the 64-bit version of Widows 7 while running a 32-bit operating system.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Error <strong><em>“This version of the file is not compatible with the version of Windows you’re running.”</em></strong>&nbsp; The cause for this error is the same as #1 above and occurs if you attempt to launch
 the Windows 7 setup program located in the unboxed folder “expandedSetup”.&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The download appears to <strong>
<em>hang at some %</em></strong> and will not continue or resume.&nbsp; Digital River and Microsoft are investigating reports of this issue.&nbsp; This appears to be a series of isolated issues that are often related to the user’s internet provider or installed 3

            Hi.
<br />
<br />If your computer begins to feel buggy and you notice problems during boot, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) command-line utility to check the integrity and replace any corrupted or missing protected system files with a known good version.
<br />
<br />When SFC is unable to fix the problem, chances are the utility was unable to get the necessary files from the Windows image, which might have become broken. In this situation, you can use DISM to repair the Windows image (.wim), which then it will allow you to use the System File Checker to fix any issue with your Windows 10 installation.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />If the above does not work, follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Tell me how you are doing and let me know if the information has been helpful in solving your query.

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Windows Store Apps. This may resolve the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, perform a clean boot:

<h2>            how to set default app to chrome for PDFs</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is not letting me choose the default app I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is forcing the selection of Microsoft applications, see image below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/624b7ac4-b2be-464b-ad84-4643a9955164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/624b7ac4-b2be-464b-ad84-4643a9955164" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I want to open PDFs with Chrome, not Edge. &nbsp;BTW, Edge doesn't even open the PDF correctly! &nbsp;In general, i would like Microsoft to not force their applications on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to do this?</p>

<h2>            How to I log in as the original Admin user&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have a PC that my office gave to me loaded with Windows XP Professional.&nbsp; I gave it to my kids, but they got tired of hitting CTRL-ALT-DEL and typing in a password just to get to the desktop.&nbsp; So I started tinkering with it.</p>
<p>I looked at USERS under CONTROL PANEL and found a few users - all associated with the network at the office.&nbsp; So I deleted all but the Admin one (let's call it ADMIN) and established a new user (let's call it NEW ADMIN), complete with admin rights.&nbsp; I noticed,
 however, that the Setting Windows under USERS were very NT-like - no frills.</p>
<p>I also checked the ability not to do the CTRL-ALT-DELETE thing.&nbsp; After booting up, I got the window to type in a password.&nbsp; The default username was still ADMIN and I could only log in using ADMIN and the corresponding password - typing in NEW ADMIN didn't
 work.</p>
<p>After loading up, I noticed the desktop was different, so clearly I wasn't really logged in with the old desktop/settings associated with the original account.&nbsp; I looked again at CONTROL PANEL and USERS, and now it had a XP-feel to it - a different,&nbsp; bright
 interface.</p>
<p>I look at USERS now, and it only lists NEW ADMIN and GUEST.&nbsp; It says NEW ADMIN is a Computer Administrator, but again, I didn't log in as NEW ADMIN - I logged in as ADMIN before the desktop loaded up.</p>
<p>So my questions are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Can I boot this machine up without asking for a password?&nbsp; This is being used by my kids, so I'm not worried about security.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How do I get my old desktop back?&nbsp; I can see the folders associated with ADMIN when I look in C:\Documents and Settings\ADMIN, but some programs won't load up (like Google Chrome, which is unique when I guess it was installed by ADMIN).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I just need one master admin account.&nbsp; How do I get rid of either ADMIN or NEW ADMIN, and does it matter which one?</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I really appreciate any help you can provide.</p>

<p>The computer must have atleast one administrator account. The original admin account you refer to is the default admin account. The user accounts you deleted had restricted accounts meaning the default admin account remained visible. Once you created a new
 account with administrative privileges the default admin account then became hidden and can only be accessed via safe mode or by pressing CTRL + Alt + Delete two times at the welcome screen (this method only applies to Xp Pro).</p>
<ol>
<li>You will need to navigate to user accounts again and click on "Change the way users log on and off". Place a check mark in the box to use the Welcome screen. Next, click on the "New Admin account and choose to remove any passwords you may have created by
 clicking on "Remove my password". This is not advised however.</li><li>You cannot get back to the default admin account desktop except as prescribed above. It is strongly recommended you leave the default admin account alone. Simply re-install Google Chrome, and any other software you want/need to the New Admin account and
 any other accounts you create. This will not be necessary for all software you install. Some software installs user specific and some install as available to all users accounts.</li><li>You cannot delete the default admin account. My advice to you is to leave the New Admin account in place and create new accounts for your kids. Preferably, an account each with limited privileges. I also recommend you leave the New Admin account password
 protected to prevent unwanted or even dangerous changes to the computer. </li><li>If you didn't create a password for the New Admin then simply click ok at the prompt without entering any data into the password field.</li></ol>
