    <title>Facing SSL errors in Windows 7 &#40;on all browsers, works fine on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Facing SSL errors in Windows 7 &#40;on all browsers, works fine on other machines connected to same ISP&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From last 2-3 months, I am experiencing SSL errors in windows 7. Here are the symptoms of the errors:-</p>
<p>1. Everytime I open up the browser to browse any HTTPS site, I get different error-codes like "ssl_error_rx_record_too_long" or some other error_code. Some other error_codes:-</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">(Error code: ssl_error_bad_mac_read)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; b.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">(Error
 code: ssl_error_rx_unexpected_application_data)</span></p>
<p>2. Sometime it starts downloading an HTTP page on entering any https site like "https://www.facebook.com" or "https://www.gmail.com".</p>
<p>3. Last time I faced this issue about 3-4 months back. Then I searched on internet and did these testings:-</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a. Checked the system-time to see if its not wrong there. It was correct. Even I checked in BIOS and there also, it was fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; b. People suggested to clear the browser cache, did that as well, but still the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; c. Few suggested to check with ISP. I attached someone else's laptop to the same ISP and he was able to browse all the sites without any issue. So, there was on issue with ISP as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; d. Whenever I am using internet at home, it starts giving me SSL errors. I use 3G dongle for the internet connection. I used the same dongle on my friends laptop, and it worked fine there.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; e. [MOST IMPORTANT] Whenever I connect to VPN using VPN-client at my home, I stop getting SSL errors. Everything works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; f. I tried uninstalling the software used by dongle and reinstalling the updated one, but still it didn't worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; g. I tried uninstalling the browser and installing it again, but still the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; h. I tried updating all the drivers but still that didn't worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; i. At last tired of all the efforts, I formatted the windows and everything started working fine as expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. After formatting, everything worked fine. Few days ago, I again started seeing this issue. As far as I remember, I installed VPN-client for sonicwall firewall on my machine on that day. Since then, I again started seeing these SSL errors. I am not sure
 whether its the issue of sonicwall firewall since I uninstalled it, cleaned it from registry, but still I am facing the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This mailthread perfectly defines my situation, but their issue was because of the ISP. In my case, I even changed the ISP but still the same issue. And other people are not getting the same issue with the same ISP.</p>
<p>https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/976504?page=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or pointers will be greatly acknowledged. Do let me know where to look for such issues. There are many more people who have seen this issue but not able to debug this. Kindly let me know any troubleshooting steps I can try out to narrow this down.
 Any help would be greatly acknowledged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards</p>

            <p>Hi Rahul,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is the computer configured under domain?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Which version of Internet Explorer is installed on the computer?
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer is not configured under domain then you may try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enable Compatibility View in Internet Explorer <br />
<br />
The Web site might not be fully compatible with Internet Explorer 8 and might not be displayed correctly. You can enable Compatibility View for the Web site to see whether that resolves the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Enable Compatibility View for a Web site <br />
<br />
To enable Compatibility View for a specific Web site that is not displayed correctly or that is not working correctly, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Enter the address of the Web site that is not displayed correctly or that does not work correctly, and press ENTER.</li><li>Click the <strong>Compatibility View</strong> icon that is located to the right of the address bar.
<div><strong>Note</strong> Compatibility view is not required, and the Compatibility View commands will not be available, if the Web site was designed for earlier versions of Internet Explorer.</div>
</li><li>After you enable Compatibility View, the Web site will automatically refresh, and you may see a message that states that the Web site is running in Compatibility View.</li></ol>
<p><strong>If this method worked</strong><br />
<br />
If the Web site displays and works correctly, you are finished.&nbsp; However, you may have to repeat this method for each Web site that has this problem. If you want to do this for all Web sites, see<strong> Method 2.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you use this method to fix a Web site display problem, Internet Explorer saves your Compatibility View setting for that Web site. Every time that you visit that site, Compatibility View will be used. To stop a Web site from running
 in Compatibility View, click the <strong>Compatibility View</strong> icon when you view the Web site.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You can also add or remove specific Web sites from Compatibility View without actually visiting each Web site. To do this, click<strong>Tools</strong>, and then click
<strong>Compatibility View Settings</strong>. Add or remove Web sites in this window.<br />
<br />
<strong>If this method did not work</strong><br />
If the Web site is not displayed correctly or is not working, you are experiencing a different problem. Try the other resolutions in this section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Enable Compatibility View for all Web sites <br />
<br />
Consider the following scenario. Most Web sites that you frequently visit are not displayed correctly or are not working correctly. You have tried Method 1 on some of these Web sites, and that method worked. In this case, you may want to enable Compatibility
 View for all Web sites. To do this, follow these steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start </strong>and then click <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Compatibility View Settings</strong>.
<div><strong>Note </strong>If <strong>Compatibility View Settings</strong> is not available, your network administrator may have used a Group Policy setting to configure the options for you. Contact your administrator or the help desk.</div>
</li><li>Click to select the <strong>Display all websites in Compatibility View</strong> check box, and then click<strong>Close</strong>.
</li><li>Visit several Web sites that did not display correctly or that did not work correctly to make sure&nbsp; the problem is resolved.</li></ol>
<p><br />
Delete browsing history <br />
<br />
Internet Explorer could be using old information when you try to view the Web page. Try deleting your browsing history to see whether the problem is resolved. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong>, click <strong>Delete All</strong>.</li><li>Click to select the <strong>Also delete files and settings stored by add-ons</strong> check box, and then click<strong>OK</strong>.
</li><li>Try to view the Web page again to see whether it works correctly.</li></ol>
<p>If the Web page works correctly, you are finished with this article. If the Web page does not work correctly, try the next resolution.<br />
Run Internet Explorer in No Add-ons mode <br />
<br />
Although browser add-ons can enhance your online experience, they can occasionally interfere or conflict with other software on your computer. Try starting Internet Explorer without add-ons to see whether the problem is resolved. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span></div>
, and then click <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons)</strong>. Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.</li><li>Try to view the Web page again to see whether it works correctly.</li></ol>
<p>If disabling all add-ons resolves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will let you determine which add-on is causing the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span></div>
, and then click <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Programs</strong> tab,&nbsp; and then click <strong>Manage add-ons</strong>.</li><li>Click an add-on in the <strong>Name</strong> list, and then click <strong>Disable</strong>.</li><li>Try to view the Web page again to see whether it works correctly.</li><li>If the Web page works correctly, you know that the add-on caused the problem. If you still cannot view the Web page, the add-on did not cause the problem, and you can enable it again.</li><li>Repeat steps 4 through 6 until you identify the add-on that is causing the problem. After you disable it, you are finished with this article.</li></ol>
<p>If no add-on is causing the problem, try the next resolution. Make sure that the Date and Time settings are correct<br />
<br />
Some secure sites require that the date and time match the date and time of the secure site. Make sure that the Date and Time settings are correct on the computer. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Control Panel, open <strong>Date and Time</strong>. To do this, click <strong>
Start</strong>
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span></div>
, type <span>date and time</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click<strong>Date and Time</strong> in the
<strong>Programs</strong> list.</li><li>Click <strong>Change date and time</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Date and Time Settings</strong> dialog box, set the date and time to the correct values.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Reset Internet Explorer settings: </strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer:<br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control
 settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try resetting Internet Explorer back to its default settings. This removes all changes that were made to Internet Explorer since it was installed, but it does not delete your favorites or feeds. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close all Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer windows.</li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</strong> dialog box, click <strong>
Reset</strong>. </li><li>When Internet Explorer finishes restoring the default settings, click <strong>
Close</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong> two times. </li><li>Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect. </li><li>Try to view the Web page again to see whether it works correctly.</li></ol>
<p>If the Web page works correctly, you are finished with this article. If the Web page does not work correctly, try the next resolution. Perform System Restore</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>All Programs</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Accessories</strong>, and then click <strong>System Tools</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>System Restore</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li><li>Try to view the Web page again to see whether it works correctly.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Anannya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes, my laptop is configured under my company's domain.</p>
<p>2. I am using internet-explorer 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing the same issue with any of the web-browser. Few other members of my company are also experiencing the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Key thing to note here is that, whenever I am in company network using WIFI or direct cable access, I don't get any of the SSL errors. However, when I am at home and try to connect using my dongle or any other's dongle, I start seeing this issue. Hence,
 this issue has nothing to do with the browser or the addons installed there since they should affect me in any situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second thing is that, when I am using VPN, I don't get any SSL issue. Could this be driver specific? This is because, I connect my dongle to USB ports and I am not sure how this gets mapped to the nic-driver and then the packets are received by my OS. Whenever
 I use WIFI or lan connection, then everything is coming through nic-drivers and it looks like those are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide me some help on this front so that I can debug more and figure out the root-cause. This issue has affected me in past as well and I could see that there are number of other customers who have faced this issue. We need to have some concrete
 fix for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping for the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards</p>

<h2>            Wi-fi speed difference &#40;slow wi-fi network connection&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Good evening,</p>
<p>(I'm an Italian user, so please forgive my questionable English and my hopefully accurate enough translations of component names)</p>
<p>I recently bought an Asus&nbsp;<span>F555BP XO067T; I noticed that the download speed using my wi-fi router hardly reaches 600kb/s while my old Acer Aspire E15 usually loads around 6.5Mb/s.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p><span>What perplexes me is the fact that the same Asus, using the wi-fi hotspot of my smartphone, easily reaches 10Mb/s with peaks of 12-16Mb/s.</span></p>
<p><span>Nothing changes if I disconnect ant other connected device from the router. I tried to restart my router, but nothing changed.&nbsp;</span>The wireless network report does not point out any problem, while the Network troubleshooter
 sometimes detects an unspecified problem. I tried the networking commands as instructed in the "<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix network connection issues

<p>
</p><p>I updated the network adapter driver to the latest version; the "Roll back driver" button is not available. I temporarily disabled all the possibile firewalls and antiviruses (I'm using the built-in Windws Defender etc...).</p>
<p>To be clear, I tried all the steps described in the "<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix network connection issues in Windows 10</a>" guide, except for the
 last two ones as they referred to the computer "not connecting", while mine does connect - it's only incredibly slow.</p>
<p>I even removed the "Save energy" option from the network adapter driver and tried the "netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel =disabled" command.</p>
<p>Nothing changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I ask my router provider/fabricator, or a technician? Is there any solvable problem, in the first place, or is my notebook just slow, and I have to live with it?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incorrect network configuration settings may trigger a slow connection speed on your notebook. For us to isolate the case further, we'd like to verify the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any significant changes to your notebook device prior to this happening?</li><li>Have you tried re-configuring or checking the settings of your router?</li><li>To make sure that we have not missed on anything, may we know the specific steps you have tried on this article:

<p>Hi Dhavelyn Mer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>because of some anti-malware interfering, I had to perform a clean install of Windows 10 following
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">
this</a> guide (actually, the shorter Italian translation); during that process, I was neither asked the Product Key code, nor the Windows version I wanted to install (Home or Pro), if this can be of any help.</p>
<p>Before the reinstall, though, the speed of the network was just as slow.</p>
<p>Since then, however, I only installed some common software such as Google Chrome (which I am currently using), Office 2007, Google Earth, Stellarium etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I didn't want to jeopardize the decent speed connection of my Acer, I never tried touching the settings of my router.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the steps n.1,2,3,5,6 of the guide.</p>
<p>I could not try n.4 as the "Roll back" button was gray, deactivated and unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly,&nbsp;<span>I removed the "Save energy" option from the network adapter driver and tried the "netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel =disabled" command (which I don't know how to restore/reverse).</span></p>
<p><span>After the deactivation of the "Save energy" option in the network adapter driver, I registered a sudden spike of 3.9Mb/s for less than ten seconds. Sadly, that was only an isolated case and shortly after my average
 500-600kb/s speed returned. I suppose, though, that this may prove that a decent speed&nbsp;<em>can</em> be achieved, but something is blocking it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this fulfils your necessity.</p>
<p><span>Thank you for your help,</span></p>
<p>

<p>Here you have a list of all the software on my computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome, Google Earth, Microsoft Office Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Publisher 2007, Geogebra, Stellarium, Calibre e-book management, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Digital Editions, WhatsApp Web, Code::Blocks, Lightworks, VSDC Video Editor, VLC media player
 and the drivers for my Epson Printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, though, I had to perform a clean install of Windows 10 after only one day of usage (apparently caused by my antimalware Comodo, which I did not reinstall), but the problem already existed, even right after the reinstallation. I had to use my smartphone
 hotspot to download many of those software and all the Microsoft updates at a decent speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to connect my computer via LAN: using an ethernet cable, my notebook reaches the "incredible" speed of 6.5Mb/s, more or less the same of my Acer. Even the ping values are definitely lower.</p>
<p>I also noticed that sometimes (only for a second) the wi-fi speed shows spikes of about 1-1.5Mb/s, but generally it is an isolate case.</p>

<p>Hello everyone reading, </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last few days I had to fix some other minor problems on my pc and I had to update the bios (as instructed by Asus support service). While LAN connection works perfectly, as I said, wi-fi connection is still slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have spent some days by now watching the Task Manager graphs while I wait for a new Internet page to load, I noticed some odd periodicity in the wi-fi connection&nbsp;speed track. While loading a single page (that is, supposedly during continuous/constant
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd52bb87-9ac0-4d6a-8fd4-ce39a95f64b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd52bb87-9ac0-4d6a-8fd4-ce39a95f64b5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>While I am connected via LAN, on the contrary, trying to load the same page produces a quite smooth horizontal line (at a much higher speed) until the loading is complete.</p>
<p>The behaviour of my other PC while using the same wi-fi connection looks more similar to the shape produced while using LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be related with my wi-fi speed connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>GC.</p>

<p>Here there are some updates about my strange case, which is yet to be fixed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. As my Asus was updated to the "Creators Update", I succesfully tried to update my Acer, which had an older version of Windows, to the newest one. No change in the relative speed was detected, therefore (I suppose) the version of Windows installed does
 not influence the speed of the connection, in this case: my Asus is still 10-12 times slower than my Acer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I tried to connect my Asus to another router. The computer reached 1-1,5Mb/s, which was similar to the speed of any other device connected to the same router; in Task Manager, loading a page produced the famous smooth line I described in the previous
 comment. These are the values displayed using the command "ping &lt;gateway&gt;" (to be compared to the pictures in the original Question above):</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Back home, the situation did not change: slow and periodically plummeting connection as always.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">After this "experiments", I believe (correct me if I am wrong) that this problem only involves my domestic wi-fi, or maybe the connection between my Asus and my router (since the other devices work properly). I still have no idea
 about how to fix it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Should I try to "de-update" the network card driver to an older version? It's the best thing I can think, now.</p>

<p>Quick update on my network: this screenshot was taken during the download of a&nbsp;<em>single</em> file (3.7Mb) using Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/036c394b-6535-48f9-b41c-ae550d72cbdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/036c394b-6535-48f9-b41c-ae550d72cbdb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to restart the operation multiple times as the download frequently stopped, probably because such frequent drops of network speed were interpreted by the browser as disconnections (or so the error message said).</p>
<p>The situation may be getting even&nbsp;worse than before.</p>

<p>Update, again: connecting my Asus to yet another router, the connections speed easily peaked around 8Mb/s.</p>

<p>Do you have QOS setup?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am curious if you have other devices on the network at the same time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latency however could also be from Broadcomm network drivers, i have seen that on my server farm..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which requires a registry hack to fix..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click in Broadcom network adapter..&nbsp;<br />
Choose properties<br />
Click Configure<br />
Disable VMQ<br />
</p>
<p>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VMSMP\Parameters</p>
<p>Add: DWORD32 - BelowTenGigWmqEnabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot</p>
<p>Right click on broadcom network adapter</p>
<p>Properties</p>
<p>Configure</p>
<p>Enable VMQ</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if that helps..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you aren't running Broadcom, and are using Intel don't do the above.. That only fixes a flaw in the Broadcom network adapter.. (Not sure what the differences are in the italian registry, you might need to google that for Italian.. sorry)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternately you can also check the switch,&nbsp;</p>
<p>enable logging on the router/switch and check the logs, they might indicate what is causing this.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom

<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

    <title>How do I restore a computer image from a network drive to a new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zacharyhankel  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I restore a computer image from a network drive to a new unallocated hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We are standardizing PC's at my work, the bulk of our fleet is Lenovo ThinkCentre M910s and Lenovo ThinkPad T470 both installed with Windows 10 Enterprise. For the next few batches of new PC's we're looking at exactly the same setup and so I am looking for
 an imaging process that will make setup faster. So far I've successfully created a default profile and saved an image to a network share on a Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard server on our domain. However, I have been unable to restore this image to a fresh
 PC with a blank hard drive.<br />
<br />
I have our Windows 10 Enterprise installation media on a flash drive and can boot to that just fine on the new PC which is connected to our domain ethernet. From there I can navigate to Repair your computer&gt;Troubleshoot&gt;System Image Recovery. After a short
 scan I get the message that Windows cannot find a system image on this computer, which is fine, I don't have one on the computer. I click cancel and Select a system image is selected by default so I click Next. I click Advanced and click Search for a system
 image on the network and click Yes to the are you sure message. The search reveals nothing and asks me to specify the location of the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the network share the image was saved to is ServerName\System Image Backup but the image saved a folder called WindowsImageBackup and in that folder is a folder named DESKTOP-PP3DHV3 and in that folder are several more folders ranging from a folder called
 Backup with the date to Catalog, etc. When I've specified the location of the image through the System Image Recovery wizard I've tried '\\ServerName\System Image Backup', '\\ServerName\System Image Backup\WindowsImageBackup', '\\ServerName\System Image Backup\WindowsImageBackup\DESKTOP-PP3DHV3',
 and, '\\ServerName\System Image Backup\WindowsImageBackup\DESKTOP-PP3DHV3\Backup 2018-11-19 231636'. Each attempt results in the same error, "An internal error occurred. The following information may help you resolve the error. The supplied kernel information
 is invalid. (0x80070154).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled the error and found that System Image Recovery requires the image be saved to the root of the drive, particularly the WindowsImageBackup folder needs to be moved to the root of the drive. So I moved this folder to the root of my servers D: drive
 and shared the folder again. However, attempting then to specify the image location as \\ServerName\WindowsImageBackup results in the same error as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried using Command Prompt commands from the installation media Repair your computer&gt;Troubleshoot&gt;Command Prompt. However when I run ipconfig /all the information is essentially blank with no Host Name and no Primary Dns Suffix. So my guess is that
 there is no networking which may be the result of my problem here, however I have no idea how to get the network to work in this state so that I can restore this image from my network location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unsure what to do now. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong but 3 days of research has resulted in nothing useful. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi there,<br /><br />I am not sure how you can build operating system images using the method you are describing but it sounds like your having issues with drivers, are you able to select driver files to load for the network adapter? This would resolve your networking issues it seems your having. If so get the inf file for the driver store it on the usb and load that.<br /><br />However the best option for a small IT department would be to use Microsoft deployment toolkit<br /><br />This allows you to install windows on a machine, install all applications required, configure the machine how needed (do not join it to the domain) then you can perform a sysprep to then prepare the machine for image capture <br /><br />Then using the media created by MDT you can capture the o/s image and create an automated proceedure to deploy the o/s<br /><br />You would also need to setup a pxe server so you can boot to the build environment<br /><br />I would suggest doing some reading about this on Microsofts web

            <p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

            <p>I allow all updates automatically, Ramesh, and I went to your link but there is no update or link to resolve this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Windows 7 and my new handset are incompatible. I eventually managed to contact someone at Vodafone who was more expert than before and after following her instructions, the PC still had not installed drivers for my handset.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However, I do have a solution! Forget the cable connection via USB and...</strong></p>
<p>Someone recommended I try the AirMore app - and it solves the problem completely. With its help I am transferring files via WiFi. Once installed, one has to visit the website for AirMore and 'connect' the handset and PC live there, then
 anyone can do anything that they could do using a USB connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very happy I found this alternative. It will work no matter what OS one is using or what phone. An almost universal solution.

<h2>            Webcam&#47;Camera app doesnt work after Windows 8.1 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I updated my version of Windows from 8 to Windows 8.1 a couple of months ago. I don't use the camera app or webcam very often but I do know that the camera and webcam worked perfectly fine with Windows 8.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now with Windows 8.1 the camera app or Skype&nbsp;doesn't get any image from the webcam. The blue light comes on to indicate that the webcam is on but the screen is just dark grey;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f260d003-f852-4756-a2dd-e092b1f9aed4" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is an integrated webcam on a Dell Inspiron 1720 laptop&nbsp;running Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center.</p>
<p>The webcam comes with accompanying software: Dell Webcam Manager which includes Dell Webcam Center. The Webcam Center also allows me to use the webcam to take photos and record videos:</p>
<p><br />

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/559f6148-3781-453f-a7bf-cf1988a29478" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My webcam works fine through Dell Webcam Center</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have checked and I do have the most up to date version of the driver for my webcam</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have also uninstalled Dell Webcam Manager and associated software and uninstalled the driver/Webcam and then reinstalled everything - yet the webcam still&nbsp;does not work through the Windows 8.1 camera app or Skype.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there a recognised issue with Windows 8.1 and webcams?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Build 7601 this copy of Windows is not genuine</h2>
                    Lenovo Laptop came with pre-installed Windows 7 and now suddenly my laptop will not launch the operating system. It just produces a blank screen with the message "Windows 7 Build 7601 this copy of Windows is not genuine". I am at a loss and would appreciate
 any advice on what I can do to fix this issue.

<h3> joe boyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            DHCP, Firewall, Diagnosis Policy services will not start &#40;access denied&#41;</h2>
                    <b>Problem description:</b><span>&nbsp;I did a routine restart of
 my computer. When it restarted I had no network connection at all. Weird. Checked the cable, that's fine, checked the router, that's fine. Run network diagnostics and get a weird error that the "Diagnostic Policy Service" is not running. Attempt to start it,
 get same error. I open services.msc, find the Diagnostic Policy Service and try to start it manually, get an Error 5: Access is denied. Also notice right above it that DHCP Client service is not running. Try to start that and get the same error.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Attempted fixes:</b><span>&nbsp;I thought that if DHCP is the problem
 for no network connectivity, I can enter IP address etc in my interface and circumvent DHCP. That works, kinda, and allowed me to get online but many things are still not running as they should including DHCP, Firewall, Diagnostic services and the little network
 icon in the system tray still says I have no network connection. Other computers on the network can't see its SMB shares, which causes a problem for my MediaPC, and thus my wife can't watch Parks and Recreation. This is critical!</span><br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try the Methods provided below and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Try performing SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer.<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.
<br />
<br />
Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannnow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of your
 first troubleshooting steps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan –<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a><br />
<br />
<br />
</span>This issue could be caused by Virus/Malware, I would suggest that you download and run full system scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
</span><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.<br />
<br />

            Same problem, suddenly i could not share my internet with other PCs in the network. Did some checking and found those services unable to start by error 5. Only think i did was installing a printer..ok maybe a RAM related crash could have **** up windows..i dont know.. 



How do i get the rights back to get them running? I dont want to load an old backup. But i need network access to my other PCs. 



I have this problem in the 64bit edition btw.

                    So, once upon a time, I had this wonderful new laptop, with Windows 8.1 on it, and an absurd bug, that was too great to be defeated by the mere mortals who created it. This bug was so scary it made me reinstall my OS. Delete my hard drive, and start fresh.<br />
<br />
So there I was, gazing upon the forums, searching for an lost elder scroll that has witnessed the creation of this OS, that would help me in my quest.<br />
I downloaded Windows 8.1 from the Microsoft sites fountain of hope, and using their program I have made my USB the device that will install it on my dear laptop. So I've entered my product key, WHICH COST ME MONEY. Just to get an error 0x8007025D. So I have
 tried everything out there, every single thing that I saw on every single forum written from 2005 to today, just to find NO SOLUTION. Microsoft support was so nice to shove the problem under the pillow and blame it all on me....yeah, I know, I am guilty of
 buying the da*n thing...<br />
<br />
So, I took out my old Windows 7 DVD, and since I don't have an DVD reader in my laptop, I've burned the .iso with USB booter or whatever on my USB. Guess what - same thing all over again...Could the problem be in my USB?...nope, tried with literally a dozen
 of different USB Flash drives.<br />
<br />
Even got that "sorry we can't install, the hardware is not supported"....well how did it work when I bought the damn thing?...got over that, just to find myself starring at the "GPT partition is needed" or whatever...so like a good doggy I go and format the
 partition, clean it and convert to GPT, just to find that there are now some missing files. But how can that be since I got them from the official Microsoft site?!<br />
<br />
Did I pay you to ra*e me like a cheap hook** or did I waste my money to incompetent support and developers who can't even get the system to install from the USB stick?!<br />
<br />
So, what to do now?....guess I'll ask for help one more time before I give Windows up for good and switch to Linux or Mac. Yup, they don't seem to have this type of problem now do they?!&nbsp;

            Lol, no dingle-berry. Even Windows Phones ****. Most reviews for apps in the Windows store are 1 star because Microsoft doesnt give two **** about their consumers. Really FACEBOOK stopped supporting version 8.1 of Windows on the Windows Phone.

<h2>            Mouse and Keyboard Input Lag</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro with latest update installed on a desktop PC, and this issue started in the last week or so;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every while there would be a significant input delay, when using mouse or keyboard , I would have to wait for 1-2 seconds before response and some inputs are even ignored, now performance in general is not affected (I think); for example if a video player
 or a game is running , the video plays normally without stuttering or freezing or any sort of problems, and the game performance continues as it was (60fps for example, with no framerate drops)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have to wait for few seconds or sometimes few minutes before the windows explorer restarts and the issue is gone,</p>
<p>Then after a while (Hours, variable) the same thing happens again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I don't know what is causing this, is it an issue with a windows update or is it a malware ?</p>
<p>Windows defender has been detecting and fixing repeatedly a "Trojan:Win32/Skeeyah.A!bit" malware...can this be the cause ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, anyway :)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Mustafa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help resolve your concern, use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<span>Search</span>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click
<span>Search</span>. Type <span>Command Prompt</span> in the <span>Search</span> box, right-click
<span>Command Prompt</span>, and then click <span>Run as administrator</span>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<span>Allow</span>.</li><li>Type the following command, and then press <span>Enter</span>.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<div>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</div>
<span>Important</span> When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source, or use a
 Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
<div>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:<var>C:\RepairSource\Windows</var> /LimitAccess</div>
<span>Note</span> Replace the <var>C:\RepairSource\Windows</var> placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair a Windows Image</a>.</li><li>Type the following command and press <span>Enter</span>.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<div>sfc /scannow</div>
</li><li>Close the command prompt, and then run <strong>Windows Update</strong> again.</li></ol>
<p>DISM creates a log file (%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. %windir% is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the %windir% folder is C:\Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the <span><strong>Trojan: Win32/Skeeyah.A!bit, </strong></span>kindly follow the troubleshooting steps from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Trojan%3aWin32%2fSkeeyah.A!bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Malware Protection Center.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Call into live support. They are fantastic at what they do!. There may be a billing issue on the account, or there may be a live issue. generally to add a member to the family pack, the gamer tag needs to be on the same console as the main account, then
 be added that way. but, usually the message you are getting indicates a possible past due balance or some other issue. Call in to xbox and see whats going on.</p>

<h2>            How to find MAC Address to connect to a wifi connection&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I need to find the MAC Address of my Laptop (Acer Aspire V5) to get an internet connection where I live (student campus).&nbsp;<br />
I've tried with the command prompt, writing ipconfig /all and choosing the static address shown. But it begins with 68 ... and the connection owner said it must begin with 00. All other addresses shown in this page don't begin with 00!&nbsp;</div>
<div>What can I do?</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>

<div>Thank you all!</div>
<div>I dind't try with the "arp -a" after ipconfig /all! What does it mean? The result is a list of addresses, where the first is "dinamic" and is different from the one I found with ipconfig /all and with the instructions of Usman Raza (with his instruction
 I find the same address of the ipconfig /all).&nbsp;</div>

            You need to scroll down the list of different connection types until you see the one that says " wireless LAN adapter WI-FI" . Under that heading, there will be a a list. in that list , there will be a line that says "Physical Address" followed by a series
 of paired numbered letters and numbers separated by colons. &nbsp;That is the MAC address.

<h2>            What is the Primary DNS Suffix and where do I find it, please&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A friend here yesterday helping me resolve some post-Free Upgrade to Win10 was slightly confused when he saw this (my older laptop) described as 'Win7 laptop'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought I'd change it. There were two places to change it - the first change was accepted/processed but the second require the Primary DNS Suffix. What is it and where do I find it please?</p>

<p>Hi Pitbulls,</p>
<p>Quite a few Kaspersky users have that same warning but it's a simple false warning. There's a fix for getting rid of the pesky warning permanently:</p>
<p>Try these steps and check if they help:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>1. Temporarily disable the WMI service (Windows management instrumentation) in:</p>
<p>a. Start &gt;Run</p>
<p>b. Type: "services.msc"</p>
<p>c. And in there find/stop WMI</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Next delete the C:\windows\system32\wbem\repository folder</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Restart the WMI service using the same procedure you used to stop and restart the computer</p>
<p>It is most likely the Windows Security Center which falsely is telling you it's off, you're not the first and it happens to all brands of Anti Virus software.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Photos Video editor&#58; Windows 10</h2>
                    I love using the video editor from the Windows 10 update, but I feel so limited to what I can produce when I compose on the editor. Since its storyboard based its almost linear in how I'm allowed to edit. Will the editor ever have a timeline based editing
 format added to it?
