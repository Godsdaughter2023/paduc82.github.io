<h2>            Programs Crashing&#47;Closing Immediately after opening.</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 and I'm experiencing problems with certain programs on my HP Pavilion g6 laptop. Sony Vegas Pro 11 keeps crashing while it trys to open. Steam and the program to view pictures(forgot what it's called) just refuse to open. I have scanned
 my laptop with Malwarebytes, Advanced System Care Ultimate 7 and Avast to find any problems but They turn up with nothing. I've restarted my laptop several times and I've been unable to find any solutions to this issue.

<h2>            Skype for Windows 10 is dark</h2>
                    I am having problems with my Skype for Windows 10. All of a sudden my picture that I am sending, both what I see and what they see on the other Skyping end, is very dark - almost unrecognizable. When I close Skype and use my camera app to check my webcam
 out the picture is fine. What happened? Is there a way to make Skype brighten my picture.

            I don't know what version it was since I deleted it last night and installed Skype 7.41.0.101 today and the picture looks a lot brighter. It was working fine until I used it yesterday and the picture was dark. I had logged out and opened Skype again yesterday
 and it didn't make any difference. When I opened my camera app, the picture was fine, so it had something to do with tan update to Skype that occurred since the last time I used it about a month ago. Thanks

            <p>Hi Frank, </p>
<p>
</p><p>For your OneDrive concern, we recommend that you do the troubleshooting below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Reset your OneDrive. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + R&nbsp;</strong>to open Run Command dialog box.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Enter:&nbsp;<strong>%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>The notification area of the taskbar should disappear and then re-appear after a minute or two. Here’s how to check: Right-click the white OneDrive cloud icon in the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar.</span></p>
<p><span>(You might need to click the&nbsp;<strong>Show hidden icons</strong>&nbsp;arrow next to the notification area to see the&nbsp;<strong>OneDrive</strong>&nbsp;icon.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>If the OneDrive icon doesn’t re-appear after a few minutes, open the&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong>&nbsp;window again and enter:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe.</span></strong><strong>Note:</strong>
<span>Resetting OneDrive re-syncs all your OneDrive files, which could take some time depending on how many files you’re syncing.<br />
</span><br />
</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Uninstall and reinstall your OneDrive. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To uninstall your OneDrive:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> then type <strong>Appwiz.cpl.</strong></li><li>On your <strong>Programs and Features</strong> window, look for <strong>Microsoft OneDrive.
</strong></li><li>Select Microsoft OneDrive then right-click and click <strong>Uninstall. </strong>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To install your OneDrive, you can download the OneDrive setup from this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/OneDrive-desktop-app-for-Windows-8-1-850703dd-ea56-4c7a-bff5-6c2e4da227cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link.</strong></a></p>
<p>

            <p>I have already uninstalled, cleared the One drive system files, and reinstalled countless times but it did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I've just tried the Reset method provided above. It did not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I thought it might be a system problem and I even reset my OS and the One drive still endlessly crashes after it's installed...Yet the weird thing is, I have 3 other devices that have healthy running One drive (2 PCs and 1 Tablet)..</p>

            <p>After a couple days of work, it turns out the error occurred due to the partition my One Drive folder located was corrupted. By formatting the partition the error finally is resolved.</p>

<h2>            Startup Repair will not let me cancel</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, for some reason I am having major issues with Windows 7 for the very first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I have NOT done any recent updates to my computer. For example, me starting Windows 7 is not because it is rebooting from a Windows update download. Second, when I shut my computer down it was not a hard shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is a Toshiba L505-S5988. 4GB of DDR3 RAM, 320 GB hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I turned on my computer and it get stuck on the "Windows starting" loading page.&nbsp; I did a hard shutdown and tried numerous remedies.&nbsp; I tried starting from a previous working point.&nbsp; I tried safe mode.&nbsp; All, of them got stuck.&nbsp; Finally, I let my computer
 initiate the Startup Repair. It asked me to do the restore and now it has been going for about an hour and will not let me cancel the operation.</p>
<p>Also, my computer did not come with a Windows 7 OS disk.</p>
<p>I have not had one issue with Windows 7, and I'm very frustrated because I need this computer for school and do no want to lose any data on my HD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I know this may sound similar to other posts, but not one person's description fit my situation.&nbsp; I didn't ugrade my OS or build my own system.&nbsp; Please help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Mike</p>

<p><span>Hi Mapel87,</span></p>
<p><span>Since the computer didn’t come with a Windows 7 operating system disk, the manufacturer (Toshiba) probably would have included a recovery partition
 that should provide the functionality of the Windows 7 operating system disk. You will need to contact Toshiba Support so that they can provide the instructions to access it.</span></p>
<p><span>In the meanwhile you may try the following steps and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Unplug all the external devices (except mouse and keyboard) and check if it helps and let us know the status.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try Last Known Good Configuration and check if it helps:</span></p>

<p>Please explain your justification for making this remark. In what way is Windows Live Mail a bigger risk than, say, Office Outlook or the Windows 10 Mail app? Or webmail, for that matter? Can you point to evidence showing that personal information has been
 put at risk by the program (and not by user action or account failings)? That the program causes the host computer to be at greater risk from worms and/or viruses than another mail client would, assuming the same level of malware protection? Or that a PC has
 suffered intrusion through this program? How do you suppose that that might happen?</p>

<p>Well, as I was informed from Microsoft and through my TechNet membership emails on topics almost 3 years ago, and one online conference I attended, Microsoft stopped support for Windows Live Mail. I even at the time just before upgrading to 10, had to start
 using Outlook online as WLM would no longer send or receive emails. Now I think you can switch the type of service to POP I think it was to use it as people are still using it, but Microsoft stated that it would not work for their new system which is obviously
 all the 10 features and technology for all devices over all platforms and WLM was not capable of it the way it was and for compatibility..&nbsp;There are no more security updates as I understood for WLM, So I would assume and from what I remember reading from Microsoft
 at the time, that no security update for it, and that would make it less secure and vulnerable in the future. Like any program or system with no more support, eventually someone will find the weaknesses for intrusion.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand we all are at risk with any emails and any client or app we use to access and open them. And obviously any email can get you no matter what if opened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But WLM 2012 is the last one right?&nbsp; with last updated support or security for it about 2 1/2 years ago right? and it is now 8 years old right?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they can find a way to get into your system like WannaCry and a few others recently and in the past, then they can find a way using an outdated app like WLM with no security support to get you that way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like, I can delete the post. I loved WLM, but I stopped using is as I upgraded to 10 and have no problem using W10 Mail or web for outlook email service.</p>

            And all the comical nonsense I see some posting on here totally&nbsp;misguiding people needing help, and you want to step on my foot. All I am saying is you are more at risk now and in future using an old program with no more support or security updates for
 it, especially an app that is used to access the internet, emails that contain malicious content and such. And ya ya we have virus and firewall protection, but that has its limits too.

            And if there was some security&nbsp;breach in the program, I doubt Microsoft would blink an eye about it because there is no more support for it. And Maybe Windows 10 is secure enough to use it without risk, but I am sure all the people in the world and corporations
 that have been hacked in one form or another with supported software, thought they were safe and they were not.

<p>OKEY DOKEY. There were upgrades of WLM though from 2006 to 2012, which possibly had new security built into each newer version along with upgraded features&nbsp;and fixes. I already pleased you by switching it to MY OPINION.

</p><p>Admit what buddy, That it can't be more of a risk then a current program.</p>
<p>Well hell, all the security updates over 20 years to stop a person for doing this or that and compromising your system or personal info and look at all the people and corporations in the world that have been hacked in about every possible way using current

    <title>SP2 MDP to DP Dell monitor connection issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markgm1957  say:</h3>
<h2>            SP2 MDP to DP Dell monitor connection issues</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 2 purchased at SF MS Store this February 2014. The ability to interface to Dell monitors from MDP to DP via has been patchy. I have 2 Dell 2560 resolution monitors.</p>
<p>MS ticket number &nbsp;SRX1251975611ID - SRX1251975611ID</p>
<p>The first goal is to get Monitor 2 working with MDP to DP</p>
<p>The second goal is to get Monitor 2 to daisy chain to Monitor 1 over DP (or HDMI whatever)</p>
<p>Sometimes the DP link was working @ 2560x1440, sometimes it was not connecting. Now after some installation of Dell drivers it looks like it is working as follows.</p>
<p>Note that MS Windows is fully updated.</p>
<p>MS surface display drivers were uninstalled (device manager-monitor-surface display) and the surface was rebooted.</p>
<p>Many different cables MDP-DP were tried including Amphenol and CSL brans certified for 2560x1600</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My Idea</span></strong><br />
I have a clear feeling that it is a driver problem. The MDP is working under certain conditions as above, so a loose contact can be eliminated. Maybe the Dell drivers are needed to be installed. I got the Dell DP monitor driver installed for Monitor #1 whilst
 the link was up. But I cannot seem to install the driver for monitor 2 unless a DP link is up</p>
<p>SUPPORT SO FAR</p>
<p>Dell say that they cannot help me, they say that the Monitors are passive devices and the issue is definitely with MS Surface.<br />
I had many discussions with MS Support. The European (German) team basically gave up and the USA team has got closer but not yet made a consequesnt solution. to date has not resolved the issue. The latest solution from the MS USA team was to check out the following
 link…however there is no clear solution defined as far as I can see, just people discussing.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro2-surfdevice/surface-pro-2-and-docking-station-with-multiple/57b196cc-697b-4bd7-bf43-e8fcfbdfda16?page=4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro2-surfdevice/surface-pro-2-and-docking-station-with-multiple/57b196cc-697b-4bd7-bf43-e8fcfbdfda16?page=4</a></p>
<p>HOW TO PROCEED</p>
<p>I think that some drivers need to be updated. Maybe Dell drivers need installation? Maybe MS monitor drivers need updating? Intel drivers?</p>
<p>Normally I need a competent monitor interface expert at MS make a plan of action to get drivers up and running well.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any proven solutions?</p>

            <p>I did a refresh. No luck. Now i ordered a new SP2 on 14 days approval to see if that works better.
</p>
<p>MS Germany declined to do an immediate swapout for the device i bought in the USA........ turnaround time 2 weeks without my PC is too much. MS therefore is nto really an international company from the point of service.. (Buyer Beware)</p>

    <title>Issue with Windows Update after a re-install. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue with Windows Update after a re-install.</h2>
                    <p>Aw **** were to start, a few days ago i was doing some checks as i normally do like check system restore to make sure its working. Well thats when all **** broke lose when i discovered that it wasn't working i could not restore my computer to any of the
 restore dates and restore dates i made would not work either. Well then i started to do some digging bout how to reinstall the system restore and finally came upon a folder DSR for Dell System Restore and in that folder their was a file that had started with
 "GUI" i clicked on this and it said warming by clicking this you will return your system to "Dell System Recovery Inenvironment" I thought i was turning on system restore but instead it was taking me back to the defualt or recovery opiton. Well i said to myself
 well ok i'll just choose one of the restore dates like " Return or Restore your computer to a state in which it was working" Or something to that affect i can't be sure since its been more then 48hrs since my fatal click of the mouse that started all of this.
 So now it brings me to the problem i have now, can't get Mirosoft Updates or Windows Updates i installed Net Framework 3.5 it then prompted me to go to Windows Update to install further updates for this service. But Windows Update still does not work. So i'm
 asking for help if any can be had? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My OS-Windows XP Home Edition-SP3 </p>
<p>Anitvirus is -McAfee not updated cause i plan to remove it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Norton Ghost 10 is install plan to remove it! </p>
<p>Browser IE8 Not fully Updated yet, but plan to! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Again just to remind my setup is in a defualt state other then service pack 3 which i was lucky enough to have the good sense to put on a flashdrive)</p>

I had (and still have) the same problem and regret to say the none of the available "Fixits" helped. Windows Updates connects and the animation gives the impression that the site is scanning the system in order to offer the necessary updates. However, by running
 a port scanner, I was able to determine that the update site had dropped the connection.
<br />
<br />
For the benefit of interested parties, the scanner I use is this one: http://nirsoft.net/utils/cports.html<br />
<br />
However, there are alternatives. <br />
<br />
What I did was to go to the Internet Storm Center site at SANS which displays the latest updates for all versions of Windows along with other patches such as those from Adobe and then to note the various article numbers. Here's the link to that: https://isc.sans.edu/<br />
<br />
From there, I went to the MS download site at http://search.microsoft.com/en-gb/DownloadResults.aspx?rf=sp&amp;q=KB2888505 and manually downloaded the patches I needed. Although I'm a confirmed Firefox fan, I recommend you download the patches using IE so that
 you can execute them immediately rather than downloading them to your own machine first as would be the case with any browser which doesn't support ActiveX.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, if you have a US version of windows, change "en-gb" to en-us" in the above mentioned link to take you to the US site instead.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

 and thats where i've been the better part of the last few weeks installing a massive amount of updates close to 150-200 updates just finsihingup this morning on all the nov updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one lesson i've learned from this is to "let sleeping dogs lie", i will never click on another folder i'm not sure bout or spend anymore time trying to fix an app or program&nbsp;on this sinking ship "the SSWDSXP". I wil try with all my might to get an new
 OS before april 2014, but if i can't i'll just take a break. Because the problems i've had over the last 3 to 5 months hardly seems worth it anymore!</p>

Hi Rann, <br />
<br />
Yes, I was there in the early days too. <br />
<br />
I haven't reinstalled XP since 2007 and I dread to think how long I'd have to spend downloading patches if I did. Several days at least.
<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about buying a copy of Win 7 before it disappears completely because I don't like the look of Win 8 at all. I don't need it at the moment since both my XP machines are running like a Swiss watch, but you never know what the future hold in store
 for you. <br />
<br />
As an alternative to Quicktime, I'd suggest the VLC player which can handle Quicktime formats and practically all other codecs. You can get it from here: http://www.videolan.org/<br />
<br />
I've been using VLC for about six years now and it's never let me down. <br />
<br />
Anyway, do come back if things go pear-shaped for you again. <br />

            Since i didn't get any decent answer i went ahead with the workaround in http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-update-installation-failure-80240020/d695e827-9774-4e10-8972-df8d51a7bb51 The only problem i had
 was with nvidia drivers. I had to reinstall the nvidia software and then the drivers. I concur that that would be to difficult for a lot of windows users. So the installer was correct and i should have waited if i wanted a smooth upgrade.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            If I enable 4 processors &#40;max&#41; in msconfig, will it increase my computer performance&#63; And is it safe&#63;</h2>
                    So i found out that my laptop is limited to use 1 processor and i changed it to 4 processor from msconfig to get better performance. I want to learn if it reduces the span of device. Is it good for performance? Thanks Microsoft.

            Hi Can, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br /> 
<br />Popular myth and can actually cause issues with some processor setups.
<br />Usually, because some erroneous benchmarking tool causes false readings. Let the BIOS and Windows handle them. Modern Intel Processors have Turbo Boost to handle issues if needed.

<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

<p>Hi Can,&nbsp;the Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U does have SpeedStep and TurboBoost and is best managed by Windows and the Intel software . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You have to remember you only really have one i5 processor, which has 2 cores and 4 threads, and the Intel firmware and software will manage it for you. When your system is performing small tasks, your processor will run on one or two threads and at a nominal
 speed, but when required, your processor will use all 4 threads and turbo boost will boost your processor way above the 2.80Ghz it is rated at . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry you have not done any damage . . .</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Which are the applications that you are trying to download?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Can you download other applications without any issues?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Check the article below which states that "This error can occur when the system date on your computer is set incorrectly".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try to reset the date and time on your computer and check if it helps you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> You can follow the steps listed in the article even if you are installing a different application other than Office XP.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Here's another post which addresses similar issue. Check if it helps you too.</div>

<p>My apologies for not getting back to you sooner, I can't recall what 2 of the download apps were. But the 2 that I can are</p>
<p>Seagates Disk Setup Wizard and Adobes product update. The error codes are all the same. The system restore did not correct</p>
<p>this. The second method you provided, was confusing, if you could give a little explaination of what to do I could try it.</p>
<p>I've tried to use the management console and looked at the event viewers, if you would like to see them let me know the best</p>
<p>way to get them to you.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for the help you're giving me.</p>

            Good news! Went into MSCONFIG through the&nbsp;Help and Support menu. Under the services tab, Windows Installer was set to manual start. Reset it to auto and was able to intall Adobe update along with Seagate Wizard. If that was what "geekgirl8" was describing,
 I wasn't understanding. This was the first time I posted a&nbsp;question. for future information could you walk me through taking a screenshot and uploading it. This may help others also. Thank you for all your help&nbsp;

<p>These directions were not sufficient in my case. &nbsp;There is another place in Word under Word Options -&gt; Save, called "Default personal templates location". &nbsp;I had to enter an alternative path in this place as well, otherwise Word would still create the folder
 in "My Documents". &nbsp;Also, this option exists in Word, PowerPoint and Excel, and I had to do it in all three. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            File History backup fails with Event ID 100</h2>
                    <p>File History Backup operation still fails on files with long file paths. As a developer I know that there is a limit on the path length that can be specified when using the OS file API, but I also know that there is a way to work around it. After all the
 same OS manage to write the file using larger file path than the max.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a backup application to not being able to handle simple issue like that is unacceptable and unprofessional.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when error like that happens it needs to show in the Action Center, to&nbsp;warn the user that there is a potential data loss in the backup.</p>

            <p>I just realized that the folders I have for the development of chapters in a book have not backed up to File History in the 6 months I've had this computer, which is running Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; I would not have known this without going into the File History
 folder itself on my external drive. File History, as accessed from Control Panel, does not give you any warning.&nbsp; Most of the error messages are as in this post, with MAX_PATH errors cited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This glitch is not only unacceptable for a program from a company that claims to be the leading developer in the world (and one that with File History is seeking to surpass other backup programs), it's outright dangerous to those of us who are trying to
 backup our data religiously.&nbsp; <em>None of the other purchased and free backup programs that I use (I have 5 drives backing up my data) have this limitation.</em></p>
<p>What gives, Microsoft? Why is every other program able to handle these files but File History cannot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this MAX_PATH limitation, I will now give up using File History. Another failure for Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Hi Kathryn</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct this has always been a problem ( since windows 8)&nbsp;with File History as I found out 12month ago. I though MS would fix it being such an important feature as backup but no. I have spent 1 full day on the phone to them to tell them of this fault.
 Which they know about by the way. The MAX_PATH for File history has bee reduced to somewhere between 205 and 220 character instead of the usual 256 which would collect most of the file I need but considering the file name convention on File History needs to
 be 300+ characters. They are mean to be getting back to me in the next 14 day that was 9 odd days ago. And I am not hopeful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes it the is a huge&nbsp;issue (wait a second feature aye Microsoft) that is the kind of thing they will tell you anyway. The other big issue is the lack of a warning as you stated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why have so few people complained because people just do not know there backup are incomplete. Until it is to late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This know&nbsp;issues needs to be bumped maybe with a new headline "<strong>WARNING your&nbsp;BACKUPS are&nbsp;INCOMPLETE using&nbsp;WINDOWS 8</strong>". millions need to know that Microsoft does not have&nbsp;there back.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>@Microsoft. </strong></p>
<p>This issue could be affecting millions of users backups. I there is anyone&nbsp;at Microsoft that has the decency to face up to&nbsp;this known issue and publicly admit that millions of users backups could be missing data. Or is the company line you don't post on
 issues that you know are your fault. Come on tell millions that there backups are incomplete because of your ignorance. This has been a know issue for so long now it is ridiculous and it has never been resolved or at least you could give users a warning of
 incomplete backup without having to go to a almost hidden place to find it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You are obviously to busy creating algorithms to wow the public with fancy features but do not care about there data being backed up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is a system called&nbsp;that cannot backup files which it creates? Winda Ate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent approx. 8 hours of pain on the phone to level one then level 2 and now research support. I found out you know this failure. This makes file history and support&nbsp;a complete failure, No more than that. It makes it a danger to million of peoples&nbsp;data.
 Things that cannot be replaced which is why we backup and&nbsp;why you tell people to backup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If something goes wrong with my PC and I loose data I will call support. They will ask did you backup sir and I will say YES&nbsp;WITH WINDOWS 8 FILE HISTORY and they will have to say well there inlays your problem sir you have used&nbsp;Microsoft's windows 8 backup
 please&nbsp;PURCHASE AN APPLE MAC TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE IMMEDIATLY.</p>

            You sound as if you're way more knowledgeable than I, when it comes to computers. &nbsp;So I'd like to know what you're now using as your backup/file history software. &nbsp;And is it free or does it have a cost? &nbsp;If the latter, what might that be?&nbsp;

            <p>Well, it took a long time to learn this (and BTW, I'm by no means an expert in these matters), but I now back up three ways:</p>
<p>1) Cloud--you can use Dropbox (free), Microsoft's OneDrive (free), or use a paid service like Carbonite. Dropbox and OneDrive are too small for me so I use Carbonite.</p>
<p>2) A daily sync--I've tried many products and have settled on Goodsync (sometimes you can get this for a discount; works on only one computer)</p>
<p>3) A weekly backup--I use the free version of AOMEI, which also can be used to do a daily sync, if you wish.</p>
<p>All of my research is on my computer, so I have to protect it in some way. I hope this helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>this idiot MAX_PATH nonsense is the reason I had to stop using OneDrive as well.&nbsp; I have directories with deep directories because modern programming tools create them (ie. I have no choice).&nbsp; I have 1TB of worthless online storage because I can't safely
 put files in OneDrive (so I have to pay for dropbox too).</p>

<p>Wow, 3 years later and this is still an issue! What the heck are you doing, MS?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just switched back to windows after 7 years on OSX. People said "windows 10 is better, you'll be happy". So far, I have this issue which is a bad one because it's easy to not know your backups are incomplete(!), and I have an issue with word 2016 not scrolling
 that was first reported at least 4 years ago. And there's still issues with multiple interfaces for changing system settings - which has always been confusing. I am happy about the alt key again, how it brings input focus to menus and triggers dialog buttons
 - however it's not as useful as it used to be with the office ribbon and some other contemporary designs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, a mediocre experience for me coming back to windows after 7 years. Bummer.</p>

<p>How can Microsoft claim that File History offers &nbsp;safety, when it, in fact, is a trap that creates a hazardous situation by being unable to backup files created in its own operational system!</p>
<p>Microsoft backup poses &nbsp;serious treat to users because it does not do what it is suposed to do!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Screen Saver Dual Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raphaelsussman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Screen Saver Dual Screen</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">I have a high-performance 64-bit Workstation with special NVIDIA Quadro 4000 drivers for the dual monitors designed for AutoCAD
 3D. When I first upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, the screen saver displayed properly on only one screen while I was able to use both screens during normal operation. I recently had to re-install Windows 10 and discovered that the screen saver now uses
 the PC Display settings of Monitor 1 only, Monitor 2 only, Duplicate, or Extended. In Extended mode, the screen saver displays on the crack between the two monitors. In Monitor 1 (or 2) Only or Duplicate mode, I cannot use the two monitors for work. The system
 recognizes the two monitors and the drivers and operates normally. I re-installed all drivers for all hardware devices including the graphics card and the monitors, performed a hardware diagnostics and checked for updates to Windows 10: no joy. Any advice?</span>

            After reading relies to the forum I realized that the generic Photos screensaver that comes with Windows 10 is only one of many screensaver products available from other vendors, and is not sufficiently sophisticated to work with multiple monitors. &nbsp;I
 elected to use Google Photos Screensaver and to store my images in Google Photo, as the Picasa product suggested by others in the forum is no longer available.

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Windows Essentials 2012 suite which included Movie maker was retired by Microsoft as on 10-Jun-17. Hence, Microsoft doesn't provide the download for this. 
<br />
<br />But you can download Windows Essentials 2012 suite which will include Movie Maker also from below location.

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />Movie maker is no longer a part of windows as it has been discontinued. 
<br />

<br />There is a replacement that is part of the photos app. If you open the photos app that came with windows 10 there is a "new video" button in the top left. 
<br />
<br />There are also some good free alternatives you could download such as "shotcut".

<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor and I'm here to help you.
<br />Movie Maker has been dismissed on Windows 10. You can use Video Editor instead. You can find it following this procedure:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + S
<br />2. Type "Video Editor" without quotes and press ENTER

 usable and 2.5 gb hardware reserved. If i insert only 1 ram (no matter which one) then it shows 1.48 gb usable so the problem is even if i add my another ram it simply goes to hardware reserved. my laptop is hp pavillion g4 and i'm using windows 10 64 bit.
 Please help me on this.</span>

            This must be due to the motherboard not having enough video memory and it is automatically reserving it from RAM. Fiddle up your BIOS settings and decrease the Video Memory. For the exact settings ask your mobo manufacturer.

<h2>            Mass Effect trilogy on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone know if the Mass Effect Trilogy will be remastered for the xbox one?</p>
<p>Or should I just grab a 360 and get the Mass Effect Trilogy for the 360.</p>
<p>Assuming that my Xbox live gamertag won't be buggered up by having an xbox one as well, but any replies that clears that up would be great.</p>

<p>As of now BioWare has stated that they have no intention of remastering any of their games. &nbsp;I would just snatched up the Mass Effect trilogy on Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Personally, I would much rather see them remaster Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age 2. &nbsp;Then bundle it with Inquisition on Xbox One. &nbsp;(They DA:O and Dragon Age 2, need it more, and I like them better). &nbsp;Just my opinion though</p>

<p>Well take this with a grain of salt. &nbsp;But I went into Gamestop a few weeks ago to purchase Mass Effect on PS3; don't have my 360 anymore. &nbsp;Anyway the salesman I know as I go in there waaay too much. &nbsp;He frowned and said wait until after E3 you might see
 a remaster for the X1. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said grain of salt here but I'm waiting until after E3; just in case.</p>

    <title>Xbox One S controller disconnects constantly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danieldickson81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One S controller disconnects constantly</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I recently picked up the Xbox One S and out of the box, I immediately ran into the controller losing connection consistently. Wondering if anyone could offer up any suggestions? Anything insight is appreciated!</p>
<p>What I've tried:</p>
<p>Replaced batteries numerous times with brand new batteries (different brands)</p>
<p>Updated the controller to the newest firmware available.</p>
<p>Plugged in the controller to the console via USB, this seems to help alleviate the issue however it's happened so much I cannot confirm if it's disconnecting while connected or while off. &nbsp;I feel as if it's been consistent while plugged in. &nbsp;Possible interference
 issue? &nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of broadcast signal, I have an TP Link Archer C9 dual band AC router - 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz ranges are active. &nbsp;The only other bluetooth devices would be phones, but bluetooth is never active on those. &nbsp;I do not live in a high congested area in terms
 of broadcast signal. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Any thoughts are very much welcome, thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Mac</p>

<p>The controllers connect the same way (which is how they are compatible on both systems). &nbsp;The S controllers have Bluetooth in them which makes them usable on devices other than the Xbox One, such as a PC. &nbsp;If you happen to have your original Xbox One controller,
 I would try pairing it to see if it has any problems. &nbsp;If it works fine, than it's probably the controller. &nbsp;If it has a problem too, it's likely something going on with the Xbox itself.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification on connection of the controllers. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I do not have my old xbox one controller / console as I've sold it. &nbsp;I've started up a case with Amazon to get the whole unit replaced as I've only owned it for 1.5 weeks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I've had a similar thing going on with my brand spanking new controller. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When it does it, I push and hold the xbox button for a couple of seconds. &nbsp;I usually get the pop-uo to power off console/controller, but can't navigate the options. &nbsp;I then press and hold the power button for a second. &nbsp;The controller vibrates and starts
 working again.</p>

<p>I just got an xbox one S this month. My wireless controller kept disconnecting. I tried new double a batteries and charging kit. Neither worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here’s what did....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unplugged my Amazon Echo dot since it might have interferred. I tried countless USB cables to manually connect with a wire and none worked. kept disconnecting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one that did work was the echo dot cable plugged into the back of the xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went online to buy a longer one and one thing I would reccommens is search for Fire TV Stick usb CHARGING cable. They have a ten foot one on there that provides more power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesnt solve the wireless but I can play flawlessly wired now.&nbsp;</p>
