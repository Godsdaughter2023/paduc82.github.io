<h2>            14965 - 14971 - Firefox Browser Issue</h2>
                    <p>I know there is another thread on Browsers not working like they used to.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;like to&nbsp;direct this thread specifically to Firefox.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;was a Firefox user up to 14965.&nbsp; This install set the default to Edge as expected so I reset to Firefox, as usual.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a fair # of Desktop Icons for my frequent websites.&nbsp; I also have a ton of Bookmarks (Favourites).&nbsp;&nbsp; Without exception, when I select a Firefox shortcut, I get strange and failing results.&nbsp; With Firefox Bookmarks, they still work as advertised.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can change the default Browser to Edge and the Desktop Icons work fine and the Bookmarks perform the same as in Firefox.&nbsp; I can take the Properties of the Bookmark and copy/paste into Firefox for a search and it loads fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I show 3 shots using Paint 3D of a Firefox load using a Desktop Icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot #1&nbsp;starts off with the download of a file.&nbsp; Never saw this before.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shot #2 shows the load of the page with what might be some low level computer instructions.&nbsp; Take note of the address now showing in the website address.&nbsp; It is an address hidden very deep in layers of folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shot #3 is just the bottom of the same page trying to load.&nbsp; I choose the Insider Site and it gets to the spinning wheel but never loads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Edge, all works like it used to in Firefox.&nbsp; Firefox is no longer an option for me with Desktop Icons.&nbsp; No issue with Firefox Bookmarks.&nbsp; I have delayed starting a thread but I don't see a large trend just on Firefox.&nbsp; All comments welcomed.&nbsp; I find
 Bookmarks in Edge more difficult to get used too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a &nbsp;few full down sliders on each shot to view the full print screen.</p>

            <p>I think the devs have been instructed to write the code to capture any shortcut on the desktop that points to the default browser, and revise it to point to Edge, regardless of what browser has been set as default.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's correct, Firefox bookmarks that exist within Firefox will continue to work as always, but Firefox shortcuts on the desktop won't, as you have described. So, ones like you, who maintain desktop browser shortcuts, may as well plan to make them relate
 to Edge, by leaving Edge set as default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe Microsoft envisions a lot of income from advertising in Windows 10, as well as whatever subscription apps they can attract users into. Enticing/forcing users into using Edge is part of that plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I expect Microsoft to offer discounted or free advertising to websites if they will set their sites to require Edge to access them, or at least optimize for use through Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, in 2 or 3 years, new computers, tablets, etc. will come with a free 90 day trial subscription to Windows, and $100 or so per year after that.</p>

<p>Pretty sure you are onto something.&nbsp; I get along not too bad with Edge.&nbsp; I can likely get used to it.&nbsp; I still struggle with the damn Favorites.&nbsp; I often can't find, like just now but did find.&nbsp; Seems awkward compared to Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the comments.&nbsp; Perhaps I can rearrange my bookmarks better on Firefox.&nbsp; For many years, I have had a "Daily" folder&nbsp;for bookmarks that are frequently used.&nbsp; It is a click on the "daily" which directs to perhaps a dozen frequent fliers.&nbsp; My 6 -8
 desktop shortcuts are true frequent fliers such as my bank, Insiders, etc.&nbsp; That could be a fallback.</p>

            <p>Yes, I agree about the awkwardness of favorites in Edge. I had said that I wouldn't even try it until after 2 years of development, but decided yesterday to go ahead and look at it briefly, and was pleasantly surprised at its performance (not its looks).

            <p>I for one do not like Edge and prefer Firefox and am very upset about the direction MS is taking. Desktop shortcuts no longer work if Firefox is set as the default browser in these preview builds which is a hint on the things to come. If this is the case,
 I will be looking for OS alternatives. I will not let MS dictate which software I have to use.</p>

            I found the same issue using Google Chrome and I reset it as Cal54 has posted which I have been doing every time I gets an upgrade (new build) been doing that seems like since day one. once reset it works normal until the next upgrade. Edit add on my 2
 RTM system I haven't had this issue as both are on Chrome and whenever it gets a new build it seems to carry over, I don't use Firefox.

            <p>When I goto url as the 'default apps by file type' the only choices are Internet Browser or Look for an app in the store. Firefox is not in that list. I am also using Preview build 14971.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I look at Choose Default apps by protocol, Firefox is listed under HTTP and HTTPS. Still does not work. If I click on any Internet desktop shortcut, it takes me to file, not url</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example, if I setup a desktop link for Google, this is where I get directed to</p>
<p>file:///C:/Users/MyPC/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/IE/2IFSXBNI/JT8IIQQT</p>
<p>instead of https://www.google.com/</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can select IE or Edge as the default browser and it works as expected, Chrome and Firefox do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be some registry hack to fix this</p>

            I did find a workaround. I installed RocketDock which is a free desktop toolbar. All the sites in the toolbar will open to Firefox now. So I just moved all my internet shortcuts to the dock. Probably other toolbar programs may also work.<br />

            <p>Actually When I set the defaults I used the Control Panel and clicked on (Default Programs)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then scroll down to (,url) double clicked it. Then chose (More apps) if Firefox is not a Choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down to and click on (Look for another app on this PC) then you will be using the file browser to go to your</p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox folder in&nbsp; Programs x86 if you have 32 bit and click on the Firefox.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>After completing the change your Desktop links should work.</p>

            <p>Hi Leo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure how all these different issues you've raised all relate.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like you're infected, you're having trouble dowloading or installing MSE (or uninstalling MSE or even uninstalling only the MSE installation file), and you're having trouble
 with Security Center.&nbsp; I'm not quite sure where to begin, so I'll try to start with how I would address the problems you've raised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue is that you can't delete the downloaded installation file for MSE (as opposed to uninstalling MSE), then try using one of the following programs to see if that helps delete it:
<span>Unlocker at: </span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</span></a></span><span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>or File Assassin </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</span></a>.&nbsp; That should resolve that problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have an issue with Security Center and others have also had it. Some have resolved it using the following and some have done so by getting assistance from Microsoft (instructions follow). Some have been unable to resolve it for whatever reason (but
 I haven't seen many such cases after all options have been tried). Some are willing to live with the problem (since MSE has its own notification icon and if it is showing green and active, then you are protected despite what Security Center may be reporting
 (it's not that Security Center is right and you aren't protected - it's that Security Center does not recognize MSE is there and enabled and working)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if it is about the security center, please check out the answers and suggestions in the following thread:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/xp-security-center-reports-virus-protection-not/1484c369-a138-4544-aa40-a3bb91dee5b9">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/xp-security-center-reports-virus-protection-not/1484c369-a138-4544-aa40-a3bb91dee5b9</a>.
 Specifically try the fix that's recommended. If that doesn't work, then try the options below. If you still have the problem, then go the the last part of the answer in the above thread for the procedure to submit an email support case and do that to get expert
 assistance with your problem as you will have tried all the tricks we know about. Although written for XP, with a little tweaking because they are a bit different, it can apply to Vista and W7 as well and the needed changes shouldn't be too hard to figure
 out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some additional considerations compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Perform these checks:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you have removed <strong><span>all other real-time antimalware products</span></strong> that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial product that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare,
 Malwarebytes (paid), etc). Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></b><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall
 tools</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that Windows Defender is uninstalled (if XP), or Disabled (if Vista/W7).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Remove Zone Alarm if you have it and use the Windows Firewall.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that the Windows Firewall is on, and set to defaults. </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you are not using a proxy server.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you have “install updates automatically” selected in Windows Update (even though the MSE definition updates are optional).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>In IE, reset all security zones to default level.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>You may need to remove and reinstall MSE as well (assuming it's installed at the moment) - we'll get to that shortly so hold off a bit on this until we get to that part with detailed instructions.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove (some of which you may already have done, but check these as some are more detailed and deserve more atttention:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that Windows Defender is uninstalled (if XP), or Disabled (if Vista/W7).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Try a clean boot </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>. If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.
 Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal
 status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE (assuming it is installed). To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:

http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a>&nbsp; in Advanced Mode to do the uninstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: </span>
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</span></a><span>
 - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></b></a><span>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install, go to </span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a></span><span> and click on languages and locales
 at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running it).<span>&nbsp;
</span>When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then update MSE, configure it to your choosing, and run a full scan to check for malware.&nbsp; Remove anything you find.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Next, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span>
 and then run a full Security Scan from Microsoft:</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a><span>. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably
 not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try
 them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you
 can ignore the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow these recommendations compliments of JimR1 - MVP:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials? (I assume you are by now or have at least tried to do so - and if so, consider yourself as running MSE).</span></b></p>

    <title>Silverlight Installation problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Silverlight Installation problems</h2>
                    I am trying to install Silverlight on my windows pc.&nbsp; I've down loaded the program, but when I try to install I am automatically transferred to the Microsoft App store. When I search the store for Silverlight, it's not there. Why can't I just install?
 This is very frustrating.

<br />
<br />For Windows Internet Explorer users:
<br />
<br />The browser will prompt you to either run or save the installation file (Silverlight.exe). Click Run to start the download. When the download is finished, the browser prompts you again to run the installer. Click Run to start the installation. Note that you must have sufficient administrative privileges to install Silverlight. 
<br />
<br />Click 'Install now' after reviewing the license agreement and privacy statement.
<br />
<br />If you have had a previous version of Silverlight installed, or are using Mozilla Firefox, you will need to restart your browser.
<br />
<br />You can now use Silverlight.
<br />Verify
<br />
<br />Verify your installation by experiencing the Silverlight site.

            I know why, you are probably running Windows 10 in S mode. Try this first.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />Click in the 'installing apps' list box
<br />Choose 'Warn me before installing apps outside the store'
<br />
<br />If that does not work, you likely need to upgrade from Windows 10 S to the full version.

<p>If you have a compatible bluetooth printer, you can print directly from N8 to printer. Alternatively, HP have an app called HP iPrint Photo which I think will use wifi. I presume this only works with compatible HP printers.</p>

<p>As I have done for more than 10 years, and about 30 of my clients have, I do NOT want the preview pane displayed until I need it. I delete various messages and reply,... without the pane displaying the message body.</p>
<p>I do not want the pane on always. A toggle button is available in all versions of outlook and outlook express.</p>
<p>I can not find the option to display such. Where is it?</p>
<p>J</p>

<p>Customize the ribbon (put it on the home ribbon) or the QAT - You can either add the off and right (or bottom) buttons or the reading pane menu. (they don't toggle, so you need 2)</p>

I cannot make calls to certain mobile contacts which heretofore were no problem. When attempting such calls, a notation appears on the screen--"Calls to this destination are temporarily blocked".&nbsp; Also when trying to send sms messages to these same contacts,
 the following notation appears: "sms not sent due to restricted account. Fix Account".&nbsp; There is NO problem with my account, both sms messages and calls to most other contacts go through. I have the latest version of SKYPE. PLEASE HELP!!</p>

Hi Rodney&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally had my problem resolved, but had to go on to "live chat'' with a Microsoft Agent who was extremely helpful to get to the bottom of my problem.&nbsp; The issue was resolved within 48 hours.

<h2>            HELP&#33; Our business is being ruined by Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Our business is at a stand still!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All we need is to be able to share a calendar that we can edit, and it's not happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We each have our own MS Office 365 Small Business premium ($15/each)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I email her to share the calendar, it says she has to be in my "organization" which is outrageous.&nbsp; I specifically asked this BEFORE we upgraded from home if we could collaborate and multiple sales reps told us we could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been cheated, lied to, and now we are seriously wasting time on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone PLEASE help?</p>

            <p>Full Calendar sharing is indeed only supported when both your accounts are within the same Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps this was unclear to the sales rep or he/she misunderstood your requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact Microsoft Support about the options to request a refund or terminate the contract if this was the main reason to get an Office 365 Small Business subscription. Another way to go would be to request to transfer the license so that both your
 user accounts are within the same Exchange organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an alternative, you can use <u><font color="#0066cc">CodeTwo NetCalendars</font></u> or
<u><font color="#0066cc">CodeTwo Public Folders</font></u> to share and sync your Outlook data over the Internet without needing to be within the same Exchange organization or even use Exchange at all.</p>

    <title>PowerPoint 2010 hyperlinks to PDF files do not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lauriefl  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2010 hyperlinks to PDF files do not work</h2>
                    <p>I am using PowerPoint 2010. I have created presentations with hyperlinks to pdf files and saved it as a&nbsp;PPT slideshow. All these files&nbsp;have been added&nbsp;to an Adobe Acrobat X Portfolio file that I created&nbsp;and were suppoesed&nbsp;to be delivered to&nbsp;our customer.
 However the hyperlinks in the PPT show do not work. I get the error msg "Cannot open the specified file" This portfolio file is going to be opened by numerous people at numerous sites via their web server. Does anyone have a fix for the hyperlinks&nbsp;or does
 Microsoft not play nice with Adobe? I suspect it's an issue with the hyperlink paths, but I don't know what it is.&nbsp;I've tried everything I can think of to resolve the issue. Of course, it works when I launch it from my hard drive. The path natually defaults
 to my system.</p>
<p>Thanks for any ideas, thoughts, solutions. I felt like a fool promoting Adobe Portfolio to&nbsp;package all these files and then not having the hyperlinks&nbsp;PPT&nbsp;work&nbsp;I don't think it's a portfolio issue, but I'm not sure of that either.</p>

            Laurie,
<div><br />
<div>My pleasure. &nbsp;Learned a few new things in looking this up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First off, FixLinks won't help in this situation. &nbsp;I think you can pretty well trust my opinion on this; I wrote it. &nbsp;;-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>OTOH, it might help if you need to bulletproof links to individual PDF files outside a portfolio. First, though, I'd put all the PDFs in the same folder as the saved PPT/PPTX, and only then create the links to them. &nbsp;In some cases, that creates a "pathless"
 link which usually works on other systems, so long as the PPT and linked files remain in the same folder. &nbsp;In other cases, PPT insists on including the full path to the linked file. &nbsp;On your PC. &nbsp;So it breaks when you move it somewhere else. &nbsp;That's the kind
 of thing FixLinks can help with.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Somewhere on Adobe's site, I saw something about how links between documents in a portfolio only work between the included PDFs; other file types need not apply. &nbsp;Sounds like that's the case here.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            Portfolio creates one uber-file that contains other subsidiary PDFs. &nbsp;If the links in PPT point to the original (ie, subsidiary) PDFs, then I'd *expect* them to break if you only send the portfolio PDF plus the PPT.
<div><br />
<div>
<div>If the linked-to file isn't there (as an independent file on the hard drive, not as part of a zip or portfolio), the link will break.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've done a bit of research but haven't found a way of linking from an external document to a specific file within a portfolio, but you can apparently create links within the portfolio. &nbsp;So you could conceivably link from the PPT to the portfolio PDF and
 have its opening page contain a menu of links to the other PDF documents within the portfolio.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or you could just distribute the PPT along with all the linked PDFs. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            IMAP Migration from Lotus Notes</h2>
                    
<p>A few months ago the company started migrating mail from Lotus Notes to Office 365 accounts. In the mean time users on the Lotus Notes have been moving mail around&nbsp;to different folders in Lotus. Now from what we can tell the movement of mail in the Lotus
 notes folders are not mirrored in Outlook.&nbsp; So it looks like we need to remigration the mail again.&nbsp; What is the best solution for this?&nbsp;&nbsp; Should&nbsp; we recreate the outlook account and redo the IMAP settings for each user. I hate to do this since all the groups
 already have been built. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi HelmutLipp7526,</p>
<p>Based on your description, since the IMAP migration was successfully performed a few months ago, it’s expected behavior that user’s movement of emails in the Lotus Notes folders at present will not be mirrored in his corresponding Office 365 mailbox. Thanks
 for your understanding. Actually, after the migration batch is deleted, mailboxes on the IMAP system are no longer synchronized with Exchange Online mailboxes. You may check the IMAP migration process for more information:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200751(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200751(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>In this case, if you want the latest folders in the Lotus Notes to be mirrored in their Office 365 mailboxes again, it’s recommended that you
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj874015(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
re-run the IMAP migration</a>&nbsp;to do the trick. Then for future use, you may just ask the users to move emails around folders in their Office 365 mailboxes. As a side note, you don’t need to recreate the Office 365 accounts, just delete the migrated emails and
 modify the previously used .csv file if needed. And for fear of losing data, you can also ask the users to

backup their emails</a>&nbsp;using the Outlook client before the deletion.</p>
<p>Let us know if anything is misunderstood.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 file wont open to full screen - leaves one row above it.</h2>
                    <p>Not sure why it does this, but my Excel doesnt open fully.</p>
<p>It is annoying. &nbsp;How do i get it to open to full screen??</p>
<p>I am launching a file from my task bar. &nbsp;i always have to expand it. &nbsp;this is Excel 2016 and i am on windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have learned that this happens only when i have a file already opened and then open another file.</p>
<p>It then puts the latter one right below the open one leaving only the top row of the first one. &nbsp;Strange.</p>

            <p>That's so you can still click the one behind it (to prevent it from being covered up and hard to reach).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing happens if you open two of almost anything. &nbsp;For example, open Calculator, then open another Calculator. &nbsp; The 2nd one will open slightly down from the first one. &nbsp;This is called "cascade".</p>

            <p>Thanks. Yep, i know that is called cascade. &nbsp;This is one right below the other but not below and to the right. It is not exactly cascade. &nbsp;Also, how do i change that cascade-type setting? I want the new file to open full screen over the ones that are open.
 I dont want that cascade stuff. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing is that it doesnt always open slightly lower than the first opened file. &nbsp;Right now it is not happening. It is odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things seem to be working now. Not sure why this happens though. Now everything is opening and expanding to full screen whether a file is open or not. &nbsp;Have dealt with this over the last few weeks. &nbsp;I will monitor it. &nbsp;Should be able to control this. &nbsp;Unless
 u specify that u want cascading or a file to open slightly below one you have open, it shouldnt assume you want that. That's no good. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>There is no option for it, that's how it was designed. &nbsp;I think the only way to prevent from seeing it is to click the "maximize" button so that new files you open will be full-screen and thus directly overlap the one underneath.</p>

            <p>They're taking feedback and pushing updates every few weeks. &nbsp;For example, two of my favorite features are that you no longer have an extra pop-up save box. &nbsp;When you go to save, you can just name your file right then and there on that screen (top image
 in screenshot below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you save as a CSV, they also got rid of the decades-old extra "are you sure you want to save in CSV?" prompts. &nbsp;Now it provides a soft warning in the notification (yellow bar), but it doesn't interrupt you with an extra dialog box. (lower image in screenshot
 below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many many more changes to come, every couple weeks. &nbsp;It's like smart phone apps now: you get updates regularly. &nbsp;No more waiting for 5 or 7 years and getting a giant update all at once for $400 bucks to buy the new Office. &nbsp;Instead, you just get updates
 as they happen.</p>

            <p>Nice, maybe they can set it up so you can select an area and then right click and see the PRINT AREA choice in the menu instead of having to do that from the top ribbon,... select print area in the ribbon, then select the actual print area,etc. &nbsp;Need Set
 Print Area added to right click menu.</p>
<p>Also, add the ability to format as number and not have it shoot out 2 decimal places and have to move it back. &nbsp;Need a one click solution for that too. &nbsp;I have other suggestions too. i think i submitted this though and also added it to Excel Uservoice.</p>

    <title>Ringtone locations and volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> resourceful  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ringtone locations and volume</h2>
                    
<p>I think I know the answer to this but want to confirm. I've noticed at least&nbsp;4 possible&nbsp;locations for the ringtones on my WM6 device. Three are folders "Sounds", "Rings",&nbsp;and "My Ringtones". I also have a ringtone
 on my device that is not in any folder. All of these ringtones are available to select for my phone. I have placed the same ringtone in different folders and they show up as multiple selections on the ringtone list. So, to confirm, as long as they are on the
 device, they will show up as an available ringtone? The Windows Mobile site says to explicitly place the ringtone in the "Sounds" folder. I want to manage them as best as possible to conserve memory. The best for me is the "My Ringtone" folder as it can be
 synced to PC and backed up. That should be OK, right? When I try to delete a ringtone, it gives me a warning that other programs may not function. That's because it picks up all ringtone files, even those with the same names in different locations, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other question is volume. I have the device at full volume but would be nice if louder. Any way to do this? Probably not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIA</p>

                    <div>
<p>Hi Community!</p>
<p>Just after I've signed in, skype automatically disconnects (i.e. right after my status gets green as "Active"). I get no error message, the login is successful, then the little blue wheel besides my name is turning, and when it gets to green woops
 I am back to the sign in window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am on Windows 10 Pro, version 10.0.17763 Build 17763</p>
<p>My Skype version is&nbsp;8.44.040</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue does not happen when I sign in on another device (iPhone, other computer). This issue does not happen when I sign in using a different account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried with or without the 2-step verification, still doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In advance, thanks a zillion for your response!!!</p>

            Hi SuzyE
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>OK. Have you tried to see if you can save images in Edge? Also shouldn't you be addressing that question to Opera?</p>

            The problem only happened after the insider update, Opera may not cater for beta software but I do feel it's possibly a Microsoft issue because of the rs 16179 update....... just being a good beta tester &amp; seeing if anyone else has this issue!

    <title>Scrren blanking on calls with Bluetooth Headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hank_cha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scrren blanking on calls with Bluetooth Headset</h2>
                    I use a Bluetooth headset most of the time I talk on the phone.&nbsp; Many of those times are on conference calls.&nbsp; The screen blanks at its normal time-out.&nbsp; This causes problems when trying to mute and un-mute my phone.&nbsp; I may be using Bluetooth, but the
 screen needs to stay active whenever a call if active.<br />
<br />
I have read many solutions, including blowing, cleaning the dust, shining a bright light.&nbsp; I have tried all of these, but the phone still blanks at its normal time-out period.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Is there any way to turn off the time-out screen blank during calls? <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the forum entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is by design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have only the standard option for the screen saver.</p>
<p>If you go on the windows phone to settings then lock screen.</p>
<p>There you can change the screen timeout. </p>
<p>Please not that will increase the battery usage. </p>
<p>You have one more option, you can do a feature request on the following page.</p>

<p>sudolinux,</p>
<p>I don't recall that issue existing with Project 2010 but if there was an update that fixed it, there most likely would also be an update that fixed it for later versions. Is you version of Project 2013 fully updated? It should be versions 15.0.4953.1000
 which is the August 2017 cumulative update. If you are not up to date, run Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Question on Conversation View and Flagging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulchung1687  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question on Conversation View and Flagging</h2>
                    <p>Background:</p>
<p>The conversation view in Outlook is great! I am currently using it and it works like a charm. I just recently switched companies and I am trying to get the same settings that I used to have before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>In conversation view, all the emails within the conversation are grouped together. On my previous Outlook, when I flagged any of the emails within the conversation, it would show a flag in the title of the email. Now, if I don't flag the original email and
 flag a later email in the conversation, it doesn't show up where I can see it. I need to uncollapse the whole conversation to find that one of the emails are flagged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Request:</p>
<p>Is there a way for the collapsed conversation to show up as flagged when I flag a later email in the conversation? This helps me to see that I have a flagged email in the conversation right away without having to uncollapse the whole conversation. I know
 that when I flag an email it creates a to-do task but it is much easier to keep track of in the conversation list pane. I know that this is possible as I was able to do it in my previous job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />

 up in the top of the screen, as follows, "ERROR: unable to find a bootable option. press any key to shut down." i have downloaded the window device recovery tool, but it doesn't detect the phone? Any ideas from this point?</p>
<p>many thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

            Hi, thanks for your reply?, the phone is not detected by the PC, it still shows the error message at the top of the screen,: "ERROR: unable to find a bootable option. press any key to shut down". I've tried the soft and hard reset, but nothing happens,
 only the error message appears again? &nbsp;

            <p>It sounds like the firmware's not working, time to find a repair centre? You should NEVER see an error like that with any of the usual reset types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or get a replacement - try a Lumia 950. Sorry. </p>

<p><span>When you give a document the same name as another document you are overwriting the file with the new file. The original document with that name
 has been deleted and replaced with the new one. Unless you have another copy of the document located someplace else on your pc, it is most likely gone. You should probably just start typing!</span></p>
