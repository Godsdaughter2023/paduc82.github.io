    <title>Is it possible to automatically assign styles based on certain Font - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mmo17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to automatically assign styles based on certain Font attribute combinations&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am having the problem that I started writing a piece of text in MS Office's OneNote 2010 using the styles that are offered there (Heading &lt;n&gt;, Code, Normal, Quote, etc.). That document&nbsp;kept growing and now I need more formatting power and so&nbsp;I need to
 transfer the text to Word 2010. Of course I had assumed, that these styles would later seamlessly translate into Word Styles, but not so. ||-(&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing a proper mapping would have been much too easy and consistent and that is of course not MS' style (pun intended!)
</p>
<p>If I copy-paste the text into Word (regardless of which mode: with or without keeping the source formatting), then all the OneNote styles are gone! Instead, in Word the entire text has style "Normal" albeit with different "exceptions", i.e.&nbsp;a former Heading1
 is now style &nbsp;"Normal with Font Calibri size 16 Bold", a former "Code" piece has style "Normal with Font Courier new 11", etc.</p>
<p>Thus I am now seeking a work-around: Is it possible to automatically assign styles based on "well-known" attribute combinations? Such as:
</p>
<p>If you encounter a style "Normal with Font Calibri 16 Bold" assign it the style "Heading 1".</p>
<p>If you encounter a style "Normal with Font Courier New 11" assign it the style "Code" (or HTML Typewriter or whatever...).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any idea: is this feasible and somewhat easy to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is there some other work-around to transfer OneNote styles to corresponding Word styles?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS.: Such a feature or style translator&nbsp;would actually be very powerful tool allowing to also convert text from people who do what I call "visual formatting" (i.e. adjusting attributes by hand) to text that uses proper styles.It always drives me nuts, if
 I get some text (and should continue to work with it), where everything is some odd exception of some completely inappropriate style...</p>

            <p>Well - in the meantime I found the reason: the font settings that differ from the style applied (like when you apply style "Normal" and then manually change&nbsp;some range to, say a larger font or bold or such) are to be found&nbsp;<u>only</u> via the Font object
 and not in the range's style (even though the used-styles list will display something like "Normal + 16pts, Bold"). There is no such style! The style is "Normal" and contains the default values, but the range's font is 16pts and Bold.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it seems simple and obvious, but I hadn't realized how Word stores that info...</p>

            By default Access uses the Banker's Rounding algorithm (round-half-even).&nbsp; The following function on the other hand will always round from zero:<br />
<br />
Public Function RoundFromZero(dblVal As Double, dblTo As Double) As Double<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim intUpDown As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lngTestValue As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dblTestValue As Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dblDenominator As Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If dblVal &lt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intUpDown = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intUpDown = -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dblDenominator = intUpDown * dblTo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dblTestValue = dblVal / dblDenominator<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngTestValue = Int(dblTestValue)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RoundFromZero = intUpDown * lngTestValue * dblTo<br />
&nbsp;<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
Paste the function into a standard module in the database, and save the module under a name which does not conflict with that of any other object, e.g. mdlRounding.<br />
<br />
To round to an integer, 1 is passed into the function as the dblTo argument, e.g. RoundFromZero(2.5,1) will return 3.&nbsp; Negative values are also rounded away from zero, so RoundFromZero(-2.5,1) will return -3.<br />
<br />

    <title>Hong Kong Map &#40;English version&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hong Kong Map &#40;English version&#41;</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I just downloaded the Hong Kong maps via Nokia Map Loader. The download went fine, but street names are all wrong? All the English names are in Mainland romanization. instead of the standard English names they use in Hong Kong. It's complete useless. Does anyone
 know where to get a proper map with proper English street names. Any help is much appreciated ... this is completely amazing<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Sounds like something you should feed back to Nokia Support via the link above right - I'm sure they think they're being "culturally sensitive" using the Cantonese.<br />

Suggest you bring your phone to Nokia for repair

            Hi There, After MUCH troubleshooting on my own (as Nokia was no help) I realised my 4gb memory card was purchased online from Hong Kong, and MUST carry some formatting that sends a signal back during the verification process that says,..... HEY we want
 the map in Chinese.... so here is the deal, take out the memory card you have, put in the 1gb card that game with the handset, plug it in to your computer, delete maps in storage, download Hong Kong again and let me know if it is in English... now if this
 DOES work, the news is not too good as even formatting the 4gb card I purchased does not solve this issue .... I am going to have to RE purchase a 4gb card here in Australia OR risk losing it anyway by having to take it out of the handset every time I want
 to use navigator while in Hong Kong..... Please let me know if my hunch is right about the memory card you are using :)<br />

            This is the third thread I found on the subject so I believe many people have this problem and it makes the map absolutely useless. I live in HK and I can tell you the road names are still in English letters but because this is known as Mainland Chinese
 "Pinyin" or Mainland phonetics even Chinese people cannot use this when they come to HK because we follow the standard Cantonese and English language in HK. Whoever thought this up to make it work like this is absolutely incredibly insensitive to customer
 needs and has probably never set foot in Hong Kong.<br />
I have just tried the following and makes it more useful for people that can actually read Chinese. OK, here is what I did, based on Lindyn95 observation I got a normal microSD can formatted it, then I put it into my N82 which I set to Chinese language before
 I open Map application and let it make the necessary directories. When I put this card into the laptop the map loader also shows the maps available in Chinese language and sure enough when I put this card back into the phone all the names are correct but in
 traditional Chinese. Then I format the card again, select english language out microSD card in phone and start up maps and it goes and makes the directories again, I take out the card and into the laptop and it will only allow me to download the HK map in
 the Mainland Chinese "English". I think there must be a way to make it download and show the cantonese version and I just have not found it yet. I will try a little longer or just continue to use in cantonese character without the english.

            In May I was directed by Ricky of the HK Flagship store to Mapking, but in late July I got an email saying that I could now download the software from the Nokia site. However, when I tried, I still got the old pinyin map. So Ricky emailed me the actual
 "cities.zip" file, which I downloaded to my N95 and it works (have the English street names).<br />
<br />
I posted it to: <a href="http://www.filefactory.com/file/a7d37e/n/cities_zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.filefactory.com/file/a7d37e/n/cities_zip</a><br />
<br />
You can use the "basic service" to download it for free. Ricky's instructions:<br />
<br />
"Extract the zip file and you can find a folder called 'cities'. After that, copy the folder to your phone."<br />
<br />
Since I was already using Nokia maps, I deleted the existing "cities" folder on my phone (losing my stored maps) and replaced it with this one. I presume I'll just add more maps on top of this when I travel.<br />
<br />
Maybe there's an easier way by now? Btw, I bought my N95 in NY but live in HK.

            That is great, although I am using a Mainland China version of the N82 I copied the content provided by HKdad3 and it is now all back in English-English and NOT Pinyin. Thanks!!! I did notice though that although the map is fixed, the Nokia Maps still
 continues to refer to all the locations the same (i.e. in pinyin), but it does not seem to affect the contents of the map itself.

            yes it also works for me I use Hongkong map.<br />
Unfortunately after I copied the cities folder and all is english now. I`m not able to use the search function.<br />
It always say no result found.<br />
With the pinyin version it was working.<br />
I also noticed that there is no Hong Kong anymore in the List for Country/Region<br />
<br />
Does anyone can help me to get the search function to work.

            The problem is with the companies that supply the maps for the Nokia phones. The "English" english map was ok in Map 1.2.<br />
<br />
It looks like Navteq has passed on the responsibility for China area maps to Nav2. Unfortunately HK having been returned to China is grouped into there.<br />
<br />
Those "geeks" in Nav2, China in their infinite, read.."limited", worldly sense, have choosen to think that all the world will use PinYin or Romanization of Mandarin to read maps in Hong Kong.<br />
<br />
One workaround until they decide to correct their errors is to load the maps used in the previous version Maps 1.2.<br />
<br />
I have used this solution on a N95-1, Map 1.2 and an E-66, Map 2.0 and they both work, along with the search function.<br />
<br />
What you need to do is to download the map from the link HKdad3 posted. Unzip file to your hard disk. Connect your phone in USB mode. Find the directory on your memory card. Copy the dir on your hard disk to the phone's memory card. Don't need to delete on
 your phone, but when you copy make sure you when asked if you want to replace, you do say yes to all.<br />
<br />
Remember, don't let Map Loader delete all maps when you download new maps! Until those dorks at Nav2 get their act together you will just get the old PinYin map. Just let it add the new maps.<br />
<br />
YMMV, but this has worked for me.

            What version of Maps are you using? What phone model do you have?<br />
<br />
The previously mentioned methods of using the maps from Map 1.2 seem to work ok with search for my E66 using Maps 2.0<br />
<br />
My maps are stored on my memory card.

            The issue was really a UI issue.&nbsp; It turns out that dropdown that has the live.com, hotmail.com, other is editable.&nbsp; You're supposed to actually put your email domain in that blank.&nbsp; I was putting my whole email address in the first blank and leaving the
 dropdown on other.&nbsp; I didn't realize it was editable until I read it in another thread.&nbsp; So it works as designed and isn't a bug, but it's not terribly intuitive from a design standpoint.&nbsp; Is there a way to close this thread or make it as 'fixed'?&nbsp; Thanks.

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Issue with Microsoft OneNote 2013 and Surface Pen Since Upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday. Since then, the button on my Surface pen cannot be configured to bring up OneNote 2013, and instead brings up OneNote (which has less features) instead. I contacted Microsoft, but they were unable to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8.1, you could select "Make OneNote 2013 (desktop) the default OneNote application" from within OneNote 2013, and that worked with the pen. That checkbox no longer works, and the app tells you "To change your default apps, go to Settings &gt; System
 &gt; Default apps." I tried this (with Microsoft support assisting) but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a bug with Windows 10. Hopefully it will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if anyone has a suggestion for a workaround, I would greatly appreciate your suggestions.</p>

            <p>Thank you. This does not resolve the issue. This works with Windows 8.1 to sent OneNote 2013 to the default, but does not work with Windows 10. With Windows 10, when you click on the checkbox labeled "<span>“Make OneNote 2013 the default OneNote application
 for OneNote links, notes, and clips" the app states "To change your default apps, go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Default apps."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Default apps" option is through Windows 10. When you bring it up, you have the option to "Choose default apps by app." Both versions of OneNote show up: (1) "OneNote (desktop)" which is OneNote 2013, and (2) "OneNote" which is the regular version one
 OneNote, which comes with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select the "OneNote (desktop)" app, and click "Set this program as default." This does not resolve the issue. When I select "Choose defaults for this program" all the checkboxes are marked. Those checkboxes are: (1) ".one Microsoft OneNote Section", (2)
 ".onepkg Microsoft OneNote Singile File Package", (3) ".onetoc Microsoft OneNote 2003 Table of Contentents", (4) ".onetoc2 Microsoft OneNote Table of Contents, (5) "ONENOTE URL:onenote", and (6) "ONENOTEDESKTOP URL:OneNoteProtocol". ALL of these show "OneNote
 (desktop)" as the "Current Default."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the "OneNote" program (which is different from OneNote (desktop)) shows an additional protocol "ONENOTE-CMD URL:onenote-cmd." This is an option that you cannot set for OneNote 2013, and is only available for the version of OneNote that comes with
 Windows (and is not part of the Microsoft Office Suite). It seems like the problem may be occurring because under Windows 10, you cannot associate the "ONENOTE-CMD" protocol with "OneNote (desktop)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ensured that I am running the latest version of OneNote 2013. It makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with someone from the Microsoft Store yesterday, and he told me that they haven't been able to get OneNote 2013 to open with the pen under Windows 10 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may require a patch to Windows 10.</p>

This worked in Windows 8.1. Very easily. Now there does not seem to be anyway to set the pen's top button&nbsp;to open&nbsp;OneNote 2013 (desktop) under Windows 10.<br />

Can someone from Microsoft or the Surface team help here please.<br />

Well, it doesn't give a solution but at least it&nbsp;confirms that Microsoft is aware of the issue and is seeking to restore this functionality for the Surface Pen and OneNote desktop.<br />
<br />
Here's what they say:</p>
<hr />
<div>
<div>
<p>In Windows 10, when you click the top button on Surface Pen, the OneNote app opens. Microsoft is aware of this and working to restore the ability to select either the OneNote app or OneNote 2013 (desktop). When the solution is ready, it will install on your
 Surface via the Windows Update service.<br />

            <p>I'm glad to hear that Microsoft is working on a fix. Hopefully the screen capture for OneNote 2013 will work better than it does with the default OneNote app under Windows 10. The default OneNote app has an issue in that, when you have multiple monitors
 hooked up to your PC and you double click on the top of your Surface pen, a screen comes up within the OneNote app that states "select a Region to clip to OneNote." Because all the screens are shown simultaneously on one screen in the app, and are shrunken
 to fit, it's difficult to select a precise area of the screen.</p>

            I have 0 faith that Microsoft intends on fixing this if a new version of office doesn't address the issue. &nbsp;Granted I realize this issue has to be addressed in both the Windows side and on the app/program side, however, it doesn't appear that there's been
 any progress on either.

            try "x"ing the apps from the list and see if you can go to the store and download each individually. In fact I had a similar issue once and uninstalled then re-downloaded and it worked for me.

    <title>Outlook rules not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook rules not working</h2>
                    <p>I have created several rules but they don't seem to be working.&nbsp; Most of the rules deal with moving the mail to another folder once it has been received but that is not happening. Some of them work if I run them manually but only on one message even if there
 are several messages from the same sender.</p>
<p>I've been having this problem for several versions of MS Office so i have to assume that the problem is in the way I am setting up the rules but I followed the wizard to set up most of them. Suggestions?</p>

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 with Word 2016, and every time I do a grammar check it tends to take longer than expected to complete. I am currently writing a novel that is about 228 pages long. Does it always do this for longer documents?</p>

<p>Hi Joshua,<br />

            Try a hard reset.<br />
<br />
1. Switch off the phone.<br />
<br />
2. Hold down the following three buttons: Green (the call answer button), * button, and '3' button.<br />
<br />
3. While holding these buttons, press the power button and switch on the phone.<br />
<br />
4. Release when the phone shows the nokia logo or shows other signs of life like the language selction screen.<br />
<br />
Also take a look at this thread by "nando61" for an alternative revcovery method. It's for a different model but it may work.<br />

If all that fails then your only option is a trip to the nokia care point/service centre.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I can't believe it!<br />
I make it work.<br />
<br />
Even the Updater screen stucked in the phone recovery it was clear that is becuase it could not modifiy or update the phone.<br />
And the reason of this was that I had installed Kaspersky mobile security and F-Secure antivirus.<br />
I had removed them and tried the installation again and voila. It worked out.<br />
I am very dissaponted that after restoring the backup to memory card that i did before updating the firmware, i foud out that only contacts and few things more are restored! All themes became corrupted, no existence of application installed before the update,
 no nothing...<br />
<br />
So, Remove any firewall, antivirus software before the update.<br />
<br />
ciao

<h2>            Excel 2003 Keyboard Accelerator &#47; Toolbar Menu</h2>
                    <div>
<p>In Excel 2003, the main menus were File, Edit, View, Insert, Format, Tools, Data, Window, and Help. The keyboard accelerator commands in Excel 2003 were Alt+F, Alt+E, Alt+V, Alt+I, Alt+O, Alt+T, Alt+D, Alt+W, and Alt+H.</p>
<p><span>At some point my Excel 2003 calls these keyboard accelerators after pressing F, E , V , I , O, T, D, W, H (UCase/Lcase) without pressing the ALT key. When i type one of these characters from within a cell, the dropdown menu shows. The only thing i
 can do is to restart the whole pc which is very hasle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keyboard was new/clean and free from any other objects that can cause for the ALT key to be pressed.</p>
<p>This issue only happens on Excel 2003 while&nbsp;Ms Word, &amp; PPT&nbsp;was fine as well as other applications.</p>
<p>Checked the MS Virtual Keyboard but it's fine, no keys are active except NumLock</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Anyone experienced the same issue as mine would be glad to know how to resolve it.
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            Hide or Unhide Row Based on the Value of Another Cell</h2>
                    My apologies, I am one of the many who wishes to use this feature but doesn't have the knowledge of how to do it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm working on an Excel 2010 spreadsheet that we are using for data collection. &nbsp;The spreadsheet will have some locked cells, etc. and function like a "form" to collect data from a group of people.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cell C1 is a formula showing variance %. &nbsp;C1<span>=(A1-B1/B1)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Based on the results of C1, the person ("user") providing the data may need to provide a statement explaining why their variance is so great.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Cell D5 is where I provide a cell (not a range because I need to collect this data into another spreadsheet for export to Access) for the user to put an explanation. &nbsp;It makes sense to keep row D hidden if an explanation is not needed. &nbsp;I
 would like to have it unhide if they have a variance of -5% or worse.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So, if cell C1 is less than -5%, then row D unhides.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Can anyone provide the secrets on how to make this 'magically' happen?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks in advance,</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Laurel</span></div>

            <p>Shouldn't the formula in C1 be =(A1-B1)/B1 ? The formula you mention, =(A1-B1/B1) is equivalent to =A1-1.</p>
<p>You need a bit of VBA code to do what you want. This means that you must save the workbook in a macro-compatible format: .xlsm, .xlsb or .xls, but NOT .xlsx.</p>
<p>And users will have to enable macros when they open the workbook.</p>
<p>Right-click the sheet tab of the sheet with the formula in cell C1.</p>
<p>Select "View Code" from the context menu.</p>
<p>This activates the code module associated with the worksheet.</p>
<p>Copy the following code into the module:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Calculate()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("D5").EntireRow.Hidden = (Range("C1").Value &gt; -0.05)<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press Alt+F4 to close the Visual Basic Editor.</p>
<p>That's it!</p>

            Windows Phone 7 is completely different from Windows Mobile 6.5. They share nothing but their name in common and offer no compatibility between the two. Any WinMo 6.5 app has to be redeveloped for WP7. There will never be compatibility. For all intents
 and purposes, WM6.5 is dead.<br />

<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook.com installed on my iPhone -- as an Outlook.com account (server = eas.outlook.com). Emails sync fine. However, even when I have the Outlook calendar selected as the Default calendar on my iPhone, and it is showing in my Calendar app, I cannot
 add meeting invitations on my iPhone into my Outlook calendar. Interestingly, as soon as I open Outlook 2016 on my desktop, bingo my Outlook calendar works on my iPhone, and I can add invitations into my Outlook calendar on my iPhone. Anyone having a similar
 issue? Any advice please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Kristine, and thank you for trying to help me out. On your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I have never been able to add an invitation I receive via email to my Outlook Calendar on my iPhone without first opening the desktop app. I have only recently set up my Outlook calendar on my iPhone -- I was using Google calendar until now but would like
 to consolidate everything with the MSFT platform.</li><li>I have been trying both the Outlook app for iOS as well as the built-in iOS app. With the built-in iOS app, when I try to add an invitation received via email&nbsp; to my Outlook calendar, I can see the Outlook calendar but cannot select it from the "Add to
 Calendar" screen. With the Outlook app for iOS, I can see the email with the invitation, but I cannot see the invitation itself, and so I cannot accept it.</li><li>No error messages.</li><li>No changes before this issue other than installing my Outlook account on my iOS email app and also installing the Outlook app.</li><li>Uninstalled both and reinstalled them several times. I have all the correct views checked, and have even selected the Outlook calendar as my default calendar -- does not help.</li></ol>
<p>Many thanks again.</p>

<p>Many thanks for trying to help Kristine, but honestly, this is really not helpful. The link you have sent me relates to setting up an account in Outlook. That is not where my problem lies. Outlook is running fine. My problem is with how Outlook.com syncs
 calendars with my iPhone apps, whether the iOS mail and calendar app or the Outlook iOS app.</p>

<p>One other thing. I have been trying a few workarounds, and I find that if I receive an invitation in my Outlook iOS app, and I forward it to my Outlook.com email account, then I can accept it into my Outlook.com calendar from my iPhone. I don't need to take
 this extra step in Outlook 2016. Also, both the Gmail and iCloud calendars offer this functionality, so this is an issue with how Outlook.com communicates with the iOS apps.</p>

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
I did all that you said:<br />
- it was already set to "Final Showing Markup"<br />
- all options were already checked in "Show" menu<br />
- all choices in track changes were already set to something, except "Changed Formatting", which was set to none<br />
<br />
I turned on bubbles to see if anything showed up but it didn't.&nbsp; The problem has gone away even though I didn't change anything! Weird.&nbsp; Thanks for your help!<br />

    <title>Accessing Yammer from Azure AD Application Portal - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Accessing Yammer from Azure AD Application Portal</h2>
                    
<p>Following up on a previous issue relating to using the Yammer portal in combination with Azure AD federation what is the preferred method of presenting Yammer for organisational users but without having to give them an Office365 subscription?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Scenario</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><br />
</strong></span>On prem AD federated with Azure AD</p>
<p>Office365 subscription, but licensing limited to a subset of the organisation</p>
<p>Subset of organisation without Office365 license want to use Yammer</p>

<p>If my testing is correct then to access Yammer from the Office365 portal the user must have an Office365 license (assume E1 being a minimum). If the user has no Office365 license the portal for O365 won't be available and so Yammer can't be accessed using
 this method?</p>
<p>Second option is to use Azure AD MyApps portal, <a href="http://myapps.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://myapps.microsoft.com</a> My experience being that I then need to pick Yammer from the AAD marketplace and scope Yammer to by subset of users. However, I'm not convinced if Yammer is supposed to be used this way or if this is a leftover of the link prior
 to MS purchasing Yammer. If it can be used how do I configure the SSO setting for Azure AD?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p><b>Yammer SSO</b></p>
<p><b>How it works</b><br />
SSO allows users to sign in with the same set of credentials they use for other applications in your environment. It also lets an enterprise control authentication for Yammer and can enable scenarios such as two-factor authentication. To set up SSO for your
 Yammer network, also known as federation, you provide various pieces of information to Microsoft.</p>
<p>When you enable SSO, you change the authentication process for Yammer. When users attempt to authenticate at Yammer.com, they are redirected to your IdP. This is a server or service that you use for authentication. When a user is successfully authenticated,
 that user is redirected back and signed in to Yammer.com.</p>
<p>Although some IdPs might support automatic sign-in so that users don't have to enter credentials, this isn't universal. If you want to avoid users having to type their passwords, select an IdP that supports this capability. Yammer operates independently
 of your application.</p>
<p>If you wish to implement Yammer SSO, you must submit a service request from your Office 365 Dashboard, Please let me know if you have other concerns.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing your concern to our attention. We understand how important for users to be able to access Yammer. We are here to help.</p>
<p><b>Office 365 sign-in for Yammer</b> is a feature for Microsoft Office 365 and Yammer that allow users to sign in to Yammer using Office 365 credentials.&nbsp;When this feature is enabled, users will see the Office 365 suite navigation bar on the top of Yammer
 network pages. This will allow users to seamlessly sign in to Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft SharePoint sites and Microsoft Office Outlook without being prompted for passwords.</p>
<p><b>Users without License<br />
</b><br />
In this scenario, a user was not assigned a license when it was created. When the user is going to Yammer to login, the user is redirected to Office 365. After being authenticated, the user is redirected to Yammer and gets the following error message&nbsp;<b>“That
 didn’t work,&nbsp;Something went wrong when we tried to sign you into Yammer with your Office365 Credentials”<br />
</b><br />
In general, users do not need to be assigned a license in order to use their Office 365 credentials to log in to Yammer, except for the first logon. If the user’s first login occurs while the user does not have permissions, he will not be able to log in. Adding
 the additional licenses does not solve the issue; an additional mapping process is required in order to update the user’s status.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to fix it:</b></p>
<p>1. Check current license status - log in to Office 365 portal with <b>global administrator</b> user, click
<b>Admin</b> and choose <b>Office 365</b>. Under the left menu, click <b>Users</b>. In the
<b>Users </b>page, locate the user and click on the name. On the user menu that will be shown on the right side of the screen, click
<b>license</b>.&nbsp;<br />
2. Update license to include all services, click <b>Save</b>.<br />
3. Click <b>Details </b>tab in the left menu. On the <b>details </b>page, update the user’s email address (for example, change the domain, the drop-down) and then click
<b>Save</b>. This will initiate the mapping process.<br />
</p>
<div>4. At this point, the user will be able to login to Yammer. An admin can go back and remove the user’s licenses.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<h2>            Word document lost when tried to save in OneDrive and open a new word template page</h2>
                    <p>I have drafted an important letter and tried to save it directly to OneDrive for me to&nbsp;access it from my other devices. when I select "Save As", it gave me the option to browse the folder to be saved, I select "OneDrive-Personal" and then it opened up a
 new document template page and my document to be saved was lost.</p>
<p>I am using window 8.1 and Office 2013. Please let me know why it happens and how can I retrieve my lost document which was drafted to save?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be a possibility that your document was saved to other OneDrive folders on your PC. Please follow the steps below:</p>

<p>Press <strong>Windows logo</strong> key+<strong>R</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Type <strong>%userprofile%</strong>. This opens a File Explorer window that has your name at the top.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Look for an extra folder named <strong>OneDrive</strong> or <strong>SkyDrive</strong>, that has an older
<strong>Date created</strong> or <strong>Date modified</strong>, and search for the missing files and folders in it. The folder name might also end in
<strong>.old</strong>.</p>
</li><li>

<p>Thanks for the response. I tried to do as mentioned above. have seen the mentioned folder with extension .old. The folder have two subfolders named 'Documents' &amp; 'Pictures' but it is empty. I was not able to get back my lost and unsaved document. Any other
 ways to get it back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed one thing that the subfolder&nbsp;'Documents' in my OneDrive&nbsp; is showing the 'Date modified' as the day I tried to save the word document, but there is no data inside in the folder with the shown date. That day, I have not tried to save anything
 to one drive before or after&nbsp;that. Is there any possibility that, it is hidden somehow??</p>

            Your file might be stuck in the Microsoft Office Upload Centre. You can save it to your computer from there.

<h2>            Columns overlap on 2 D chart when secondary axis is added</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to make a 2 D chart for three data series with the horizontal axis as the day of the month.&nbsp; Two of my series are temperature and I want these to be on the left vertical axis.</p>
<p>The other series is rainfall and I want this to be on a secondary vertical axis on the right side of the chart.</p>
<p>When I have only one vertical axis, all three series display side by side for each date.&nbsp; As soon as I put the rainfall series on a seconday verical axis, that data overlaps the other two data series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I&nbsp;show three columns for each date, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
side by side</span> with two data sets associated with the left harizontal axis and the trhird series associated with the right horizontal axis?</p>
