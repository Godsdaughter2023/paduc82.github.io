    <title>Resource usage different between Gantt chart and resource view - - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Resource usage different between Gantt chart and resource view - Project 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have a recurring (but random/sporadic) problem with Project, where the resources assigned in the Gantt chart view don't match up with the resources assinged in the Resource Usage, or Resource Graph, views. &nbsp;In the Resource views the resources will show
 as being at 0% (rather than totally blank, so there's _some_ link to the resource being used.)</p>
<p>It seems very much like a bug, as if I go into the Gantt chart and re-enter the exact same resource usage information, the Resource Usage View/Graph will then update.</p>
<p>What especially worries me is that if this occurs without me noticing it, then I could easily be constrained by resources in my plans without knowing it.</p>
<p>Is there any way to force project to recheck/recalculate resource usage?</p>

            <p>Chris,</p>
<p>I seriously doubt it is any kind of bug in Project but it could be a "bug" in your file (i.e. corruption). Let's check a few things.</p>
<p>1. Is your version of Project fully updated? If not or you're not sure, run Windows Update. The latest update is Sept 2016 and that will give a version of 14.0.7173.5000</p>
<p>2. Are all your tasks auto-scheduled?</p>
<p>3. Do you have calculation set for automatic?</p>
<p>4. Have you leveled your plan?</p>
<p>5. Does your file use a resource pool file?</p>
<p>6. Does this happen with any file you create or just this one file?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Unable to get the &#36;25 WIndows Store gift card using the link to validate  on my HP Stream7</h2>
                    I purchased an HP Stream 7. It was supposed to come with a $25 gift card, and the invoice form the Microsoft Store had a link to validate it and get the gift card. I have followed every tip I could find on the web, including using EI and changing security
 settings, and when I type the characters on the screen and click on validate, after thinking, I get a message that Something Happened, and it wants me to start over. I sign in again on m account, and do it over and over, and then it finally comes to a screen
 that there is something wrong with my account &nbsp;and it cannot apply the gift card, or something like that, and to contact support and mention 715-123128. Of course I cannot find any way to contact support, I just go in loops. I checked my Live account, and
 it is set to US, so I know that is not the issue. Does anybody have a clue what that code means, or how I can actually reach somebody at Microsoft to help? I really want to get and use the gift card this week.

            <p>I had the same exact problem. Seems to be once you upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure where you bought your tablet, but I called the Microsoft &nbsp;sales department where I bought my tablet (not tech support). The number was 877-696-7786.</p>
<p>
</p><p>they were very helpful and wound up giving me a promotional credit rather than Windows store credit (they were out of $25 cards and I was wasting too much time trying to figure it out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck</p>

    <title>Value of a merged cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robin clay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Value of a merged cell</h2>
                    I have a block of data, ten rows long and ten columns wide, each contains data in the form of an address.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, some of the cells are merged, either side-by-side or one above the other.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a location map.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How (in VBA) can I get the value of a merged cell ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I want to do is to place the cursor in any cell, merged or not, and then click on a Macro.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In another sheet is a schedule giving the contents at each address. &nbsp;Clicking on that Macro should then take me to the line in the schedule that gives a list of the contents of that particular address.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then, clicking on another Macro should take the cursor back to the same cell on the map in the other sheet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All of this works absolutely fine - unless the address is a merged cell, when I get Run-time Error 13: Type mismatch.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Calculated Fields in a Pivot</h2>

<p>- where the Cost is the new calculated column and Price and (number of) Units are existing pivot table columns</p>

<p>Hi DM_MWD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask whether you have access to the data source? If you added the table(source data) to the data model before, the calculated field is not available. If you added it before, we suggest you copy the source data to a new worksheet and rebuild the Pivot
 table then the calculated field should be able to click. You can also try delete relationships in the data model, but it will cause some&nbsp;errors in PivotTables or in formulas that reference these tables, which is a bit risky:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/delete-relationships-between-tables-in-a-data-model-6e1bd568-f6ee-4cf8-913d-e18e46e570f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete
 relationships between tables in a Data Model</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or as an approach, you could calculate the date in the data source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further support, is there any chance you could share the file with us? To protect your privacy, you can upload the file to a cloud drive you use and share a link with us in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">private message</a>.</p>

<br />
Yeah, in 2007 simply typing in the named formula doesn't work.&nbsp; You have to select the chart, then Chart Tools contextual ribbon | Design tab | Data group | Select Data button.&nbsp; Then, to specify&nbsp;the x-values click the Horizontal Axes Labels section | Edit button
 and to specify the y&nbsp;values the Legend Entries (Series) section&nbsp;| Add button.

<p>Hi Bwanajag,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may be caused by some files and folders, you may try checking your OneDrive folder and see if there are files and folders that encountered sync error, if so, you may temporarily move
 them out of the OneDrive folder, then reset your OneDrive by the following process to fix this issue:</p>
<p>
1. Quit OneDrive. (Select the cloud icon in the top tray, then select&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Quit OneDrive.)</p>
<p>
2. Find&nbsp;OneDrive&nbsp;in your&nbsp;Applications&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>
3. Right-click&nbsp;OneDrive&nbsp;and select&nbsp;Show Package Contents.</p>
<p>
4. Browse to the&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Resources&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>
5. Double-click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">ResetOneDriveApp.command</span>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">ResetOneDriveAppStandalone.command</span>, if you're using the standalone app).</p>
<p>
6. Start OneDrive and finish the setup process.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please also try updating your OneDrive application to the latest in the App Store or by
<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=823060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a>.</p>

                    If someone calls it doesn't ring and if it does it doesn't recognize the numbers anymore. No signs of left so I have to check from the call list whether someone has actually called. And the same issues apply to SMS. Started about a week ago. Windows 8.0
 and Lumia Black.

            Everything is up to date and no. I haven't got any help. Where is the copy of my address book &amp; contact list. I have lot of contacts who don't use Facebook or hotmail etc. I'm afraid of resetting the phone because I don't want to lose my contacts and their
 info. This is a mess. What an earth caused this as I haven't changed anything and suddenly no ringtones, no signs of incoming calls SMS and emails. Can only see the number if I check the list behind the icon. Doesn't recognize my contacts anymore.

<p>Your contacts are automatically synced to your default MS acount and you cannot lose them. They will automatically restored to your handset after a hard reset once you set up the same default MS account on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find your contacts if you go to people.live.com on a PC. They should also be shown under People on your handset. It doesn't matter that your contacts don't use FB or hotmail, they should still be found in these places.</p>

            Hi Loganakira,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using Microsoft My Phone!&nbsp; In order for "see current location" to work, you need to specify that you want to sync your phone's current location.&nbsp; This is done on the device by loading up the My Phone application then selecting Menu &gt; Sync Options.&nbsp;
 Ensure the "Current Location" is checked.&nbsp; Press OK.&nbsp; The next time My Phone synchronizes your current location will be uploaded to the portal.<br />
<br />

            Pictures are not inside cells. They are in layers on top of the worksheet, so when you sort, the worksheet is independent of the pictures.
<br />
<br />
I would be inclined to suggest using FileMaker, which can treat a picture as a data element.<br />

            It didn't do any good because it isn't intended to :-) <br />
<br />
The Object Positioning option pertains to whether an object's position shifts when rows, columns or cells are Inserted/Deleted. It has nothing to do with Sorting in any way.<br />
<br />
The Preference setting I've always found to be misleading. The "cut or copy" part is fine - If an object is within the selected range it will be included when you paste. It's description further indicates that when you sort objects will stay
<br />
As Jim described, objects "float" in a separate layer &amp; are positioned relative to the top left corner of the sheet, they are not connected in any way to individual cells, rows or columns. The nature of your need isn't specified, but I agree with him that some
 other type of software might better serve your purpose. Even a Table in Word might suffice since pictures can be inserted into table cells, and pictures can also be inserted into cells in Apple's Numbers app. There are a number of image management programs
 out there as well, including iPhoto.<br />

<p>Joe's answer was simply wrong, so I deleted it. You do NOT need Office 2011 to migrate to 2016. Outlook 2016 can import 2008 data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to be extra cautious, you can export your 2008 Identities using File &gt; Export and then use File &gt; Import in 2016, but if you do a regular update, the whole process should be automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be more worried that you have the minimum system requirements before installing Office 2016. You'll find the requirements here:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Pardon me, but that's <strong>complete &amp; utter bull****</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Mac Pro 4,1. I upgraded the OS from 10.6.8 to 10.11.6 yesterday. My Entourage 2008 (the only part of Office that I use every day) immediately started acting up (a new blank email automatically opens on launch, Gmail accounts can't be accessed, etc).
 Fair enough - it's par for the course for there to be issues with Office 2008 now I'm running El Capitan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I buy Office 2016 Home &amp; Business for Mac (perpetual licence) and install it. I then update Autoupdate to the latest version (3.11) and all the Office applications to the latest versions (15.39).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I export everything from Entourage 2008, saving in .rge format (the only option given).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to import into Outlook 2016, the options given are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Outlook 2011 data on this computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Outlook for Windows archive file (.pst)</p>
<p>
</p><p>•&nbsp;Outlook for Mac archive file (.olm)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, there's <strong>no</strong> option to import from Office 2008.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I choose the first option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two options then appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Import from here</p>
<p>/Users/[myusername]/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities</p>
<p>
</p><p>below this it says "No data found", or there's the second option, which is</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Import from another location</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that it doesn't say "Import from here ... Office Identities" or&nbsp;"Import from here ... Office 2011
<strong>or 2008 Identities</strong>" or similar. It says <strong>Office 2011 Identities</strong>.&nbsp;<span>2011 - that’s it. Nothing else.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I choose "Import from another location" and navigate to my .rge files, they're
<strong>greyed out</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore - it's <strong>not possible</strong> to directly migrate from Office 2008 to Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even Microsoft themselves categorically state this.</p>

<h2>            Automatically suspended when performing move request to o365.</h2>
                    <p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>The client are looking to find out if there are any known issues with submitting a move request for large mailboxes (~100GB) and auto-suspending that request?</p>
<p>&nbsp;For instance, will the daily synchronization have trouble if the account is suspended for a number of days? These are mainly service mailboxes (~10) that they've applied an archival policy to but are still quite large.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The client does not plan to have them in the auto-suspended state for long but want to be sure that they aren’t creating a headache for themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The client has hybrid setup with exchange server 2010 SP3, exchange server 2013 and with O365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Information that is presented on <a href="https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/65190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Zune Back Button not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Zune Back Button not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have a Zune 80gb at home and recently the back button got stuck. This is really annoying, because whenever the back button gets stuck, I can't get out of my music/pictures/whatever I'm looking through that time. I have to wait a couple hours before the
 Zune returns to the lock screen and I am able to do what I want. And then it happens again! Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hello SohiniRoy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks for your post to the Microsoft Answers forums!&nbsp; If the back button on your Zune player is unresponsive, there is a possibility that the cause is software based but otherwise the hardware itself will need to be addressed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The first step to take will be reinstalling the software on your player's device by reformatting the device back to factory settings.&nbsp; It's important to make sure your collection has been backed up to your PC before taking this step!&nbsp; The instructions
 posted here will reset the device, and we have more information posted online&nbsp;as well (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-phone-7/remove-and-reinstall-zune):" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-phone-7/remove-and-reinstall-zune):</a></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Set the <strong>Hold</strong> switch to the unlocked position.</li><li>Press and hold the top of the Zune Pad and the <strong>Back</strong> button at the same time, and keep them down until the Zune player restarts.
</li><li>After you release the buttons, press and hold the following combination of buttons, depending on your player model.</li><li>Continue to hold these buttons until your player restarts and the message "Clearing contents. Please wait." appears on your player's screen, followed by
<strong>CONNECT ZUNE TO YOUR PC</strong>.</li><li>Connect your player to the computer that has the Zune Music + Video software installed, and then update it. It should take about 30 minutes to update the player software.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If the back button is still unresponsive at this point, it will be needed to service your Zune player.&nbsp; We're no longer to provide any repairs for out of warranty devices, but another option for you it to try doing a Bing search with keywords like "Bing
 Repair Service".&nbsp; I hope this helps to get things back on track, we look forward to any further updates or questions you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Greg</p>

            Workbook Sharing is like Workbook Protection. Most of the features are disabled when a workbook is Shared (or in Shared mode). The only option is to use installed application to edit it.

<h2>            Missing folders and emails after mandatory switch to outlook</h2>
                    Today when I signed onto hotmail it was changed to outlook and ALL of my folders and the emails within them were gone. I am always active on this account so it is not because of inactivity on the account like I have read in some other posts. Please tell
 me there is a way to recover my folders that are missing and the emails within them because some of the emails were extremely important and had legal information in them and I need to be able to access them. Who can I contact regarding this? Could you please
 provide a phone number!

            <p>This is not the case though is it? because I have the same problem. I have'nt deleted the emails so they are not going to be in the folder when old deleted messages have been recovered. I had all my gaming details stored in my drafts folder on hotmail. I
 now cant access any of my games, many of which I have spent alot of money on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your steps and they have not recovered any emails that I had saved in my drafts folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now what?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>I will be glad to assist you with your concern. Did you lost the emails too after the upgrade? I've created a private message area that asks for some additional information. Please click on

            I am having the same problem and it is causing a lot of stress. I woke up yesterday morning to discover my Hotmail account had automatically upgraded to Windows Oultook and I have lost a massive amount of archived emails. This is not due to deleting emails
 so the "recover deleted email" option will not work. <br />
<br />
I need these emails! I rely on them for personal records etc. I am trying to pull up digital copies of invoices/receipts/ adn other documents of that nature that I no longer have on my new computer. These records are crucial for me. I also rely on my email
 as a documentation of communication. <br />
<br />
Please help. If these emails cannot be recovered, Outlook just won't cut it.&nbsp; I will have to switch to an email provider that I can trust and rely on.
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Hi, thanks for your response. <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>The switch to Outlook occurred automatically on the 5th or the 6th</li><li>The data loss was immediate, I had been referencing emails form 2009/2010 the night before and could not do so in the morning when the switch happened</li><li>No issues logging in, no password reset in the last 6 months</li><li>No I did not click on a link</li><li>And no I did not try to downgrade or deactivate Hotmail before the switch</li></ul>
<p>It all came as a surprise. <br />

            Also another&nbsp; note, the data loss only affected my inbox. My inbox currently only has 320 emails, far less than the thousands that were originally in there.&nbsp; I only have emails dating back a few months.&nbsp; However folders I created for junk mail/school emails
 were not affected. <br />

<p>Sorry for the late reply. We are currently experiencing high volume of inquiries. By the way, let's find out what are the possible options that we can do to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>By upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface. All your emails should still stay in your Inbox.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kindly answer these questions so that we can isolate your issue:</span></font></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><font>When was the account switched to Outlook.com?</font></span>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If your emails were over 365 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in account even before you upgraded to Outlook.com. You can try to recover some of the deleted messages
 yourself. Click </font></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0000ff">here</font></span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If you access your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn’t log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails due to
 inactivity in web account.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If you renamed your account, you got another option to save your Hotmail emails differently when renaming your account to @Outlook.com account: If you chose to rename your account to
 @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked you – ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account. If you chose to create a new folder, the default
 name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under ‘Folders’. All your old emails will go in this folder.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>It is also possible that someone hacked the account and the hacker had already deleted emails in your account before you renamed your account or before your account is automatically
 upgraded.</font></span></p>

<h2>            Messenger Contact not appearing in Skype, and Messenger showing contacts as offline when they are online</h2>
                    <div>
Hello, so recently I have had some issues with my Messenger contacts. I will break down step by step what happened.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Today (Dec 6 2013) I accidentally deleted one of my email contacts from Outlook.com. I then restored the deleted contact, and linked it with the appropriate Messenger and Skype profiles associated with the same email.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
However, when I logged into my Skype Application, where it normally showed two of this contact (one as a Skype contact from my original Skype profile, and one as a Messenger contact from when my Outlook/messenger account merged with Skype), the Messenger contact
 was listed as not being in my contact list, and clicking "Add Contact" did nothing. We were still able to send and receive messages via Messenger (either in the sidebar on Outlook.com or in the Skype Application) for a short period of time.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Shortly after, my friend told me I was "offline" when I was in fact online, and I saw him as "offline" when he was online. He tried to send me messages via Messenger, and they did not go through. I tried on my end, and eventually we got a few messages through
 when he used the sidebar on Outlook.com, but we are still seen as "offline" for each other. He can not contact me via his Messenger application, which is very frustrating.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I have since unlinked and re-linked my Microsoft and Skype accounts twice (it will not let me anymore), as well as re-installed Skype twice, and attempted Skype support, and nothing has worked.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
So to summarize my problems are&nbsp;</div>
<div>
1. Messenger contact does not show up as a Messenger contact in Skype. Only appears as original Skype contact for same email (but he does not frequently use the Skype profile or application)&nbsp;</div>
<div>
2. Outlook.com Messenger sidebar shows me as "offline" to him, and him as "offline" to me. We are unable to send messages to each other (although it appears sometimes they do send but we must both be on Outlook.com and we still appear as "offline".&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I would appreciate your assistance on these issues.&nbsp;</div>

            This just started happening to me, also.&nbsp; None of my messenger contacts appear online any longer and I appear offline to them.&nbsp; I also accidentally deleted a contact, tried to re-add them, but there is absolutely no way to add them back.&nbsp; Also, on my Windows
 Phone, in the messaging hub the Messenger contacts used to show up there, but again, no one shows up and there is no way to message them from my phone now.<br />

            Does anyone have a fix for this????&nbsp; I am losing my patience very quickly.&nbsp; I'm trying all different types of 3rd party programs to get my messenger contacts to work again.&nbsp; One still won't show the contacts online, just like Skype is doing.&nbsp; Another will
 constantly delete a contact every single time I sign into it.&nbsp; I refuse to Skype any longer because it's awful and it also doesn't show my Messenger contacts online, which is the most important thing I need!&nbsp; I don't use Skype more than maybe once a year.&nbsp;
 I need my Messenger contacts to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

<h2>            Serious Windows 10 bug</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I've had windows technical preview for about 2 weeks now and I recently got the preview build including the notification panel and all was good but I later restarted after sending an email with inky (if that matters) and suddenly no metro app would
 open half the functionality in control panel stopped working almost all my drivers stopped cmd wouldn't work and only 7 applications would launch (IE, gchrome, control panel, Zune, Opera, Firefox, Inky, Minecraft sorta).</p>
<p>Please help and please remember MY SETTINGS APP WONT OPEN!! (so no updates)</p>
<p>I thank all responses ahead of time!</p>

            I ended up reinstalling and putting windows 8.1 on a second partition (in case if anything goes wrong again) to fix the problem and it seems everything works ok.
