<h2>            Online Archive Subfolders Missing in OWA</h2>
                    <p>I have a user that cannot see several subfolders when viewing the Online Archive via OWA. &nbsp;However, the user can see all of the subfolders when viewing the Online Archive through Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user has 10 main subfolders labeled with "01" &nbsp;"02" &nbsp;"03" &nbsp;and so on all the why up to "10". &nbsp; In OWA, we can see "01" - "04" completely (all subfolder with the folder); however, we are CANNOT see some of the subfolders in "05" (subfolders A-C). &nbsp; And
 we CANNOT see any of the main subfolders from "06" - "10".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, they are only missing in OWA. &nbsp;They can be seen in Outlook2016 without issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Environment - O365 with ExchangeOnline</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have try multiple computers and with multiple browsers, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hello Reggie,<br />
<br />
There may be several reasons why a user is unable to see certain folders/subfolders when viewing OWA. One of which may be because the user does not have full access permissions. To better assist you with your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did this issue start?</li><li>Were there any recent changes on the users computer prior to this happening?</li><li>Are you using Office 365 for Business?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check this article and refer to the resolution provided: <strong>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did this issue start?</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>On July 7, 2017. &nbsp;One day after completing the migration of the 10th and final pst file into the user's online archive using Microsoft's network upload process. &nbsp;The migration was successful. &nbsp;All archive could be seen in Outlook
 2016 and in OWA. &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<li>Were there any recent changes on the users computer prior to this happening?</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>The only thing that changed right before the folder went missing was that the last imported archive was moving from the bottom of the list to the top in the Outlook 2016 client. &nbsp; Before this, the user was able to view all of

            What amount of sunlight are we talking about? Some LCD screens does not perform very good in sunlight/direct sunlight as the screen reflects all the light. Some lcd's are okey, some terrible.<br />
<br />
The best screens for use outdoor is Amoled and Super amoled and now the amoled with clear black display as it takes away a lot of the reflection.<br />
<br />
If you have a screenprotector on your phone it might make it worse. You could also try turning up the brightness of the screen. Or play with that setting untill you find the sweet spot.<br />
<br />
However, I don't think you will get a superb experience in direct sunlight with your phone due to the screen.<br />
<br />
My SLCD on the HTC desire is terrible to read in direct sunlight. It's just the way it is.<br />
<br />
I don't know if there are any screen protectors which could make it easier to read outside, but you could try google it.<br />
<br />
If you have compared your 5530 with other 5530 phones and yours looks worse, I would suggest you take it to your nearest Nokia care point to get it checked.<br />
<br />
However LCD screens usuallly is a mess to use in sunlight and I have often found my self covering up the screen to make a shadow or go somewhere darker.<br />
<br />
If you want the best experience you will have to look for another phone with an amoled /samoled or amoled with clear black - display.

            You could also try different wallpapers and themes to find one which has the best contrasts and make it viewable in sunlight.

            It means you are not an Office 365 subscriber but a perpetual license holder. Office 365 subscribers pay on a monthly or yearly basis whereas perpetual license is one time upfront payment. All new features are released only to Office 365 subscribers.

<br />My sincere apologies. This feature is available only to Office 365 subscribers.

                    I have the desktop version of outlook 2016 and i am trying to delete an email account. I have used the 'account settings' box under "file" and have 'removed' the account from there. It does go away.......Until. If i close Outlook, when i reopen it........TA
 DA.... the damn account is back again. i have been doing this for 6 months now. HOW THE HELL DO I GET RID OF THIS ACCOUNT? Please do not tell me to create a new profile. i shouldn't have to. if microsoft tells me to 'remove' it from the account settings, it
 SHOULD GO AWAY!!!! I am tired of having to fix issues with every single piece of MS software that exists. IT IS NOT MY JOB TO FIX YOUR PRODUCTS. You are the professionals. How about fixing your **** so it actually works. I dont work for you and you dont pay
 me. I am the end user. You are the professionals.

<br />
<br />Hello jkhcast
<br />
<br />First step is defining by what you're actually referring to in terms of "....account is back again."
<br />
<br />Frequently the issue is a mis-understanding about what gets removed based on what actually was deleted in &lt;Account Settings&gt;. What wasn't mentioned were the following important items
<br />
<br />#1 - Was the account removed from the &lt;Account Settings&gt; &lt;Email&gt; tab&gt;?
<br />or
<br />#2 - Was a data file removed from &lt;Account Settings&gt; &lt;Data Files&gt; tab
<br />
<br />#3 - What type (POP3 or IMAP or Exchange account is involved?
<br />
<br />Without knowing the answer to any of the above - here is how things work which people mistake for an account "not getting removed" or "returning"
<br />
<br />a) if his involves a POP3 account and &lt;ONLY&gt; the mail account was removed, it will not remove the PST data file which is what appears in the Outlook Nav Pane. Far too many people believe that the Outlook Nav Pane shows email accounts when it actually is a list of all the data file configured in the account. To completely remove a POP3 account, you need to remove both the email account under the &lt;Email&gt; tab AND remove the PST file associated with the account under &lt;Account Settings&gt; &lt;Data Files&gt; tab
<br />
<br />b) If this involves an IMAP or Exchange account and the .ost file associated with the account is deleted, Outlook will automatically create a new one and sync everything with the server. To remove an IMAP or Exchange account, it needs to be removed under the &lt;Account Settings&gt; &lt;Email&gt; tab

            Just to confirm, you deleted this from &lt;Account Settings&gt; which you accessed via the File tab in Outlook - correct?
<br />
<br />Assuming the answer to the above is yes, suggest the following 
<br />
<br />- with Outlook closed, open the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app and remove the EX account from there and then re-open Outlook. Does the issue still persist?
<br />
<br />If the issue does in fact, still persist then
<br />
<br />#1  - Assuming that this involves more then one email account in the profile, how many others are there and what type (POP, Imap or EX) are these
<br />
<br />#2 - Again, assuming that this involves more then one account, which data file has been set as the "default data file"
<br />

<h2>            Contacts Doubled</h2>
                    
<p><font>Hi,</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>I recently hard reset my Nokia N79, I had taken a backup of the Contacts &amp; Messages. After hard&nbsp;reset,&nbsp;I restored the Contacts &amp; Messages. But only the&nbsp;Contacts were Doubled(Same contacts duplicated) in the
 handset.&nbsp;When I select Mark All &amp;&nbsp;try to delete the Contacts, it is not deleting the contacts. I have to&nbsp;select the Contacts individually&nbsp; &amp; then delete. After deleting all the Contacts, I tried Synchronizing, even after Synchronizing I found the Contacts
 duplicated. When I tried deleting the Duplicate contacts, the original contacts are also getting&nbsp;deleted from my handset.&nbsp;I tried changing the Sync settings in the PC Suite. But still facing the same problem !!!. It is irritating to have the&nbsp;duplicate contacts
 in the Phone. Can anyone tell me if this is a problem with the Nokia PC Suite or the handset. I'm using Nokia PC Suite&nbsp;7.1 version &amp; the firmware of my handset is 20.175.53.1.</font></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please check your backup file using noki application, if your backup file itself contains duplicate contacts while you are taking backup?&nbsp; Does your phone has got latest version ?&nbsp; When i checked this issue at my end, it just restored the contacts
 once only... This device has got firmware version of 30.019 RM-348 N79 in XP SP3</p>

<p><font>Hi,</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>I again Formatted the handset &amp; restored the Back-up. I remember that the Contacts were not doubled while taking the Back-up. Even if I restore the Contacts from the MMC. The Contacts are doubling. When I mark
 all the Contacts &amp; try to delete the Contacts, it quits deleting. I have to individually select/mark Contacts &amp; then delete. I'm using a Windows XP SP 2 PC.</font></p>

<h2>            e71 moved app to root folder now i can&#39;t open or uninstall</h2>
                    in the app manager i highlighted nokia radio and selected move to folder and chose root folder. (For some reason ovi always installs to my memory card and i can't find option to choose phone.) anyway now i haven't got a link to app and when i try to uninstall
 it fails. I tried file manager in office but there's nothing in the phone or mem card root folders like nokia radio and even if there was i can't see an apps folder that contains the apps shortcuts you get when selecting apps manager on phone. Where are all
 these apps saved. I'm assuming file manager is the same as my computer/windows explorer on pc ie you can see everything on the phone. Can anyone help please? Thanks, lawrence

            well they are stored kinda in a cryptic manner in hidden folders like system or private&nbsp; you can try a program I found MidletRestorer I think I got from the Nokias Beta site and see if that works.&nbsp; It worked for me on my E63 to get back some lost programs,&nbsp;
 not sure if it will work for radio since it came part of the phone but may be worth a try

<p>try a restart. apps installed in the memory card often fail to show themselves after a move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if that doesn't work, try a soft reset (no data loss) by turning off your phone, removing the battery for 30+ seconds then putting it back and powering up again. If you put it in root folder, you should see it when you press menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If after the restart, you still can't see it with app manager, try looking for it with file manager. if it's not to be found on your phone, you can always download it again from ovi</p>

<p>Not sure if this fits here.... i did also have trouble once when i did copy files to root-folder. It seems that root-folders are restricted to normal user.</p>
<p>I was able to see the file in the Nokia Phone Browser on the windows-pc, but not able to move or delete it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to solve the problem by installing a third-party filemanager on the phone (Y-Browser) and then i was able to do what i want with that file on the phone. This third-party filemanager did show a lot more files and informations about the memory contents,
 as the on-board filemanager does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe give it a try.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is with regard to the same problem faced by many here in terms of the data automatically getting transferred to the ROOT FOLDER. Many files/folders from the installation folder in my E71 just vanished all of a sudden and now when I am trying to install
 ebuddy (which I had installed earlier) the phone gives a message- if I want to replace the existing ebuddy application. This means that the earlier downloaded version exists somewhere in the phone, but I do not know where. Also, I am not able to install the
 new ebuddy application/re-install as the phone rejects it saying, updation failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be a great help if someone can please guide me as to<strong> how can I find the Root Folder in E71 and restore all the folders</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Attri</p>

<div>In Word 2002 or 2003, go to <strong>Tools | Options | Spelling and Grammar </strong>

    <title>Pivot table&#58; &#34;Count&#34; function omitting&#47; ignoring zero - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> winniewingyee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot table&#58; &#34;Count&#34; function omitting&#47; ignoring zero values</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>My dataset have customer names as index rows, with column of various types of charges.
</p>
<p>Not all charges apply in every row. Thus there are a lot of zero values in cases in which those charges did not occur. They're not entered as "no value" or "blank cells" - instead they're entered as "0".</p>
<p>I am using a pivot table to summarize the charges by customer. </p>
<p>I want to show total charge for each customer. So I use "sum" with no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want to know the "occurance" for that type of charges:</p>
<p>e.g. I know there are 100 shipments to this customer over the past 12 months. I want to know how many times a "waiting charge" occured. Therefore I want to count the number of times a waiting charged occured.</p>
<p>But my problem is, the "count" function counts every single value in that column (including all the zeros)... ie. I get 100 for that cell. But in my case, zero means a charge was not incurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how can I count all the rows that are not zero?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried using "calculate formula" and use a countif function, e.g. =countif(b3"&gt;0") . But it's giving me an error.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate your help!</p>

<h2>            Word crashes without warning</h2>
                    <p>Hello MS community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some time now, I am experiencing an issue with Word 2016 (I personally have Office 360, but this is the program's version).</p>
<p>Here I am, writing in the Word program, and all of the sudden, without any error message or even Word getting stuck of anything, the program crashes, shuts down entirely. This doesn't happen with only&nbsp;a specific file, since it crashes every Word file that's
 open.</p>
<p>I have no clue what could be the meaning of this, but it just won't stop happening.</p>
<p>I don't know if this has anything to do with that problem, but I also have an issue with Outlook: I simply can't manage to configure my Outlook e-mail account. I enter my name, e-mail address, password (and retype it correctly), then when I click Next, the
 Windows Security appear, asking me to enter my MS account password. I type it, click OK, and then it just keeps on asking it again and again as if I never typed it. Then, when I finally give up and click Cancel, it says the account configuration failed, and&nbsp;offers
 me to try again. That doesn't work too.</p>
<p>So if anyone has a solution to either of my problems - PLEASE contact me! The first problem is more urgent as it caused me to lose work material, while I can simply use Windows 10 Mail app as a replacement for Outlook office program.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Ziv.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you&nbsp;provide a crash bucket that I can pass on to our engineering team, to help us investigate the issue you're experiencing? H<span>ere are instructions for collecting crash data.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Reproduce the crash.</span></li><li>
<span>Open the Event Viewer (Search for “View Event Logs” in Windows 8+)</span></li><li>
<span>Go to <strong>Windows Logs</strong> &gt;<strong> Application.</strong></span></li><li>
<span>The crash will be recorded as a “Windows Error Reporting” source, and it will be the last entry of that type in the list (see the Date and Time).</span></li><li>
<span>Click&nbsp;it, and you’ll see the <strong>Cab Id</strong> and <strong>bucket number</strong>. The process name should be WinWord.exe. Note that some</span><span>times these IDs won’t show. If that happens, try to reproduce the issue again, or try to do so
 on another computer.</span></li></ol>

<p>Ziv,</p>
<p>I VERY Much feel your pain! This has been happening to me as well. Exactly as you described. At first I had no clue what was causing it, but I think opening a certain document causes all of my Word files to immediately disappear. All of Word closes! I lose
 hours of work! Very frustrating!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you ever find out what was causing this? Did you get it resolved??</p>
<p>Thanks for any insight you can provide,</p>
<p>David</p>

    <title>Office programs won&#39;t open after laptop crash - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office programs won&#39;t open after laptop crash</h2>
                    Hello there,
<div>My laptop crashed (for reasons unknown - I got a blue screen when I was chatting on Skype with nothing else running) and I got an alert that my C drive was corrupted. When I rebooted my laptop it seemed to have fixed this, but now none of my Office programs
 will open. I wanted to do a system restore, but I'm being told I have no restore point, despite checking I DID have one before I fixed the C drive. It's just disappeared. I don't even get an error message when I try to open Word, I just get a spinning loading
 circle and then nothing happens. I don't know if re-installing it would work but I'm scared to because I don't know where my code is, since I didn't get a disk when I bought it and can't afford to have to pay for another license.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions would be very much appreciated. It is essential for my work that I have Office working so this is making me panic a little bit, since I have no idea what happened and no indication of what's even gone wrong.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance!</div>

            Please confirm exactly which office bundle you have, one of the "Office 2013 ??? " bundles, or one of the "Office 365 ??? " bundles.&nbsp; The difference is important to how to re-install. If you have Office 365 you don't have to worry about the product key.
 If you have Office 2013, we can give you some tools to try and extract the key from your hd.
<br />
<br />
First thing to do is try an Office Repair<br />

<br />
Only if that does not help do you want to progress to an uinstall &amp; re-install.<br />
<br />
Doing uninstall will not cause problems with your personal data files.<br />

            Thanks for your reply, Rohn
<div>I have Office 2013, the student/home version.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried repair and had an Office pop-up saying 'Something went wrong' before I can even select which method of repair I want to use.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then tried to uninstall using the Fix It troubleshooter suggested by Microsoft and it doesn't work - the pop-up says that Microsoft 2013 Click to Run hasn't uninstalled and the Office suite still appears in the Uninstall programs list.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I try to manually uninstall it through the control panel I get the same 'Something has gone wrong' pop up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I called tech support and was just told I need to do a full system restore, which I would obviously like to avoid but at this point I have no idea what else to try.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope that helps!</div>

            That is a little strange, since I didn't think that the "Office 2013 Home and Student" was a "click to run" installation. Obviously I could be wrong about that.<br />
<br />
You still have the manual uninstall option, method 4 in the same tip you got the fix it from.

<h2>            Retrieving Email Folders in Outlook through Office 365</h2>
                    I have just replaced my computer after it died and purchased Office 365.&nbsp; I have setup Outlook and was expecting to be able to find my email folders and the emails I had saved in there on my old computer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, only the emails that were in my
 Inbox are appearing.&nbsp; Please let me know how I can retrieve the email folders and emails that were in my Deleted folders.&nbsp; Thanks.

            Hi Eric,
<br />What type of email account do you have configured in Outlook? POP, IMAP, Outlook.com, or Microsoft Exchange?  
<br />
<br />Were you using a POP account or PST files for offline or archive storage? Those files would need to be backed up.

<h2>            homepage.exe</h2>
                    I keep getting homepage.exe coming up as a security risk issue through my computer security and am not sure whether to accept or block. I have blocked it previously and think that this then caused errors in website browsing as I was unable to access any
 websites and was getting the message that a "socket connection had failed due to socket connection access restrictions" followed by a 10 - 11 digit number. Has anyone else experienced this and should i accept or block this?
<div><br />

<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>I'm sure that's disconcerting to say the least and I would want to eliminate that issue if it was my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You <strong>may</strong> be seeing remnants of an adware program that was on your computer...specifically "BestMatch."<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check startup menu and if you see it in there you can hopefully disable it.&nbsp; If you can find such a program installed or a file folder called "BestMatch" or "HomePage" suggest you remove it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you might want to run the following programs:</p>

 Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP), and browser Hijackers from your computer.&nbsp; By using AdwCleaner you can easily remove many of these types of programs for a better user experience on your computer and while browsing the web.</span></font></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">The types of programs that AdwCleaner targets are typically bundled with free programs that you download from the web.&nbsp; In many cases when
 you download and install a program, the install will state that these programs will be installed along with the program you downloaded.&nbsp; Unless you perform a Custom install, these unwanted programs will automatically be installed on your computer leaving you
 with extra browser toolbars, adware, and other unwanted programs.&nbsp; AdwCleaner is designed to search for and remove these types of programs.</font></span></p>

<h2>            How do I fix a error 1406 when installing ms office 2010 pro plus</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I've been trying to installing microsoft offce 2010 pro plus(which I recived from my school). The thing is it downloads just fine. But it gets about half-way then stops. Then spits out a error along the lines of "Error 1406: Unable to write registry key of
 {generated_id_here}/inprocserver32/14.0.0.0 because you have improper permissions". I have called ms themselves on the matter then they directed me my manafacturer then to where I bought the computer. All wanted me to pay to get it fixed. Is there not a way
 to fix this? (without of course trying the reinstall option they told me to do)<br />

            Ok kinda figured it out, did a clean boot then installed it. The install then went through without a problem, and it seems to still wok this morning after I renabled everything. Don't know what I might have on my computer that could prevent it.<br />

            <p>Dear Mila</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for breaking the silence from Microsoft side letting us know that Microsoft has identified the problem. But the question is when can expect the fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem was present in the very first version of Preview for Office and we have been sending feedbacks about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have now installed the latest Final version of office on all machines, I am unable to work on word 2016. It is crashing every few mins and I am loosing work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something wrong with my documents? Or is it the Word 2016? I was working on these files on 2011 version without yellowing problem and crashing. But after updating to 2016 on the main computer at home, I feel let down up Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            The 2016 version was released before being completely debugged. I recommend uninstalling and reinstalling 2011 if you can.

            <p>I've been experiencing this issue ever since I began using the Word 2016 preview and it persists to this day. It is sporadic. Sometimes I manage to get in a few hours of work without it cropping up, other times it happens within seconds of opening a file,
 every time I open the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now completely given up on Word and won't be trying to use it in the future. I've reported this issue through the Word "Send Feedback" option with every new preview, yet it hasn't been addressed even in the final release of Word 2016. Disappointed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some reports I saved:</p>
<p>
</p><p>--- June 28, 2015<br />
<br />
Constantly restarting Word is really slowing down my work.<br />
<br />
Every few minutes it stops displaying portions of my text, replacing it with white or yellow regions of nothingness. This happens on both my MacBook and iMac Retina, and has been happening since I started using Word 2016 (the last three or four previews).<br />
<br />
The only remedy I have is to completely restart Word which requires reopening my file, relocating my place in the document, and reopening the style pane.<br />
<br />
--- July 13, 2015<br />
<br />
Even in the latest Word 15.11.2, I am seeing the same rendering issues as in previous builds. The screen goes yellow and doesn't render the document I'm working on. It seems to happen most when scrolling through a document. I should note that I've been using
 the older .doc format all along, if that makes a difference. I've also been using a set of custom styles from my publisher, and haven't tried working with any other documents to narrow down the issue.<br />
<br />
It's hard to believe that Office 2016 for Mac is now released without such serious issues being addressed. :-(<br />

            <p>What you're seeing is an incompatibility with the video driver. Unlike Windows, you rarely get a video driver update from Apple. Whatever driver is installed when you install OS X is the one you have to live with. If you combine your model of Mac with the
 video driver used by your version of OS X, plus Word 2016, you get yellowing on the screen. It's very likely that only people with exactly the same hardware and operating system version get yellowing on-screen. No one else does. So it's a tough bug to pin
 down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's worthwhile to file a bug report using the smiley face and include the exact model information for your Mac. Here's a page that shows you how identify the exact processor information: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/find-mac-cpu-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mac
 CPU Information</a>. Armed with the CPU info, you can find the exact model here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.everymac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">EveryMac.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in the Finder, click on the Apple icon in the menu bar and choose About this Mac and include all the information there, especially the graphics processor information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't guarantee that this will get MS to solve the problem, but without this information, they cannot fix it.</p>

            <p>Sorry John, but I disagree!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It cannot be due to the video driver and I can confirm that I have that problem on two different Macs with two different specification of graphic card and drivers. One is with Intel Iris Pro and the other is ATI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me explain you why is that: I have been working on word documents that will open and work fine for hours. I have even opened multiple word files and have worked on them simultaneously. Not a single time, Word 2016 had crashed on me therefore, we can
 rule out graphic drivers being the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I have opened some documents which DO lead to yellowing of the screen and eventually crashing. What I have figured out so far is that there are some documents which are culprit. They were either created in office 2011 for mac or office
 2013 for windows. I have for instance a 401 page long thesis. When I open it and leave it for about 5 mins and come back to it, as soon as I move the mouse to scroll, the page turns yellow. I have been using this document to tst the yellowing in each preview
 release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yellowing of the screen, and disappearance of the text occurs in these situations but not necessarily to have all of them at the same time: Open multiple word files created on other versions of office; yellowing occurs more likely whilst &nbsp;"scrolling" the
 document; the document has tables and graphs; yellowing may not occur right away and you may have to wait for about 5 mins before the corruption starts; and lastly when it occurs, Word crashes with error of "core foundation crashed module".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, my understanding is that it is something to do with the documents or some other factors. But that's for the office team to look into as they are more capable than me in the area. (or it is combination of factors with graphics drivers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why many people are not seeing this because like i said there could be some culprit document which are incompatible with the code of the newer version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Can someone else confirms that yellowing in appearing in the document created in Office 2016 version? This will help us rule out the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I would like to add that if you say that it is the graphics driver, then the first thing which comes to my mind is that why Office developers has not made Office compatible to work with these drivers. Like every other developer who is developing apps
 including Apple makes sure that there app works fine with the drive provides. And in an event when something is wrong you can't just simply but the blame on driver. That sounds to me an easy way of passing the blame! (Sorry nothing personal) :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been contacted by the office team to provide a document which causes the corruption, I would like to help them but at the same time all these documents are highly confidential i.e. theses and important papers. Therefore, I am still seeing which documents
 I can send them to pin point the problem. I have several screen recording of the crash. Only if I could show the office team myself. Here is a link to some of those videos&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://http://1drv.ms/1SkZepz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://http://1drv.ms/1SkZepz</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I like and appreciate the whole new Office 2016 package and I am sorry for being very critical. But I want the issue to be sorted as a paying customer.</p>

</p><p>I experienced this issue on two different computers and have reported it with the frowny face several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The MacBook has Intel HD Graphics 5300 graphics while the Retina iMac has&nbsp;</span>AMD Radeon R9 M295X graphics. The Retina iMac doesn't appear to utilize integrated Intel graphics, so Word is exhibiting the same problems

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I was also contacted to send in a sample document and just sent in a .doc file for a book chapter I'm working on. I agree with your assessment, as this .doc was initially created in some version of Office
 for Windows no doubt (not by me). It was a template (but just a .doc file) with all the styles I needed. I haven't narrowed down what elements cause the problem, but hopefully the fine folks at Microsoft can.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I still can't insert images into older .doc files and my publisher doesn't currently support the newer .docx format. I can't really wait three months for an Office 2016 update so I'm stuck with installing Office 2013 for Windows in a VM (or 2011
 for Mac) or just abandoning Word altogether.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Yes - they have contacted me too and have advised me to disable the grammar check until they fix this. I have done that and have tried working on the documents. I have no yellowing so far. I think the devs may have nailed it and found the root cause.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 635 keeps filling up storage by itself&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I NEED AN ANSWER FAST!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Lumia 635 that I bought about 1.5 years ago. It does not have win10.</p>
<p>Today I went to download this game called Color switch. And it said I don't have enough space on my phone to get it.</p>
<p>I quickly went to check my storage AND I HAD 2MB OF FREE STORAGE! Literally 2 mins ago I had 1GB of free storage... 1GB is VERY BAD but 2MB?!</p>
<p>Normally &nbsp;I would have WAY MORE free space on my phone (More GBs)</p>
<p>So what my phone is doing is it's randomly filling up so much space and freeing it up. Sometimes it's going from 10MB to 700MB in 2 seconds. It's really weird. Can somebody help me and has anybody had the same problem.</p>
<p>I need help fast. This is ruining my phone.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a lot of factors that may contribute to your phone losing some of its available space. We suggest using Storage Sense on your device to track what causes your phone to lose that much extra space.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the sudden consumption of your extra space may be due to temporary files. If this is the reason, you can have it deleted by going to Settings&gt; Storage Sense&gt; Temporary Files &gt; tap Delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further help regarding your phone's storage issues.</p>

    <title>Disabling internet access on C2-01 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disabling internet access on C2-01</h2>
                    Hi all I have bought a C2-01 phone for use away from my home country and wish to disable all access to the internet as it would be extremely expensive. In Menu/Settings/Connectivity/Packet Data/Packet data conn./ I only have 2 selections "When needed"
 or "Always online", what is missing is "Never". The trouble is there are lots of internet accessing options within the phone menu system that use the internet and if you accidentally select one it will go "online" without asking. Any suggestions? Thanks in
 advance. Ned

<p>Welcome to the Nokia discussion boards!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are correct that those are the two types of options you can select. As you will not be using any data at all, you would not need to open the applications which require data. Here is a more detailed description of both the settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When needed</strong> — Establish a packet data connection when needed by an application.<br />
The connection is closed when the application is closed.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Always online</strong> — Automatically connect to a packet data network when</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Best thing will be to define a access point that is non existent and set this as the default access point. That way even if box box application tries to go online, it wont be able to.

            haZey Saying "you would not need to open the applications which require data" is OK for a competent user, but the trouble is the phone will be used by a number of people who are definitely NOT! timkarnat I've tried defining an access point, using Menu/Settings/Configuration/Personal
 config.sett./ but it just seems to ignoe it and go online anyhow

            Okay, you have set personal config settings. But have you activated them as default? Go to settings&gt;configuration&gt;default config sett. and select the NON EXISTENT web setting you have created.Then go to settings&gt;configuration&gt;preferred access point and
 select the access point you created.<br />
And yes, check whether you have created the FAKE web settings and access point. Go to settings &gt;configuration&gt;personal config sett&gt;options&gt;add new&gt;web And then press back. Your fake web setting is created. This is what you have select as default config sett
 above.Then again go to settings&gt;configuration&gt;personal config sett&gt;options&gt;add new&gt;access point. Enter some text and press back. This is the access point you need to select in PREFERRED ACCESS POINT above.<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>&nbsp;some firmware variants do not offer that option. However, you do not need it because this is here in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;because modern networks allow all access-point names (wildcard APN), a fake account is of no use anymore. Therefore, does ?</p>

            Rather than discussing any customisation or existing feature, why do you just simply rename the AP name from the provider's default name (which is workable) to something not existing (which is NOT workable)? For example, some random letters or Obama or
 BinLaden?

<p>Because modern network operators except everyone, ah everything. They apply a wildcard to the APN. You can enter what you want, the connection is going to be established.</p>

<p>i have an access point (BT Home hub) and it SAYS "access point defined" every time i enter the wep key but...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.why does it never show up in the "active data connections" menu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.why do i have to keep entering the web key over and over again (even just after iv entered it, literally every time!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.WON'T EMAIL ALLOW AUTOMATIC RETREIVAL OF EMAIL because it says i need to define an acess point when iv already done it a million times??!*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*my email literally worked ONCE, the first time i set it up and even then.. WHY DOES IT ONLY SHOW IN ONE HIDDEN PATH THROUGH MESSAGING INSTEAD OF INCLUDING IT IN A QUICKLINK?? all the quicklinks say "no email"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;please help me iv been alone for too long with my phone! :S</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it can't&nbsp;mean...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1: the acess point generally isnt working (my internet works sometimes on phone)</p>
<p>2: i need to change my email settings (the first time they all came through and it let me reply)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASSSSEE help me on what you think it means</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**also i would be amazed if you could tell me how to stop it from asking you the wep key a million times and somehow save the web key with the&nbsp;"defined access point" somewhere lol, and also&nbsp;to password protect your emails (in the windows live section in
 the messaging section)&nbsp;(anyone can veiw them)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(&nbsp;i don't mind if i get a&nbsp;new txt in, im not worried but emails are alot more personal than that i think and there must be a way, even if they expect you to go through and delete all of them, if you get a new one everyones going to be able to see it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(((i'm going to take it to a phone repair place to see if they can suss it out, if they can il post it on here anyway)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but this really makes NO sense,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>first of all, my windows live email accounts i created have come up in 2 seperate clients (already on E71) "live" and "windows live" i don't know what the difference is but the one that worked at first was windows live which downloaded all my email then
 let me reply, however stopped straight away from downloading any new emails!? when i go into it from the messaging page then options then settings then email, when i try even click it it says "messaging feature not supported"&nbsp; !!?? does this mean its not supported&nbsp;<em>anymore</em>?
 i don't know, but anyway, from that client all my emails are there un-protected by a login for everyone to see, now with my "live" account, unlike what iv just said about the other one, this one actually
<em>does</em> have a secure login<em>..</em> except its not letting me use it!! it
<em>says "unable to create secure login, server may not support secure login" </em>
</p>
<p>what does that mean?? i don't even know who it means by server, for the phone or my router??&nbsp;</p>
<p>also i don't know if this means anything but iv tried acessing it from google at msn.com AND from the quicklink but the quicklink wouldnt ever load and it wouldnt let me sign in the other way, theres definately nothing wrong with my msn account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sorry for all this ramble i just wanted to include everything please help!!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>To answer your first question about your wifi, I actually experienced similar problem yesterday. I actually forgot to turn off MAC address filtering on my router. After I entered my E63's MAC address, it worked.</p>

<p>First off all, Active Data Connections has nothing to do with WLAN, it's for GPRS.</p>
<p>You better clean up the mess&nbsp; and start all over again.</p>
<p>1) Go to settings &gt; settings&gt; connections &gt; accesspoints. Delete all wireless buttons and press options&gt;&nbsp; new accesspoint. Define your accesspoint with your wepkey etc... Then go to Communication &gt; Messages &gt; options &gt; settings &gt; E-mail &gt; New mailbox. Make
 sure all your settings are ok, like pop and smtpservers passwords etc... And then....Happy Mailing:smileywink:</p>

    <title>Is it possible to set Internet Explorer to ask you where to save files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ofekzeevi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to set Internet Explorer to ask you where to save files before saving them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I download files from the web using Internet Explorer 11, it asks me whether to Save or Open the file. If I click Save, it saves it to the default folder. I want Internet Explorer to ask me, whenever I download a file, in which folder to save the file
 before saving it, a kind of "Save As" feature. I know I can change the default folder in which&nbsp;it saves files, but I don't have a specific location, I need to save each and every&nbsp;file&nbsp;to a different folder.&nbsp;At the moment I'm&nbsp;saving them all to the same place,
 and then moving them to the right place, and it&nbsp;is really annoying. I couldn't find a way to set it to ask&nbsp;me where to save files before saving them, is it even possible?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>I'm not aware of a way of doing that in IE modern (aka metro). </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can think of is to use the <strong>View&nbsp;in the&nbsp;desktop </strong>
option (on <strong>Page tools </strong>when you right click)immediately before clicking on the download link then using the
<strong>Save as</strong> option as previously mentioned. You can then return to IE11 modern using, for example, the
<strong>Alt </strong>+ <strong>Tab </strong>keyboard shortcut.</p>
