            <p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8, or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currenty-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite (i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. What are the KB numbers &amp; associated installation dates of the last four (4)
<em>successfully-installed</em> updates listed in <strong>Update History</strong>? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. What <strong>Update Version</strong> is displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE10 Desktop's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab (e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 10.0.54</strong>)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?<br />
<br />
8. Is Adobe Flash Player <em>for Internet Explorer</em>&nbsp;<strong>v13.0.0.182 </strong>
installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER <em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor;
 TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner
<em>Registry Cleaner</em>)?</p>

            <p>PA Bear,</p>
<p>1a. Lenovo G710. Ordered: 3/12/14, Shipped: 3/22/14, Received: 3/27/14.</p>
<p>1b. Win8 was preinstalled on the PC.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use Norton Constant Guard.&nbsp; It has no expiration date, it is supplied by Comcast.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; I installed&nbsp;Norton when I received the PC.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; I un-installed McAfee before I installed Norton.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; McAfee was pre-installed on the PC when I received it.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The last 4 successfully installed updates are: KB2942844 (4/12), KB2922229 (4/12), KB2899109 (4/1), KB2938527 (3/28).</p>
<p>7a. IE&nbsp;Update Version 10.0.2 (KB2792100).</p>
<p>7b. No, I use IE and Bing.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Yes,&nbsp;Adobe Flash Player for IE (13.0.0.182) is installed.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;use a "Registry Cleaner", unless it is done by Norton Behind the scenes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is helpful.&nbsp; Thank you for all your help thus far.</p>

<p>I did uninstall McAfee first and then I installed Norton when I first got the PC.&nbsp; I didn't use the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool though.&nbsp; I just downloaded this tool from McAfee and ran it, then rebooted.&nbsp; I also reinstalled the Norton Security
 Suite from Comcast and rebooted again.&nbsp; I then tried to install the Windows Updates.&nbsp; Got the same error code as before.&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p>Well, yes - there's more to it than running the McAfee removal tool, especially if you didn't run the Norton removal tool before you reinstalled the Comcast/Norton freebie.<br />
</p>
<p>Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following multi-step fix I've cooked up just for your computer...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt; DON'T SKIP ANY STEP &amp; perform all Steps in one, uninterrupted session! If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em>]</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<p>
</p><p>1b. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download a fresh copy of the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop, too:
<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Uninstall <strong>Constant Guard Protection Suite </strong>[and&nbsp;<strong>Norton Security Suite</strong>
<em>and then</em> (Norton)<strong>LiveUpdate </strong>if listed separately]&nbsp;<em>as well as
</em>any <strong>Norton Add-ons</strong> via <strong>Control Panel | Programs | Uninstall a program</strong>. Reboot when prompted to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Enable the Windows Firewall immediately after rebooting! [Should happen automatically but I want you to check.]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em>else</em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed Step #7 below!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1a above and select <strong>Run as Administrator
</strong>to run the Norton utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1b above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the McAfee utility agaiin. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. <em><strong>OPTION A</strong>:</em> Do a clean install of Comcast's Norton Security Suite freebie; follow all prompts. [Yes, just the Norton suite, not the Constant Guard suite - at least for the time being.]&nbsp; See
<a href="https://constantguard.comcast.net/norton-security-suite/?cid=NET_33_644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://constantguard.comcast.net/norton-security-suite/?cid=NET_33_644</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: Do not enable or install any Norton Add-ons or toolbars (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>OPTION B (Recommended):</strong> </em>Enable Win8's built-in&nbsp;<strong>Windows Defender
</strong>instead (and leave the Windows Firewall enabled). See:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/21962-windows-defender-turn-off-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/21962-windows-defender-turn-off-windows-8-a.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>7. If you installed the Comcast/Norton freebie again in #6 above, run (Norton)
<strong>LiveUpdate</strong> manually &amp; repeatedly until you get a "no more updates" or similar prompt.&nbsp; If you opted to enable Windows Defender, you may skip this one (1) step
<em>only!</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>8a. Download/run the appropriate scripts from the following Trusted Source (my colleague IE MVP Kai Schätzl):
<a href="http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note =&gt; The scripts are good for IE10 &amp; IE11, too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tip: The file named <strong>ie8-rereg.all.zip</strong> contains both of the scripts below (plus a third that you will NOT use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>8b. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd</strong> to run the script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8c. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.64on64.cmd</strong> to run that script <em>then reboot.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Reset Internet Explorer settings&nbsp;per the instructions on this page: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note =&gt; For optimal results, check the <strong>Delete personal settings
</strong>option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. Run the Windows Update troubleshooter from start to finish per the instructions on this page =&gt;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>11. Reboot once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. Run a manual check for updates &amp; see if KB2925418, KB2936068 and/or any other security updates offered will successfully install now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIP: Start with the security updates first - then run repeated manual checks for updates until all of the non-security updates have been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIP: If KB2925418 is offered &amp; installed first, chances are KB2936068 will be offered in the next round. You want both installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIP: Sometimes it's best to install .NET updates as standalones (i.e., KB2729462 by itself,&nbsp;then KB2736693, then KB2742616, etc., etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>13. Reply to this post with a status report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: If Win8.1 is offered via the Windows Store, please do NOT install it just yet!</p>

            <p>Problem solved. I had same error (0xE5E03FA) in event viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the details on &nbsp;https://medium.com/technical-series/a2a5d4b24d55</p>
<p>The solution is simple (ensure you have backup), on a elevated command prompt (after agreeing to UAC prompt), run the following statements:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>net stop cryptsvc</li><li>ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2\edb.log *.tst</li><li>net start cryptsvc</li><li>exit</li></ul>
Now start the update.

<p>I am in receipt of both your 14 step fix and Abhijit Deshpande's reply.&nbsp; I haven't been able to work on my problem yet, but I was wondering if I need to do both (your 14 step fix and Abhijit Deshpande's fix)?</p>
<p>I am very impressed at the level of support I have received on my problem.&nbsp; Many thanks to you both.</p>
<p>Let me know and I will proceed.</p>

<h3> mxj1986  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 Won&#39;t Turn On After Update</h2>
                    <p>My Surface is a refurb no longer under warranty that was working beautifully last week. Then it updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shut off twice and was impossible to turn back on, and a few days ago it did the same thing and i have yet to get it to turn back on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It acknowledges the charge cord and lights up when attached. When i try to power button no response, but if I try tje volume up and power button hold, the charge cord will blink out about ten seconds in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing happens if I just hold down the power, but more quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once, using the second method, I got it to turn back on. But it soon shut off without notice .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix this? I have been waiting because i was hoping to google a solution or find some reason its happening but I got nothing.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm sorry to hear about the trouble you are experiencing with your Surface, it's never easy to experience downtime.
<br />
<br />Try these troubleshooting steps as a first step, however I realize you may have tried this already:
<br />
<br />1. Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
<br />
<br />2. Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
<br />
<br />3. After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.
<br />
<br />4. Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.
<br />
<br />If these steps fail to boot your device, consider visiting a Microsoft Store and trying another charger. It may be as simple as having a defective charger. If that fails, you may need to send your device in for service.
<br />
<br />Here is a link to find your nearest Microsoft Store: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations...</a>
<br />
<br />Good luck, I hope this helps.
<br />
<br />Michael

            I believe it may be due to the in game music being played during the clip. From past experiences that is what it seemed to me. It is dumb I know. I could be wrong but it seems to make sense to me.&nbsp;

<p><strong>Read section 10 ---</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Last updated July 2017</strong></p>
<p><strong>MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS</strong></p>
<p><strong>WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF YOU LIVE IN (OR IF YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN) THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE READ THE BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN SECTION 10. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you for choosing Microsoft!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, this is a license agreement between (i) you and the device manufacturer or software installer that distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on
 where you live or if a business where your principal place of business is located, one of its affiliates) if you acquired the software from a retailer. Microsoft is the device manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft or one of its affiliates, and Microsoft
 is the retailer if you acquired the software directly from Microsoft.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This agreement describes your rights and the conditions upon which you may use the Windows software. You should review the entire agreement, including any supplemental license terms that accompany the software and any linked terms, because all of
 the terms are important and together create this agreement that applies to you. You can review linked terms by pasting the (aka.ms/) link into a browser window.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By accepting this agreement or using the software, you agree to all of these terms, and consent to the transmission of certain information during activation and during your use of the software as per the privacy statement described in Section 3.
 If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you may not use the software or its features. You may contact the device manufacturer or installer, or your retailer if you purchased the software directly, to determine its return policy and return the software
 or device for a refund or credit under that policy. You must comply with that policy, which might require you to return the software with the entire device on which the software is installed for a refund or credit, if any.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.<span> </span>Overview.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.<span> </span>Applicability. This agreement applies to the Windows software that is preinstalled on your device, or acquired from a retailer and installed by you, the media on which you received the software (if any), any
 fonts, icons, images or sound files included with the software, and also any Microsoft updates, upgrades, supplements or services for the software, unless other terms come with them. It also applies to Windows apps developed by Microsoft that provide functionality
 such as mail, contacts, music and photos that are included with and are a part of Windows. If this agreement contains terms regarding a feature or service not available on your device, then those terms do not apply.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b.<span> </span>Additional terms. Additional Microsoft and third party terms may apply to your use of certain features, services and apps, depending on your device’s capabilities, how it is configured, and how you use it.
 Please be sure to read them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i)<span> </span>Some Windows apps provide an access point to, or rely on, online services, and the use of those services is sometimes governed by separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Microsoft Services Agreement
 at (aka.ms/msa). You can view these terms and policies by looking at the service terms of use or the app’s settings, as applicable. The services may not be available in all regions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(ii)<span> </span>Microsoft, the manufacturer or installer may include additional apps, which will be subject to separate license terms and privacy policies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(iii)<span> </span>The software includes Adobe Flash Player that is licensed under terms from Adobe Systems Incorporated at (aka.ms/adobeflash). Adobe and Flash are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Adobe Systems
 Incorporated in the United States and/or other countries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(iv)<span> </span>The software may include third party programs that are licensed to you under this agreement, or under their own terms. License terms, notices and acknowledgements, if any, for the third party programs can
 be viewed at (aka.ms/thirdpartynotices).</strong></p>
<p><strong>(v)<span> </span>To the extent included with Windows, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote are licensed for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you have commercial use rights under a separate agreement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.<span> </span>Installation and Use Rights.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.<span> </span>License. The software is licensed, not sold. Under this agreement, we grant you the right to install and run one instance of the software on your device (the licensed device), for use by one person at a time,
 so long as you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Updating or upgrading from non-genuine software with software from Microsoft or authorized sources does not make your original version or the updated/upgraded version genuine, and in that situation,
 you do not have a license to use the software.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b.<span> </span>Device. In this agreement, “device” means a hardware system (whether physical or virtual) with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a
 device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>c.<span> </span>Restrictions. The manufacturer or installer and Microsoft reserve all rights (such as rights under intellectual property laws) not expressly granted in this agreement. For example, this license does not give
 you any right to, and you may not:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i)<span> </span>use or virtualize features of the software separately;</strong></p>
<p><strong>(ii)<span> </span>publish, copy (other than the permitted backup copy), rent, lease, or lend the software;</strong></p>
<p><strong>(iii)<span> </span>transfer the software (except as permitted by this agreement);</strong></p>
<p><strong>(iv)<span> </span>work around any technical restrictions or limitations in the software;</strong></p>
<p><strong>(v)<span> </span>use the software as server software, for commercial hosting, make the software available for simultaneous use by multiple users over a network, install the software on a server and allow users to access it
 remotely, or install the software on a device for use only by remote users;</strong></p>
<p><strong>(vi)<span> </span>reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, or attempt to do so, except and only to the extent that the foregoing restriction is (a) permitted by applicable law; (b) permitted by licensing terms
 governing the use of open-source components that may be included with the software; or (c) required to debug changes to any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License which are included with and linked to by the software; and</strong></p>
<p><strong>(vii)<span> </span>when using Internet-based features you may not use those features in any way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them, or to try to gain access to or use any service, data, account, or network,
 in an unauthorized manner.</strong></p>
<p><strong>d.<span> </span>Multi use scenarios.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i)<span> </span>Multiple versions. If when acquiring the software you were provided with multiple versions (such as 32-bit and 64-bit versions), you may install and activate only one of those versions at a time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(ii)<span> </span>Multiple or pooled connections. Hardware or software you use to multiplex or pool connections, or reduce the number of devices or users that access or use the software, does not reduce the number of licenses
 you need. You may only use such hardware or software if you have a license for each instance of the software you are using.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(iii)<span> </span>Device connections. You may allow up to 20 other devices to access the software installed on the licensed device for the purpose of using the following software features: file services, print services, Internet
 information services, and Internet connection sharing and telephony services on the licensed device. You may allow any number of devices to access the software on the licensed device to synchronize data between devices. This section does not mean, however,
 that you have the right to install the software, or use the primary function of the software (other than the features listed in this section), on any of these other devices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(iv)<span> </span>Use in a virtualized environment. This license allows you to install only one instance of the software for use on one device, whether that device is physical or virtual. If you want to use the software on
 more than one virtual device, you must obtain a separate license for each instance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(v)<span> </span>Remote access. No more than once every 90 days, you may designate a single user who physically uses the licensed device as the licensed user. The licensed user may access the licensed device from another device
 using remote access technologies. Other users, at different times, may access the licensed device from another device using remote access technologies, but only on devices separately licensed to run the same or higher edition of this software.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(vi)<span> </span>Remote assistance. You may use remote assistance technologies to share an active session without obtaining any additional licenses for the software. Remote assistance allows one user to connect directly to
 another user’s computer, usually to correct problems.</strong></p>
<p><strong>e.<span> </span>Backup copy. You may make a single copy of the software for backup purposes, and may also use that backup copy to transfer the software if it was acquired as stand-alone software, as described in Section 4
 below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.<span> </span>Privacy; Consent to Use of Data. Your privacy is important to us. Some of the software features send or receive information when using those features. Many of these features can be switched off in the user
 interface, or you can choose not to use them. By accepting this agreement and using the software you agree that Microsoft may collect, use, and disclose the information as described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement (aka.ms/privacy), and as may be described
 in the user interface associated with the software features.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.<span> </span>Transfer. The provisions of this section do not apply if you acquired the software in Germany or in any of the countries listed on this site (aka.ms/transfer), in which case any transfer of the software to
 a third party, and the right to use it, must comply with applicable law.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.<span> </span>Software preinstalled on device. If you acquired the software preinstalled on a device (and also if you upgraded from software preinstalled on a device), you may transfer the license to use the software directly
 to another user, only with the licensed device. The transfer must include the software and, if provided with the device, an authentic Windows label including the product key. Before any permitted transfer, the other party must agree that this agreement applies
 to the transfer and use of the software.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b.<span> </span>Stand-alone software. If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that
 belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the
 media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.<span> </span>Authorized Software and Activation. You are authorized to use this software only if you are properly licensed and the software has been properly activated with a genuine product key or by other authorized method.
 When you connect to the Internet while using the software, the software will automatically contact Microsoft or its affiliate to conduct activation to associate it with a certain device. You can also activate the software manually by Internet or telephone.
 In either case, transmission of certain information will occur, and Internet, telephone and SMS service charges may apply. During activation (or reactivation that may be triggered by changes to your device’s components), the software may determine that the
 installed instance of the software is counterfeit, improperly licensed or includes unauthorized changes. If activation fails, the software will attempt to repair itself by replacing any tampered Microsoft software with genuine Microsoft software. You may also
 receive reminders to obtain a proper license for the software. Successful activation does not confirm that the software is genuine or properly licensed. You may not bypass or circumvent activation. To help determine if your software is genuine and whether
 you are properly licensed, see (aka.ms/genuine). Certain updates, support, and other services might only be offered to users of genuine Microsoft software.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.<span> </span>Updates. The software periodically checks for system and app updates, and downloads and installs them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources, and Microsoft may need to update
 your system to provide you with those updates. By accepting this agreement, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any additional notice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.<span> </span>Downgrade Rights. If you acquired a device from a manufacturer or installer with a Professional version of Windows preinstalled on it and it is configured to run in full feature mode, you may use either a Windows
 8.1 Pro or Windows 7 Professional version, but only for so long as Microsoft provides support for that earlier version as set forth in (aka.ms/windowslifecycle). This agreement applies to your use of the earlier versions. If the earlier version includes different
 components, any terms for those components in the agreement that comes with the earlier version apply to your use of such components. Neither the manufacturer or installer, nor Microsoft, is obligated to supply earlier versions to you. You must obtain the
 earlier version separately, for which you may be charged a fee. At any time, you may replace an earlier version with the version you originally acquired.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.<span> </span>Geographic and Export Restrictions. If your software is restricted for use in a particular geographic region, then you may activate the software only in that region. You must also comply with all domestic and
 international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on geographic and export restrictions, visit (aka.ms/georestrict) and (aka.ms/exporting).</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.<span> </span>Support and Refund Procedures.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.<span> </span>For software preinstalled on a device. For the software generally, contact the device manufacturer or installer for support options. Refer to the support number provided with the software. For updates and supplements
 obtained directly from Microsoft, Microsoft may provide limited support services for properly licensed software as described at (aka.ms/mssupport). If you are seeking a refund, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine its refund policies. You must
 comply with those policies, which might require you to return the software with the entire device on which the software is installed for a refund.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b.<span> </span>For software acquired from a retailer. Microsoft provides limited support services for properly licensed software as described at (aka.ms/mssupport). If you purchased the software from a retailer and are seeking
 a refund, and you cannot obtain one where you acquired the software, contact Microsoft for information about Microsoft’s refund policies. See (aka.ms/msoffices), or in North America, call (800) MICROSOFT or see (aka.ms/nareturns).</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.<span> </span>Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver if You Live in (or if a Business Your Principal Place of Business is in) the United States.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration
 Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private
 attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. “We,” “our,” and “us” includes Microsoft, the device manufacturer,
 and software installer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.<span> </span>Disputes covered—everything except IP. The term “dispute” is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and the manufacturer or installer, or you and Microsoft, concerning the software,
 its price, or this agreement, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b.<span> </span>Mail a Notice of Dispute first. If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to the manufacturer or installer, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT.
 If your dispute is with Microsoft, mail it to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: LCA ARBITRATION, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399. Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. A form is available at (aka.ms/disputeform).
 We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>c.<span> </span>Small claims court option. Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, and if you meet the court’s requirements, you may sue us in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business your principal
 place of business) or our principal place of business–King County, Washington USA if your dispute is with Microsoft. We hope you’ll mail a Notice of Dispute and give us 60 days to try to work it out, but you don’t have to before going to small claims court.</strong></p>
<p><strong>d.<span> </span>Arbitration procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the software for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute
 is $75,000 USD or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the software, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see (aka.ms/adr) or call 1-800-778-7879. To start an arbitration, submit the form available at (aka.ms/arbitration)
 to the AAA; mail a copy to the manufacturer or installer (or to Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft). In a dispute involving $25,000 USD or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
 Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (of if a business your principal place of business) or our principal place of business—King County, Washington if your dispute is with Microsoft. You choose. The arbitrator may award the same
 damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.</strong></p>
<p><strong>e.<span> </span>Arbitration fees and payments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i)<span> </span>Disputes involving $75,000 USD or less. The manufacturer or installer (or Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft) will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
 If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, the manufacturer or installer
 (or Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft) will: (1) pay the greater of the award or $1,000 USD; (2) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (3) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues
 for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will determine the amounts unless you and we agree on them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(ii)<span> </span>Disputes involving more than $75,000 USD. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(iii)<span> </span>Disputes involving any amount. If you start an arbitration we won’t seek our AAA or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or your filing fees we reimbursed, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous
 or brought for an improper purpose. If we start an arbitration we will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. We won’t seek our attorney’s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration. Fees and expenses are not counted in determining how
 much a dispute involves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>f.<span> </span>Must file within one year. You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes — see Section 10.a.) within one year from when it first could
 be filed. Otherwise, it’s permanently barred.</strong></p>
<p><strong>g.<span> </span>Severability. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in
 arbitration. If any other provision of Section 10 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of Section 10 still applies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>h.<span> </span>Conflict with AAA rules. This agreement governs if it conflicts with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</strong></p>
<p><strong>i.<span> </span>Microsoft as party or third-party beneficiary. If Microsoft is the device manufacturer or if you acquired the software from a retailer, Microsoft is a party to this agreement. Otherwise, Microsoft is not a
 party but is a third-party beneficiary of your agreement with the manufacturer or installer to resolve disputes through informal negotiation and arbitration.</strong></p>
<p><strong>11.<span> </span>Governing Law. The laws of the state or country where you live (or if a business where your principal place of business is located) govern all claims and disputes concerning the software, its price, or this
 agreement, including breach of contract claims and claims under consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, implied warranty laws, for unjust enrichment, and in tort, regardless of conflict of law principles. In the United States, the FAA governs all
 provisions relating to arbitration.</strong></p>
<p><strong>12.<span> </span>Consumer Rights, Regional Variations. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. You may also have rights
 with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory
 country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.<span> </span>Australia. References to “Limited Warranty” are references to the express warranty provided by Microsoft or the manufacturer or installer. This warranty is given in addition to other rights and remedies you
 may have under law, including your rights and remedies in accordance with the statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this section, “goods” refers to the software for which Microsoft or the manufacturer or installer provides the express warranty. Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement
 or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b.<span> </span>Canada. You may stop receiving updates on your device by turning off Internet access. If and when you re-connect to the Internet, the software will resume checking for and installing updates.</strong></p>
<p><strong>c.<span> </span>European Union. The academic use restriction in Section 13.d(i) below does not apply in the jurisdictions listed on this site: (aka.ms/academicuse).</strong></p>
<p><strong>d.<span> </span>Germany and Austria.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i)<span> </span>Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, the manufacturer or installer, and Microsoft, give no contractual
 guarantee in relation to the licensed software.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(ii)<span> </span>Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, the manufacturer or installer,
 or Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject to the preceding sentence, the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if the manufacturer or installer or Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which
 facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, the manufacturer
 or installer or Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>e.<span> </span>Other regions. See (aka.ms/variations) for a current list of regional variations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>13.<span> </span>Additional Notices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.<span> </span>Networks, data and Internet usage. Some features of the software and services accessed through the software may require your device to access the Internet. Your access and usage (including charges) may be subject
 to the terms of your cellular or internet provider agreement. Certain features of the software may help you access the Internet more efficiently, but the software’s usage calculations may be different from your service provider’s measurements. You are always
 responsible for (i) understanding and complying with the terms of your own plans and agreements, and (ii) any issues arising from using or accessing networks, including public/open networks. You may use the software to connect to networks, and to share access
 information about those networks, only if you have permission to do so.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b.<span> </span>H.264/AVC and MPEG-4 visual standards and VC-1 video standards. The software may include H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and/or VC-1 decoding technology. MPEG LA, L.L.C. requires this notice:</strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC, THE VC-1, AND THE MPEG-4 PART 2 VISUAL PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENSES FOR THE PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABOVE STANDARDS (“VIDEO STANDARDS”) AND/OR (ii)
 DECODE AVC, VC-1, AND MPEG-4 PART 2 VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO. NO LICENSE IS GRANTED OR SHALL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE.
 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. SEE (AKA.MS/MPEGLA).</strong></p>
<p><strong>c.<span> </span>Malware protection. Microsoft cares about protecting your device from malware. The software will turn on malware protection if other protection is not installed or has expired. To do so, other antimalware software
 will be disabled or may have to be removed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>d.<span> </span>Limited rights versions. If the software version you acquired is marked or otherwise intended for a specific or limited use, then you may only use it as specified. You may not use such versions of the software
 for commercial, non-profit, or revenue-generating activities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i)<span> </span>Academic. For academic use, you must be a student, faculty or staff of an educational institution at the time of purchase.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(ii)<span> </span>Evaluation. For evaluation (or test or demonstration) use, you may not sell the software, use it in a live operating environment, or use it after the evaluation period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
 in this Agreement, evaluation software is provided “AS IS” and no warranty, implied or express (including the Limited Warranty), applies to these versions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(iii)<span> </span>NFR. You may not sell software marked as “NFR” or “Not for Resale”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(iv)<span> </span>Preview. You may choose to use preview, insider, beta or other pre-release versions of the software (“previews”) that Microsoft may make available. You may use previews only up to the software’s expiration
 date and so long as you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Previews are experimental and may be substantially different from the commercially released version. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, previews are provided “AS
 IS,” and no warranty, implied or express (including the Limited Warranty), applies to these versions. By installing previews on your device, you may void or impact your device warranty and may not be entitled to support from the manufacturer of your device
 or network operator, if applicable. Microsoft is not responsible for any damage thereby caused to you. Microsoft may not provide support services for previews. If you provide Microsoft comments, suggestions or other feedback about the preview (“submission”),
 you grant Microsoft and its partners rights to use the submission in any way and for any purpose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>14.<span> </span>Entire Agreement. This agreement (together with the printed paper license terms or other terms accompanying any software supplements, updates, and services that are provided by the manufacturer or installer,
 or Microsoft, and that you use), and the terms contained in web links listed in this agreement, are the entire agreement for the software and any such supplements, updates, and services (unless the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft, provides other terms
 with such supplements, updates, or services). You can review this agreement after your software is running by going to (aka.ms/useterms) or going to Settings - System - About within the software. You can also review the terms at any of the links in this agreement
 by typing the URLs into a browser address bar, and you agree to do so. You agree that you will read the terms before using the software or services, including any linked terms. You understand that by using the software and services, you ratify this agreement

</strong></p>
<p><strong>***********************************************************************</strong></p>
<p><strong>LIMITED WARRANTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Microsoft warrants that properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. This limited warranty does not cover problems that you cause, that arise when you fail to follow instructions,
 or that are caused by events beyond Microsoft’s reasonable control. The limited warranty starts when the first user acquires the software, and lasts for one year. Any supplements, updates, or replacement software that you may receive from Microsoft during
 that year are also covered, but only for the remainder of that one-year period or for 30 days, whichever is longer. Transferring the software will not extend the limited warranty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Microsoft gives no other express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. Microsoft excludes all implied warranties and conditions, including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. If your local law does not
 allow the exclusion of implied warranties, then any implied warranties, guarantees, or conditions last only during the term of the limited warranty and are limited as much as your local law allows. If your local law requires a longer limited warranty term,
 despite this agreement, then that longer term will apply, but you can recover only the remedies this agreement allows.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If Microsoft breaches its limited warranty, it will, at its election, either: (i) repair or replace the software at no charge, or (ii) accept return of the software (or at its election the Microsoft branded device on which the software was preinstalled)
 for a refund of the amount paid, if any. These are your only remedies for breach of warranty. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state or country to country.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Except for any repair, replacement, or refund Microsoft may provide, you may not recover under this limited warranty, under any other part of this agreement, or under any theory, any damages or other remedy, including lost profits or direct, consequential,
 special, indirect, or incidental damages. The damage exclusions and remedy limitations in this agreement apply even if repair, replacement or a refund does not fully compensate you for any losses, if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
 of the damages, or if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages, so those limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. If your local law allows
 you to recover damages from Microsoft even though this agreement does not, you cannot recover more than you paid for the software (or up to $50 USD if you acquired the software for no charge).</strong></p>
<p><strong>WARRANTY PROCEDURES</strong></p>
<p><strong>For service or a refund, you must provide a copy of your proof of purchase and comply with Microsoft’s return policies, which might require you to uninstall the software and return it to Microsoft or return the software with the entire Microsoft
 branded device on which the software is installed; the certificate of authenticity label including the product key (if provided with your device) must remain affixed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.<span> </span>United States and Canada. For warranty service or information about how to obtain a refund for software acquired in the United States or Canada, contact Microsoft via telephone at (800) MICROSOFT; via mail
 at Microsoft Customer Service and Support, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399; or visit (aka.ms/nareturns).</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.<span> </span>Europe, Middle East, and Africa. If you acquired the software in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, contact either Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, Customer Care Centre, Atrium Building Block B, Carmanhall
 Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate, Dublin 18, Ireland, or the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (aka.ms/msoffices).</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.<span> </span>Australia. If you acquired the software in Australia, contact Microsoft to make a claim at 13 20 58; or Microsoft Pty Ltd, 1 Epping Road, North Ryde NSW 2113 Australia.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.<span> </span>Other countries. If you acquired the software in another country, contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (aka.ms/msoffices).</strong></p>

<h2>            HALO 4&#58; N&#38;&#35;227&#59;o consigo salvar o jogo. Ajudem&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Eu não consigo salvar no coop offline jogando em tela dividida.</p>
<p>Toda vez começa tudo de novo.</p>

<p>OBS1: Quando eu coloco o DVD e inicia o jogo, não pede para escolher nenhum dispositivo de salvamento.</p>
<p>OBS2: Quando eu vou sair do jogo, eu apero start e não tem "<strong>salvar e sair</strong>". Apenas "<strong>Finalizar jogo</strong>".</p>
<p>OBS3: Quando eu aperto start no meio do jogo, aparece "<strong>Reverter p/ o ultimo salvamento</strong>", mas só que inicia do inicio, e não da onde eu tinha parado.</p>
<p>OBS4: Quando eu fui no menu do XBOX, em sistemas, na parte onde aparece os "save games", eu não vi nenhum save do HALO 4.</p>
<p>OBS5: O auto-save aparentemente está ligado, porque depois de passar determinados fases, aparece o ícone de salvamento.</p>

<p>Um cara, link abaixo, tbm estava com a mesma dificuldade, mas depois ele disse que deu certo, mas não disse como:</p>

<p>http://forum.jogos.uol.com.br/_t_lastpost_2262055_43?postId=46417954</p>

<p>vc possui apenas um dispositivo de memoria? isso explicaria ele não perguntar onde salvar, o Halo reconhece automaticamente que so tens 1, por isso sabe que não precisa perguntar onde salvar</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>pouca memoria, recomendo deletar algo, limpar o cache, estas coisas</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>jogador 2 está conectado em algum perfil? ou joga como convidado ou sem perfil nenhum</p>
<p>é obrigatorio o 2º controle ter seu perfil tbm pelo seguinte:</p>
<p>quando vc joga sozinho, ao sair da partida o jogo salva o seu progresso, não apenas a fase mas o checkpoint. para evitar que esse checkpoint seja perdido ao jogar em coop, ele cria um novo salve exclusivo para os dois perfis de modo que se vc quiser continuar
 de onde parou com outra pessoa (outro perfil) ele não permiti, somente com os mesmo jogadores (mesmos perfil 1 e 2)</p>
<p>ou seja, vc joga sozinho, parou, pode continuar onde parou</p>
<p>vc joga em coop, parou, você podera continuar onde parou desde jogue com a mesma pessoa (perfil na verdade, não importa o jogador ele não vai reconhecer as digitais mesmo)</p>

<p>The folder is probably<br />

</em>rather than<br />
<em>c:/System32<br />
</em>and the file is probably<br />
<em>mshta.exe</em></p>
<p>If this is a recent issue then you can most likely fix it by using System Restore. Here is how it works:<br />
1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu.<br />
3. Enter the Administrator's password when prompted. It is often blank.<br />
4. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
5. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I did follow the steps and check the update history&nbsp; and the updates were installed successfully. But over the past few months these updates have been installed everyday.<br />
Still windows update keeps installing them and the update icone (shield with exclamation mark) keeps popping up after a while asking me to instal these updates.<br />
<br />
I tried:<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span>Method 2: Examine the installation log file but an error message keeps poping up:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Windows cannot find&nbsp; C:\Windows\kb 2478658.log. Make sure you typed the name ect...<br />
<br />
I tried three times: <br />
<br />
1. <span>%Windir%\KB</span><span>.log<br />
2. </span><span>%Windir%\</span>2478658<span>KB.log<br />
3.</span><span>%Windir%\2518864KB.log<br />
<br />
All i come up with is three times:<br />
<br />
Windows cannot find C:\Windows\KB ect.....<br />
<br />
Windows updates also tells me that two updates were found and are ready to install....the damned ones again.<br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 s power brick red light - only when loading disc&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone. Im looking for some help.</p>

<p>My 360 s power brick has the red light problem which is well documented and ive researched thoroughly.</p>

<p>However, this issue does not occur when not loading a game - when im on the dashboard in a party it works fine. Earlier I playe ME2 in a private chat for hours - again fine (confusingly - maybe due to long rest period given beforehand?) But loading games
 like gears 3 or fifa consistently causes red light to trigger on the brick and the power to the xbox cuts out.</p>

<p>Advice? Would replacing the cable even solve this issue?</p>

<p>Thanks guys</p>

<p>I've got this problem : my power supply turns red about 30 minutes-1 hour after the ignition of the console.
</p>
<p>On the support microsoft they say cool block 30 min I do several times, but I feel that its only keeps longer lit the console because if I unplug the console just after the forced extinction ben and she holds of 10-15 min.
</p>
<p>So is the block or console is defective?</p>
<p>Sorry but I use google translation beacause i'm french</p>

<p>Here are a couple trouble shooting steps (which I read you have done extensive research on). &nbsp;If these do not work. &nbsp;Then follow the link, because your Power Supply is failing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Try plugging your console’s power supply into a different electrical outlet. Do not use a surge protector.
</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;If the power supply light is solid red or flashing orange, unplug the power supply and let it cool for 30 minutes. Then, plug the power supply back into the outlet.

<p>nice...I bought my first DLC for a WWE series this past year and still regret it. I hope they actually release a decent roster and maybe give a little back to their loyal fan base for once although I doubt it. Money talks...but atleast the create a wrestler
 sharing is still intact and that's beter than any DLC offering they've ever had.</p>

<p>This is 2K's first full year with the game. The NBA series has always been top-notch. I think they'll nail it this year. Really looking forward to playing a career mode again. Haven't had a decent one since PS2 days.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and giving us an opportunity to assist you on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
As per the issue description, it looks like you are unable to access Windows 7 shared files or folder on computer running Windows 8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would like to ask some questions in context of this issue:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Are you able to view the shared files/folders of Windows 7 on the network?<br />
2) If yes, what exactly happens when you try to access files/folders? <br />
3) Do you get any error message? If yes, what is the error message that you get?<br />
<div><br />
If you are unable to access the files/folder of Windows 7 shared on the network on a computer running Windows 8, then, it might be an issue with the home network on which you have shared the files.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to run the automated network troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the methods:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:<br />

<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>

            <p>Well - it cleared up all by itself somehow afternoon. It took 4 days for the Win 8 machine to finally access the Win 7 machine. I did nothing. Very strange!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However this morning - again it could find the folder/drive yet it identified the Win 7 machine on the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what you mean by Win 7 network. I have a network with a number of machines on it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Win 7 machine can see all of the shared folders/drives on the 5 XP machines and the Win 8 machine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the 5 XP machines can see the folders/drives on Win 7&nbsp;and other XP machines AND they can see the Win 8 shared folders/drive..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Win 8 machine can see the folder/drives on the XP machines. It can see the Win 7 machine but when I try to list the shared folders/drives I get a 0x80070035 error code with message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All machines belong to WORKGROUP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "automated network troubleshooter" detects no problems it just says the Win&nbsp;7 machine is not responding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can connect to the network on the Win 8 machine.</p>
<p>The Win 7 machine has been sharing printers, folders and drives with the XP machines happily for 2 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only trouble I have is getting the Win 8 machine to connect to the folders/drives on the Win 7 machine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the input</p>

            <p>Here is an interesting thing. If I Map a Network drive to the IP address of the Win 7 machine it connects okay. There appears to be a problem somewhere recognizing the name of the machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this provide any more clues?</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
Thank you for a quick update on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
Let me gather some information to further troubleshoot the issue:</div>
<div><br />
Have you installed any security software on the computer?<br />
Since, you are unable to access the shared files over the network, let’s run the shared folders troubleshooter and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
You can follow the methods:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
You can follow the steps to run the shared folder troubleshooter:</div>
<div><br />
a) Type troubleshooting on the start screen and click on Settings on the charms bar.<br />
b) Click on “Access shared files and folders on other computers.”<br />
c) Follow the onscreen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><br />
If you have installed any security software on the computer, I would suggest you to temporarily disable the security software and the firewall settings on the computer to try and resolve this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Important Note: </strong>Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>To temporarily turn off windows Firewall settings, you can refer to the link:</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You shouldn’t turn off Windows Firewall unless you have another firewall turned on. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your PC (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.</div>
<div>Hope it helps.</div>
<div><br />
Please reply us with the status of this issue.</div>

    <title>Two controller problems... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xkotov syndrome  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two controller problems...</h2>
                    
<p>The first is with the xbox controller that was included with the system. The left stick loves freely moving and choosing things in-game with so much as the slightest touch. For instance, a fighting game, it'll randomly go all over the character roster when
 I try and select just one character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is with another xbox controller I purchased when the first one began messing up like that. The right stick doesn't seem to want to snap back into where it's supposed to, and is currently resting as far up as it can go, refusing to get fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How would I go about getting both of these fixed? Would it be as simple as opening them, making sure I don't lose the buttons, and very carefully cleaning them?</p>

<p>The controller that came with the Xbox I've had for 2 years, and the newest one is a year old.</p>
<p>So yeah. A 90 day warranty won't work for that.</p>

<h2>            programs not running&#59;showing up as application not found</h2>
                    When I click on programs on my desktop such as Itunes, Word and Safari I get an error message saying "application not found".&nbsp; The only way I can run programs such as Itunes and Mozilla Firefox is to run the itunes setup or the computer asks me if I want
 firefox to run firefox then it begins to work.&nbsp; How can I fix this?

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro N Build 10586 Media Features Pack won&#39;t &#40;un&#41;install</h2>
                    <p>Hello people,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I updated my Windows 10 Pro N Build 10240 to Build 10586 using an ISO file. Everything went perfectly fine, but the Media Features Pack is installed (according to the installer when installing the pack). Which it isn't of course, my OnePlus Two
 doesn't show up in Computer (I've installed all the necessary drivers for it, trust me) GTA V failed to launch because mfreadwrite.dll is not found. (MF = MediaFoundation), and indeed when searching for mfreadwrite.dll nothing was found.
<br />
<br />
When searching my Windows.OLD folder, it appeared in the WinSXS folder, on my new installation it didn't of course.</p>
<p>When checking out the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Packages\)</p>
<p>the Media Feature Pack Shows up as Microsoft-Windows-MediaFeaturePack-OOB-Package_Wrapper~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.10240.16384 with the following keys:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb891e8f-c1eb-48e5-b5b5-6fa86b529c0c" height="429" width="807" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth and sfc /scannow doesn't fix the problem, also when I click Add or Remove Windows Features, the Media Features Pack is
<strong>not </strong>listed in the list. When trying to install it with dism I get the following result</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9a082e7-6eb8-42ff-a30b-96f5f54a73d9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing the cab from the msu file (that I extracted) it shows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e4eafe5-7ec7-41b0-9ccb-6ff536fe9267" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>of course it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that during the upgrade the registry key that tells the system that the Media Feature Pack is installed was also copied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is wrong? I don't want to reinstall my windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible could anyone give me a fix asap? I need the pack for school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all the help.</p>

    <title>I cant sign in&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vvcarterboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            I cant sign in&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Heres my first post. I recently bought an xbox 360 core. I bought a wireless adapter to play call of duty black ops and get combat training. I connected to our wi-fi and the xbox tested the connection. It said it was connected and after it connected to xbox
 live, it said Live Marketplace-up and some other things that said "Live-...." they all said that they were up. So I then go to sign in, I already had an account, and after I typed in my info it says something like "cannot log into profile, try later" then
 it gave me error code 80070570 i think is the exact number. I have never bought a membership yet and I havent done anything stupid on my profile that would break rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Im getting very upset after going through the troubles of getting everything together and finding out i need something else. Is there anything else I need? Do I need a gold membership? Or is this something obvious that I'm not seeing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help or Any ideas are welcomed as Im out of ideas. Thank You in advance!!</p>

            <p>Hey there vvcarterboy! Thank you for your post, it was an excellent first post! :) There are a few things we can address here. First of all, are you hoping to play online with Call of Duty? If so, you will definitely need a LIVE Gold Membership, as Free accounts do not enable online play. However, the error code you are getting means you are having a bit of trouble signing into your profile at all, correct? Have you tried downloading your profile? In order to do so, you can follow the instructions available here: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/t/153143.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../153143.aspx</a> . Let me know if this helps! :) </p>

<p>What I meant by playing online, is I've heard that once you sign into Call of Duty Black Ops once, without playing a LIVE game, will unlock &nbsp;a new option to play in regular multiplayer. I dont know if this is completely true but I believe it. Eventually
 I will get a Gold membership, but for now I just wanted to sign in. The only time I have signed into my WLID is on this website, It wont work on my Xbox. I did try downloading my profile.</p>
<p>I am currently using a regular USB flash drive. I have a 360 memory card coming, is the USB not a compatible storage device? Do I need the memory card to sign in and download my profile?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>After I got a connection it had me run about 3 updates, I get a good connection but I just cant sign in? In a way Im glad Im not the only one :)
</p>
<p>Do you think its just something temporary? Marsman10, on your xbox have you ever played LIVE before? The reason I ask is, if you havent been able to at all maybe we have the same problem. Can you sign in?</p>

<p>So I just tried signing in today and it got a bit further but still could not log in, but it gave me a new error code.</p>
<p>I just decided to not bother with it today and just play regular multiplayer, i clicked local and it made me try to sign in. I typed my info in and it tried to log in again but nothing. So I turned my Xbox off and unhooked the adapter and turned the Xbox
 back on to try local multiplayer and again made me sign in. I think my Game and Xbox is fked up untill i get to sign in. Im about to bounce this stupid thing out the window if It keeps this up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After installing&nbsp;Windows10 I've got 2 mouse problems. I'm a&nbsp;hands up&nbsp;PC zilch brain so&nbsp;I could be wrong&nbsp;about that but these 2 mouse fingos only cropped up after getting&nbsp;Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First up.</p>
<p>The scrolling speed of my mouse has sped up big heaps. Even&nbsp;trying to deliberately scroll slowly the pages&nbsp;whizz about&nbsp;in a blur.</p>
<p>I need to slow it&nbsp;down before me overworked&nbsp;and already near worn out old&nbsp;geezer peepers get&nbsp;their own&nbsp;permanent scroll trying to keep up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 2nd mouse problem is&nbsp;givin me a massive dose of&nbsp;super&nbsp;fuggin irritz!</p>
<p>I now have to click twice to start&nbsp;typing when I&nbsp;move from one&nbsp;place to another even after placing the cursor and clicking the mouse.
</p>
<p>I'm a very slow an merfodical&nbsp;one finger plodder.&nbsp;I concentrate really hard to find and tap each key. Writing this question will take me&nbsp;near an hour, maybe more if I manage to delete it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After poking away&nbsp;filling in a form&nbsp;or writing a sentence&nbsp;I'll look up to see nuffinks been typed coz I didn't remember to click the friggin mouse twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After hundreds of these events&nbsp;I've managed to stay&nbsp;sane enough to&nbsp;not turn me laptop into a digital flaptop&nbsp;missile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I use the mouse with my left hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Unfortunately we don't have any codes we can offer to replace a misplaced code. We recommend reaching out to the retailer you purchased from for a possible replacement. Really sorry to hear you misplaced your code, hopefully the retailer may have a solution. </p>

<p>i have sold my 250 gb hard drive and i have no space on my xbox to download gta 5. so i have two 8gb usb's but it says to be able to download gta 5 from the xbox marketplace you will have to have 16 gb of space, 8 gb for the actual download and then another
 8gb for when you start the game and it installs itself. so i would like to know if i could download gta 5 using 2 8gb usb's? could that work?</p>

<p>No, you cannot split up the download. It can download to one location only because it's in one package. If you were installing the discs, then you could do it separately. In your case, you would need a larger USB drive.</p>

<p>No that is not true. You can split the game to two different storages because it is not a single package. However 8gb usb is not enough. I would recommend 2 16gb usbs. You can download the half to one, and another files to the second usb. I downloaded 8gb
 to hard drive, and another 8gb to pendrive to assure the best graphics. But the game still looks like crap. If you want to buy it on marketplace you should reconsider. Because right now it is unplayable due to this optimization. Buy the disc instead and a
 16gb usb. I had both versions and the disc version is at least 1000% better (and is cheaper too).</p>

<p>Yes you can split the data between two drives. &nbsp;I think the answer to this problem, or at least a temporary fix, is to make sure the data is split between a fast usb device and the internal hdd. &nbsp;Initially i installed the whole game to my external hdd because
 i did not have an internal hdd. &nbsp;I used a Western Digital passport with USB 3.0 even though i knew i couldnt use the 3.0 speeds the drive is rather fast in 2.0. &nbsp;The game played pretty well considering it was all streaming off one usb 2.0 drive, but i noticed
 signifigant high load times and many textures slow loading. &nbsp;Also at times a significant drop in frame rates, im not sure if this is optimization or drive speed. &nbsp;So i decided to try the splitting the game onto two drives method. &nbsp;I installed a 120gb internal
 drive and deleted the game from the external drive. &nbsp;The total size of the downloaded version from Xbox live is 15.84GB which is the same as two DVDs. &nbsp;I re-downloaded the first download to the external WD passport. &nbsp;When you start the game for the first time
 it automatically downloads 4 files which downloaded to the internal HDD. &nbsp;So in theory I have the play disc a.k.a the first download on the external drive, and the install data on the internal HDD. &nbsp;This is the same method many users have used to fix texture
 loading issues etc. &nbsp;Instantly I noticed a decrease in load times at least a half minute or more on initial load. &nbsp;Driving seems smoother, though still not perfect, and much more enjoyable. &nbsp;I have not had enough time to fully test the results of the switch
 but my initial response would be it was well worth it. &nbsp;Two devices streaming data as adversed to one has to help and load times are much better. &nbsp;DO IT!</p>

<h2>            Programs interrupted by window opening</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm having an issue where a small window keeps opening at seemingly random times (~1/hour) before immediately disappearing. This not only interrupts whatever program is running and steals focus (which is very annoying), but I'm also worried that a piece
 of malware or spyware might be running in the background. The window closes before I can see any details, the task manager isn't showing any suspicious processes (at least as far as I can tell), and a scan with windows defender hasn't found anything. Has anyone
 experienced something similar and know how to stop it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Tom Goldstein</p>

<h2>            My LaCie 1TB ext. HDD works fine with Desktop &#40;DT&#41; computer which has Vista but when I connect it to Laptop which has Win 7 it doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    My LaCie 1TB ext. HDD works fine with Desktop (DT) computer which has Windows Vista Home Premium 64 bit, when I connect this drive to Laptop which has Windows 7 home premium 64 bit, the laptop sees this drive as a raw drive with drive letter E. I can't
 read or write, I have tried diskpart and remove read only command but so far nothing seems to work, I have checked the drive and the USB cable with HD Tune and it says drive is working fine with desktop system.&nbsp;
<div>I even erased the drive completely including partition with Acronics True Home Premium 2012, the DT will see the drive and I can partition it again but Win 7 will not even see the blank drive. Hence I can't even partition and format the drive using Win
 7. It will see the drive that Vista has formatted it as a raw drive and wouldn't allow to read or write. I tried to change it to NTSF but since I can't access it, I can't even change it to NTSF.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The diskpart command doesn't work either. &nbsp;
<div>Can someone please help? Thanks </div>

            Hi Praseetha,
<div><br />
<div>One more thought. Since I have "completely" wiped out the drive, I suspect it may have also deleted the hidden partition (?) which the OS may be looking for. I did partition the drive with Vista and it works fine with desktop computer, however the same
 drive doesn't work with Gateway laptop with</div>
<div>Win 7.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Does Win 7 require something special than Vista? Is Vista's MBR different than Win 7? And why does Win 7 sees it as a RAW drive and hence it won't allow laptop to do anything to the drive, i.e., Format, change partition to NTFS, or chkdsk or convert.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also I notice, when I plug in the USB cable in Laptop, the power light comes on for few seconds and it goes away. I don't know what that means but may mean something to you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also know that drive is fully functional according to HD Tune Pro utility which tested the whole 1TB and it took more than 8 hrs to do it. So the drive and USB cable should be good. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just more info. that might help you to diagnose the problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Hi Praseetha,
<div><br />
<div>One more thought. Does Win 7 looking for a file or something other than MBR? Could that file be in a hidden partition so it does not get accidentally erased or modify. If that's true, then that is what I am missing, because when I erased the whole drive
 it got erased too. I haven't heard from you so you must be thinking hard.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for your help. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
<div>I haven't heard from you for a long time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried a Y USB cable with the laptop and LaCie drive, it did made a small difference meaning after power on, it does see the drive as NTFS but if I try to do anything with the drive like format, create a folder or move a file, it goes back to raw
 drive and drive is not usable anymore. Any thoughts or ideas?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks. &nbsp;</div>

            <p>That's interesting, that's not part of Microsoft Windows. &nbsp;I assume it was pre-installed by HP from the factory? &nbsp;It sure appears to be related to Firefox based on that icon on the left, but it may not be actually from the same company as firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to try to find out what it is, or where it comes from, is to find it inside the Task Manager. &nbsp;Try this out:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Ctrl-Shift-Escape to open the Task Manager. &nbsp;If it opens small, click the Show Details button to expand it into full view with tabs.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Go to the Startup tab (which lists programs that auto-start when you login)) and look for anything in the listing for anything that might be related to a search toolbar or such. &nbsp;If shown in this list, it can help identify what it is and perhaps what company
 built it, so you can find the instruction manual on how to edit it.</li></ol>
