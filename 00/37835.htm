<h2>            Zipping files in Win 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to zip files in Win 10.&nbsp; The instructions I have found seem easy, but it does not work when the option is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do is highlight the folder I need to condense, send to, and then the only option that comes up is "Bluetooth".&nbsp; In all of the things I have read, there should be more options there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something in how my Win 10 is configured?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer Aspire Switch 10. After a recent clean install of Windows 10, no sound comes from my speakers and I cannot use my microphone. The device manager says everything is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Volume settings are high</p>
<p>- My speakers are enabled as the default (and only) playback device</p>
<p>- My microphone is the default (and only) recording device</p>
<p>- I have reinstalled every possible driver and according to my manufacturer and the Intel driver utility, I have all the latest drivers installed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do. Please help!</p>

            Hi aptop505. please try this, hopefully it will resolve your audio problems . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot 
<br />
<br />Run both these Troubleshooters:
<br />
<br />Playing Audio
<br />
<br />Recording Audio

            I ran both troubleshooters. The recording audio troubleshooter couldn't detect any problems, and the playing audio troubleshooter didn't seem to detect any, either. The playing audio troubleshooter also doesn't help after I don't hear the test sounds--it
 doesn't make a difference if I tell it to re-install current drivers or find new ones.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience you are facing. I will certainly help you with this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to know few more details on the below questions to understand the issue better.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Did you try to upgrade to Windows 10 via Windows Update or an Installation Media?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you able to access the desktop by any chance?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If able to login, please try the below steps and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Clean boot the system.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>-Hit CTRL + ALT + DEL at Black Screen&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-From the Task Manager go to File &gt; New and launch MSCONFIG</span></p>
<p><span>-Perform a Clean Boot via MSCONFIG. Refer to the following link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></em></strong></a>
</p>
<p><em>[Steps for Windows 8.1 hold for Windows 10 systems]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Disable the Video Driver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>-Hit CTRL + ALT + DEL</span></p>
<p><span>-From Task Manager go NEW &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type&nbsp;<em><strong>devmgmt.msc </strong></em>and hit ENTER</span></p>
<p><span>-Snap Open the Display Adapters Tab&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-Right Click the Video Card and Choose <strong>Disable</strong></span></p>
<p><span>-Reboot the system and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: Try low resolution mode</span></strong></p>
<p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do so. If you
 don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>" to start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then boot in <strong>low resolution mode</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for providing a detailed information on the issue, I understand that you are getting a black screen on a second monitor. I will certainly help you with this issue. This issue might occurs due to display drivers or incorrect settings.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You may access the link below and <span>follow the steps to setup dual monitor on your laptop</span><strong>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, follow method 2</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Uninstall and reinstall display adaptor</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the above method does not help, the display driver might be corrupted. Let’s try uninstalling and reinstalling the latest drivers from manufacturer’s website.</span></span></p>
<p>

    <title>Microphone is too sensitive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microphone is too sensitive</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having some issues with the sensitivity of my microphone. When I am using skype or any other speech program for that matter my friends complain that they hear a "helicopter" sound when I am not talking. Which is ofcourse my desktop buzzing. Whenever
 I make a loud noise it will go away. Now I have found a way to make it less sensitive but Windows 10 resets is every single time sometimes it even fights me with the slider. I do this in the sound settings then properties of microphone then levels then microphone.
 I tried with friends and sliding it down to 75-80 will make the sound go away but my voice is still loud enough to hear. Now it will just jump back in a random amount of time. Sometimes even right after I adjust it</p>
<p>So does anyone have a solution for me to make these settings final?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your options.</p>
<p>I tried method 1 and method 2. Troubleshooter doesn't find a problem and there is nog driver update because it is up to dat.</p>
<p>Method 3 is what I am doing manually every time. Only I am sliding it down not up because it needs to be less sensitive.</p>
<p>The problem still persists and windows very casually slides the slider back up to 100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is maybe interesting to note is that whenever I open sound, properties etc. And I adjust the sliders it will not let me apply it. Only the buttons ok and cancel can be clicked. Apply is unclickable.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade says my Dell Latitude E6520 is Upgradable but it&#39;s on the list</h2>
                    I guess the title says it all. It's a Dell Latitude E6520 with Win 7 Pro. The Win 10 Update App said that upgrade would be OK though this model is not on the tested-Dell-Models list.

            <p>I have upgraded two E6520s from Windows 7, 64 bit to Windows 10 - both were done from the upgrade icon on the toolbar.</p>
<p>Both work fine but initially have a tendency to exhibit high disk usage but it goes away after a couple of days; I have seen online speculation that this is caused by Windows 10 re-indexing the drives.</p>
<p>Both E6520s have Nvidia NVS 4200M graphics cards, one (which was a clean-ish Windows 7 install) seems to have upgraded with no graphics issues but the other - a much used laptop with a lot of software installed - had a flashing screen problem after the install
 which was fixed by following the advice here&nbsp;http://techdows.com/2015/08/fix-screen-flashing-issue-in-windows-10.html&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this the second E6520 would boot up but would take 4 minutes to do so and a whole minute of that was a back screen that you can move the cursor around on, the fix for that issue ended up being to disable the Nvidia card in device manager, shut down
 and restart, re enable the video card, and then install new drivers. &nbsp;The instruction on doing this are here&nbsp;http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/software/operating-systems/1403760/how-to-fix-the-windows-10-slow-boot-bug and the driver that's now shown against my
 Nvidia NVS 4200M is dated 9/10/2015 and is vn 10.18.13.5413</p>
<p>All seems well now.</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Final option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

            No need to buy a new PC for a Software issue.
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

 10 all clean on my laptop!</em></span><br />
<br />
Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I hope this is the right place to ask this question. If not, could a mod please move this thread to the correct category?<br />
<br />
A few days ago I <strong>upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Home</strong> through the regular 'upgrade queue'. Everything just fine. My Windows 7 was getting kind of sluggish so my plan was to upgrade to Windows 10, then back up all my data and then do a
 'clean install'.<br />
<br />
So, I backed up all my files manually (just click and drag), nothing special, on an external hard &nbsp;drive. Then I went to
<em>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery &gt; Reset this PC</em> (I believe this options is called
<strong>Push-Button-Reset</strong>). After choosing to keep my data but no apps, it started preparing me for the reset. After seeing the big list of software that Windows would delete by doing the reset (it kind of asked for a final confirmation) I decided
 not to go with it, since I still have some important school software I was not quite sure about. I had to make sure I could use this software again after the reset. I wanted to back up my data better.<br />
<br />
So, I bought another external harddrive just to be sure (other one was full) and made a
<strong>System Image</strong> through&nbsp;<em>Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Backup and Restore</em>. I did this to make sure I had something to fall back to in case everything failed. So, after a few hours, the System Image was complete.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Back again to the Push Reset function in Windows 10. Again, off to&nbsp;<em>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery &gt; Reset this PC&nbsp;</em>and choosing the&nbsp;<strong>Keep my Files&nbsp;</strong>option. This time, after preparing for a short while, I get a pop-up that says
 '<strong>Could not find the recovery environment - Insert your Windows installation or recovery media, and restart your PC with the media</strong>'. This pop-up shows up both by choosing
<strong>Keep my Files</strong> or <strong>Remove Everything</strong>.<br />
<br />
So, what does this mean? The Recovery option seemed to work before making the System Image. Does the System Image somehow delete the recovery environment? Right now I am creating a
<strong>bootable USB</strong> through <strong>Media Creation Tool</strong>, but I am not quite sure how to use it once it's done. Can I kind of 'factory' reset my PC through a USB? But keeping all the hardware drivers and such, and personal files?<br />
<br />

                    Not entirely on like waiting on the dashboard but on as in sleep mode, I call it that because when you press the power button on the Xbox, it puts it like into a sleep mode. I need to know because I need to download a lot of stuff in a short period of
 time, thx

            <p>Hi, Esteban,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaving your XBox on for extended periods of time will not break the console itself. But it is not suggested that you leave it on for too long. If you are not able to check on the console while it is running then you run the risk of the console overheating,
 which can cause damage to the system. It is okay to do this every once and a while but running the system for extended periods of time will, over time, lower the life of the system.
<br />
<br />
Actually if you leave it on it won't damage your whole system but it will burn out your drive to where you can't use it. When the xbox is running and you have a disc in it the lens will get hot and eventually it will over heat and melt. Worst you can get the
 red ring of death.</p>

<p>Hi, I hate wireless controllers!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I use the xbox one wired controller <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
for</span> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PC</span> for my xbox one console? I know I can get the kit to "wire" my controller&nbsp;which I have done but it broke and will not work anymore and I'm not going to buy another.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the xbox one controllers from
 other makers "authorized" for use on the xbox one console? And is there any plans to make a "hard wired" controller?&nbsp;</p>

<p>From what I could understand when i read an article on pcgamer.com the PC xbox one controller is exactly the same as the xbox one controller only that it comes packaged with a micro USB cable in the box.. As far as I know if you want to use your Xbox one
 controller wired instad of wireless all you need is an standard compatible usb cable with a micro usb plug on the end to go into the controller.. you don't have to buy a play &amp; charge kit to use it as a wired controller..</p>

 the computer for more.&nbsp; I keep getting the message stating i need to make more room for the update or attach an external drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;I need 10GB and I only have 6GB of apps and programs and several MB of files, but the restricted part of my HD is too large to
 clean sufficient space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connected a 16GB thumb drive and even though it has sufficient space I get the message that i need to free up almost 5GB of space on the C: drive.</p>

<br />You can free space on your hard drive by using "Disk Cleanup" or by deleting temporary files. Check these links, I hope it helps.

<p>I did the disk cleanup and deleted temporary files (both through the file folders and automatic cleanup way)<br />
</p>
<p>the part that is throwing me off the most is the updater saying i need 10 GB, me providing 12GB useful on a thumb drive and then the updater still insisting i clean up 4.87GB on C:</p>

<p>Does the last article (ISO file) contain the updates?&nbsp; It looked like it was more geared toward upgrading from a previous version.&nbsp; when I started looking into downloading the upgrade it shows a step (screen shots in the article)&nbsp;that asks if you want to
 automatically download the updates.&nbsp; I am concerned I will run into the same space issue and get stuck mid update again.&nbsp; Is there somewhere i can download the update file itself to portable storage and install it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>is the spring/fall creator name just what MS chose or does that imply only an update to part of WIN10 and not the whole OS?</p>

            Run it from cmd or from Run. I mean - read each item to determine do you want to delete it, not just select all. ;) May be you need to download some files again after inaccurate deleting.

<p>After doing all of the above to clean space i still get the error.&nbsp; it looks like there is no amount of space sufficient without removing pieces of the OS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to force the download to removable media and not worry about disk size?&nbsp; why would MS make an OS designed for tablets that needs more space than the standard tablet...makes no sense.</p>

<h2>            Pre-installed Windows 7 home product key</h2>
                    Hello, I bought a&nbsp; laptop with a pre-installed windows 7 home premium. I used a third party program to find out my product key. If I acquired a CD from a friend could I use my product key to install it on a laptop that my brother got a year ago and give
 it to my mom(he has a new one now).

            <p>You can't do that, you are using an OEM license, it is tied to your computer and cannot be used on another computer.</p>
<p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p><strong>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</strong></p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system
</p>
<p>OEM licenses are to be installed by professional system manufacturers only. Under Microsoft's OEM License Agreement, they are not to be sold to end-users under any circumstance, and are to be preinstalled on a computer using the OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK)
 before shipment to the customer, and must include at the very least the manufacturer's support contact information. They are, therefore, designed for installation only on a single computer and are not transferable, even if the original computer is no longer
 in use. This is not usually an issue for users who purchase new computer systems, because most pre-assembled systems ship with a preinstalled operating system. There are few circumstances where Microsoft will allow the transfer of an OEM license from one non-functioning
 system to another, but the OEM System Builder License Agreement (SBLA), as well as the OEM End User License Agreement (EULA) do not contain any allowance for this, so it is entirely up to Microsoft's discretion, depending on the situation</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en/licensing/sblicensing/pages/licensing_for_hobbyists.aspx</p>
<p>There are two types of OEM vendors. Royalty OEM vendors can distribute Windows products by using System-Locked Preinstallation (SLP) Product Keys so that end users can bypass product activations. All other OEM vendors distribute Windows products by using
 the standard Product Keys that require the user to activate the Windows products.</p>

<h3> outpost_cx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot, repair, recover or reinstall</h2>
                    <p>One of my Windows 10 desktops died the other day - I think during an update. I've run into a BSOD on and off with no clear resolution to be found. I suspect it happened during an update and killed it mid-process. I've recovered some of the files and can
 see what appear to be healthy partitions. I've tried running chkdsk /f and chkdsk /r /x. The computer restarts part way through. I've tried booting from a Win 10 DVD and running repair tools. I've tried restoring to recent system restore points. I've tried
 resetting the PC. All of them get part way through, then the system restarts. I've used Paragon Disk Manager v16 Advanced to view the partitions, do a surface scan, and run chkdsk. They show no problems with the drive. All complete successfully using the Paragon
 software, but it still won't boot up. There are two recovery partitions, two system reserved partitions and the actual OS partition. I've tried Paragon's boot repair software, which supposedly completes successfully, but it still won't boot. The most frustrating
 part came tonight when I tried to do a clean install of Windows and it told me that Windows couldn't be installed on ANY of the partitions. Worse yet: I have no license key because this was the free Win 10 upgrade from 8.1! If I reformat the hard drive, my
 license info goes away with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my license key, wipe the drive and cut my losses by starting over? Aside from that nuclear option, is there anything else I can try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and I checked the thing with Windows Defender. Multiple times. Nada.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue that started during the update might be caused by corrupted system files. Meanwhile, when you upgrade from Windows 8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade, your computer gets a digital entitlement which is stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. You can proceed on reinstalling Windows 10 because it will automatically reactivate. For your reference, check this
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/901ebde8-6a24-4dd4-bd97-87512c7b264d/how-to-reinstall-windows-10-after-free-upgrade?forum=win10itprosetup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">thread</a></strong> on how to reinstall Windows 10.
 We recommend that you follow the steps under this section: <strong>RE : how can one re-install windows 10 after the free upgrade?</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have other concern.</p>

<p>Thank you, Gerard! I appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using Win 10 boot media to reinstall from scratch. Install chugs away for a while then shows me a list of partitions on my hard drive. No matter which I select, Windows can't be installed because they're GPT partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried running chkdsk /r /x as suggested in another post. That seemed to run without any problems, but when I restarted I eventually got a blue screen with error 0xC0000021a.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point it's looking like I need to completely reformat the disk and reinstall Windows from the boot media. Is that the next step? I've recovered my data - which is all still accessible.</p>

            <p>A method to try and remove Windows 8.1 updates requests, came from 'A new method' link.</p>
<p>This involved trying to remove 2 program updates, KB2871389 and KB3008273.</p>
<p>Windows allowed removal of the latter, but not the former.</p>
<p>So now l still get &nbsp;requests to update to Windows 8.1, but with the proviso to 'Remind me later'.</p>
<p>Problem has been partially solved.</p>
<p>Windows made the biggest stupid mistake to change the format from Windows 7 to Windows 8.</p>
<p>Windows 8 is a very poorly designed format.</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 was designed to re-format similar to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Why change something that worked well?&nbsp;</p>

                    Having troubles re-installing H&amp;R Block At Home 2009. Keep getting error code 1935 and a long string of code. Talked to the folks at H&amp;R Block, they had me create another admin account and reload the software. Still no luck. They suggested I try this site
 to see if any help is available. The program did work for about two weeks, then I got a "side-by-side" error when I tried to run the program. I uninstalled the program and have not been able to reinstall it since. Any help would be appreciated.

            I gave up and called H&amp;R Block for a refund. Installed Turbo Tax and it is running fine. They didn't seem too upset that I was calling to get my money back. They probably have a lot of other issues with the software and refunding your money is probably
 the easier solution. Guess they don't mind losing a loyal customer for the last 7 years&nbsp;either. Their loss!

2) Have you set the correct sound device? Click Start, type: sound. Then click Sound under Control Panel. Then set the default sound device.<br />
<br />
<br />
More options:<br />
<br />
3) Is the sound device disabled?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Right-click the speaker icon on your taskbar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Select "Playback Devices"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. In the white empty space right click and select both Show Disconnected/Disabled Devices<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Do you see icons for your speakers and headphones now?&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E. If you now see it you may need to right click on the correct sound device and select "Set as default device"<br />
<br />
4) You can also try the troubleshooter below to discover any connection issues that may exist, instructions are below:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Click 'Start' &gt; Select 'Control Panel'<br />

            Hey Lincoln,
<br />
<br /> firstly if you have anything running as an anti-virus other than Windows Defender, uninstall it. Especially Comodo as it's known to cause issues with that game
<br />
<br />Secondly, there are solutions to this on the forza horizon 3 forums here that may help. It is the top reply: <a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_postsm735993_-Solution--Game-stops-loading-at-Splash-Screen--Windows-10.aspx#post_735993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_posts...</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know if that fixes the issue. Thank you!

            If you don't see it under the Settings app in the Devices section on the left, then it's probably that you need to go to the manufacturer's website and download the bluetooth driver.

    <title>converted to a Xbox from a PS3 and got tips - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deerlover1  say:</h3>
<h2>            converted to a Xbox from a PS3 and got tips</h2>
                    
<p>hello, i'm a new Xbox 360 owner after a few months of dealing with the instability of a Playstation 3 Slim (got a fat recently that works *better* but am still using the Xbox daily and only use the PS3 fat for exclusives to the console) and i got two so
 far and plan on getting at third one (loving it so much i want all my rooms to have one) and i did have one go RRoD but i got tips to avoid that too, as it was user error on my part</p>
<p>I have found that my Xbox 360 (one's a 360 S and another's an older fat one with white casing) is relatively reliable and runs pretty cool (tons cooler than my PS3 ever did) so the claims of overheating are greatly exaggerated or i have not gamed enough
 to kill it yet. but i do have a few things to FYI about since most of them are not covered in any article i have read about the RRoD or its causes.</p>
<p>While watching Netflix (my primary use so far until i save the $$$ for some good games) for over a few hours on end, i have sometimes dealt with the white circle of rebuffer (video stops to rebuffer with a percentage in the spinning circle) and i used to
 simply power off the unit from the front panel button and turn it right back on to reboot it, thus fixing whatever caused this rebuffer loop (where the percentage stops and never goes any farther) and figured my HDD got locked up or the unit just froze. unfortunately
 i was greeted one day by one red ring and an E 74 message after turning it back on, and at the time i was unaware my PSU was giving the glowing red LED. so stupid me took my Xbox apart and reseated the heat sinks assuming it overheated (buying that lie online,
 and it was not that hot really). when i turned it back on after it did work for ten more minutes before throwing the three red rings of death and no video. shortly after i turned it off, and then it was dead. as in nothing happened when i tried turning it
 back on at all. PSU led still red. so...i assume if you try turning your unit off and back on that way, and not going back to the dashboard and shutting it down in settings, it kills the power brick or something inside the console. or it somehow corrupts the
 firmware to an unusable state. either way i killed it and had to buy another one. :( but i learned something. i assume the actual operating system is not stored on the hard disk as it is designed to be swapped out easily enough, and is stored on a NAND type
 memory. if the PSU was not the original problem my improper shutdowns were slowly corrupting the NAND memory and eventually fried it. possibly causing E 74 followed by the completely dead console that is now just for parts. still love it though and learned
 something--most RRoD scenarios, much like YLoD on PS3 are caused by user error, abuse or bad care. so fanboys can take their claims and shove it. i love my Xbox and while i use my PS3 on a *limited* basis, it surprises me that Sony cannot make a console that
 is more reliable than Windows ME</p>

<p>EDIT: to consolidate this into one thread i will add this here. the power brick has a status LED when it is in use, and when your console is on, it should always be green only. if it is orange, flashing orange, or even red while your console is on and in
 operation, it means there is a problem in the power supply or the outlet itself or you have too many things running on a current tap. if you get &nbsp;the three-red ring of death, check your power supply LED. i will bet it is orange or even red. meaning faulty
 power brick. try another power brick from a known working Xbox like from a friend or if you got two, try your good Xbox PSU and see if it works. i lost one Xbox 360 due to the three-red ring of death followed by a completely dead console (the PSU failed and
 took the console with it). for the longest time i figured red was just the color of the power supply LED, until it failed and as i was checking, discovered the color chart in fine print under the power brick itself. i had a weak and/or failing supply and when
 i turned my Xbox off and right back on in an effort to reboot it after resetting my router, it killed it. i am unsure of everyone but my replacement Xbox has a power brick LED that is green all the time, on or off. i suspect that is proper, although my slim,
 and it may be slim specific, has one that is orange when off and green while on. i would recommend checking your power supply light regularly</p>

<p>That's true for all consoles this generation. Both my fat PS3 and my fat 360 throw off an absurd amount of heat. I haven't had problems with either yet, but&nbsp;plenty of&nbsp;space and ventilation are a must.</p>

<p>my fat 360 is pretty cool but i got it in an open cabinet next to an open window and currently use it for Netflix and that's it. perhaps when i game it will change.
</p>
<p>the slim PS3 had a puny little fan in it and they eliminated half the vents and the only air it was getting was coming from the same vents it was pulling heat out with, making most of the air intake already heated air, reducing cooling capacity and causing
 tons of game lags, false DNS errors, disconnects from PSN and ultimately, a frozen XMB or game.
</p>
<p>on my fat though, i am unsure the number of fans, but it has the ability to go a lot faster speed wise (rpm of fan/fans is much higher than the slim's) and there are vents all over the thing. still not as stable as my Xbox but it is *better*. my slim when
 i traded it in for the fat actually froze in-store while they were testing a CoD game in it. plus there are plenty of Youtube videos showing more slims getting YLoD than the fats. and the slim has not been out as long. the lifespan seems to be 1-2 years max.
 most fats died after 6 or 7 years</p>
