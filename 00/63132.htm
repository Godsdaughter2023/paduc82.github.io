    <title>Windows 8.1 Windows Update stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andycroft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Windows Update stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I have worked my way through all of the suggestions and wiki that I can find on this site including the excellent one at
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_update">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_update</a> but my problems still exist and indeed are slightly worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I have been having intermittent problems with Windows Update for a couple of months but until this month running the Fix-It once or twice allowed all updates to go in. Currently I have 12 important
 and 1 advisory update to go into the system. The Fix-it usually indicating that it had fixed something but on occasions stating it hadn’t and suggesting a generic link to obtain additional support but without giving any sort of diagnostic report which is most
 frustrating.</span></p>
<p>Event Viewer indicates that all of the updates have been downloaded onto my PC, however, when I try and install them during Shutdown, the window pops up to say that the updates are being installed and when left long enough the
 machine shuts itself down without having installed the patches. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have turned F-Protection (uses Windows firewall,) off whilst trying the various things recommended but it makes no difference. The previous protection was provided by AVG.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have run SFC /Scannow and DISM a few times with no faults being reported on most occasions although DISM did say it had done repairs the last time I ran it, the subsequent run of SFC found no problem..</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried only selecting one update (when I could list them,) at a time but no difference over selecting all.</span></p>
<p><span>Having worked through all of the suggestion on the answer
</span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058?wa=wsignin1.0</a></span></p><span>
 I am now in a situation whereby any attempt to run Windows Update produces the error message "Windows Update can't check for updates because the service is not running. You may need to restart your PC." I have&nbsp;restarted my PC and the same message appears.
 &nbsp;Looking in Services.msc, Windows Update is not listed as an option. </span>
<p>When I tried "net start wuauserv" it comes up with System error 5. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at wuaueng.dll gives version 9.9.9600.17489 dated 14/11/2014 07:10. (UK date format)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions please? I do have log in Word with a lot more details on the investigation so far.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Andy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the reply. I appreciate your efforts to resolve this issue, I will surely help you to resolve Windows Update issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Conflict between third party applications.</span></li><li><span>Virus.</span></li><li><span>Corrupt User Account.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Try the steps listed here:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:<br />
</span></strong><span>I suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and check if it helps.
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong><span>

<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, follow the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link
 to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove virus, spyware, and other malicious software.

<strong>2) </strong>If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
If the issue persists, I suggest you to check if the issue occurs on a new User Account or not.</p>

            <div>Thank you for your help, it is much appreciated.</div>
<div>I have tried all of the suggested solutions below but to no avail: I still get the following error message when I event try to check what updates are required or have been installed for example it produces the following error: "Windows Update can't check
 for updates because the service is not running. You may need to restart your machine."</div>
<div>​</div>
<div>
<p>Needless to say I have restarted the machine many times and it makes no difference whatsoever. I cannot find out what service is not running. However, if<em>&nbsp;</em>I try to manually start wuauserv which I think is the appropriate one, using the command "net
 start wuauserv" in Admin mode of Command Processor it produces the error: " System error 5 has occurred."</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>As I indicated I tried all of your suggestions including the new account, none of them made any difference, indeed the System error 5 above was detailed from the new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I &nbsp;have tried to find wuauserv in Windows in case it was stuck with the wrong security setting but I cannot find it which makes me think it is embedded within a DLL.</p>

</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I suggest you to disable antivirus software temporarily and check if you can start the Windows Update service.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<br />
1) Please make sure to re-enable Antivirus software after troubleshooting steps.<br />
2) Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable or uninstall it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled or uninstalled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            <p>I have been around the loop again of trying SFC and DISM, the latter stating that it had repaired something. I then tried to tun Windows Update only to be told that the service was not running so I ran the Fit-It. This indicated that it had repaired somethings
 but that there was still a fault, code&nbsp;0x80070005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then looked on Microsoft Support which took me <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/968003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here&nbsp;</a>, This tells you to install SubInAcl along with the relevant instructions... only it does not install! Since it does not install I cannot follow the rest of the instructions. Frustration!&nbsp;</p>

            What happens when you install SubInACL? I think that you're just supposed to copy the exe into the System32 folder. (you can extract the exe from the msi with 7zip)

            <p>I cannot install SubInACL. While you can copy the .exe into the right place, it does not set it up in the Registry unless you use the install program... the one that isn't working! That is part of the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good thought though and I have tried it as you will gather.</p>

<h3> canonymous  say:</h3>
<h2>            Since the Win 10 update, my computer can&#39;t find my printer&#58; Error code 0x00000002</h2>
                    <p>Everything was working fine until the most recent Win 10 update. Now my printer can't be found and forums are directing me to "right click 'computer' to access print spool" My search tool cannot find "print spool" and since the solution was written for Win
 7, there's nowhere on "start" or in "Control Panel" which gets me to the print spool. Please help. I've begun considering no longer allowing Windows to update because every time it does, I lose an hour or more of productivity figuring out how to get my basic
 functions (like this and wifi network adapter) working again.</p>

<h2>            Just installed Windows 7 &#40;64-bit&#41; - Explorer.exe isn&#39;t starting up&#33;&#63; - Blank desktop&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I've just reformatted my computer from Windows Vista to Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit, and I can't get Explorer.exe running. All I see is the desktop theme (the windows logo with a blue background). When I hit Ctrl+Alt+Dlt, I can hear it go into that mode where
 you choose to "Switch Accounts", "Log off", "Task Manager", etc. but the screen is completely blank.<br />
<br />
I've been looking into this, and it seems as if the only people that get this problem are the ones that have Nvidia video cards, as I do. I know it's the video card causing this problem because when I disable it in Safe Mode and reboot into normal mode, the
 desktop appears perfectly.<br />
<br />
Here's what I've tried:<br />
<br />
1) Went into safe mode<br />
2) Disabled the video card, restarted computer<br />
3) Went back into normal mode to update the Nvidia video card<br />
4) Restarted<br />
5) Computer reaches desktop, but explorer.exe hasn't started, so no icons, start menu, etc. can be seen<br />
<br />
I've also tried going into the registry to do this:<br />
<br />
Go to the following in the registry editor:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\… NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon.<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
In Winlogon, on the right side, there should be a value called "Shell".<br />
Double click this value. Make sure only 'Explorer.exe' is the value of Shell, if anything else is there , simply delete it and leave 'Explorer.exe' .<br />
Restart the computer for the changes to take effect.<br />
<br />

<br />
This has not worked for me either.<br />
<br />
I know I can solve this by getting a new graphics card, but I'd rather not do that. I like the one I currently have, the Nvidia GeForce 8600 GS.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what I can do at this point? I don't know what the problem is. All I know is that explorer.exe isn't starting up, and that only computers using an Nvidia video card get this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.

            I wonder consider updating your motherboard chipset drivers along with the BIOS.<br />
<br />
Have you tried Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit to see if the problem is not specific to 64 bit?
<br />
<br />
Its possibly a drive issue with Windows 7 64 bit in particular and your video card.<br />
<br />
You could also try reinstalling Windows 7 64 bit, make sure all non-essential devices are disconnected and if it corrects the problem.
<br />
<br />
Try this in Normal mode.<br />
<br />
Press CTRL + SHIFT + ESC <br />
<br />
Click File &gt; New Task (Run)<br />
<br />
In the Run dialog, type: explorer.exe <br />
<br />
See if it starts Explorer<br />

<h2>            Have to buy Mass Effect DLC Bring Down the Sky Again&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Having been one of the people who had been having trouble this past week and a half playing a backwards compatible game on their new Xbox One, I was thrilled when MS rolled out a fix. However, I now have a new problem. I can't download the DLC Bring Down
 the Sky for Mass Effect without paying for it again. While this DLC only costs a dollar, I am concerned that if Mass Effect 2 and 3 is made backwards compatible (hopefully soon), I will have to pay for those DLCs again..and some of them were considerably more
 than a dollar. Everything I read says that the DLCs I buy on the Xbox 360 will be available to download for free on the Xbox One so long as I use the same gamertag (which I have been using since the original Xbox). So what gives? Is there a fix for this?</p>

<h2>            Critical_Structure_Corruption memory dump</h2>
                    <p>After updating an HP Envy Desktop referenced <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/dism-fails-to-fix-corruption-with-0x800f081f-error/bcf2e834-d550-4887-bc4e-2d5a28f89cd7">
here</a>, the PC was running fine with clean reports from dism. This morning there was a Critical_Structure_Corruption error. The memory dump can be found at:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me if there is any definitive information to point to the culprit in the first dump file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The second memory dump was after a "Kmode exception not handled ntfs.sys" error according to the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have updated over a dozen drivers and eliminated as many startup programs and services as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for the replies. Yesterday I completed updates of over a dozen drivers using the HP Support Assistant. I know this included the graphics drivers (which I believe might be the primary suspect), the entire intel chipset. I believe it also
 included the SATA drivers. I also updated the BIOS and shutdown some startup applications and services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, so good. No errors or problems since around 1:30 pm EDT yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep an eye on things, do some health checkups, and report back if there are any developments.</p>

<h2>            How Do I Change a Wired Connection Profile</h2>
                    <p>In the Control Panel-Network Connections box the Ethernet interface is showing a wireless connection. How do I change the profile used for that connection. The correct profile already exists in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Profiles
 but isn't being used, it's deferring to one of the wireless profiles.</p>

<p>The priority order as listed by the netsh wlan command is correct. Right now I have a wired connection using a profile called weshomenet. When I connect a wifi adapter it looks like it's using the same profile rather than the first profile in the priority.</p>

            After further thought, it seems the instructions for changing the priority order applies to a computer with one network interface. Whatever I set the first profile to, both the ethernet and the wlan interfaces use that profile. I think the OS should at
 least be able to detect if a profile is in use and use the next profile. Better would be an interface that would use a defined profile to use.&nbsp;

<h2>            I have an issue with playing FIFA world cup 2006 on the computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original title : FIFA world cup 20006</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to play this game when I have earlier versions of Windows.<br />
<br />
Two years ago, I changed to Windows 7, and the game didn't work. <br />
It's all OK in the menus, but when I start a game, suddenly, all the screen turns white, and I can't see the players and the ball.<br />
The only one thing that I can see is the stars indicating the player with the ball.
<br />
<br />
Can you help me with this problem? I know that it's very, very old, but I really like it.
<br />
<br />

                    <p>Okay, trying to copy files to or from my 3TB Seagate drive in a SATA dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Tried multiple SATA docks</p>
<p>- Tried Windows scan/repair tool in explorer (it cannot repair the drive. log shows shadow copy provider had an error</p>
<p>- using various utilities (and Ubuntu's Gparted) shows the drive as 756gb instead of 3tb</p>
<p>- I can still access the files, but cannot copy them to another drive or copy files to the drive in question</p>
<p>- tried running chkdsk /f /r /x but after 2 hours it was at 140/7290 sectors. at that rate it will take weeks to scan</p>
<p>- even used Active Partition Recovery and it showed that the Copy Boot Sector was invalid. Copied the Primary Boot Sector to the Copy Boot Sector and all is showing in the green now...still no difference</p>
<p>- ran sfc /scannow and all system files are fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've spent an entire day working on this issue. I'm at my wit's end. What else is there left to do other than run a full CHKDSK which (on a 3tb drive) might take weeks??</p>

            <p>I will try this only if/when the disk scanning options are exhausted. I currently have Active Partition Recovery doing a complete disk scan and if that fails I'll try letting CHKDSK do it's whole (very long) thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an external USB drive, and it giving the same error on three different Windows 10 computers so I don't think it's the system itself. It's something with the GPT boot sector of the drive, but a simple Scan and Repair is not working (failing with the
 above mentioned error message about shadow copy provider)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions? The disk still shows up in Explorer, I can still access the files...but like I said most disk analyzing software is showing it as a 756gb disk with a 2.73tb partition (which is obviously some kind of filesystem issue). If I could copy
 files from it I'd just copy them onto another drive and then re-initialize it but I can't currently copy my files off of it so I'm not willing to do that.</p>

<h2>            Blue screen after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10, I used my computer for a couple of days, but then at some point reached the blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my computer won't even bring up the log on sreen. It keeps booting on a black (or dark grey) screen where I can move my mouse, but there is nothing to click on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every now and then a red screen with a circle of running dots is displayed, but after 5 seconds the black/grey screen is displayed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, the blue screen is displayed again with the messages BAD_POOL_HEADER or CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED (or something similar to that). And then the computer self-restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any kind of help, and right now the help would probably be hitting some kind of magic button so that my PC at least gives me the option to do something, because I haven't been able to try anything so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you a lot for reading!</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After going through the process I described above for about 40 times, the computer finally displayed a screen giving me the option to Reset my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do it, but the final result was: "There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only way out of this screen is by hitting Cancel.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player won&#39;t play cd but provides no error details</h2>
                    Windows 7 Windows Media Player 12 - previously would play music cd's (purchased retail, not burned) that I inserted into the BD/DVD/CD drive just fine.&nbsp; Now whenever I put in a cd it seems to read the cd info (album, artist, tracks) but when I attempt
 to play a track I see a red X.&nbsp; If I hover over the red X is see "Windows Media Player encountered an error.&nbsp; Click the icon for more information."&nbsp; When I click the icon I simply see a box that says "Error Details" and nothing more.&nbsp; How do I troubleshoot
 this error?

            <p>Thank you for the very detailed reply with multiple suggestions.</p>
<p>There were several known changes made to my computer since the last time I played a CD.&nbsp; These included some Windows updates (which were applied automatically during shutdowns), a Java update, an Adobe&nbsp;Flash update and perhaps others that I'm not aware of
 or don't recall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was a bit stumped by whether this was a hardware or software problem since Windows Media Player appeared to read at least a portion of the CD ok to obtain album and track info but could not play any of the tracks.&nbsp; Just prior to reading your suggestions
 I tried something to isolate whether this was a Windows Media Player issue or a CD drive issue.&nbsp; I opened iTunes which was already installed on my computer and previously used to play music stored on hard drive (but had never been used to play music directly
 from CD).&nbsp; I inserted one of the CDs which Windows Media Player could not play and iTunes played&nbsp;the CD&nbsp;just fine.&nbsp; I closed iTunes and reopened Windows Media Player and now it can play any CD fine in Windows Media Player.&nbsp; I am happy to say everything seems
 to work fine now, but I have no idea why the problem disappeared after using iTunes when I could re-create the problem at will before that trying to play any and all CDs with Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As one final test, I put in a known "damaged" music CD.&nbsp; It acts just like the previous problem - i.e. can read/display the album and track info but cannot play any track, shows the red X next to each track it tries to play, and when clicking on the red
 X opens a box which says "Error Details" and nothing more.&nbsp; It would be nice if it provided an error code or more descriptive message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your response.&nbsp; We can close this thread as my problem has mysteriously gone away.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Disk Partition Corrupted during Recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sharky69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Disk Partition Corrupted during Recovery</h2>
                    <p>Perhaps I can get a pointer in the right direction, I will try and keep it short.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Oct 14 my laptop seemed to be slow so I decided to do a roll-back with system restore, well it never recovered and went into a recovery loop I could not get out of. I thought I had made a recovery disk but apparently not, 2 weeks out of coverage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ordered the original recovery disk from HP, but being impatient and not wanting to wait I purchased a download program "Guaranteed to Fix" my pc. I have gone from&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2dd13d19-8940-40a0-9a91-b705db60a4c6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2dd13d19-8940-40a0-9a91-b705db60a4c6?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47ca6fce-7d74-42ae-aae1-3cab7416ba7a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47ca6fce-7d74-42ae-aae1-3cab7416ba7a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still get access to my disk drive but I now have multiple partitions and my "C" drive now shows as "E" and my recovery screens are non existant, the tool I bought seems to have re created all the partitions on my hard drive, can this be repaired using
 diskpart?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am dead in the water waiting for my "original recovery disks" from HP!</p>

<h2>            Installer has stopped working</h2>
                    So whenever I try to install any program, I get a general "Installer.exe has stopped working" error, APPCRASH event. Version.dll seems to be the fault.
<div>I have tried many things to fix it, including:</div>
<div>1. Running sfc</div>
<div>2. Restarting windows installer service</div>
<div>3. Running in safe mode</div>
<div>4. Unregistering and re-registering windows installer</div>
<div>5. Running without any startup programs and services but microsoft ones.</div>
<div>6. Running microsoft fixit (crashes the same like any other installer)</div>
<div>7.Installing the latest windows installer (update is not applicable on computer)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Absolutely nothing works. &nbsp;I remember I had this problem not long ago, and running sfc about 5 times in a row solved it, but that is no longer working.</div>
<div>If anyone can help me solve this, it would be appreciated.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you have used all methods to fix this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to repair Windows 7. Please use following article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It requires Windows 7 disk/media.</p>
<p><br />
Note: Performing a repair installation will not damage files and applications that are currently installed on your computer.&nbsp; However, I would suggest you to backup all the important data from the computer before performing in-place upgrade.<br />
Back up your files</p>

            <p>Hello Aled,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience and we understand the frustration when things don't go the way they supposed to. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To be able to assist you better, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you using a Microsoft Account or a Local User account?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do have any System Restore point set in Windows prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you check if the same issue occurs when you log in to Windows using a different Local Administrator user account?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you check if the date and time settings on your PC is set correct?&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check for the latest updates in Windows 10 which helps the PC&nbsp;to make optimal&nbsp;use of Windows 10 capabilities as well as fixing&nbsp;any missing&nbsp;links in performance of the operating system.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To check for updates now, go to <strong><span>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update,</span></strong> and select
<strong><span>Check for updates.</span></strong> If Windows Update says that your PC is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;follow the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party application/software to be causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A <strong><span>clean boot</span></strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Disclaimer:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal
 startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also,&nbsp;verify that you have disabled any other&nbsp;third party real-time antimalware products that were installed on your PC, to check if any how incoming/outgoing connections to the PC are affected by the firewall.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.
</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to check if the status of the Windows Store Services&nbsp;is started and set as automatic.</p>
<p>1. Tab on <strong>Win+R, </strong>to open Run Command.</p>
<p>2. In the dialog box, type <strong>services.msc</strong></p>
<p>3. Here locate <strong>Windows Store Services</strong>, double click to open it.</p>
<p>4. Once&nbsp; done, click on the <strong>Start</strong> button and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, refer to the below link to&nbsp;run the <span><span><strong>Troubleshooter for Windows 10 apps</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, run the Microsoft Account troubleshooter from the below which automatically resolves sync issues in Windows.</p>
<p>Ref: <span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/sign-up-create-account-cant-450-LEFKPM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/sign-up-create-account-cant-450-LEFKPM</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
Check if proxy connection is enabled. If yes, then disable the proxy connection and check the status.
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to disable proxy:<br />
a. Open Internet Explorer.<br />
b. Click <strong>Tools </strong>and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.<br />
c. Click on the <strong>Connections </strong>tab.<br />
d. Click on the <strong>LAN Settings </strong>button.<br />
e. Then uncheck the option <strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN</strong>.<br />
f. Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>Internal hard drive(s). My Western Digital 500GB Sata drive will get lost within 10-15 minutes after boot. Also every once in a while my other SSD drive (Intel X25-M G2 80GB) is lost too! When the symptoms started (instantly after installing Windows 7) I
 used to see the drive in device manager, and in computer management as having RAW partition(s), but lately I don't see the drives in the device manager at all. When they are usable, they seem to work just fine, and error-checking finds nothing wrong in them.
 When I double-boot into Vista, the drives work normally.</p>
<p>I have tried the suggested solutions, updated chipset drivers, made sure cables are firmly in place.</p>
<p>Event viewer shows up with these lines:</p>
<p>(Disk) The device, \Device\Harddisk2\DR2, is not ready for access yet.</p>
<p>(atapi) The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Ide\IdePort3.</p>
<p>These were just my specs, if you will look into the other "answered" thread you will find more cases.</p>
<p>Now, will you please let us know that you have escalated the issue further and provide us the bug/article ID so we can follow the progress.</p>

<p>Well, this is discouraging. The other thread is marked answered, yet it shows activity through May - August, few days ago, yet I certainly see no answer.&nbsp; This thread marked unanswered shows no activity since April.&nbsp; I would like to add to the collecting
 requests to look at the issue of Win7 losing 2nd internal Drives.&nbsp; This was also posted on the other thread marked Answered.</p>
<p>I've got a 3 mo old Dell XPS900 loaded, with win7 x64 HP, a 1.5 TB boot drive Segate, and 2nd WD 2TB Drive which is fine, came from a 1 year old XP Box (which btw, never lost that same drive).&nbsp; Win7 Device Manager, or Disk Manager has been intermittently
 losing my 2nd HDD since day 1.&nbsp; It's not that much of an annoyance.&nbsp; At first, I could simply go to Device Manager &gt; Scan For New Hardware, and there it was, but that has now stopped working.&nbsp; A reboot is required to bring it back, then the drive stays there,
 until Win7 decides to lose it again, sometimes in the middle of a file transfer.&nbsp; Sometimes I can evoke the problem by pluging in a USB Drive.&nbsp; The Drive, cable, PSU, chipset, are all fine, updated, and this is a very new Box.&nbsp; I've run complete diagnostics
 on all the hardware, it's in perfect shape.&nbsp; In fact my 2nd HDD Smart data gets a better rating than my boot drive, which is never lost.&nbsp; There are no other common variables that I can see, no specific software, time of day, anything in common that I can see
 is in motion when the 2nd HDD is lost.&nbsp; Sometimes, I'll just be calling up Win Explorer, and it seems to hang a little like trying to read, then fails to show the 2nd HDD.<br />
<br />
Once I'm booted, I can plug in all my USB drives 3 x250 GB, and 1 x2TB, USB externals, but if I leave any of those USB externals plugged in at boot, then my 2nd Internal HDD most likely will never show up.&nbsp; Not a hardware problem, all that hardware worked fine
 in XP.<br />
<br />
That 2nd HDD is plugged directly into the Mboard, with separate power supply cord.&nbsp; BIOS sees it fine. BIOS is updated and current as of release, about a month ago.<br />
<br />
It is not a Hard Drive issue, it is a OS issue. Reboot, and the drive reappears in win explorer.&nbsp; When it disappears it is it missing from Device Manager, Scan for Hardware doesn't reclaim it, and it is totally missing from Disk Management.<br />
<br />
I'm actually extremely pleased with Windoze 7, it's extremely stable, with serious multitasking, I have not been able to crash it one time, of course my hardware is cutting edge, but it handles all my hardware power very well.&nbsp; It's just a little annoying to
 lose your HDD in the middle of a file transfer. And it happens so unpredictably and intermittently, the box will run for 3 days, with 2 internal drives, 4 USB externals, 1 other PC mapped, and 2 laptops mapped.&nbsp; Then just outta' nowhere, 2nd HDD disappears
 from Disk Manager. Nothing out of the ordinary happening on the box, no backups running, no scans running, no big settings being messed with, no software installs.&nbsp; It's fine one minute, then it disappears, under very normal conditions.<br />

<p>Thanks Chris,</p>
<p>The drive that is getting lost is a Western Digital Caviar Green WD20EADS (2 TB). Wester Digital, WDC WD20EADS-00R6B0, 2000.3 GB. Firmware 01.00A01, Serial ATA, SATA/300 Drive, Buffer Size, 32767 KB, SMART, 48 bit LBA.</p>
<p>The Drive was originally formatted by Vista x64, SP2, Disk Manager as GPT disk, then later removed from that machine and placed in a new Dell XPS9000, Win7 x64.&nbsp; When Vista Disk Manager partitioned the Drive (1 partition), I noticed a 128 MB section at the
 front of the disk (.. protective MBR for the GPT formatting ?? ..), which worked fine with Vista x64 SP2.</p>
<p>My latest move was to completely repartition the Drive using the Win7 x64 Drive Manager into 2 partitions, wiping out all earlier partitions, even the 128 MB unallocated partition that Vista put there.&nbsp; I completely re-formatted (long format) both partitions,
 left it as GPT Drive, and Win7 never put the 128 MB unallocated section at front of Disk.&nbsp; I haven't had it disappear since making those changes.</p>
<p>Not sure that fixed the issue, so if it disappears again, I'll post new message.&nbsp; If it doesn't then maybe that will be useful for those experiencing losing the drive.&nbsp; Again, my issue was not the one where a large SATA drive is winding up after sleep, hybernation,
 or shut down.&nbsp; Mine was disappearing sometimes in the middle of active file transfer, and I don't have any hibernation, sleep, or drive shut down setting in my configs.</p>
<p>Actually, I repartitioned my boot drive in the Win7 x64 box into 2 partitions as well, and both drives seem to respond faster as 1 TB partitions, rather than 2 TB partitions.</p>
<p>If it comes back, I'll start a new thread.</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista Update - Taking over 3.5 hours....so far&#33;</h2>
                    I booted up my laptop (Vista Home basic) at 6.20am today. It gave me the message "Configuring Update: Stage 1 of 3 - 0% complete"&nbsp; By 7am it was telling me the same thing but that it was at Stage 3 of 3 - 100% complete.&nbsp;
<br />
Looking at it now (9.58am) it is STILL telling me the same thing, 100% complete of the three stages. Is this normal?&nbsp; I have a meeting this afternoon for which I need a document I was working on at home.&nbsp; Is there any hope????

            I had this problem and Epson Tier 2 support figured it out for me. &nbsp;It came from having a different type &nbsp;of printer (Dell)&nbsp;installed previously. &nbsp;You have to uninstall other printers and/or find the old driver&nbsp;directory&nbsp;on your computer and delete it.
 &nbsp;Sorry I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;remember the details, but Epson can walk you through it if you give them these hints. &nbsp;(Tier 1 had no idea, so it may take a while.)
