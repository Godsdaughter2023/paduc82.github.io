<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 not showing all users in group</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When adding users from a group in Skype we have noticed there are lots of people missing (using 365 Exchange and Skype).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process we're following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Search for a distribution group in Skype search box</li><li>Right click the group and select 'Add to contacts list'</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If I right click on the group and select 'See contact card' I can see there are 146 members:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95fb3144-c9a0-43de-9cbf-30320172da32?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95fb3144-c9a0-43de-9cbf-30320172da32?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But if i expand the group and scroll down, I can only see 91 members:</p>
<p><em>&lt;masked by moderator due to privacy&gt;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c13275a-7d89-4945-ac6d-2ef72981fd8f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c13275a-7d89-4945-ac6d-2ef72981fd8f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>All the members of this group are visible in the 365 portal.&nbsp; This happens on all machines displaying 91 members.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

<p><span>Hi Matthew,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I noticed that the SR was closed. I will summary the information here to help other community members who has the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The behavior is expected. When users expend the group, only the first 100 entries of the group members will be retrieved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your time and efforts.</span></p>

            <p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56320add-c686-4304-9f17-a60219ed9046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56320add-c686-4304-9f17-a60219ed9046" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, read this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incident involving Acer systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some suspicious Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your system is not from Acer it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when XP feels threatened
 by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e525cb1e-867c-4da3-a1da-78031881f760" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!

    <title>Shift key ignored after 1 second delay. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Shift key ignored after 1 second delay.</h2>
                    
<p>I've on a Windows 7 PC and would like my keyboard to do as it is asked.</p>
<p>If i type 'HELLO WORLD' quickly while holding the shift key down throughout, I get what I expect.</p>
<p>If instead I pause for about a second before typing the world I get 'HELLO world'. This is not an effect I want.</p>
<p>I often hold shift down for a while while highlighting text to cut or copy. If I hesitate, then the start point suddenly moves.</p>
<p>BTW if I launch&nbsp;into Virtual XP mode, the same effect is seen.</p>
<p>Please help as this is very irritating and I've checked the 'Ease of &nbsp;Access' settings, which all appear to be off.</p>

<p>Yes - I've tried another keyboard on this computer (exactly the same type of keyboard)&nbsp; and still have the problem.</p>
<p>I've also tried the keyboard on another computer, also with Windows 7 on it, and that computer does NOT have the problem.</p>
<p><strong>New breaking news</strong></p>
<p>This affects all the control keys - Ctrl, Alt as well as Shift !!!!</p>
<p>For instance if I hold Alt and Tab and then release the Tab key, the available windows to switch to are shown for about a second and then I go to the window I'd selected.</p>
<p>I've installed W7 on a 'server' (HP Proliant ML115) and there aren't any keyboard drivers listed for non-server OS's, so it may be a keyboard driver issue after all.</p>
<p>Are there any others out there with a similar setup?</p>
<p><strong>RESOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>It is the keyboard/keyboard driver. The keyboard is a PS2 type, the HP one that came with the ML115.</p>
<p>I'm now typing on a USB keyboard and do not have the problems any more !!!</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions, ones I should have tried before bothering you in the first place really, but maybe this will help someone else.</p>

<p>I have Windows 10 release - 10.0.15063, and it too has the same issue as reported by the OP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to determine what the original base installation version of Windows was in order to determine whether this was a RTM to current build upgrade issue ? As far as I recall this is was a clean build made back at the end of July, and the first
 message in the event log shows the same version number though.</p>

            <p>Instead of cutting and pasting a generic reply, try reading what someone posts before answering... Why it is MVPs seem to only want to post cookie cutter responses is beyond comprehension (even more so when it's obvious the OP already ran SFC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as far as the issue at hand.... if DISM fails due to corruption within WinSXS, there are two courses of action that will fix the issue&nbsp;<strong><em>WITHOUT</em></strong> doing a repair install.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 1</strong></li></ul>
<ol>
<li>run&nbsp;<em>dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup</em></li><li>Restart computer (utilize charms bar only) once cleanup has finished</li><li>run&nbsp;<em>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</em>
<ul>
<li>This should now complete successfully and repair the corruption within WinSXS.
<ul>
<li>If it doesn't, restart computer, then run <em>sfc /scannow</em> , restart once completed, then repeat 1 - 3</li></ul>
</li><li>It would also be a good idea to run&nbsp;<em>sfc /scannow</em> once done</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 2</strong></li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Follow the instructions at:&nbsp;<a href="http://thetechcookbook.com/windows-8-update-kb3022345-causing-corrupt-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Tech Cookbook</a>&nbsp;using SFCfix to replace the x64 or x86 version of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft-Windows-Unified-Telemetry-Client.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Restart</span>&nbsp;computer (utilize charms bar only) once cleanup has finished</li><li>run&nbsp;<em>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</em>
<ul>
<li>If it fails again, perform steps 1 - 3 of&nbsp;<strong>Solution 1</strong> (after restarting computer)</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>***Due to how Windows shuts down and boots, you <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">must</span></em></strong> restart the computer after each and every
<em>SFC</em> or <em>DISM</em> repair operation, regardless if it completes successfully or not. &nbsp;Without going too much into it, this is due to a pending flag that is placed on the system***</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>A few key points:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>There is almost always a way to avoid doing a repair install, and all other options should be exhausted prior to doing a repair install for a multitude of reasons (it counts as a separate Windows activation, and while you'll never be unlicensed, it
 will eventually require you to go through the hassle of a phone activation; some software companies may license their products in such a way a repair install counts as a separate activation [as it does with 4Team software], among many other things) &nbsp;</em></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><em>The unfortunate achilles heel of Windows 8 and beyond is the DISM utility, as it's the only Windows utility capable of repairing WinSXS corruption. &nbsp;There are times when a repair install is necessary, but it should always be a last resort. &nbsp;</em></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><em>If you spend a decent amount of time on your PC, regardless if you're an amateur or power user, I'd encourage you to look into the MDT (Microsoft Deployment Toolkit), which is free. &nbsp;It was developed for business use, where multiple PCs must be deployed,
 however it's great for any user as it allows you to create a Windows install that auto installs all your desktop programs, drivers, and apps with little to no interaction from a user. &nbsp;It's something you can tinker on and come back to over several months to
 tweak it just right for your uses. &nbsp;It definitely saves a lot of time when you eventually do have to reinstall an OS (upgrading a deployment to a different version of Windows is as simple as deleting the old source files and copying the new ones over). &nbsp;</em></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Whenever you do a new install of an OS, after you get all drivers and desktop applications installed, and customize the OS to your liking, boot into WinRE (or WinPE) and take a WIM of your system drive.... it will save you an enormous amount of time
 if you ever have a corrupted or non-recoverable system. &nbsp;Set the compression flag to max, start it before bed, and by the time you wake in the morning, the imaging will be completed.</em>&nbsp;Restoring a WIM requires no re-activation of any software, as it's a
 complete backup of your system partition. (Creating a WIM in WinRE or WinPE requires setting the /ScratchDir flag, otherwise your imaging will fail [this is unique to Windows 8 and beyond due to ImageX no longer being compatible with Windows 8+].)</li></ul>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 pen tips - bulk packs of one hardness&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markthemech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 pen tips - bulk packs of one hardness&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had my Surface Pro 4 for a few weeks and have also picked up a set of replacement tips. Sure enough the shroud on the HB tip started to peel off of the softer internal material and the pen started to lose accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the pen extensively over the past few weeks as I develop my workflows to use the Surface for engineering drawing markup and review. As such I'm prepared to accept that this is part of wear and tear in my use case and calls for stocking up on
 consumables, especially if we choose to deploy this device to other team leads in my organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After replacing the HB tip with the H tip, I'm much happier with how it writes now. I also feel like the fully encapsulated H and 2H tips would stand up much better to wear than the HB and B tips which expose the softer inner material.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if there is (or will be) an option to purchase bulk packages of pen tips in a single hardness? It'd be fairly wasteful if I had to buy a 4 pack of tips when all I want is a specific hardness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Call of duty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dampbreeze  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call of duty</h2>
                    I cannot connect to any call of duty server. I have great internet and Xbox membership, I am prompted with an alphabet error code on every single one of the games. I believe something is wrong with my account but Xbox says they can't fix it. Activision
 has the worst support lines I've ever had to go through and I still can't get a hold of them. The only issue I can see with anything on my end is that I have 100% packet loss but I'm not to sure what that means. I can still play other games like GTA 5 with
 no issues. I really need help please.

<p>My nat type is open, great internet speed. The servers are fine for Xbox and call of duty. It just won't let my profile on. The error code i am getting on BO4 is ABC-EFGHIJKLM---QRS-U</p>
<p>also when I try to download my Xbox 360 profile or won't connect to the internet. The only issue I can see is the packet loss but again I don't know if that actually effects anything. I have went through every method to fix my issue provided on the Xbox
 support site and every issue I could find in the community but nothing will work. I called Xbox and the lady just made stuff up not actually trying to understand the bizzarness of my issue.</p>

<p>Hey there DampBreeze!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues playing on Black Ops 4. </p>
<p>Now, I wasn't able to find anything really on that letter code in Activision myself, but high packet loss is definitely something&nbsp;that could cause problems playing. Put simply, packet loss means the amount of signal that is lost between your modem and the
 console. We have a guide with instructions on how to deal with that here on ”<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/multiplayer-connection-error-solution?icid=furl_xboxone-highpacketloss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I get an error message
 when I run the ‘Test multiplayer connection’ on Xbox One</a>". </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't already, I would say to give those steps a shot and&nbsp;let us know if that helped&nbsp;resolve the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

<p>I have this problem now because i set upnp to active on my router to change nat type to open.</p>
<p>Then package loss is 100%</p>
<p>When you have nat moderate type you simply cant find other players game servers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nat open cannot connect 2 game itself.</p>

            Recently someone enlightened me to the fact that I could use Acronis True Image available free from Western Digital since I had WD drives. If you have a laptop it might not work since Windows 7 isn't supposed to boot from an external device. I could be
 wrong, or things might have changed. If you don't have a Western Digital drive there is a free trial version of Acronis.

            I have never been able to successfully restore a system image to a new hard drive, neither have many other people. Although someone may reassure you that it works fine, there will always be someone here asking why it won't work for them. I got tired of
 doing fresh installs of Windows 7 and reloading my software. This time I used Acronis True Image and made an identical bit-by-bit mirror image of my system before I replaced my drive. It worked like a charm, no hassles, no headaches, no errors. In order for
 you to use this, you would have to re-install your original HDD and then make your mirror image to a second internal HDD. Then remove the original HDD and boot from the image drive you just created. Done! Place your first drive in a safe place for later use
 or use it for something else. &nbsp;

<h2>            The Misadventures of Reinstalling Windows In-place&#58; Putting it in its place after it repeatedly tried to install itself in the WRONG partition</h2>
                    <span style="font-style: italic">I know this is a very long read, but I just had to share my awful experience with reinstalling Windows, and how I finally solved it (with some questions still remaining). Maybe it'll help someone, or maybe it'll at least
 be entertaining. Thanks for reading, if you do.</span><br />
<br />
This past weekend, I discovered a severe issue with ReadyBoot in my Windows 7 Pro x64 install, as I
<a href="http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/140262-how-to-speed-up-boot-process-under-windows-vista-or-windows-7/page__view__findpost__p__996904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
explain in more detail elsewhere</a>. So, after trying to troubleshoot that for most of Saturday, I finally decided I would do a repair install (inplace upgrade) on Sunday morning. This was not the first time I reinstalled Windows--I actually did it just six
 months prior, and it was a smooth, straight-forward process. Actually, I can't ever recall a time when I've had problems (re-)installing Windows on any of my computers over the years. But, this time was anything but problem-free...<br />
<br />
Before I go on, let me detail my PC specs really quick, in case they matter: Dell XPS 15 L502X, Core i7-2630QM, 8GB RAM, 640 GB 7200RPM HDD. I was running Windows Setup from a USB thumb drive, as I've been doing ever since I transitioned to Windows 7 in 2009.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">First attempt:</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
</span><br />
<br />
The upgrade process failed during the stage where drivers and Windows features get installed. The error message said something about missing a required driver. And so, I suspected the issue: (pseudo-)drivers left behind by an incomplete SuperAntispyware uninstall.
 Generating a system health report sometime a day or two before the attempt, uncovered two drivers not able to be found, and they sure enough were leftover traces of SuperAntispyware. I had to download a utility from the program's website to clean them out.
 I had actually taken care of these before, but then shortly before the upgrade attempt, I restored my system partition after a time-expensive mistake on my part, clean installing Windows over my existing install (yikes). This backup was from before I cleaned
 out those traces of SuperAntispyware.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Second attempt:</span> <br />
<br />
After the botched first attempt, I had to restore my system backup AGAIN, because after the error of "a required driver could not be installed" or something like that, I rebooted and selected "Windows Setup Rollback" or something like that,
<span style="font-weight: bold">only to be greeted with a CMD prompt warning me that a winpeshl.ini file was found, but that no commands could be launched successfully.</span> What? So, not only did Windows fail to reinstall, it failed to rollback, prompting
 my need to restore from my backup. I did so, cleaned out those rogue SuperAntispyware traces, and even uninstalled nonessential programs that came with drivers, like the Virtual CloneDrive ISO-mounting program, and Easeus Todo-Backup (just to be clear, I've
 been using the ISO image of Todo-Backup on another jump drive to restore my backup). Once I generated a clean system health report, I proceeded with a second upgrade attempt. And...wait for it...<span style="font-style: italic">it failed again!</span> With
 the same exact error, too, about not being able to install a required driver. WHAT? I then rebooted, only to be greeted with the same CMD prompt about winpeshl.ini...gee, doesn't this sound familiar? By now, I was fuming. Here I was, on a late Sunday afternoon,
 having already sunken my entire day up to that point, into trying to repair my computer, and I was getting NOWHERE.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I still had tricks up my sleeve. I wasn't going to cave and do a clean reinstall, because I knew to get back up and running with all my programs and customizations afterward would cost me up to two days (the fact that I had already lost my whole
 weekend to computer issues notwithstanding). So, I had to figure out, what else could I do? Then I thought, aha! I have Windows PE on one of my jump drives, that I could use to investigate Windows' botch ups. I booted up from that, and peeked into my system
 partition where the failed setup was. <span style="font-weight: bold">I navigated to the winpeshl.ini file, and saw that it referenced rollback.exe, which was nowhere in the given path, or even anywhere on my system partition.
<span style="font-style: italic">Interesting...</span></span> <br />
<br />
My sleuthing also uncovered the expected $INPLACE.~TR and related temporary directories on my system partition, but then I examined my data partitions (a primary 20GB one for Documents, a primary 525GB one for my media, and a couple tiny logical partitions
 for usage by particular programs), and grew even more annoyed... <span style="font-weight: bold">
Why does Windows Setup bother to enumerate files in data partitions? What a waste of time!</span> I figured that's the culprit for Windows' hanging at least a few times during the upgrade process, gathering user settings, files, and programs on partitions<span style="font-style: italic">
 that it shouldn't even bother with</span>...This is why I keep my OS/programs separate from my data! To try to simplify OS installs/reinstalls...and yet, for Windows to make an apparent mockery of my forethought, irked me to no end.<br />
<br />
Both my primary data partitions had $INPLACE.~TR folders and other evidence of Windows' being where it wasn't supposed to be. However, my logical partitions maybe only had one file added to them, and surely no $INPLACE.~TR...Hmm...that gave me an idea that
 I would explore for my next upgrade attempt. Before that, however, I became simply astonished upon discovering a stash of Windows' install files in $WINDOWS.~BT,
<span style="font-style: italic">on my media partition</span>. "Idiot!" I exclaimed, barely restraining the urge to mouth off a litany of curse words. "So here's your problem, eh? Trying to install yourself on my music drive, fool! Stupid retard, freaktard,
 dumb-butt returd [and on and on...]" I simply couldn't believe this...But wait, there's more!
<span style="font-weight: bold">Rollback.exe was still nowhere to be seen.</span> So, after all this searching around, I still had a failed upgrade install, a failed rollback thanks to an MIA rollback.exe, and a whole bunch of blood boiling in me. I now had
 no apparent choice but to restore my broken Windows from backup, for a THIRD time.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Third Attempt:<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
</span></span></span></span>By now, night was falling on my wasted Sunday on a wasted weekend, and I could only wish my blood pressure would fall. After restoring my backup again, I then decided that if Windows is gonna be stupid and try to install itself where
 it doesn't belong, then I'll just have to deny it access to my data partitions, in attempt to corral the wildly wily Windows into my system partition. I also thought of converting my primary data partitions to logical ones, to see if that would help...I knew
 the latter would be a trivial task using Easeus Partition Master, and after a little research, I knew "hiding" partitions appeared trivial as well--just a matter of removing the drive letter via Disk Management. I grew smugly slightly self-satisfied, as I
 figured I was soon finally gonna get the upper hand in my battle to reinstall Windows. I figured, since the Upgrade process starts from within an active Windows install, and if the drives are inaccessible with no letter, then Windows can't possibly get its
 grubby fingers on them, right? <span style="font-style: italic">Right? </span>*Cue suspenseful silence*<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
</span></span></span></span>Once I done did my deed of denying my data drives their letter (and converting my media partition to logical), I finally proceeded with my third upgrade install attempt, thinking logically that I would finally win. I waited in eager
 anticipation, as I saw the progress bar slowly inch forward. After what seemed an eternity, Windows finally finished the third step of expanding installation files...and then, tada!--<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">FAIL!</span><br />
<br />
Once again, the process failed at the beginning of the installation step, with the SAME error of missing some "required driver". The blasted message couldn't even be slightly less useless, by including the name of said required driver. Ughhhh! And once again,
 rebooting to attempt a rollback, gave me the same error about winpeshl.ini. I simply couldn't believe this!<br />
<br />
So, once again, I fired up Windows PE, and went straight to my media partition...Huh? It was instantly visible in Windows Explorer, along with the other drives I had attempted to hide...Guess that trick backfired, and, converting my media partition to a logical
 one made no difference either, for Windows, in its infinite lack of wisdom, dumped its installation files there, and once again, there was much grumbling and gnashing of teeth from me. Faced with the prospect of having to restore my Windows backup for a FOURTH
 time, I did some more snooping around in Windows PE. I hadn't visited the $INPLACE.~TR folder on my media partition till now, for I figured it'd just be a stash of all my personal files that shouldn't have been touched in the first place, as was the case with
 my documents partition. Well, lo and behold, what do I find lurking in the $INPLACE.~TR folder?
<span style="font-style: italic">Another&nbsp;$WINDOWS.~BT</span> <span style="font-style: italic">
folder!</span> Stupid failed-up Windows install! Not only does it stick its junk on the wrong drive, it can't even keep its junk in one place on said drive! How moronic can this be??? And why would setup files be mixed in with MY files, anyway? More grumbling
 and gnashing of teeth followed...<br />
<br />
But then, I caught a little lucky break...before I could break a window or something. Stashed away in the second set of setup files was rollback.exe, that stupid MIA file...I copied the contents of the whole second
<span style="font-style: italic">$WINDOWS.~BT</span> folder into the first one at the root of my music partition. Surprisingly, I got no prompts for duplicate files--just warnings about merging directories with the same name...<span style="font-weight: bold">meaning,
 this appeared to be one master set of setup files, split up in two locations...how in the world does this happen?</span>

Not really expecting much, I rebooted after my copy operation, and surprisingly, Windows initiated a rollback...well well, at least Windows finally got something half-right. Sure, it had failed miserably multiple times already to upgrade ITSELF (I mean, come
 on, I could understand upgrade woes in an XP-to-7 or Vista-to-7 install, but on a self-upgrade? Especially one that I had successfully and smoothly performed previously on the same machine? Never.) but at least it succeeded at doing a quickie rollback...well..."quickie"
 being relative, say around 15 minutes. Whatever. I celebrated a brief and minor victory, though knowing it could not make up for my wasted day. 15 hours of macrohard hassle would not be easily undone by a micro victory of merely returning my Windows to its
 former broken state (with a broken Readyboot) without having to resort to my backup. 15 hours of this mess, and that's excluding my Saturday wasted on trying to repair ReadyBoot! Sometime after midnight, I finally gave up for the night, took a break by watching
 some cartoons online (a good laugh helps), and then went to bed...down and discouraged, but not quite defeated yet. I vowed to be victorious the following day.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Fourth Attempt
</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
Monday morning, I got up, and promptly got back to trying to fix my computer. I don't remember what I did differently for my next attempt, however, if I did anything different. Maybe I just initiated the process so that if it failed again, I could look more
 closely again via Windows PE, for any log files detailing where this fail-trainwreck-of-a-process went off the fails--er...I mean, rails. Sure enough, the process failed again with the same "required driver" error, and I went back to Windows PE to investigate.
 However, in that process, I got a bright idea that I wish I would've thought of far sooner: I may not be able to hide the partitions that I didn't want Windows to touch, but maybe instead, I could fill them up with dummy data, so that Windows Setup would not
 have enough room to take a dump on them? A dummy file creator turned to be one trivial Google search away. "Finally, success is within reach!" I thought.... "Hahaha, fill all the spaces!" I then said, as I started making the first of three 100 GB dummy text
 files on my music partition. It ended up taking over 20 minutes to write the first file to disk, during which I had breakfast and still had time to spare. Ugh...That meant the whole process could take an hour or longer... But then I got an even better idea:
<span style="font-style: italic">What if I just shrink the size of my partition?</span> The principle was the same...if Windows could not have enough space to store its setup files elsewhere, then that would force it to stay on the system partition, right?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Fifth Attempt</span><br />
<br />
Using Easeus Partition Master, I shrank my media drive to a point that it only had about 10 GB free. I also wrote a 7 GB dummy text file to my Documents drive, leaving it with less than 5 GB free. My final two data partitions were either too small to be of
 concern, or already nearly full, and so, I didn't touch them. So now, my system partition had the most free space of all my partitions, at about 26 GB--more than enough for installation. I began what I hoped and prayed would be my final upgrade attempt...
<br />
<br />
The minutes ticked by slowly--too slowly. It felt like the stupid thing was taking even longer than usual. I especially dread the part in Step 3, expanding of installation files, where it reboots the computer, and then stays stuck at 18% for at least 10 minutes,
 as it "gathers additional information before expanding installation files"..."How much additional information do you need, fool?" I'd keep on thinking... Oh, with my trust level at over -9000, I actually intervened right after that reboot--I went into Windows
 PE, and checked the location of the $WINDOWS.~BT folder. Surprisingly, it was finally where it belonged, on my system drive, and all in one piece, too! But, I kept in mind that in the next 10-20 minutes to follow (being stuck at Step 3 at 18%, Windows could
 very well try to dump its junk elsewhere...I prayed that wouldn't happen...<br />
<br />
After another eternity, the progress meter finally advanced beyond 18%, and Windows expanded the rest of its files. This time, I actually had some feedback for it--X-amount of MB out of 2918MB or however much it was. I don't recall ever seeing until now, that
 figure at this step, after the preceding reboot. Seemed to be a good sign...<br />
<br />
The progress figure finally crawled to 100%, and I grew increasingly nervous...if it fails, it always fails seconds after transitioning to Step 4...well, Step 4 began... and then... HALLELUJAH! the stupid thing finally advanced without croaking! It began successfully
 installing all the required drivers and such, and then eventually began transferring my files, settings, and programs, all 800,000+ of them. That was especially nerve-wracking, as so many times, it'd appear to get stuck, and the closer it got to finishing,
 the more I tensed up at apparent standstills. I wasn't sure if it counted the files on my data partitions...knowing its stupidity, it probably did... but hey,
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">at least I FINALLY GOT WINDOWS REINSTALLED</span>. The whole upgrade took about 2 hours...The whole hassle to get to this point, took me 20 hours* Crazy!<br />
<br />
*Excluding my wasted Saturday. In all, I lost Saturday and Sunday to troubleshooting and trying to upgrade, and then Monday to finishing upgrading and getting my computer back to normal for regular use, and now I've spent most of today documenting my tale here
 and <a href="http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/140262-how-to-speed-up-boot-process-under-windows-vista-or-windows-7/page__view__findpost__p__996904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here (same link as given at the beginning)</a>.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Conclusion</span><br />
<br />
So now, I finally wrap this up with a few questions...<span style="font-weight: bold">how does Windows Setup go so wrong the way it did for me?</span> As I noted somewhere above, this is not the first time I've reinstalled Windows on my current laptop. My repair
 install in early October 2011 went smoothly with no issues, and I had made no substantial changes to my config between now and then. Well...I only had three primary partitions back then, before carving some space out of my media partition for two tiny logical
 partitions, <span style="font-weight: bold">but still, surely that can't be enough to trip up Windows Setup, right?</span> I'm at a loss for any explanation.<br />
<br />
If you've read all the way to the end, thank you...I hope it hasn't been a total waste of your time, haha. I hope it's at least been entertaining :)<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for sharing the information with us. In place upgrade installation will replace the corrupted or missing system files of the Operating System, In-place upgrade installation fails because of many reasons, whenever we perform in-place upgrade
 installation, we should keep the computer in clean boot, disconnect the devices like printers , scanners etc, even we have to disable antivirus.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>In-place upgrade installation fails because of hard driver bad sector; we have to perform chkdsk to fix the issue. Hardware drivers like display, sound, might affect the in place upgrade installation, we can disable the devices by going through the
 device manager before performing the In place upgrade installation.</span></p>

            Unfortunately, I don't believe I have log files anymore. Once I felt confident that my reinstallation was a full success, I had Disk Cleanup remove the upgrade logs and any other associated files. However, during one of my failed upgrade attempts, I copied
 a pair of setupact.log and setuperr.log files...I distinctly remember seeing in them, where Windows marked my media partition as its BT tracking drive, or whatever--it infuriated me, because, if I'm upgrading Windows on my system C: drive, why should it even
 touch my other partitions?<br />
<br />
I tried to recover those two logs files using an undelete program, as well as any log files I removed via Disk Cleanup, but now, all I see in any recovered files are a mess of garbled characters--nothing useful. I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
Where else can I search on my hard drive for log files? Are there any particular file names you're looking for?<br />
<br />
I did my best to prepare my computer for my upgrade. I made sure the system health report produced no errors, I made sure there was no malware (I run regular on-demand scans, anyway), I ran with as few services as I need (which I do in regular usage anyway),
 and I made sure my disk was in good shape by using CHKDSK. I'm not sure what else I could've done.<br />

<h2>            Deleting a shortcut to a Drive without deleting the whole drive.</h2>
                    I created a shortcut to my two storage drives on my main drive. Now, when I search my computer for a file, it finds the original and the one under the shortcut. When I try to delete the shortcut, it tries to delete the entire drive. I don't want duplicate
 results for every search so how can I delete the shortcuts?

                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm considering getting a set of Kinect Xbox one and installing 3D builder in order to get some of my company part scan. i wonder how accurate this scanning combo do? i know we can choose to have high resolution in the apps. also the higher my graphic card
 capability the better results the output model gonna be. i'm planning to get a pretty good PC with GeForce GTX 780 Ti GPU on it. But i wish to know what is the accuracy at it's highest resolution? is it +- .010" accurate? or +-0.1" accurate compare to the
 original model? please let me know if any one have any clue about this. appreciate your time and thank you in advance!!</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t edit tags&#47;metadata in jpg&#47;mp4 files when in library - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oysteve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t edit tags&#47;metadata in jpg&#47;mp4 files when in library view on Windows 8.1 Enterprise</h2>
                    I use libraries all the time. On Windows 8, I could be in library view and edit tags for my photos and mp3s just fine. Tags are useful as they aid in indexed searches. On Windows 8.1 Enterprise, this whole convenience has gone. I can't even edit these
 files in library view. Only when I click on "Open File/Folder Location" which points to the real location of the file then was I able to edit tags for these files. These files are not on read only mode and ownership has been assigned to me.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this some sort of a joke? Windows 8, in this regard, was a much better OS compared to Windows 8.1. With the addition of the useless start button and now this, I am really thinking about going back to Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am also surprised that no one else has this problem. I did my research before posting this question.</div>

            I also can't edit the tags of any files when viewing them in Library view in Windows 8.1. I have to open their exact so location before I can edit the tags. This was possible in Windows 7 and 8 but not 8.1. It must be a tweak they made, although I don't
 like it.

<h3> aahck  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB microphone &#40;CAD u37&#41; problems</h2>
                    <p>Much like&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/cannot-install-drivers-for-c-media-u37-usb/fc2dfa2e-890a-429f-9b7d-ca686c09f873">this user</a>, I have a CAD u37 microphone that won't
 work with Windows 10. When I troubleshoot the microphone, I get this message: "USB Composite Device is an older USB device and might not work with USB 3.0. &nbsp;Plug the device into an available USB 2.0 port."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike the user in that thread, though, my computer recognizes that the microphone is plugged in, it just won't record. On Audacity, the line just stays in place and blinks a little. On the default voice recorder, I get this message: "We couldn't save this
 recording. It looks like the autosaved file was deleted before you finished recording it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the obvious stuff (rebooting, unplugging and plugging back in) as well as installing drivereasy, going into my device manager and monkeying with my USB controllers, disabling my default microphone... I've been messing with it all day, and no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thing is supposed to be plug and play, so I'm not sure why I can't get it to work.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's troubleshoot the issue by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Windows built-in troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong><em>Windows key + X,</em> </strong>then select Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Search for <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click on <strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong><em>.</em></span></p>
<p><span>3. On the left pane, click <strong><em>View all</em></strong><em>.</em></span></p>
<p><span>4. In the list of options, click on <strong><em>Recording Audio</em></strong><em>.</em></span></p>
<p><span>5. Click <strong><em>Next</em></strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Try to use different audio formats</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in
<em><strong>mmsys.cpl.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. On the <strong><em>Playback</em> </strong>tab, right-click (or tap and hold) the
<strong><em>Default Device,</em></strong> and then select <strong><em>Properties.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the <strong><em>Advanced</em> </strong>tab, under
<strong><em>Default Format</em>,</strong> change the setting, and then retest your audio device. If that doesn't work, try changing the setting again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let us know how it goes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>I forgot to mention that I'd already troubleshot the microphone and got the message "USB Composite Device is an older USB device and might not work with USB 3.0. &nbsp;Plug the device into an available USB 2.0 port."</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future reference, though, I figured it out and got my microphone up and running:
</p>
<p>I went into my device manager, uninstalled all of the items under the USB header, rebooted my computer so it would reinstall those items, then I disallowed each of those items from turning off to save power.</p>

<p>Hey ,SvelteCrib20699!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about that problem with Gears of War 2.</p>
<p>If you are getting something that is crashing your game, I would try the steps on

<p>If that doesn't work, then maybe try to what we call a soft reset. Basically make sure that you know all the sign in info for any gamertags and your internet and then follow the steps here at
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hey, thanks por answering</p>
<p>
</p><p>sadly I have to say that it didn't worked your advise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed&nbsp;<span>the steps of "how to reset your console to factory defaults on xbox one" and I was</span><span>&nbsp;sure to do using the "</span><span>Reset and keep my games &amp; apps
 function"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Actually I tried using "reset and keep my games &amp; apps" and using "reset and erase every game" and sadly still exist the failure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I noticed that, since I syncroniced the second gamer tag in the session, the issue persist. Also I noticed that when I have to choose one memory slot (playing in co-op) the menu changes and it doesn't appear some functions
 as "change chapter" (for example)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last, in the beginning of all this issue, (a months ago) when we experienced this mal function,&nbsp; I used to change the user name and we could continue to play but not any more&nbsp;</p>
<p>
