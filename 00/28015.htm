<h2>            How the &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; do I use the music player&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    I have spent 3 hours trying to get this **** to work! 



I just want to make and manage my own playlists, with my own god damn music. I don't want X-box accounts, I don't want to play music from the "cloud", I just want **** to **** work! 



I'm sorry if I'm venting, but I finally took the leap and bought a windows phone, and while what is there works (apart from the music player), there is just too many things messing (like a functioning music player). 



I can sync music from my computer. I can manual move it over, but that leaves me trying to make a playlist on the phone itself, which is impossible, because the play now list CAN'T BE **** CLEARED, and your only option is to add all of Playing Now list as a playlist. Alright fine, I'll just add them as is, and remove the stuff i don't want... What? I'm not allowed to edit my playlist? ARE YOU FOR **** REAL?! 



Please can ANYONE tell me what the **** is going on and how to fix, use this piece of **** software?

            I bought my Lumix 610 new in October 2012 and the charging/data connection port seems very unreliable/temperamental. Is this a design problem or am I just unlucky? How easy/quick is it to fix?

            <p>In 2013 I bought a new computer with Windows 8.1 and loaded Office 2010 that I had purchased previously and which worked flawlessly with Windows XP on my last computer. &nbsp;Shortly after I began to receive the "cannot open ....pst file" messages. &nbsp;The first
 time this happened I had to pay for MS support to come in to the computer remotely because I have so much important information in my Outlook files. &nbsp;MS had to repair the pst files using the application scanpst that can be found in the Programs/Office folder.
 &nbsp;It took about two hours and the person couldn't find the problem. &nbsp;He had to push it up a level to someone who knew what they were doing; they had to make and appointment with me to reconnect the next day! After repairing the file several times, it came up
 with no errors. &nbsp;Outlook could then open it.</p>
<p>I have this problem regularly and unexpectedly - about every two months. &nbsp;My wife and I both run pst files on Outlook and both files fail from time to time with Outlook. &nbsp;I can fix the problem now fairly easily but it is more than annoying. &nbsp;It seems that
 Outlook is at fault because Outlook must be repaired using the Office - Repair function mentioned or else the pst file is corrupted again when Outlook tries to open it. &nbsp;I have been hoping that one of the big fixes that is regularly performed by MS for Windows
 8.1 would cure this but it still continues. &nbsp;Someone that is not as capable would be lost. &nbsp;This is a serious problem for MS and it seems to continue without attention. &nbsp;It says something about the MS approach when it builds in "repair" functions for program
 problems that it can't fix permanently.</p>

    <title>iPAQ Pocket Word files to MS Word 2007 conversion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avengineer  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPAQ Pocket Word files to MS Word 2007 conversion</h2>
                    I have just moved to a new desktop running Windows 7 Professional. I can link and sync with my HP iPAQ HX2415 however I have not been successful in converting the older Pocket Word files usable with the new MS Word 2007 app.<br />
Question is; is there a conversion app that can make these compatible or do I have to move on to a newer mobile device?<br />
Thanks for any help..

<p><span><span>By default, Word or Excel documents that you create on your older Pocket PC are saved in a Pocket Word (psw) or Pocket Excel (pxl)
 format.&nbsp; Office 2007 cannot open psw or pxl formatted files.&nbsp; Furthermore, if you sync these files to a computer that runs Windows Vista /7, Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC) has no way to convert these files from the Pocket format into a format that can
 be used with Office 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you wish to use Pocket PC created office documents on your computer running Office 2007, you can save these files on the Pocket

                    <p>In Outlook 2013, there used to be a red cross delete icon that appeared when you hover over an email in your inbox, as well as a priority flag icon. &nbsp;I've just updated to Outlook 2016 (via 365 subscription), and there is no delete icon when hovering, only

<p><span>From the description, it look like touch mode in enabled in Outlook. Let us disable the touch mode and check if the Delete popup icon appear while hovering on emails.</span></p>
<p><span>To do that open Outlook-----at the right top corner---click customize quick access tool bar. ----click touch/mouse mode. Once the touch mouse mode is enabled---click on the option mouse.</span></p>

<h3> jubileebill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint presentation of cloud-based files</h2>
                    If my PPT file is on DropBox (or another cloud-based file server) and I open my presentation, what happens if my internet connection goes down after I begin my presentation? Has the entire slide deck been down-loaded to PPT's local storage on my PC when
 PPT opens the file such that loss of access to DropBox (or an alternate cloud-based files server) after the PPT is loaded will cause no problem? How does PowerPoint work with respect to loading everthing in memory or a local system file vs. continually accessing
 the original file source?

            <p>I'm not sure of the answer to that, but wouldn't the best strategy be to download the presentation to your computer first, then play it from the local file rather than trusting to a (possibly) flakey connection to the cloud?</p>

            <p>Hi Steve -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response. I do realize that copying the file to local storage will work, but I was curious as to how PPT actually works internally and whether or not one could skip that two-step process without risking one's presentation should you
 lose internet access after opening the file but while presenting it. Our Church uses DropBox for sharing files, and in the course of meetings or programs it's much more convenient to simply open the file from its DropBox location rather than copying it and
 then opening it. If opening a PPT file directly in a shared DropBox file loads everything into memory or a local PPT store, then the extra step would be unnecessary. I was hoping someone familiar with how PPT works internally might have some insight into that.</p>

            <p>I'm going to climb out on a limb and make a guess here, and that guess is that PPT loads slides as they're accessed (so it has a fresh copy of any slide that someone else might have edited when you're editing collaboratively).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But backing up off the limb to securer footing on the main tree trunk, I'll mention that people have had problems with images disappearing from their presentations when they open/edit files directly from online storage like DropBox.&nbsp; The problem *seems*
 to be fixed in recent updates to PPT, since we haven't heard many people complaining of it lately.&nbsp; Or rather, it seems to have squeezed through the bars and fled to the Mac side, where it's begun to bite people lately.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the "Safe Hex" people are all recommending local files only.&nbsp; I'm with them.</p>

            Did you upgrade from Windows 7 and did you get a digital license? If so you can do a clean install with an iso of Windows 10 either the public build or the latest insider build? Otherwise you will have to reinstall Windows 7 from a recovery dvd and start
 over.

<p>Hi CA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take it you are now back on W7? The question is then whether you have much installed in regards to software and/or personal&nbsp;files. You should be able to upgrade that W7 build to an Insider build, but it is better to clean install W10 directly. As Ray points
 out, it also depends a bit on your Licensing status. If you had any W10 version installed at any time that was Activated and/or showed 'digital license linked to your Account' then you are good and can Clean Install W10 directly and Licensing will be automatic.
 If you are unsure about this, then you'll probably just have to chance it. If your license was never upgraded to W10 then you are out of luck and will have to buy a new License for W10 to being fully functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to where to find the bits to install, that depends on what Insider Ring you are (were) subscribed to. So please post that and also whether you are familiar with doing such a Clean Install. There is a bit more to it than sticking in a USB-Stick...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<p>Rolling back to 7 doesn't necessarily mean all their data is lost...apps and programs that work with 7 (or DON'T) should still be there somewhere, even if not directly registered anymore.</p>

 AND you can synchronize Outlook folders and categories on your PC with corresponding categories on your Windows Mobile handheld or smartphone.

            Hi MargieV
<br />
<br />On the alphabetical list of installed applications on your Start Menu, right click an application and choose 'Pin to Start'
<br />
<br />If that does not work for you:
<br />
<br />Open a new document in any Office Application
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />In Task Manager, right click that Office Application and choose 'Open File Location'
<br />
<br />In the resulting folder, right click any or all the Office applications and choose 'Pin to Start'       
        </p>

            Hi RileyJan
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This is a problem which I have seen being reported by few others also. You should report this to Microsoft so that Microsoft developers should look into this. There are 2 ways to give this feedback -
<br />
<br />1. Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Feedback &gt; Send a Frown
<br />
<br />2. Through Uservoice - Click the following link to see the feedback of others and to provide feedback - <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://excel.uservoice.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>DavidUV,</p>
<p>The resource "limit" is called Max Units and it is set by entering a value in the Max Units field on the Resource Sheet. For example, for a normal workday using the Standard calendar, a resource will work 8 hrs per day so the Max Units is set to 100% (1.0).
 If the resource is assigned such that his/her hours exceeds the Max Units, Project will give visual indicators that the resource is overallocated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in the Gantt Chart view, a task with an overallocated resource will show a little red person in the Indicators field (normally the left most column). You will also see the Resource's name in red on the Resource Sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The threshold for the overallocation warning is set under Resource &gt; Level group &gt; Leveling options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for reference, there is no way to set Project so that you are physically prevented from overallocating resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for such a timely reply. Perhaps I didn't state my problem clearly. I don't care how long a resource works daily. In fact, the timeframe for the project is based on the hour and extends indefinitely. I don't want to limit how long the resource
 is allowed to work daily either. What I wanted to do is that when a resource (like an unique machine) is in use for one task, it can't be used for some other task at the same time. Is that achievable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>DavidUV</p>

<p>DavidUV,</p>
<p>Yes that is achievable if you use Project's leveling feature. For example, let's say there are four tasks that use the machine resource. Two that last 5 days and two that last 1 day each. As originally scheduled the machine is overallocated since it is being
 assigned to work on all four tasks simultaneously.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caf24435-14e9-4a74-8f2a-31dbe480758a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caf24435-14e9-4a74-8f2a-31dbe480758a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve the overallocation, the four tasks are prioritized and the leveling options are set as shown</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6813d7b6-ea55-41b5-bf8f-ab47932c2882?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6813d7b6-ea55-41b5-bf8f-ab47932c2882?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When leveling is applied, the four tasks are arranged in priority order such that the machine only works on one task at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e499064-f7f5-42a2-a148-45ed1a687c56?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e499064-f7f5-42a2-a148-45ed1a687c56?upload=true" /></a></p>

    <title>Cannot send emails from linked hotmail account on Android phone HTC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whizgig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot send emails from linked hotmail account on Android phone HTC One</h2>
                    <p>In recent weeks my phone has been unable to send emails from my synced hotmail account. In speaking to my phone network provider they said to delete the email account and set it up again. When I did this it didn't solve it and they said it is Hotmail related
 and not a phone software issue. I asked if it would be resolved by any Android update but they said to contact my email provider, Hotmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is an Android HTC One (first generation) and my email account is on Hotmail.co.uk, synced via pop3 version. I can receive emails ok, but I cannot forward or send new ones. I've had the phone and no problem with emails for just over a year so it's
 odd it just started and there was no recent firmware upgrades. Any help duly appreciated. This is not an Outlook issue but you have no option in the Category drop-down to mention Hotmail account, not an Outlook account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi - Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Affected account - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Specific browser and its version - Not a browser issue, issue is with the email app on the phone not sending or forwarding emails - it's the regular android email app I've synced my hotmail account to using POP3</p>
<p>- Do you encounter the same problem when using different device or browser on the phone? - Not a browser issue, see above. No problem with this email account on my laptop or any other device apart from the phone.</p>
<p>- Are you getting an error message? If so, what is the exact error message? - I just get an icon on my top status bar on the phone, the Email letter icon with an exclamation mark on it. When I drag this down to view detail it just reads, unable to send email
 with an option to resend, but it never works if resend is attempted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further info. - The first time I had issues with the email app on my phone it wasn't receiving emails and my phone network provider tech support said to delete the account and re-create it. When I did that the receiving of emails worked but then the sending
 did not and the guy said if you have any further problems contact your email account provider - MS Hotmail, so then I contacted you. I didn't want to delete the account and re-create again as at least I can receive emails and therefore reply to people I need
 to via my work email address as I can at least read the email address that people have sent to me from. At work I cannot access Hotmail on my work's network, so normally I use the phone to be able to read and send personal emails when necessary. But obviously
 it is annoying that for some reason I have lost the ability to send emails via the phone recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. Over the weekend the sending of emails via my phone email app seems to be working again. Can I please see how this goes and I'll reply with the details you requested (I was able to get my unique ID code ok) if this problem re-occurs.
 I do turn the phone off every night so maybe something has cleared this but I would like to leave this for now and see how it goes.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just responding to the question I received as to whether the problem I had sending emails via my phone is resolved. For now I am able to send and receive emails ok via my android phone but I know how these things can change so I didn't want to close
 the issue in case there was a recurrence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you feel that this is answer enough then feel free to close this issue but I would rather keep it open until I've had a good couple of weeks with no problems recurring. I close my phone down every night so every day the situation could be different if
 something was happening on the start up of my phone that caused this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We are happy to know that you're able to send emails again to your account using your mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've mentioned that you can send emails when you are using your laptop, it is possible that it is caused by the outgoing settings you've used when you configure your account on the mobile app in your mobile device. Since it is working fine now, you
 may monitor your account and see if you will experience it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in case that this issue happens again, don't hesitate to come back to us. We're always here to help you.</p>

<h3> reettees  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer- Skype and Windows 10- Microsoft account outlook-Gmail Account - Local Account Internet provider hispeed.ch</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 since four weeks about. My E-mail accounts are linked. I can send and receive mail on each. I have Internet Explorer as default with Google as my home page. Every day I encounter some new problem. My G-mail address is my default mail address</p>
<p>Today I wanted to SKYPE with a friend. I have had a SKYPE account since 2013. I have updated this as suggested by SKYPE. I have checked the Firewall and looked at the settings. SKYPE is there possible.</p>
<p>However when I SKYPE for a few minutes, I am thrown out of my Internet connections. I can always troubleshoot this and get my connections back. However when I close SKYPE, I have problems to get my Internet Explorer with my Home Page. Even worse, I had to
 put in my G-mail account again and also my local mail address at Swissonline.ch.</p>
<p>I have written for help to SKYPE, but do not know if they have solved this problem. How should I set my Microsoft account- Outlook with my other two accounts and have the SKYPE working.
</p>
<p>I have checked my Modem and Router. They are always o.k. until I get thrown out by SKYPE.
</p>
<p>I realise I must have some kind of mistake in my Windows 10 settings, but I have not found anyone who could find the mistake. Not even those who charge for their work.</p>
<p>Sorry to write his much, but it is the only way to describe what is really disturbing me. Before I had Windows 7.</p>
<p>Thank you for any suggestions you may have.</p>

            Dear lostintrama ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails ( I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you ):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> with conditions for common words in the body of the email and in subject
<br />5. Some of the scammers learned how to mask their addresses and domains. You will need to check the actual domain in the message source. In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a>
<br />Also you can add customize action that will enable an icon directly in the message window. Go here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/surfaceActions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/surf...</a> and Message Surface &gt; tag View message source. 
<br />
<br />Also read this information about fighting junk emails from Postmaster for Outlook <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also check tips on how to stay safe online from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/online-safety-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!

<p>
</p><p><span>Are the messages in the Junk Email folder? If so, the block is working.&nbsp; It doesn't prevent the mail from being delivered, but removes it from the inbox. Outlook.com does not have an option to permanently delete junk mail. (Outlook desktop
 has that option, but spam moved on the server would not be processed by the desktop.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>At the bottom of the Junk mail options at&nbsp;https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/junkEmail - you can trust only people in your safe lists or contacts. &nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I have had this same issue for months and months. Adding the addresses and the domain names to the blocked senders list does nothing and is a useless suggestion. Having my junk mail filters set to only trust safe senders and block attachments does nothing.
 Microsoft needs to permanently block the domain senders from the junk mail IF WE HAVE ADDED THOSE EMAILS/DOMAIN NAMES TO THE BLOCKED LISTS.&nbsp; They should not be continuously being sent to the junk mail folders, even if the point of the junk folders is that
 they're being filtered away from our inboxes. They shouldn't be making it into our email accounts in any form or fashion. What is the point of reporting this issue, and the hordes of spam emails, as phishing, if Microsoft refuses to block any of them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the three responders to this complaint above, but their suggestions do not fix the issue. Doing any of their suggestions don't fix the issue. For example, no matter how many times I block the "clialiedge.com" domain or add their various senders
 to the blocked list, they still make their way to the junk folder. They shouldn't be getting through at all. Now, when I go to add any email ending in "clialiedge.com", the list won't save or add the address to the list of blocked senders. No one has a suggestion
 for fixing that kind of bug or whatever. It's up to Microsoft to fix this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I appreciate the Independent Advisors offering suggestions, but anything else, other then what is suggested, would be appreciated as well.</p>

<p>Hi Qwirky1,</p>
<p>Your posting of 12-2-2018.</p>
<p>Yep, U got IT!</p>
<p>This Garbage should be Stopped before we see it, </p>
<p>Not Excuses. Not&nbsp;Stuff &nbsp;that Does Not Work.</p>
<p>Has Never Worked and Will Never Work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Blocked "clialiedge" Months ago. I still get several Emails Each and Every Day from this Garbage. I have 17 emails from this Garbage in 3 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Sent Hundreds of Garbage Emails from "clialiedge" to Micrsoft over the last few months. Does No Good. and All the others Garbage Senders I Posted about on Nov.27,2018 and before. Repeat and Repeat. Stop the Garbage. No Excuses Microsoft.&nbsp;I have also
 many times when "Info" about Garbage "Links" are sent. I write how little value the "info" and most of the time. Not Current.
</p>
<p>BETA Outlook.com is much worse than the Take over of Outlook of Hotmail. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only "Block" one Sender in the Blocked Email and or Domain Once. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In any Languge of Computer Garbage Language "Block" Means "Block"</p>
<p>In Microsoft languge "Block" Means Break Rules, "Sweep", "Move to" or some other Useless Worthless Instruction. That is the Microsoft Way. From One Microsoft Way.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have written to Several Microsoft Support Engingeers about this,</p>
<p>from Jan, 16, 2016. I have the replies on my desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HappyHolidays,</p>

<h3> tsbarnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Managing media on Ovi Share</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone know if there's any possible way to work with multiple files in Ovi Share? &nbsp;Somehow a large upload I did ended up in there four or five times, so four copies each of roughly 40 pictures. &nbsp;It would be ridiculous to try and clean it up one-by-one,
 but I can't find any other way to manage the files. &nbsp;Any ideas, am I missing something on the site, are there any applications to manage Ovi Share, etc?</p>

<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Look at the number display on the screen. The number indicates the DEP status which reads as follows:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>§<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>1 =AlwaysOn – DEP is enabled for all processes</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>§<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>2 =OptIn – DEP is enabled for Windows system components and services (this is the default setting)</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>To disable DEP</span><span>, follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Start menu and type in cmd and right click on it and select run as administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>At the command prompt, type in ‘bcdedit.exe/set {current} nx Always Off’ (without quotes).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Now, you should receive a message saying ‘Operation Completed Successfully’.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Restart the computer, DEP /No Execute should now be disable.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This did not work.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Then I tried the powershell script - but that didn't work either.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I'm quite frustrated that I didn't want the upgrade, it forced its way in, now I can not perform my normal duties.
