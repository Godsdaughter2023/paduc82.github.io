            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums
<br />
where there will be others with the same model and there might be known issues. &nbsp;As<br />
OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their supplied drivers.<br />
<br />
There are two versions of the HP - PhotoSmart D110 - a and b<br />

            <p>Hi Niklas,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community!</p>
<p><br />
I understand that your computer shuts down and you get OUC. EXE error. I will try to help you with this issue.</p>
<p><br />
1) Have you made any changes prior to the issue?<br />
2) When exactly do you receive the OUC. EXE error?<br />
3) When exactly does the computer shut down?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p><br />
Step 1: Could you check if the same issue occurs in safe mode.<br />
Please follow the below link on how to boot the Computer in safe mode.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p><br />
Step 2: Perform clean boot to check whether it is a software conflict issue.<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
<br />
Clean boot:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
Note: After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state” in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.<br />
</p>
<p>Method 2: Perform a Virus scan on your Computer by clicking the link below<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p><br />
Please post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that you can utilize to get the issue resolved.<br />
We look forward to hearing back from you.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Update 1803 Destroyed My Computer. Can&#39;t load windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deliofernandez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update 1803 Destroyed My Computer. Can&#39;t load windows anymore</h2>
                    I recently bought an Alienware Aurora R7, which came with Windows 10 Home installed, after about 3 months of using the computer, I checked updates for Windows (I always check updates every month) and saw there was an update for Windows 10 Version 1803.
 I proceeded to install the update, and then I clicked restart after the update was downloaded. The system restarted, but when it tried to boot up, It gave the BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) and gave error 0xc000021a, I checked on Microsoft's website about the
 error and tried to fix it, but it didn't work. At the end, I had to reinstall Windows with the Dell OS Recovery Tool. After I reinstalled Windows, everything was good to go, but then my computer updated again, so now I have the same issue. Please Help

            Hi DelioFernandez ... sorry you are having issues with updates but seems there is incompatible software or hardware that is causing this issue.
<br />Can you get into safe mode and do a clean boot at all?
<br />See link.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />If not, then you will need to rebuild your PC as you have done previously to get it up and running.
<br />make sure you are NOT connected to internet and then login.
<br />Go to start - settings - update and security - advanced.
<br />Pause the feature updates for 365 days.
<br />Pause the quality updates for 30 days.
<br />Then connect to internet and see if your machine functions.
<br />Don't install any apps at first... let it run with no apps installed to see if it  is hardware issue.  
<br />If works fine then install one app let it run see if it works, then the next etc.

            Im having a hard time even booting up with a new OS installed. I'll try other ways and see if this works, since it doesn't even bother to load windows, it just restarts

            The computer only shows the Alienware logo, but doesn't show the loading screen. I'm trying to install a new OS from the cloud and see if that works. As far as if I can get into safe mode, no, I can't get into safe mode

            I can't create one of those since my computer came with specific drivers, which the normal windows installer doesn't have. I already have an USB with Windows 10 on it, so if this doesn't work, then I'll try with the Windows 10 installer

<h3> jonderonde1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer preview pane</h2>
                    <p>every time windows 10 updates it kills the preview pane(Window) in the windows explorer app. I know we did not always have this option back in the old days (Windows 3.1.1) But it is very useful.
</p>
<p>It is a big time waster trying to make it work again.</p>
<p>Please do something to make it work again without wasting my valuable time.</p>
<p>Have you a quick fix.</p>

    <title>DVD&#47;CD ROM on my new Acer does not work properly with Windows7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mobi dark  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD&#47;CD ROM on my new Acer does not work properly with Windows7</h2>
                    &nbsp;<span>I recently bought a new Acer Aspire 4736 Notebook to replace my old Dell, and was persuaded to run Windows 7 on it, rather than buy a new copy of XP.
<br />
<br />
When I turned on my new machine I found that the shop had already installed an old version of W7 on it but it was completely unusable. The dashes in the search bar and the dots in the address bar kept running out of control across the screen and I couldn't
 stop them and input any text. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, I downloaded a new copy of W7 using my desk top and installed it on the Acer. This seemed to solve the problems and I started to set up everything - downloaded Window Live, anti virus software etc.
<br />
<br />
Then after a day or so the old problem came back again and I could not use the machine. So I re- installed W7 from my disk, and chose the'format' option to reformat the disk and get rid of the old programmes completely. This solved the old problem, and I reinstalled
 Windows Live, anti virus software and some other programmes which worked fine.<br />
<br />
At first the DVD ROM worked fine. I played a DVD movie, no problem. Then I tried again and the window froze. I tried to to close the programme from the task manager ("not responding") but it would not respond. So I opted to log off, but it wouldn't log off,
 and eventually had to "crash close " the machine. Upon restart, the DVD worked OK.<br />
<br />
Then I wanted to install some propriety software (legal) from CD's. The first time the disk was shown as present and I even got a list of the files. But when I clicked 'set up' the window froze, and I had exactly the same problem as above and had to crash close
 the machine.<br />
<br />
The next time I couldn't even get the computer to show the disc as present. Restarted, got the disk details showing on the screen but as soon as I right clicked,the window froze etc etc. Tried different discs, including the DVD which had previously worked and
 the same problem - frozen windows and had to crash close the machine.<br />
<br />
Also, upon restart the machine will invariably show that the disc present is the previous disk which has already been removed and replaced.<br />
<br />
I have tried 'repairing', (no problems reported) and restoring to a previous point, but still the same problem.<br />
<br />
As this is a brand new machine - I would like some advice as to whethere it is a faulty Acer, or W7 that is causing the problems.
<br />

            Hi Mobi Dark,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses, I understand you have loaded XP on the system at this time.&nbsp; If you do choose to go back to Windows 7, it sounds as though you may have encountered at least a couple of different issues.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Possibly the Driver for the DVD ROM should have been reinstalled using the Troubleshoot Compatibility mode.&nbsp; I would download the most recent driver for the DVD onto the desktop of the system, if it's not Windows 7, then at least XP and written in the correct
 bit ---X86 or X64--of what you are running-----browse to the folder you have the driver downloaded, right click the file that is the equivalent to SETUP.EXE and Select TROUBLESHOOT COMPATIBILITY.&nbsp; It will run the Troubleshoot Compatibility TOOL and then give
 and Option to TRY WINDOWS RECOMMENDED SETTINGS if it finds a possible workaround.&nbsp; -------This is if you are actually seeing the DVD drive in Windows Explorer, because from the sound of the information provided you were also encounter the Upper and Lower Filters
 needing to be reset. ---I'll get to that in a moment.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Next the original issue with the DVD freezing sounds as though it may have been a CODEC's issue.&nbsp; A codecs is the COMPRESSION/DECOMPRESSION of the file that is being played.&nbsp; There are many CODECS available to all kinds of media.&nbsp; If that occurs again,
 check the file extension of the file you are playing and try to download the latest codec for it.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Last, if you are having issues where the DVD viewed in Windows Explorer is the same as the one that was removed from the system previously, the UPPER AND LOWER FILTERS should be deleted.&nbsp; Here are the steps for resolving that;<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Start</strong></p>
<div>
<div>, and then click <strong>All Programs</strong>.</div>
</li><li>Click <strong>Accessories</strong>, and then click <strong>
Run</strong>. </li><li>Type <span>regedit</span>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>. </li><li>In the navigation pane, locate and then click the following registry subkey:
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</div>
</li><li>In the right pane, click <strong>UpperFilters</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You may also see an UpperFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry. Click
<strong>UpperFilters</strong> only. If you do not see the UpperFilters registry entry, you still might have to remove the LowerFilters registry entry. To do this, go to step 8.
</li><li>On the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, click <strong>
Delete</strong>. </li><li>When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click <strong>
Yes</strong>. </li><li>In the right pane, click <strong>LowerFilters</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If you do not see the LowerFilters registry entry, unfortunately this content cannot help you any further. Go to the
<span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/GettingReadyforWindows7/thread/#nextsteps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Next Steps"
</a></span>section for information about how you can find more solutions or more help on the Microsoft Web site.
</li><li>On the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, click <strong>
Delete</strong>. </li><li>When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click <strong>
Yes</strong>. </li><li>Exit Registry Editor. </li><li>Restart the computer </li></ol>
<p>That excerpt was taken from the following VISTA KB ARTICLE&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060</a>&nbsp; - the steps are primarily the same, I am including it incase you need it for future reference.<br />
<br />
Primarily the issues experienced seem to be driver related and possibly the copy of Windows 7 RC that was downloaded may be corrupted.&nbsp; Some downloads from sites outside of Microsoft sites have been found to install virus'.&nbsp; Not sure in this instance, but,
 do want to assist you with any complications that are being experienced.<br />

<h2>            Display driver problem with Philips 230E on an ATI Radeon HD 4200</h2>
                    My problem is that usually while play a game the screen will freeze for about 15secs then take me to desktop where a message is saying that my display driver had stopped working but then recovered itself, however my game will be froze usually creating
 an inconvenience. I have fully updated the drivers to the best of my knowledge, problem persists.

            <p>Problem solved! Bought the&nbsp;&lt;Product information removed&gt; and it had found 204 problems with my registry (56 more problems that a different cleaner could not find) and fixed them all! Not only did this fix my display problem but the computer runs incredibly
 faster, everything from windows itself and all games load nearly instantly. Could not be happier paying the $30 or so for the program. BTW this program is what Windows recommends to fix the problem... I'm surprised that so many people have the same problem
 yet a registry cleaning program fixed it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Smoothest / best:<br />
Purchase a new (or refurbished) computer with more modern hardware and software that is supported with Windows 10 from the manufacturer(s) from a legitimate and reliable source. &nbsp;Could have Windows 7 or 8.1 installed and you will still be eligible for the free
 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other: Verify the hardware and software you have in/installed on the computer is supported by the manufacturers with - in my opinion - at least Windows 8. &nbsp;If everything is supported up to THERE you will be more likely to be able to perform a GENERAL smooth
 transition. &nbsp;Then PURCHASE a Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 license and product key and upgrade from Vista to it. &nbsp;If you don't care about your programs/settings/etc. - get Windows 8/8.1. &nbsp;If you want to bring EVERYTHING along for the ride and not have to re-install
 much (if anything) - get Windows 7. &nbsp;(Although good luck finding a legitimate Windows 7 upgrade package - not an OEM copy or something.) &nbsp;Then upgrade that (freely) to Windows 10 - fixing any software/hardware incompatibilities along the way.</p>

            <p>Since there is no free Upgrade from Vista to Windows 10, it would have overwritten your Vista install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should always have your files backed up externally if you value them because the hard drive can fail at any time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look in C: drive for a Windows.old folder which holds your previous OS if you didnt' wipe the hard drive before install.&nbsp; Browse into the folder to your User folders to copy your files out to the Windows 10 folders for them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're sure you have everything from the windows.old folder including any stored mail or bookmarks you might have also failed to backup, you can delete it using Disk Cleanup s,electing System Files.&nbsp;

<h2>            NVIDIA issues with Windows 10</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 Pro (x64) recently downloaded the latest NVIDIA drivers (9.18.13.4192 - Quadro FX770M) and now is stuck in a rebooting loop. &nbsp;It is unable to get past the first graphical screen. &nbsp;Once in a while it gets to the log on screen where it says (Please
 wait) then the screen goes black, then reports that there is a VIDEO TDR FAILURE (nvlddmkm.sys).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am unable to access Windows or the logon screen, so I rebuilt the system. &nbsp;However, it keeps downloading the update. &nbsp;The only way around the issue is to wait for it to install the update after another rebuild then disable the device before the system
 reboots. &nbsp;However, that results in a lack of performance and obvious graphic issues, but it allows me to at least work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking around the internet I am not the only person having issues with this, I have tried numerous so called solutions (i.e. sfc, wsreset, etc), here are some of the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download the drivers direct from Nvidia with a fresh install - Installed and presented the same issues, suggesting a fault with the Nvidia driver.</p>
<p>2. Extract the nvlddmkm.sys from the Nvidia pack and manually place it in the correct directory - obvisouly failed but tried it anyway.</p>
<p>3. Rolling back the driver - reported once there was no previous driver and after another rebuild rolled back then updated them again to the problem version.</p>
<p>4. System restore - same as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had these issues before with Nvidia updates, but it is getting beyond a joke now and appears to be getting worse, instead of the BSOD every so often, I now have a system which is now stuck in a loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is being done to resolve this issue as it is not an isolated incident? &nbsp;What discussion is happening between Microsoft and Nvidia to resolve this? &nbsp;Microsoft stopping automatic device updates? &nbsp;Nvidia working on a reason why this keeps happening every
 update? &nbsp;Both companies working on why this keeps happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or has anyone got a solution that works, i.e. bespoke Nvidia drivers?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to refer the steps below and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: Sometimes, your PC’s external devices can be the cause of problems. Try unplugging all your devices, and then plugging them in one at a time.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re seeing a black screen, there might be a connection problem with your PC or display.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If you’re using a desktop PC, check to see if&nbsp;your display is plugged in and turned on. Also, try connecting to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different video outputs on your PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent to a different display adapter or
 output. </span></li><li><span>If you have a TV connected to your PC, make sure it's turned on and set to the input for your PC.
</span></li><li><span>Try projecting to a different monitor. Press the Windows logo key &nbsp;<span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Block the driver update causing the issue.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You cannot stop Automatic Windows updates on Windows 10 but you can block certain updates for any particular driver. I suggest you to refer the steps provided by Rohit Chettri on the below thread link to block update of a driver software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update/how-to-block-automatic-reinstall-of-a-driver-or/bff07224-4ce2-4b42-ab29-68c3a305d730"><span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update/how-to-block-automatic-reinstall-of-a-driver-or/bff07224-4ce2-4b42-ab29-68c3a305d730</span></a><span>

            <p>The system I am using is a laptop, I have removed all attached devices during my own fault finding procedures.&nbsp; However, I am confused by your advice, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before even "Step 1", I stated that I am using a Quadro FX770M which is a laptop graphics card. &nbsp; That concerns me because you seem to be giving me generic adivce, which demonstrates your are not intrested and giving throw away comments, for the following
 reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your post: "<span>If you’re using a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
desktop PC,</span> check to see if&nbsp;your display is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
plugged in and turned on</span>. Also, try connecting to different video outputs on your PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent to a different display adapter or output."</span>&nbsp; That suggests you have not read or researched my post
 or looked at the information I have provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: You stated "<span>If you’re seeing a black screen, there might be a connection problem with your PC or display", despite me stating I am using a Quadro FX770M (a laptop display chipset) and that I also stated that "</span>the screen goes black, then
 reports that there is a VIDEO TDR FAILURE (nvlddmkm.sys)".&nbsp; Although this occurs rarely, would mean the monitor is connected and working between black outs.<br />
</p>
<p>Step 2:&nbsp; This step did not work, and I only tried through<strong> </strong><span>d</span><span>esperation</span>, because I am left with an OS which does not take advantage
 of my system.&nbsp; Have you even read the thread and what subscribers states? &nbsp; I have, it is full of people with issues and problems, therefore&nbsp; I am back to a system where I have to disable the device driver, so I can block the updates but left with an OS which
 is not working to its full potential and had only a temporary work around.</p>

            <p>Ok... i dont' know how &amp; why, but i resolved this issue with my Nvidia card. (I'll translate it in english, the best i can)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a Windows 10 home 32 bit installed with multiple problems with my Nvidia card after the uptdate 1511. Before that update, it was working relatively great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried every possible way to correct this situation... no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i reinstalled Windows 7 home 64 bit (anyway, my 16 bit games won't work with windows 10). I installed only my sound card and my Geforce Nvidia driver... nothing more. I updated this 64 bit system upto the Windows 10 upgrade. I created (in windows 10)
 a ISO DVD to be able to do a complete fresh installation of Windows 10 home 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this time... WITH NO CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET in the Windows 10 fresh install. Once done, i installed my sound card driver and the latest driver for my Nvidia card. Then it worked... and i reconnect to internet to activate windows and do the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RESULT: It seems to work without any problem after 2 days of test.</p>

            <p>I was going to do some testing this weekend, doing a complete rebuild, as this problem has now 'bricked' my laptop and is stuck in a reboot loop, therefore I cannot access safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try out your process with the networking switched off and use drivers downloaded and saved to CD. &nbsp;If it does work, my main concern is when another driver update rolls out, thank you for your reply.<br />

            You maybe onto something here, did the same before the rebuild, managed to get all the way to the logon screen and put the laptop in safe mode boot. Disabled the graphics card and rebooted. &nbsp;Installed the sound card driver over the default Microsoft driver,
 enabled the graphics card and rebooted. &nbsp;I was able to get to the logon screen and logon each reboot. &nbsp;However, it would still crash with TRD error at some point during every time after I had logged on but this is the longest it has worked so far between crashes.

</blockquote>
<p>If your clean installed failed (and i assumed that it was done without any internet since the beginning), i don't know what could it be done after that. My experience was made with a desktop. It's probably different and, your drivers should come from your
 laptop company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of my friend have resolved this issue like me and the others are stuck again like you. The only common thing among them is they're using Nvidia cards. I don't know if is Microsoft or Nvidia to blame. But from my experience, Nvidia is much more quick
 and encline to deliver a solution... and fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, Windows 10 is about to FLOP with all these issues. People told Microsoft, very long before the released of Windows 10, that mandatory drivers given by Windows update was a big mistake. They didn't listen. To add to this, they continue to stick
 with this problem... even if everyone knows it failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes... and yes... it's probably Microsoft's fault. The last 5 years wasn't enough to understand what's the consumers want. Anyway, they're big enough to continue like this for several years. Now, i want a PS4 or a steam machine. I want a chromebook and my
 android phone. For the office, everyone is looking for Linux and openoffice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish you luck (and for me too), my experience with Windows 10 give me a ''blip'' for the future.</p>

            Don't worry, W10 was fully forking on the P8Z77-V during the consumer preview. &nbsp;And I think that the W8.1 driver are compatible with W10.

            This is not true. The P8Z77-V has an issue where the RTC wake up and system idle (starts screen saver) does not work on this board.

            <p>Let mew clarify, I am using this motherboard presently with Windows 10 release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P8Z77-V</p>
<p>i7-2600k over clocked</p>
<p>Nvidia GTX 660 2GB card</p>
<p>16GB ram</p>
<p>256 Mushkin SATA3 SSD</p>
<p>3 additional platter drives</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using this motherboard upgraded without any issues from Window 7 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows 10 pro, not preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue I have is that screensaver and power saving will not activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get the RTC to work by using the windows 8.1 64 bit drivers from the asus support page, and the onyl ones I had to update manually were the Intel engine and the chipset driver. no other drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been no other issues with Windows.</p>

            Reverse Key or Reverse 10-key in data entry refers to the use of numbers within the letter keys. The original keypunch machines and early data entry terminals used what is now considered reverse key. The nine on the top row is the 0, U the 1, I the 2,
 O the 3, J the 4, K the 5, L the 6, M the 7, the command key is the 8 and the period key is the 9. To change from alpha to numerical the keyer holds down the shift key. Actually data entry is much easier with reverse key as it eliminates the transition from
 alpha keys to the numeric keypad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Data entry is the act of keying in data. best explaintion I could find on the web

    <title>Windows 8 Registry and Norton Utilities - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikek703  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Registry and Norton Utilities</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Norton Utilities v16 and ran a Registry Scan for the first time.&nbsp; Windows 8 came with the computer, which is just two weeks old. The scan resulted in over 2,000 items that need repair.&nbsp; Half of them are in the Add/Remove programs category
 and 780 in the deep scan.&nbsp; Frankly, I am afraid to click&nbsp;"repair."&nbsp; I believe these problem areas are due to the applications that came with Windows that I have not activated.&nbsp; What will happen to these applications if I select repair?&nbsp; Will they still be
 available for use?&nbsp; I hate the idea of just doing it and then having to rely on the Windows Restore feature in case of problems.&nbsp; Restore in Windows 7 never worked but&nbsp;at least&nbsp;Norton Utilities always succeeded in repairing the Windows 7 registry without any
 problems.&nbsp; Any advice?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>LOL.. 2000 items that DON"T need repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows 9x registry needed attention because its maximum size was small and users used to install and uninstall masses of utilities, game demos and worthless programs from diskettes found on every computer magazine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regclean 4 only ever removed the absolute safest entries, and if there wasn't enough safe entries to remove, Windows 9x would crash, forcing a re-install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Windows NT, the registry in the true 32-bit Windows operating systems have not had the same problem as their Windows 9x COUSINS. They IGNORE orphaned entries. Also, the maximum size of the Windows 7 and 8 registry is 2gb, and I doubt if yours has passed

<p>I am running Windows 7 Professional, and I have installed "windows xp Mode" and Virtual machines (along with the updates)</p>
<p>When in the windows XP mode, everything will be acting as normal, then a blue screen error will flash up. There is no time to read it, as it just restarts automatically...normally losing all my work.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;affect Windows 7 at all, or the virtual machine program/windows xp mode, just the instance of windows xp</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>Was just given this error code after the restart</p>

<h2>            Online printer not recognized as online</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 7 professional from Vista Business. After upgrade, I was able to access a wireless HP C4380 series multi function printer thru my LAN. Now for some reason, I can not longer print to this printer. When I run the troubleshooter,
 it tells me the printer is off line and to turn on the printer. I have turned it off and back on and it still shows up as offline, both in the troubleshooter and in the control panel device window. I have not made any other changes to the computer or installed
 any new hardware or software. It just stopped working one morning. <br />
<br />
I checked the router via my admin access and all devices are visible to the router. So why is the printer not visible as online to Windows 7, all of a sudden. As I said, it worked for weeks, now it is invisible.

            The IP address for the printer has changed.&nbsp; Create a new Standard TCP/IP Port for the device but use the Hostname for the device rather than the transient IP assigned by the router.

                    <p>Hi! so I have a question about something I did the other night. I was going to move my PC but before that, I had to shut it down. when choosing if I wanted to restart or shut down it said ``shut down and update´´. I pressed it and my computer went all quiet
 and had shut down or so I thought. obviously, I had to unplug the computer to move it so I unplugged it as soon as it shut down but now when I try to start it, it just won´t start up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I have not been able to try and hold the power button since it doesn't&nbsp;work on my computer, reasons unknown.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Timmy
<br />
<br />Thank you for that information.
<br />
<br />If the system does not power on at all, this could be a sign of either power supply unit failure or the motherboard is not dead. 
<br />
<br />You can unplug it for 24 hours, reconnect it then check if it powers on. Other options you can also try include swapping out memory modules. 
<br />
<br />If none of those work, then its either PSU or the motherboard.

Figured it out on my own. I had to enter the addresses of all contacts in People, which also created them in outlook. Then went into Excel and in the toolbar created an excel document which listed all contacts and addresses and filed that in My Documents, then
 went into Word and in the toolbar followed the steps for creating a label list and merged the Excel contacts during the address label creation steps.&nbsp;

            <p>Could you be a little more specific about the Excel part?? You mentioned you go into Excel and in the "toolbar" created an excel document that listed all contacts? There's so many tabs and buttons I haven't the slightest idea what I would click to do this.
 Are you referring to template screen before even opening Excel??</p>

</p><p>I don't understand why the "People" app doesn't just let you print from the app. This seems like a LOT of work just to print the information that I just spent hours entering into the App only to realize I can't even print it out now...</p>

            I agree. We should be able to print from the people app.

            No ability to print contacts is ridiculous. The Excel/Word work around is also ridiculous. Microsoft ought to chime in and provide an answer and develop a simple app Word or Word Pad app add on for that purpose. Perhaps there is a contacts.csv work around
 that's easier, but then when changes are made to contacts, a new file has to be created.

<p>This is a large problem for most people.&nbsp; I have tried everything and nothing works!&nbsp; I have wasted hours and hours on such a simple thing.&nbsp; Why they won't fix it like it used to be, I don't know.&nbsp; BUT I did finally come up with a system that worked for
 me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open whatever word processing program you have.&nbsp; Set the blank page for two columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; If you have a large enough screen, move that window to the right.&nbsp; (Windows key; right arrow) Open "Contacts" and move the window to the left.&nbsp; (Windows key; left arrow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; On your "paper" in the top left corner, type the name of the first person on your list.&nbsp; I recommend bold print. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; On the Contacts, be sure you have all the information for that person showing in on the right pane.&nbsp; If "See more" is highlighted, be sure the click so you have ALL the information showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Use the Snipping Tool to highlight and cut the phone number, address and any notes you have in their file.&nbsp; Save the snip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Paste the snip under the name on your sheet of paper.&nbsp; Space down about 3 lines and type the name of the next person on your list. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; Repeat steps 4 thru 6 until you have transferred all your contacts information onto a printable form.&nbsp; Then save and print!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tired everything else.&nbsp; I don't WANT an Excel spread sheet that I have to tape together and use a ruler to follow!&nbsp; I tried exporting my contacts and it would only export 26.&nbsp; I have 107!!!!&nbsp; I just want a simple 8 1/2 X 11 sheet of paper showing
 name, address and telephone number.&nbsp; It should NOT be this hard...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the next time the electricity is off in a storm, I have a hard copy I can use.&nbsp; And I won't have to sit in the middle of a parking lot somewhere calling 8 relatives trying to get the number of that cousin I hardly ever call during the next family emergency.&nbsp;
 I have it now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have missed a step in the above instructions, I apologize.&nbsp; At least I have pointed you in a workable direction.</p>
        </p>
