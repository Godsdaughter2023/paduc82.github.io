<h3> matthewhochstein  say:</h3>
<h2>            My windows 8 Asus laptop is stuck in PXE ROM</h2>
                    <p>My laptop fell of a bunk bed and than said that it was fixing disk errors</p>
<p>my laptop died and then whenever I turned it on it would go to bios</p>
<p>i read a forum about it and tried enabling cms and PXE something and reset, thinking it would fix my computer (it said that would fix it), and now my laptop is stuck on PXE ROM, I read forums on that and tried to press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, and it dissapeered,
 flashed the Asus screen I saw before it went into PXE ROM, and it went right back to PXE ROM, how do I get out of PXE ROM for good and get my computer back to windows?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you dropped it and it said it was trying to fix Drive errors, the Hard Drive has probably failed and needs to be replaced and the Operating System reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are normally 3 possible&nbsp;reasons for that error you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. BIOS Boot Order set to Boot to Network: Check BIOS settings for Boot Order.</p>
<p>2. <span>Check cable connections between Motherboard and Hard Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Failed Hard Drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>_________________________________________</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can check the Hard Drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; look for your Computer's specifications &gt; find out brand of Hard Drive &gt; go to Hard Drive Manufacturer's website &gt; find and download Hard Drive Diagnostic software and make a Bootable disk from it on the Computer
 you are using to get here, following their instructions &gt; test your Hard Drive to see if it has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can also use this Method to test your Hard Drive:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update Breaks Network, need a fix &#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> albertfairfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Breaks Network, need a fix &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So ive posted a few times already, basically just keep getting fobbed of, following the same advice which doesnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here it goes long story short,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC worked fine</p>
<p>After Update, the network card does not work with the new update, wired or wireless.</p>
<p>To fix this the only way i could manage to get the network back working was to roll back to a previous version of windows, voila, everythings fine, however every time i turned the PC on Windows would automatically update again forcing me to roll back again,
 so i used this forum and was shown how to turn of auto updates from happening and for few weeks this was fine. Then one day while being used it restarted itself and starting updating, and i knew i would have to roll back in order to use the internet again
 however this time when it completed, before the login screen a new error message appeared, "windows is not installed, please install windows"...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So using a usb flashdrive i created the bootable installation for windows, repair wasnt an option for some reason, nor was fix so i had to reinstall windows , upon being asked which version of windows 10 i had i was not sure so i just went with the option that
 was already selected, upon finishing i realised i had the wrong version because i couldnt activate it, however the internet was working, so i reinstalled it to the correct version, and windows was activated, however now the same bloody problem, cannot connect
 to any network wired or wireless, and now i dont even have a previous version of windows to roll back to.</p>
<p><br />
I really need some help, is there some way i can manually download an older windows 10 update, put it on a usb and use it to restore the windows update to an older one? Ive been trying to figure this out for weeks, no fix seems to work and no one seems to know
 any answers other then have you tried the troubleshooter? The Pc wasnt even a month old before the update was pushed and its useless without being on a network.<br />

<p>Probably just the case...&nbsp; which speaking of case... if you don't have any info, you might need to open the case up and find a few key details:&nbsp; who built the motherboard, and who build the network card (if separate) so you can get the right drivers for

<p>Try opening "System Information" and look in the Network section, maybe it can identify who built the network card and then we can go to that company's site to get the driver you need.&nbsp; Here's an example from my computer (the network card was built the the
 Realtek company):</p>

            Great deal -- get the driver for it from them directly.&nbsp; If the system isn't able to connect, you might need to use another computer to get it, then use a USB stick or something to take it to the computer having the trouble.

            Thanks for the reply, I did download a driver for my card, but when trying to "update" the driver the folder i downloaded doesnt show up as an option, i saw a post about a guy who having very similar problem as me, and they suggested to him to install
 a previous version, i think thats what im going to do, only im not to sure how i can find the version my pc would of had at Christmas time.

<p>That's not usually possible. And even if it was, it only delays the issue for a few months. All updates on Windows 10 or mandatory, the only way to prevent them forever is to unplug from the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
How are you installing the driver?&nbsp; some drivers come with a setup program that you can just double click, and other times you have to go to device manager and choose the file yourself.</p>

                    <p>Hello so I have an HP Laser Jet M252dw. I have been experiencing issues with this printer for some time. I am unable to print a test page from the properties window but I am able to print documents from my Google Chrome&nbsp;browser. The printer is connected
 via WiFi to my home network and is easily detectable by my desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop is a Windows 7 device and I have the printer installed via different methods. First I tried the native windows installer which properly detects the printer on my network and it accurately recognizes the IP address and model information. However,
 when I try to print a test page it fails immediately with an error message from windows "Test page failed to print..." I try to print from word and nothing happens, no files are entered into the queue and I do not receive an error message. However, I AM able
 to print from google chrome with no delays at all. I have already tried uninstalling the printer and have even downloaded the proper HP software wizard which is able to successfully&nbsp;identify and install my network printer. The HP wizard prompts&nbsp;for a test
 page which successfully&nbsp;prints but when I try to print from word or a test page via the printer properties window it always fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried creating a static IP address for my printer and manually adding the port in the printer properties with no change in behavior. I honestly do not think there is anything wrong with the printer installation but perhaps something wrong with
 the windows print spooler? I disabled and restarted the print spooler in the services menu with no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This printer has worked before with my home network and my desktop. The only change that has occurred&nbsp;is a reset of my computer due to updates and a power down of my network which would have reset most of the DHCP addresses. Hence why I tried a static IP
 with the printer itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try googling "printer only prints from chrome" but I get no results. Has anyone seen this issue or have some suggestions? Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The symptoms you describe are going to be difficult to diagnose through an online forum like this.&nbsp; There's likely to be a bit of back and forth questioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Devices and Printers, take a screenshot of the Devices and Printers window, and include it in your reply.&nbsp; For directions, see

<p>
</p><p>Right-click on the icon for your HP LaserJet Pro M252dw and select "Printer properties".&nbsp; Select the "Ports" tab.&nbsp; Click and drag on the faint vertical line in the header row between "Port" and "Description" so you can see the full width of the "Port" column.&nbsp;
 Report what is in the "Port" column for the line that is checked and highlighted.&nbsp; Click "Cancel" to close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Chrome and press CTRL+P to open the normal Chrome print dialog.&nbsp; What is the complete name shown as the "Destination"?&nbsp; Confirm that if you click "Print" here you can print to your printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the print dialog is still open in Chrome, click the "Cancel" button to close it.&nbsp; Now press CTRL+SHIFT+P.&nbsp; This should open the standard Windows "Print" dialog box.&nbsp; Can you select the M252dw here and successfully print to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Print a configuration page:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is the printer's IP address shown on the configuration page the same as shown in the "Port" column of "Printer properties" above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you enter this IP address in a web browser, do you get to the printer's Embedded Web Server page?</p>

<p>Hello thank you for your reply, I will try to answer all of your questions here:</p>
<p>This is the current setting for the port as established by the HP software wizard. I have previously manually created a port with just the static IP I set for the printer with the same results.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5afb127-e814-4e4e-bfe1-fbdba409c60e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5afb127-e814-4e4e-bfe1-fbdba409c60e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>When I enable the Chrome printer dialogue&nbsp;it accurately&nbsp;displays my printer "HPColor..." and successfully&nbsp;prints. When I use the windows print dialogue (ctrl+shift+p) from this webpage (still in chrome) I am able to successfully print using the accurate
 printer name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to print from Word I am able to choose the same printer name as in Chrome but nothing happens</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4a2f4be-fae2-499d-a647-fabc02192cc5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4a2f4be-fae2-499d-a647-fabc02192cc5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The IP address for my printer is currently still the static IP I manually set. When I enter this address into chrome I successfully receive the webpage for printer configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3dfd612-f06d-44c8-8dda-5e0c5983ab52?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3dfd612-f06d-44c8-8dda-5e0c5983ab52?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><p>Please let me know if you need any other info I may have left out. Thanks again for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for all the information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Can you print from Word to the Brother printer (or to the Adobe PDF printer or to the Microsoft XPS Document Writer)?
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you print from Notepad to the HP M252?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You already said that you could NOT print using the "Print Test Page" button in the "Printer properties" dialog box, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you try to print from one of the places that doesn't print (e.g., from Word), if you right-click on the printer in Devices and Printers and select "See what's printing" is there a print job stuck in the queue?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>**********************************************************************************************************************</strong></p>
<p>The following may or may not apply to you (the threads are for Windows 10), but see if starting Word "as administrator" will allow you to print.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>See these two threads:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/1321258-i-cannot-print-a-windows-10-test-page-or-from-word-2010excel-2010outlook-2010-but-can-print-from-chrome-and-edge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/1321258-i-cannot-print-a-windows-10-test-page-or-from-word-2010excel-2010outlook-2010-but-can-print-from-chrome-and-edge/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Inkjet-Printing/Can-t-print-from-Office-2010-with-Windows-10-except-from/m-p/5995515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Inkjet-Printing/Can-t-print-from-Office-2010-with-Windows-10-except-from/m-p/5995515</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In particular, post #10 in the second thread says that fixing the permissions for your TEMP folder may cure the problem.&nbsp; As that post explains, the default location for the TEMP folder is %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp&nbsp; If you want to confirm this, open
 a Command Prompt window, type the following and press Enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo %temp%</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigate to your TEMP folder (remember that AppData is a "hidden" folder), right-click on it and select "Properties" and select the "Security" tab to see the permissions.&nbsp; If your user account does not have "Full control" permission and you can't set it,
 you'll have to "Take Ownership" of the folder.&nbsp; If you need instructions for this, just ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*****************************************************************************************************</strong></p>
If everything else fails to help, the only other thing I can think of doing is resetting the Windows printing system.&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>You should try the "light" method described below first, but I suspect that if anything works it will be the "full" method, which should restore the printing subsystem to almost the state it was in when Windows was first installed.&nbsp; The main drawback to
 the "full" method is that it will remove all printers other than Microsoft Fax and the XPS Document Writer.&nbsp; You'll have to re-install any other printers you want to use.&nbsp; To reinstall the Adobe PDF printer, see
<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/add-pdf-printer-manually.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/add-pdf-printer-manually.html</a></p>

<li>Microsoft used to have two automated "Fix it" routines for resetting the Windows 7 print system.&nbsp; You can read a little about them here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2793718/you-experience-print-spooler-error-messages-after-installing-or-upgrad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2793718/you-experience-print-spooler-error-messages-after-installing-or-upgrad<br />
</a></li><li>Unfortunately, in its zeal to move all of its customers to Windows 10, Microsoft has "retired" many of its Windows 7-related tools, and the two "Fix it" routines discussed in the above article are casualties of that policy (as&nbsp; you will see if you click
 on the "Fix it" links in the article).&nbsp; Fortunately, the PowerShell "guts" of those routines has been preserved (see the "More Information" section of the above article).&nbsp; The script has been moved to a new URL:
<a href="https://github.com/jdickson289/Print-Reset-Tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://github.com/jdickson289/Print-Reset-Tool/<br />
</a></li><li>For details, click the ReadMe link at the github.com site or see <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2012/02/24/microsoft-fixit-for-printing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2012/02/24/microsoft-fixit-for-printing/</a> (or see step 8 below).<br />
</li><li>Download print-reset.ps1 from the github link above and save it someplace that you'll remember.&nbsp; Don't just click the link (that will just show you the source code).&nbsp; Depending on what browser you use, right-click and "Save as" or "Save link as" or the
 like (or click the big green "Clone or download" button, download the zip file, and then extract the print-reset.ps1 file).<br />
</li><li>Click Start, type Powershell into the Search box, right-click on the link to PowerShell and select "Run as administrator."&nbsp; Respond as needed to the UAC prompt.<br />
</li><li>Type the following command into the blue PowerShell window and press Enter.&nbsp; Type Y and press Enter in response to the warning prompt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted<br />
<br />
</li><li><span>&nbsp;</span>Type the full path to the file you saved.&nbsp; For example, if you saved the file in C:\temp you would enter the following<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\temp\print-reset.ps1<br />
</li><li>Type a space after the file name and type either -full or -light and press Enter.<br />
<br />
If you press Enter without typing one of these switches, you'll get the help output that shows what the script will do in full and light modes.&nbsp; See screenshot at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
In any case, then type R and press Enter to actually run the script.&nbsp; Respond with a Y and Enter to any warning.<br />
</li><li>After running the script in -full mode, reboot the computer.&nbsp; Then reinstall your printers.<br />
</li><li>Although you should probably use the -full switch, following is a screen shot of what you would see if you used the -light switch (because I didn't want to reinstall all of my printers).&nbsp; I've circled in red all of the user entries that I typed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad1915ff-f18f-4dbc-ad57-8e58f6378e7c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad1915ff-f18f-4dbc-ad57-8e58f6378e7c?upload=true" /></a></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>11.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span>With respect to the warning in yellow:&nbsp; If you like, you can export all of your print queues (which should be empty) and printer drivers to a file from which you can restore them if things go wrong.&nbsp; The command line version mentioned in the warning
 text (printbrm.exe) is located at C:\Windows\system32\spool\tools but there is a more user-friendly version (PrintBrmUI.exe) located at C:\Windows\system32 (you can run this by clicking Start and typing PrintBrmUI.exe in the Search box).&nbsp; However, given that
 it is unlikely that you have "custom printer configurations," I don't think you need to take this step at all.&nbsp; Just type Y and press Enter after the warning (as I did in the screenshot).<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Download a fresh copy of the driver package for each of the printers you want to reinstall from Brother or HP<br />
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><br />
</span></span></li><li><span>Run the installation package and follow the on-screen connections to connect the printer<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Go to Devices and Printers and confirm (a) that the printer is installed and set as the Default Printer and (b) right-click on the icon, select Printer properties, and click "Print Test Page"</span></li></ol>

<p>Hello, Thank you for all the info. It looks like adding the "full" permission&nbsp;to all users fixed my issue. I am not sure why because my account which is an "administrator" account did have the "full" permission. Weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I wanted to mention that I tried to reset the printing system using the file you mentioned. But I received an error that did not allow me to complete the process. It may be an issue with the file itself based on how the error reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c752b32-f0ce-48cf-b28a-f32e97ad522a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c752b32-f0ce-48cf-b28a-f32e97ad522a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>In any case, I was able to print from word after changing the temp folder permissions. I appreciate&nbsp;your help and research, I couldn't find anything while searching for solutions! Thank you very much!</p>

<p>Sorry.&nbsp; My instructions had an error -- when you attempt to save the link as I mentioned in step 4, you're actually saving a web page coded in HTML rather than the script.&nbsp; I thought that I had used that method before, but if I did, it doesn't work now.&nbsp;
 In any event, what you have to do now is use the big green "Clone or download" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably for the best that the script didn't run -- you didn't have to reinstall everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why changing the permission in that way works -- but I'm glad it did for you.</p>

<p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have better clarity on the issue, please answer the below-listed questions and get back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is your disc a Re-Writable DVD disc or a Writable disc?</li><li>What is the name of the disk?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>A Re-Writable DVD disc is a compact disc that can be written, read arbitrarily many times, erased, and written again.</p>
<p>If you are using a Re-Writable disc, then follow the below steps to erase the contents of the disk completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Erasing the contents of the disk will delete all the data that is present on the disk, so please backup the data before erasing the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that your drive has the ability to write DVDs, otherwise, you won't be able to erase, reformat, or write new data the disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Insert the DVD into your DVD drive and in the <strong>
Autoplay</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Burn files to disk using Windows Explorer</strong>. If you don't see the dialog box, click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>This PC</strong>, and then double-click your DVD drive.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the <strong>Burn a Disk</strong> dialog, type a name for the disk and choose a format for the DVD. There are two different formatting options for rewritable DVDs.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click like a USB flash drive if you want to use the <strong>Live File System format</strong>. These discs can be played in computers, but not in most DVD players. Use this format if you want to back upfiles on your computer. Files will be burned to disc
 as you add them.</li><li>Click with a CD/DVD player if you want to use the <strong>Mastered format</strong>. These discs can be played in CD/DVD players, as well as in computer DVD players. Use this format if you want to playmusic or video from your DVD. Files will be burned to
 disc all at once, when you're done adding them.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once you've selected your formatting method, the drive will prepare the disc. This may take a few moments. After it's finished, you'll be able to start adding files to the disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a shot and let us know of any changes.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 screen is bruising and bleeding. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 screen is bruising and bleeding.</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/916351af-837a-4f29-bc54-014d3cd335eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/916351af-837a-4f29-bc54-014d3cd335eb" /></a>I
 have had a glass screen protector on since the second I opened the box and the keyboard cover is always on. But blotches have appeared on the screen that look like backlight blemishes. Smear type marks that bleed light through dark colors or any color darker
 than white. This is a major pain when creating art with the pen because the image does not display correctly in some spots and especially when watching video.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally thought it was being caused by the type cover keys pressing against the screen, but the&nbsp;protector&nbsp;is hard and there is no flex in the cover. This is the second sp4 I've&nbsp;owned&nbsp;with this problem. I returned the first one&nbsp;thinking it was defective
 because it had a small bruising. The new one has worse backlight bleed and now the bruising backlight bleed&nbsp;is worse than the&nbsp;first one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is happening because the glass is too thin. I noticed that when using the pen on a few sp4s in store without glass screen protectors and you can see the screen flexing and distorting underneath the pen tip with normal pressure. Even touching
 the screen with a finger causes a reaction... very faint one, but its there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had these problems with my surface pro 1. Microsoft advertised that the screen was made extremely thin on the sp4 and this may be the issue. This could be a design flaw. It doesn't appear to affect performance, but it certainly affects the way things
 look and I'm worried it will get even worse and start being a bigger problem. The high resolution display is a big selling point, but if touching the screen causes bruising that allows light to bleed through then what's the benefit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this? Should I just get another one? Or is this going to just be the way it is? Very disappointed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I will post a Youtube video to show what I mean.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Connected User experience is not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like I am the first person that actually needs the service "connected user experiences and telemetry". When I got windows 10 I disabled all I could in the windows settings but did not touch any reg data or smh. After playing some hours of Forza and
 other Xbox&nbsp;games on my windows pc I noticed that "Cueat" not working as I did not get any achievements. I tried to set it to manual start via services.MSC&nbsp;but that does not work as I cannot start the service because the buttons are greyed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any help, would be cool if I could get it working again without having to reset my whole system again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings Liz</p>

<p>Hi Liz_VI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to isolate this issue so that we could find a way to get this fixed. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When playing your games, are you not receiving any achievements after completing some tasks, mission, or challenges?</li><li>Can you tell us what are you trying to manually start under services.msc?</li><li>May I know when did you notice this issue?</li></ul>

            I appreciate for bringing this up. Can you tell us if you were able to receive achievements in other games that you played on your computer even without going to Connected User Experience and Telemetry? Also, are you signed in on the Xbox app when playing
 Forza Horizon 3? <br />
<br />
I agree that you should receive an achievement when you start playing the game. It is possible that there's a delay in providing the achievements in your account. Normally, it should reflect within 24 hours in your account. If it still didn't show up, I recommend
 that you fill up the survey form under <strong>Section 3</strong> on this <em><strong><a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/88E985A3-4139-430C-9400-93771D0C1004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> so that we can raise this to our
 Xbox Achievements Team and let them handle his concern for you.<br />
<br />
Let us know if need further assistance.

<h2>            Windows update reverts files to previous versions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good evening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to open a file that I've been working on for a long time earlier today, I was horrified to discover that all of the changes I had made in the past several weeks (around 20+ hours of work) had mysteriously disappeared. After some digging, I quickly
 found that the file said that the last time it was saved was Oct. 8, 2016, even though I had been working on it since then, and know that I saved it earlier this week. I suspect that this is related to Windows Update, as my computer just installed Update Packs
 KB3197954 and KB3199986 in the past two days. What happened to my file? Is there any way to recover all of the work I put into it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

</p><ul>
<li>The application is the most recent version of Adobe Photoshop.</li><li>I did save it manually, and I do remember the last save location.

            The chances that an update would revert one file to a previous version are vanishingly small.&nbsp; I can't account for what might have happened, but in an earlier post you said that you remember the last save location.&nbsp; Does this mean that you're in the habit
 of saving files in more than one location?<br />

    <title>Constant password requests Windows10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abqhudson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant password requests Windows10.</h2>
                    <p>New computer for my wife has Windows 10. &nbsp;She is the administrator and the only user of this computer. &nbsp;She signs in and provides her password. &nbsp;While trying to work on the computer (Off-Line as we are concerned about hackers and privacy) she must repeatedly
 re-enter her password - very, very annoying. &nbsp;Tried to do away with her password - nothing works - because, I believe, she is the administrator. &nbsp;How can we do away from the repeated requests to reenter her password - seems like if she doesn't enter something
 within a minute or so - she gets another request for a password - 10 times during a recent work session. &nbsp;Extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to set up a new local account for her which did not require a password. &nbsp;Lost all of her previous work setting &nbsp;up the desktop and her ability to use her Quicken software without being on-line. &nbsp;Since this computer will be used off-line for personal
 accounting and other private record keeping, we do not want a Microsoft account. &nbsp;How do we get rid of the constant nuisance of password requests or at least extend the interval to an hour or so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            This happens to me constantly when I am writing checks with Quicken. Why do I have to put up with this? I have already wasted too much time with this annoyance. Nothing seems to work.

<h2>            Windows Blue Screen - Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having an issue with windows crashing fairly frequently.&nbsp; I can't say for sure but it seems to be more frequent when watching videos.</p>
<p>It might have something to do with the latest windows update but this is just a hunch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling this might have to do with my graphic card but I can't upgrade the driver anymore :(</p>
<p>I really don't want to buy a whole new PC just because of a graphics driver.&nbsp; Everything else on the PC runs great.</p>

            Hey Rick.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's no reason to buy a new PC because of software problems, because even if it won't repair or reset, you can always Clean Install and then you'll have a better install than comes on a brand new PC which are larded with bloatware that interferes with Windows and most enthusiasts won't even run.
<br />
<br />What I would do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, it fixes most problems.  If not you'll know it's due to a program conflict and we can go from there. 
<br />
<br />If the crashes persist run the Blue Screen Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Prepare the BSOD crash report for analysis following these steps:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            The error code is bugcheck44 which means 2 drivers tried to access the same resource at the same time. One of them was Storport.sys which is a component of windows.
<br />This is not properly documented though,

<p>Thanks for your reply Greg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I forgot to mention I did a clean Windows 10 install from scratch about 6 months ago. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you still recommend waiting for Spring Creators Update to be released?&nbsp; Or would you recommend jumping to some step in the checklist</p>

            It was not in the "deleted" items.&nbsp; It was in my backup files and I hit "restore".&nbsp; It showed up on my desktop as a .bak file that I can't open, nor can I import it into Outlook Express.&nbsp; It's now a 2 meg file sitting on my desktop.

            <div>OK. Here is how it should have been restored so make sure the bak file is not also in the OE message store.</div>
<div>*****************************************</div>
<div>All e-mail items may be missing when you start Outlook Express 6 Service Pack 1:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918069</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To restore a bak folder to the message store folder, first locate the Message Store in Windows Explorer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In OE: Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In WinXP, the dbx files are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer | Tools | Folder Options |
 View.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Windows Explorer, click on the dbx file for the missing, or empty, folder and drag it to the Desktop. It can be deleted later once you have successfully restored the bak file. Minimize the Message Store.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open OE and, if the folder is missing, create a folder with the *exact* same name as the bak file you want to restore but without the .bak. Eg: If the file is Saved.bak, the new folder should be named Saved. Open the new folder and then close OE. If the
 folder is there, but just empty, continue on to the next step.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First, check if there is a bak file already in the message store. If there is, and you removed the dbx file, go ahead and rename it to dbx.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it isn't already in the message store, open the Recycle bin and right click on the bak file for the folder in question and click Restore. Open the message store back up and change the file extension from .bak to .dbx. Close the message store and open
 OE. The messages should now be back in the folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the messages are successfully restored, you can go ahead and delete the old dbx file that you moved to the Desktop.&nbsp;
<br />
******************************************************</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now, if you do not have a bak file in the message store, then you can manually import the one on the Desktop. First, rename the file extension from bak to dbx.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open OE and create a folder with the *exact* same name as the one on the Desktop. Open the new folder and then close OE. (You must do this). Go to Windows Explorer and locate the Message Store folder for your OE identity,
<strong><em>but don't open it</em></strong>. Click on the Desktop and drag the file from the Desktop in the right hand pane to the OE store folder in the left pane. Prompt - "Do you want to overwrite......."? Click Yes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>*Note* If you have moved the Outlook Express store folder from it's default location on drive C to another drive, drag the dbx file to a location on that drive and not the Desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>You lost me early on.&nbsp; I HAVE located and saved the location of the Outlook Express files.&nbsp; They are ALL .bak files</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I have the main folder (but not the subflders) on the desktop (but I can't open it).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have checked the box for "show hidden files".</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; You lost me on "In Wincows Explorer, click on the dbx file for the missing....&nbsp; I have NO dbx files.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I DID create a folder in OE with the exact same name without the .bak.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I really don't know what you mean by "message store" or "message store folder"</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I went to the second page where it statrs:&nbsp; Now, if you do not have a bak file in the message store, then you can impirt one from the desktop.&nbsp; First, rename the file extention from bak to dbx(What's a file extention?)</p>

            <div>1: All folders have their own files even subfolders, so you should have bak files for all the folders either in the Windows Recycle in or the OE message store.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2: Then you should be able to find the OE store folder in Window Explorer. (Windows Key + E).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3: The path to the message store will be very similar to this:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>C:\Documents and Settings\Your User Name\Local Settings\Application Data\Identities\{Long string of letters &amp; numbers}\Microsoft\Outlook Express
<div>Do you see your dbx files in that folder? Any bak files?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4: OK.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5: See 2 &amp; 3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>6: File extensions are the letters that follow file names. Eg: .exe, .pdf, .doc, .pps, (and .bak and .dbx)&nbsp;etc.
<br />
<div>This is what the path to the OE store folder should look like. DBX files at the right. Hope this helps.

            <p>All of my missing folders are .bak files and I can see them in (I guess) the OE mesage store.&nbsp; I copied and pasted the location into the Windows serach and it listed ALL what used to be in my Outlook Express.&nbsp; The folders that are currently in Outlook now
 have both the regular file# and a dbx file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that are missing are just bak files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found the "store" by using the explanation you gave in the first message.... OE, tools, options, slect folder.&nbsp; Then I pasted that into the Wonows search for files/folders.&nbsp; I have no idea what a "Windows key" is .. my keyboard evidently doesn't have one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea how to get to the "path" to the OE storage folder that you have at the end.&nbsp; I can't get that screen to come up no matter what I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, but I'll have to call a computer geek to manually do this your acronyms and descriptions are very hard to follow .. and I was in electroics for 11 years, just before the onset of computers.</p>

            <p>If you want to evaluate the final version of Windows 8, you can download a copy of Enterprise edition which includes all the features and capabilities Windows 8 has to offer.
</p>
<p>This evaluation provides a <strong>90-day trial of Windows 8 Enterprise edition</strong>. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available as ISO images in the following languages: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), English, English (UK), French,
 German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish. In order to use this evaluation, you must register and the product must be activated online with Microsoft-hosted activation and validation services. Microsoft does not provide technical
 support for this software.</p>
<p>The terms are straight forward, you have 90 days to try out the product and your applications, afterwards, you must purchase a license as the trial is not extendable. Microsoft states:</p>
<blockquote>Things to Know Before You Start
<ul>
<li>The evaluation edition will expire and cannot be upgraded.</li><li>To upgrade, the evaluation must be uninstalled and a non-evaluation version of Windows must be re-installed from your original installation media.</li><li>Consider running the evaluation edition in a&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/16/running-windows-8-developer-preview-in-a-virtual-environment.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">virtual environment</a>&nbsp;or installing on
 a separate hard drive or partition. The will allow you to upgrade your original Windows installation to Windows 8.</li><li>During registration (required) you must login with a Microsoft account and provide your name, e-mail address and country.</li><li>You are required to activate the product online within 10 days after installing.</li><li>Once the evaluation is installed, you cannot upgrade. To revert to a previous version of Windows, you must do a clean install from your original installation media.</li></ul>
Activation and Usage Guidelines
<ul>
<li>Back up your files and settings before installing this evaluation and again prior to the 90-day expiration.</li><li>Upon installation, you will have 10 days to activate this evaluation online. Windows will prompt you to activate. A product key is not required for this software.</li><li>You must complete activation before August 15, 2013, to use this evaluation.</li><li>Once you activate, you have up to 90 days to use the software. You can track the amount of time you have left by referring to the "watermark" in the lower right corner of the Windows desktop.</li><li>If you fail to activate this evaluation within the 10-day grace period, or if your evaluation period expires, the desktop background will turn black, you will see a persistent desktop notification indicating that the system is not genuine, and the PC will
 shut down every hour losing unsaved work.</li><li>Following the evaluation period, you will need to replace the operating system on your test computer and reinstall all your programs and data. It is not possible to upgrade the evaluation to a licensed working version of Windows 8. A clean installation
 is required.</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you agree to these terms and are willing to try out Windows 8 for 90 days for development and evaluation purposes, you can download Windows 8 right now. But, read the fine print carefully, you will not be able to upgrade this install after the expiration
 of the trial is over and will have to do a clean-install of Windows post trial.</p>

<h2>            Combining user accounts</h2>
                    I have set up multiple user accounts (all mine).&nbsp; How do I combine them so that all files and folders from all users are on the single surviving user?&nbsp; Can desktops be combined as well?&nbsp; Also, how do I transfer outlook folders, address books, etc. to the
 surviving user?

            You can't combine user accounts. Choose one that you will use, make it a Standard account, and copy the data from the other accounts to it, putting the files in the appropriate directories (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc.). You also do not want only one
 user account on a system. See below for general information about users in Vista. As for Outlook, export the data - messages, Contacts, calendar, etc. and save the exported .pst file in the Public folder. Then from your Standard user (the one for your daily
 work), open Outlook and import that .pst file. After you know you have everything the way you want it, you can delete the superfluous user accounts from Control Panel&gt;User Accounts.<br />
<br />
User Accounts in Vista - You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These
 accounts should be left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />

<p>Hi! <br />
<br />
Welcome to our community. <br />
This is Leocadia and I am glad to assist you today. <br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about this situation. We would like to help you promptly. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes BitLocker recovery gets tripped and goes into a never-ending boot loop. I've seen this with UEFI and laptops with mSATA cache drives. This will stop the BitLocker request on boot, allowing you to get to the OS and troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />
You will need the recovery key to complete these steps. <br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1: Enter the Boot Loop <br />
Yes - let it loop. We need to get past the recovery screen. Once at the recovery screen, "skip this drive"
<br />
<br />
Step 2: Enter Advanced Options <br />
Once skipped enter the advanced options screen: <br />
Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Command Prompt <br />
<br />
Step 3: Double check the drive status <br />
Manage-bde -status c: <br />
Should return BDE Active (or similar) <br />
<br />
Step 4: Unlock the drive <br />
Manage-bde -unlock c: -rp &lt;recovery-key-including-dashes&gt; <br />
<br />
Step 5: Disable drive protection on boot <br />
Manage-bde -protectors -disable c: <br />
<br />
This stops the drive form asking for encryption password during next boot <br />
<br />
This squirts the key into BDE, unlocks the drive and disables it for next boot, bypassing the boot loop, enabling you to fully manage BDE once Windows has booted.
<br />
<br />
Please, complete these steps and let me know if it works for you. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t fully shut down</h2>
                    My Acer Aspire E1-572G laptop can't fully shut down after several hours of using, the led indicator and the fans are still running after I turned it off, I have no choice but to press the power button to force it shut down. I had tried few methods I found
 on google like changing the battery plan and etc, it only can shut down normally if i turned it off after around 30mins of using, but then after a longer time of using it, it can't fully shut down again, please advise!

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem?
<br />How long has this been happening?
<br />Have you installed any new software or hardware drivers since you started experience this problem? If so, what are they and are they designed for Windows 10?
<br />
<br />Have you checked the manufacturers website or contact support find out about compatibility, updates or support for Windows 10?
<br />Do you have a system restore point created you could go back to? 
<br />Does the problem occur in other user accounts on the computer?
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703, 1709?

<br />
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make and model of the computer?

            That sounds very much like an incompatible Video Driver. &nbsp;You need to find Windows 10 Compatible Drivers (probably via the PC Manufacturer's Support Site).&nbsp;

<h2>            HDMI Handshake Malfuction &#38;quot&#59;Fixed&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p><span>My Xbox 360 has worked with my HD television via HDMI for about 3 months until one day I could not play Xbox 360 via HDMI.</span></p>
<p><span>Troubleshooting the issue was my first resort.</span></p>
<p><span>First, I tested the HDMI cable I was using to play the Xbox and it was functioning properly between my laptop and tv.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, I tested the Xbox to my TV with another HDMI cable and it did not work.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, I tested the Xbox on another TV using the same HDMI cable and it connected.</span></p>
<p><span>Then I made sure that the display settings on my TV were functioning and tried connecting it again.</span></p>
<p><span>It did not work.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally I did my research and found out the Xbox was unable to only connect to one specific TV, the primary TV I use.</span></p>
<p><span>This was because of a handshake error between the Xbox 360 HDMI input and the TV's output. The handshake error lay in the edmi starter not functioning properly, kind of like a starter not working on an engine.
</span></p>
<p><span>But the&nbsp;bizarre part is that it was only happening between the Xbox 360 and that specific TV. ??? So weird. I don't understand how electronic devices communicate but this was leading me to believe that there was some kind defect
 in the Xbox 360's HDMI functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>So finally, the</span> <span>
<strong>way to resolve this issue: buy an HDMI switcher that connects the xbox to the TV.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>On another issue, I think Xbox should provide people who are experiencing this some kind of more efficient instruction or rebate.</span></p>
<p><span>This event is not an isolated one.</span></p>

<p><span>My TV is a Sony LCD bought in 2008, &nbsp;KDL-40S2010.</span></p>
<p><span>My statement is well-warrented. If you take a look at the original post in this forum regarding the same issue,&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/7/p/143610/1168681.aspx#1168681 Xbox Support was unable to resolve
 it given the information that it was supplied by the user in need of help.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm sorry you think my manner was uncalled for, but I called Xbox twice and was given useless advice. I am here offering a solution to improve Xbox support.
</span></p>
<p><span>I want xbox to understand that this is not a problem happening with a specific TV. In the links to other forums, users with the same issue have different models of TV's than mine. Just FYI.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are a member of Xbox support, I am sorry if I am coming across very shrewdly, I am not a troll. Are the links I have provided in my original post not enough to understand the problem?</span></p>

 have been to post it in a civil and polite manner instead of a bashing rant about how MS was useless in helping you and the ONE other person having the same issue. Now do you understand where I am coming from?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Iv also encountered this problem (there are many people who have too) with my Xbox and my new Samsung TV. Something must have happened to the settings of the Xbox when I hooked it up to my other Sony TV, so when I tried it again on my Samsung it no longer
 works leaving a 'no signal' message. I tried it on a different but very similar Samsung too and same story. I tried every other blind resetting and pixel changing trick suggested on the net and its still not working. The whole reason why I bought this tv was
 to play my Xbox and now I can't. I'll have to try spending more money and getting a HDMI switcher.</p>
