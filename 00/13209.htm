<h2>            Is there a solution to Outlook actions going slow&#63;</h2>
                    When I do simple actions like clicking on Reply I get the spinning circle to show it is thinking. Sometimes it doesn't do this and sometimes it does. It seems to be doing it more and more. I use CA security suite for anti-virus/anti-spamware.

<p>There are a couple of relatively simple trouble shooting steps you can try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First is restart your computer (it sounds lame, but often does fix "random" problems)</p>
<p>Second, do an Office Repair</p>
<p>Third, do an uninstall / reinstall.&nbsp; Office is setup to allow you to uninstall and reinstall and it will keep your coustomizations.

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Uninstall from Control Panel</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Uninstall using Fix it<br />
<strong><span>Note</span></strong>: If you are using a 64BIT operating system, save the fixit tool on the system and then run it from the saved location.
</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Remove manually</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2 in this tip does a more thorough job that the “normal” uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 2 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete
 everything. It leaves configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries. These “carry-overs” may contain corruption that is causing your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Excel 2007 in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 and experienced problems with my Excel part of office 2007.</p>
<p>Some issues were addressed using the compatability facility. Individual excel files work fine, but as soon as a second excel file is opened neither file will display properly. In task view both files look smaller than usual. Closing both files and re-opening
 Excel allows a single file to be opened OK.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<br />
12. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through1 Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
13. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

13. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

    <title>Date stamp applied by OneNote after syncing with Office Lens is always - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul a. delphin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Date stamp applied by OneNote after syncing with Office Lens is always 11 hours behind actual time.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am really hopeful for some advice and guidance to this problem please.&nbsp; I hope the following makes sense...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 2016 Pro running on Windows 7.&nbsp; And I'm using Office Lens on my Nokia 6 Android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue syncing the correct date and time when OneNote updates it's syncing with Office Lens / OneDrive. For example, I take a shot (using my phone) of a document in Office Lens, and while this syncs okay to my local OneNote, OneNote&nbsp;<strong>always
 applies a date stamp of </strong><strong>11 hours less than the current time</strong>. Tonight one file was actually 11 hours and 1 minute! Syncing is pretty quick but regardless, OneNote always inserts the wrong time.&nbsp; If I manually create a new page in OneNote
 then there is no issue, the time is correct. I note however that my Quick Notes Pages DO the display the proper time... it's just that when I open a page there it is, 11 hours less than what it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive files BTW always show the CORRECT date.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e43fd1c5-3d16-4e80-a0fa-f386fe4deea8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e43fd1c5-3d16-4e80-a0fa-f386fe4deea8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My system date and time as well as regional settings are all fine. I've checked and double-checked them. My phone has the correct date / time settings also. I've logged out of OneNote, OneDrive, Microsoft etc.&nbsp; and logged back in - same problem. I've rebooted
 my phone and PC, as well as applied all updates - same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see the accompanying screenshot. Hopefully it will clarify what I mean. This is causing real headaches for me. I know I can manually change the date in One Note but I do not believe this is a viable solution. I should not have to do this. Is this
 a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much in advance I really hope someone can help as I need all date/time stamps to be as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul.</p>

            Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
Whenever you create a new page in OneNote, it will display the date and time that it was created. The date and time displayed depend on the date and time that's set on your PC. When you want to change the time that's displayed on a page, you can refer to this
 article for a simple guide: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-or-remove-the-page-creation-date-or-time-in-onenote-8d807eb5-32dd-45f8-b382-84cca91a070f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change or remove the page creation date or time in OneNote</a>.<br />
<br />
Since syncing the time of your OneNote doesn't sync with the time that you have uploaded a file using Office Lens is not yet available on your end and we're committed to making OneNote a great experience for all users, we recommend that you post your issue

<p>Office 365 Midsize Business renewal has given us Office Business Premium and users are being prompted to install Office 2016 on their PCs. This appears to require uninstalling Office 2013. The question being asked is whether macros, templates, Quick Parts,
 addresses etc. are retained or lost?</p>

<h3> katethomaswriter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word and Outlook not responding</h2>
                    I &nbsp;have installed Office 365 and everything works except for Word and Outlook (which of course are the two I need most!) When I open Outlook, I just get 'Not Responding' in the window frame and it shuts down. When I open Word, everything looks good at
 first - all my recent documents are listed - but when I try to open one, or start a new blank document, I get 'Not Responding' in the window frame and it shuts down. I even uninstalled my old Word 2010 in case that was causing a problem, but that didn't work
 and now I have no Word (not good for a writer!).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help? Office 365 seemed like a fantastic idea, but now I'm not so sure! Thanks.</div>

<h2>            Diff and Merge two Excel Files</h2>
                    
<p>I am looking for a solution for diffing and merging two excel files on an entry-by-entry basis. For clarity, I&nbsp;want to open two versions fo the same spreadsheet, review the changes between the two versions, and choose which version of the changes to accept
 on a per-entry basis. Everything I have so far found allows me to view the differences between files and to chosoe which spreadsheet to accept, but not to choose changes per entry.</p>
<p>Note that these are not shared workbooks so the compare and merge tool does not apply.</p>

<p>As a first move, I would insert a new column A in each.&nbsp; Then fill the column with a unique identifier (such as the workbook name) to identify the source.&nbsp; I would then copy one set of data below the other set of date.&nbsp; Then I would sort the data on the
 Identifier fields so that like records were next to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you could then insert another new column A and put an X in which one you want to keep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then select the new column A and hit F5 to get the goto dialog.&nbsp; Select special and select blank cells.&nbsp;&nbsp; then go to the home tab and under cells, select the delete dropdown and select Delete Sheet Rows</p>
<p>Now you can delete columns A and B or keep column B if you want the source.</p>
<p>Do a save As to save this as a new workbook name and preserve you previous data.&nbsp; Close the other workbook without saving changes.</p>

<p>Thanks, Tom. We have a large number of data files that change frequently. What you describe will not be practicable. We are needing something like what is known as a diff tool which is used to manage things like changes in programming&nbsp;codebases.</p>
<p>Instead of sharing files on the network we have files in a version control depot, else the "compare and merge workbooks" feature would be nearly ideal.</p>

<p>Unless I misunderstood you, if you are manually comparing each row pairing to make a decision on which to keep, the other actions would be trivial.&nbsp; If I were doing it I would write a macro to perform those steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were really asking is there a tool to allow you to do what you want, then I guess I would not know.&nbsp; I am surprised there is one that does &gt;Everything I have so far found allows me to view the differences between files and to chosoe which spreadsheet

<p>Unless it is just putting up two workbooks next to each other (tiling windows).</p>

<h2>            outlook 2010 How to GLOBALLY change email header font &#40;not SMTP header&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a user with outlook 2010. &nbsp; &nbsp;They have multiple sub folders under their inbox. &nbsp;They also have any other folders. &nbsp;They would like to be able to GLOBALLY change the font of the email headers (not the SMTP headers or the actual column headings) but
 the actual emails that are visible in the right hand pane. &nbsp;The one that shows From: &nbsp;Subject: &nbsp;Received: size:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They can do it one folder at a time but there are way too &nbsp;many folders to do this for. They want to be able to do it (for example) at a top level folder, and have it trickle down to the sub folders.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know a means of doing this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            My Microsoft Word is saying my account isn&#39;t activated</h2>
                    We've had this computer since 2014 and have had Office since the 1st day.&nbsp; Never had an issue.&nbsp; Now it's asking for an activation code for office.&nbsp; When I enter in the email and password it says I don't have office but I do.&nbsp; It's not allowing my to edit
 any of the documents I've created on this computer.&nbsp; I also checked date and time and that is all correct.

    <title>outlook 2010 shared calendars not syncing unless restarted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keb mac  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2010 shared calendars not syncing unless restarted</h2>
                    I have multiple executive admins that are sharing multiple calendars and we have been noticing that the shared calendars do not update automatically unless Outlook is restarted. For instance today one admin placed a calendar item on a shared calendar but
 the other admin was unable to see the calendar. I restarted Outlook for the user that could not see the instance and it still did not appear. I then restarted Outlook for the user that added the instance then restarted Outlook again for the user that could
 not and it then appeared. So the admin added the instance but it did not update the shared calendar because it had not synced in the last 3 hours so the actual calendar was not updated. While trouble shooting I had opened the shared calendars mailbox through
 OWA and the instance was not showing there either until the Outlook client was restarted for the admin that added the instance.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why are these shared calendars not updating automatically? Cached mode is on for these users but for some it is not and option to turn off because they have laptops and need their mailboxes available offline.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They are all using Outlook 2010 clients and we have Exchange 2007 fully patched.</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi all,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I had the exact same issue here, running outlook 2010 and 2013&nbsp;with Exchange 2010.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I tried all the usual stuff, no improvement. The one commonality I did discover was, that if both users mailbox were in the same mail database, the calendar updated instantly for both.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If their mailboxes were on different mail databases, that's when the update wasn't happening on both.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The fix was on the exchange server (exchange 2010).</span></p>
<p><span>Under the properties of the mail database, there's a tab called CLIENT SETTINGS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I discovered one mail database was pointing to&nbsp;the&nbsp;wrong public folder database.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once I had both mail databases pointing to the same public folder database.&nbsp; Users who had mailboxes on different mail databases were instantly able to see Shared Calendar updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps....

<h2>            Authentication unsuccessful using smtp except for &#91;string&#93;.eurprd07.prod.outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Fernando and I am a system administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company is using office365 as online exchange system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several applications that must authenticate against smtp.office365.com or smtp.outlook.com in order to send emails (backup applications, servicedesk application, web applications...) but lately they are not able to authenticate against the smtp servers,
 and so, the emails are not being sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is starting to impact our business because our clients are not getting response from our automated tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to detect that sometimes the applications are able to authenticate (barely) and it is when they end up authenticating against:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[string].eurprd07.prod.outlook.com </p>
<p>
</p><p>If any other server handles the authentication, the answer is Authentication unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of servers not letting us authenticate:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Authentication unsuccessful [VI1P193CA0011.EURP193.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM]</p>
<p>Authentication unsuccessful [HE1PR0901CA0050.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com]<br />

Authentication unsuccessful [AM4PR0902CA0020.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com]</p>
<p>....(the list was way longwer)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, we have no problem to log in with owa or outlook client. </p>
<p>The applications were using this system until a month and never had an issue before.</p>
<p>Tried to increase timeouts, verify passwords, and the only way to make things work is to change mail provider (tried with another and worked).</p>
<p>The accounts facing this issue are different and the only thing in common is they belong to our domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help or if I am in the wrong channel to communicate, I would also love to know the right place to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fernando</p>

<p>Hi Graham,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us.</p>
<p>We'd like to suggest you try the followings:</p>
<p>1.Close Word, reboot Mac in safe mode with the steps in
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article</a> to isolate issues.</p>
<p>2.Regarding the error message, try the suggestion in this article:
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/disk-utility/repair-a-disk-dskutl1040/mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair a disk using Disk Utility on Mac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you may try the followings:</p>
<p><span>1.</span><span>Quit the Word application.</span></p>
<p><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>Go to the location below</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>rename </span><span>the original "Normal.dotm"
</span><span>as "oldNormal.dotm".</span></p>
<p>~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Re-launch Word application, create a new document and see if you can save it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If above doesn't help, please let us know the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.Does the error message only appear when you save new documents? If you edit and save an existing document, does the issue happen?</p>
<p>2.Does the issue happen when you save new files in other Office applications? Excel/PowerPoint?</p>
<p>3.If you save the new document to a different location on Mac, does the error appears?</p>

</p><p>I have also had problems with existing Word documents which have become "Read only"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Existing documents will save, subject to above</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only use Excel and there are no apparent issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the Save location has no effect</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the queries being posted it is beginning to look as if this is an issue with Apple but your quidance is appreciated</p>

<p>Having thought that the issue had been resolved I developed problems with Word as well as Excel.</p>
<p>Surely the most recent update would solve all my problems - no such joy attempting to save a new word file returns the error message&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Word cannot save or create this file. &nbsp;Make sure that the disk you want to save the file to is not full, write-protected or damaged", Excel returns the same error message as before.</p>
<p>Further complication is that after using update I am confronted with a message saying that there is an update for Excel 16.20.0, but on checking, this is the version of Excel I have in place!</p>
<p>Not only have I wasted money on an upgrade I have also wasted a considerable amount of time finding alternatives to allow sending documents toothers</p>

<p>Hi Graham,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply. We totally understand the frustration when encountering the issue in Word and Excel, we will help you do further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you try saving the document to an online location such as OneDrive and see if the error message appears or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current latest version is 16.20(181208), you can check Office's detailed build number via Word menu&gt;About Microsoft Word. If it is not the latest build, you can firstly download and install
<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the latest version of Microsoft Update tool</a>, and use it to update Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the error message persists when you save Word documents or Excel workbooks on the location on your Mac or OneDrive, we'd like to collect the following information to investigate the issue:</p>
<p>1.A screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.When the issue happens, please go to the locations to get the ULS log file for Word and Excel. Then share it with us in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">private message</a>.
</p>
<p>~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.word/Data/Library/Caches/Microsoft/uls/com.microsoft.word/logs&nbsp;</p>
<p>~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.excel/Data/Library/Caches/Microsoft/uls/com.microsoft.excel/logs&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Since we cannot reproduce the issue, it would be helpful if you can record a video for it. This will help us observe how the issue happens. Please also share it in private message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your time and effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h3> slashford  say:</h3>
<h2>            quickbooks 2013 and office 365 compatibility</h2>
                    <p>As of appx one month ago (~May 2015), qb no longer will export to excel, either from a canned report version, or a direct report from the payroll module.&nbsp; At least the former reports (eg. pnl, bal, transactions) do export to csv.&nbsp; The latter does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a dig-deep into the forums at QB, it appears that perhaps it only recognizes an excel app that resides on the computer (eg as in Office 2013).&nbsp; However it doesn't explain why QB functioned perfectly in exporting to excel 2 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did one of the updates remove the mirror version of the office programs from my computers and therefore QB is looking for something that no longer exists on my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is most inconvenient for a small business owner that has dueling providers...in this case MS and QB/Intuit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution?</p>

    <title>N97 mini charging from flat using PC USB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlza---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 mini charging from flat using PC USB</h2>
                    
<p>Had quite an interesting experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My N97 mini was completely flat (battery).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to charge it using my PC's USB port, the PC will try and identify it as a flash drive, but it will then bomb out - this is an endless cycle (the sound Windows makes when adding USB Flash drive and then removing it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using different USB ports has the same result. I am not sure whether charging occurs, but after 10min or so I am still unable to switch the phone on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I went to the device manager and I can see it reloading each time the N97 tries to register as a USB device. Then I went and looked at which port the N97 is connected to (open each USB root hub and look at the Power tab - ie refresh each time the new
 device found sound is played from Windows - the USB hub that will be connected to the phone will be indicated by "nokia usb flashing parent"). By disabling the applicable hub, the phone actually showed the Nokia logo on a white screen with the battery life
 indicator (non charging).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I then re-enabled the USB Root Hub, the display remained on the phone and it started charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without disabling the hub the phone would just continue to endlessly find and then discard the "flash drive".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was using Windows XP SP3.</p>
<p>Nokia OVIsuite 2.2.0.241</p>
<p>I did manually terminate any Nokia processes prior to disabling the USB Root Hub (not sure how many tried to rerun again).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally it is charging again. Wasn't too keen on what happened, because I don't carry the charger with me when travelling abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone finds this usefull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ciao</p>

<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>Went to bed with 5 bars of battery, woke up with a dead phone. Now I'm at work trying to charge via USB, but the screen won't light up. It'll buzz when I press the on button but nothing else happens. The little light beside the N97 Mini's USB port is on
 OK. My PC doesn't recognise the phone as a drive or anything.</p>
<p>Is it charging at all? Is my phone just dead and this isn't a battery problem?:-(</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>It's been "charging" now for 30 minutes, but when I try to start it without the USB cable plugged in I get nothing at all, not even the vibrate. I guess that means there's zero charge in the battery?</p>
<p>Hopefully the wall charger will do a better job when I get home...</p>

            I have an old N97mini and I just received a new battery pack (1930 mAh). Problem is, it won't start, the same as Dan_Solo, a short buzz when not plugged in and no buzz when plugged in. Could you please tell me if you solved the problem, because in my case
 it does not charge the phone not even with AC charger? Thank you. Boris

<h2>            lumia 830 wireless charging</h2>
                    Hello all,<br />
<br />
Today I received my Lumia 830 however I'm confused with something. My friend has the same phone and on his back cover (back plate) he has a black square with two metal connections coming from it in the middle of the case.<br />
<br />
However on my black back plate it doesn't have anything.<br />
<br />
Does this mean my phone does not have wireless charging?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            There were suggestions that some variants of the 830 may not support wireless charging.<br />
<br />
With the 820 you could get both qi and none qi back plates. The qi ones with the black square and metal connection being the ones with qi. Perhaps the same applies to the 830. You could always try your friends backplate on your phone and see if it works.

            Thanks for the reply. The box that it came in says wireless charging. I've read on a few sites that its built into the phone. I'm looking for clarification on this before I buy the charging plate.

            If the box says it does then it should. For some reason the backplate you have is the wrong one. It should have the black square which is the wireless receiver. Perhaps you should contact the retailer to exchange.

            That is what I thought, I contacted the network and they insist it is never opened when they get it from Nokia. Nokia told me on their live chat that its built into the device?

            There has to be a receiver just like the one on your friends phone. If it is not on the backplate then it has to be on the back of the main phone. I say you got a faulty backplate.

<h2>            9926 breaks&#47;disables x1200 display driver</h2>
                    <p>When I installed Windows 10TP into my Toshiba P200D with 4gb and 250Gb SDD from windows 7 I had to find and reinstall the X1200 Graphics Driver, by using the Vista 64 driver from the Toshiba Website. When Win10TP auto-upgraded to build 9926 it disabled the
 X1200 driver. I tried re-installing but it failed and just left me with Lowest Common Denominator Driver (mobile basic driver?). I have reverted to build 9841, which system worked flawlessly, so I am unable to use 9926.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts as Windows 7 worked flawlessly before installing Win10TP.</p>

            <p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand that you are facing issues with installing Windows 10 TP Build 9926 on the computer. We will help you to resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to inform you that graphics card which you are using in the computer doesn't have any drivers which is&nbsp;compatible with Windows 10 TP. The latest driver was for Windows XP. So I suggest you to upgrade your graphics card in your computer and check if
 it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest you to install the graphics card driver in compatibility mode and check if it helps. You can refer to the following link to download the driver for your graphics card.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amd-drivers.com/download-RadeonX1200-graphics-driver-for-WindowsXP-32bit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amd-drivers.com/download-RadeonX1200-graphics-driver-for-WindowsXP-32bit.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now, to install in Compatibilty Mode, follow these steps:<br />
<span>a. Locate the&nbsp;<strong>executable</strong>&nbsp;file (.exe file) for the driver installation program.</span><br />
<span>b. Right-click the file, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</span><br />
<span>c. In the&nbsp;<strong>Package Name</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong>Compatibility</strong>&nbsp;tab.</span><br />
<span>d. Click to select the&nbsp;<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>&nbsp;check box, click&nbsp;<strong>Windows 8&nbsp;</strong>with which it is compatible with in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span><br />
<span>e.&nbsp;<strong>Double-click</strong>&nbsp;the executable file to start the installation program.</span></span></p>
<p>Please post back if the issue persists and we will be glad to assist you further.

            <p>It annoys me when replies are not thought out. 5 seconds of research about would have told you that a Toshiba P200D is a laptop so there is no way to upgrade the graphics card.
</p>
<p>The XP driver link is at least valid, but it is the exact same version of driver I have installed. My point is that the latest Windows 10 Preview breaks/disables the driver version 8.593.100.</p>
<p>As that driver works with Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 and the previous vesion of Win 10TP I feel its a Win 10 TP problem, NOT a throw you computer away job.</p>
<p>As the driver I have already got installed is the same exact version I am resisting using your link as I do not believe it will change anything.</p>
<p>Thank you for you reply.</p>

            As you can see no one was interested. Latest version of Windows 10 broke my X1200 video driver. So I deleted windows 10 and with great relief I reinstalled Windows 7. I found nothing better in Windows 10 and will definitely not be upgrading from windows
 7. For my Window 8.1 I probably will let it happen as Windows 10 as its just a Windows 8.1 service pack. I am not impressed if this is the best Microsoft can do, its pathetic. Windows 8.1 with Classic Shell is better than Windows 10.

    <title>OneNote Crashing while trying to sync large notebooks on iPad Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneNote Crashing while trying to sync large notebooks on iPad Pro</h2>
                    So I recently got an iPad Pro, and decided to download OneNote. So I had a whole bunch of PDFs that I had already loaded onto my iPad Pro, and thought I would collect them into one Notebook. After using the app and loading one of the 300+ paged PDF it
 crashed. Trying to figure out the problem, I just turned the iPad onto Airplane mode and continued on. After I had finished, I put it back onto the wifi and let it try and sync without me interfering. It then crashed again, and every time I open the app, it
 just crashes. And yes, I have already tried turning Auto Sync off, but that doesn't do anything, seeing as it continues to auto sync anyway. I don't know what to do anymore

            Hi <strong>Artoods</strong>,<br />
<br />
We’ve noticed that the post has been idle for quite some time now. We’d like to confirm if your OneNote for iPad is still crashing while syncing your notebooks. If yes, it’s possible that conflicts have occurred at the time that it tried to sync the large notebooks
 on your device as it may contain multiple notes that include pictures. Aside from turning the Auto Sync off, have you already tried
<strong>resetting the OneNote app</strong>? If you haven’t done it yet, please try to do so and follow the steps provided
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/reset-microsoft-onenote-between-users-on-a-shared-ipad-or-iphone-a814bf16-34e0-4c35-aaee-13b664cdc517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">here</a></strong>. Also, we’d recommend
<strong>checking for any available updates for OneNote for iPad</strong> on the Store app installed on your device. This will help us determine if the app is having an issue with the current version of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep me informed about the status of your concern by replying to this thread and for me to provide further recommendation.

I am only using links within my computer and I already did what the link directs.<br />
<br />
Wait, I looked at that link and the file is different but I do not have WMV, i have wmv then there is no EditFlags.<br />

            <p>I've spent 2 days trying to fix this and my BEST GUESS is that NO ONE KNOWS HOW !!!&nbsp; Some referenced using DECIMAL for the 1 to stop it, others HEX for the 1 -- so I tried ALL and NONE WORK. And it is all across the board - my main problem is with OUTLOK
 2010, where I have created *.OFT files, and their associated 'shortcuts' (hyperlinks) so I don't have to type e-mail addresses for everyone. I had one master of everyone, and then modified it one at a time, so I could just use something person A sent me, copy
 it and insert into person A's *.OFT and I could immediately forward it to everyone BUT person A who send it to me to begin with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything worked perfectly in Office 2003 (Outlook 2003), but I think MS has finally gone off the deep end with the RIBBONS and has no way I've found to use shortcuts (hyperlinks) for documents the OWNER (me and you) have created and KNOW ARE SAFE.</p>

            i have found a solution for that. i have tried all of the ways for solution but they couldn't. Solution is that you have to update your acrobat reader and than you will see no message while opening the pdf files in hyperlink.

    <title>change the SYSTEM LOCK SCREEN IMAGE picture in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thehardwarehacker  say:</h3>
<h2>            change the SYSTEM LOCK SCREEN IMAGE picture in windows 10</h2>
                    Ive been messing with windows 10 for a couple of days, and i decided to see if there was a way to hard change (edit the reg. settings, and the files in windows) the back ground picture for the login screen in windows 10. I followed the steps i used in
 windows 7 to change it (i will never touch windows 8) , and while to process worked the same way, the picture didn't change. While i did change the lock screen, i have not been able to get the login background. Has anyone else attempted this, and been able
 to succeed? if so please respond on how its done. Thanks. <br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this query.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) Which login screen background are you trying to change on the computer? Is it the User Login Screen or the System Login Screen?</span></p>
<p><span>2) What are the steps that you have already tried to change the login screen on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3) What exactly happens when you try to change the login screen by following the steps that you had tried for Windows 7?</span></p>
<p><span>4) Did you get any error message? If yes, what is the exact error message/code that you get?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is important to understand the difference between the various lock and login screens in Windows 8. Some of these screens are controlled by individual user accounts, while others are system-wide defaults. Knowing which screen you need
 to change can be quite confusing, owed in part to the variety of terms used to refer to them as well as the subtle differences between the two "versions" of these two screens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The 2 login screens available on Windows 8/8.1/10 are User Login Screen and System Login Screen. Let me give you a small description about these different screens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When a user is logged in but has locked their account, they will see a lock screen image. By default, this is an illustrated image of the Seattle Space Needle. This screen is referred as the
<strong><em>User Lock Screen</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the same user were to log back into their account, they will be brought to a login screen with a solid color background that displays their account picture. This screen is the<strong><em>User Login Screen</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the last user is logged out of the computer, a lock screen image will display that is not tied to any individual user account. We will call this the
<strong><em>System Lock Screen</em></strong>. This screen may initially seem indistinguishable from the user lock screen as by default both these screens have the same background image.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, pulling up the login screen from the system lock screen will display the various user accounts you can choose from to login. This screen is referred to as the
<strong><em>System Login Screen</em></strong>. The background color on this screen is set independently of any one user account. Just as with the system lock screen, the only way this color can be changed is by editing an advanced setting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Now, you should be able to figure out the exact screen that you would like to change on the computer. Please get back to us with this information, so that we can assist you further
 with it.</span><br />

            <p>Thank you vary much for the reply, that gave me a lot of info that i didn't have before. According to what you said, and what i check that i have already changed, it is the
<strong>system login screen</strong> that i am trying to change. I am not afraid of editing advanced settings, i do this kind of thing all the time in windows 7, and OSX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the steps ive taken so far, i used the same method i use in windows seven: in the system files i went through the following (added the last 2 folders/ file): computer/local disc/ windows/system32/oobe/info/backgrounds(custom background image is in
 the folder)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the registry i went through the following: computer/hkey local machine/software/microsoft/windows/currentversion/authentication/loginui/background (and added OEMBackground&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_DWORD (and set the value data to 1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing i noticed is that in 10 in the background folder in the registry, there is a sub folder called 'USER', unlike in windows 7. I added a DWORD with the same setting in this folder as well, is that what is causing the setting to not take, or is that
 thought irrelevant?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for any warnings, 'things' happening, nothing has happened since i tried to make the change, no popups warning or anything like that.
</p>
<p>
In advance, thanks for your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>While the information you provided is interesting it is also annoying. &nbsp;Why hasn't Microsoft made modifying these four different screens easily accessible? &nbsp;Why do users have to post on a forum and hope for help. &nbsp;Users desire to modify the login background
 has gone back many years by now one would expect Microsoft to realize this and make it somewhat easy to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I would like instructions on how to change ALL FOUR SCREENS.</p>

How would you know if it was in Win 8 since you "refuse to touch it"?&nbsp; Regardless, the background during login has never been customizable in Windows, ever.&nbsp; The difference in the (unfinished technical preview) Windows 10 builds is that in place of a solid
 color (XP/7/8/8.1), there is an image.&nbsp; It is much better to submit Insider feedback through the app if you don't like it instead of wasting your breath here.&nbsp; This is a community forum, not a direct line to MS engineers.

<p>When I connect my new Nokai Lumia 1020 to USB, my PC (which is Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate) is not able to install the correct driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I connec the mobile, Windows installs driver for a device named as "RM-875|Nokia 909". It then says "</p>
<p>There is no driver selected for the device information set or element."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have then updated the mobile's software to the recent version, but with no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched Nokia site for a driver and found nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I explore Lumia 1020 in Windows 7 64-bit? What can I do to troubleshoot this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>In my case, it turnns out the problem was that the following file was missing:</p>
<p><strong><font color="#000000">C:\Windows\inf\usb.inf</font></strong></p>
<p>I just copied that file from other machine and rebooted the PC. It all went good after that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know why that file has gone missing but it appears that this is a common problem with some PCs.</p>
