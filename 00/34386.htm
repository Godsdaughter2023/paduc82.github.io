<h2>            Windows 8.1 Retail vs MSDN &#40;or other&#41; Product Ids</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have aquired a Windows 8.1 Pro license at an excellent price via the wonders of Ebay and wonder if there is anyway of checking it's validity, I know what to look for with Windows 7 but not with Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Second part of the Product Id is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">00599 - is that what is needed?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Many thanks!</span></p>
<p>

<p>Thanks Mahesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It activates of course but the question is whether it's MSDN / OEM or RETAIL. One can usually tell from the product ID.</p>

            <p>Hello Picklebacker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSDN versions of Windows are usually Retail copies anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it is worth the second set of numbers in the product ID of my MSDN copy of Windows 8.1 Pro are 00000; while a copy of Windows 8 Pro (again MSDN) is 10076.</p>

            <p>Hi Pickle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John gave you the identification detail. Although for verifying what is the source of product, you can call &nbsp;1-800-642-7676 and verify your key. Secondly MSDN keys are not supported as an retail product by Microsoft Answer Desk, since this comes through
 MSDN subscribers and they are not supposed to sell their product key, since it does not have&nbsp;End User Customer support associated with the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may report this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx</a> if for any reason you product key is not working or coming as counterfeited/pirated.</p>

    <title>Wrong keyboard showing up on Touch Keyboard - Chinese input method - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wrong keyboard showing up on Touch Keyboard - Chinese input method</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Traditional Chinese language pack on my Surface Pro 4 Windows 10 with Pinyin (or Bopomofo) input method, which is working fine on my physical keyboard (using English alphabets to spell out the Pinyin for Chinese characters) but not when I
 switch over to the touch keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I switch to tablet mode with touch keyboard to type Traditional Chinese using the Pinyin/Bopomofo method, it automatically defaults to a touch keyboard with Chinese characters instead of a English alphabet keyboard.&nbsp; Without an English alphabet
 keyboard I cannot spell out the Pinyin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help?&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I JUST found a solution, which is&nbsp;adding the Chinese (People's Republic of China) language&nbsp;and then in Keyboards - Options - Character set, change the defaulted Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People who can only understand Traditional Chinese and type in Pinyin input method would only have this option to make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<h2>            Why does the Disk Management Console fail to assign a Drive Letter to a perfectly healthy HD or FD drive&#47;partition&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Highly Probable Solution to Windows Drive Letter Not Being Assigned<br />
</span></span></strong><span>A Problem Experienced with Win10 / Many Others Reported this Problem for Win8, Win7, Vista<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></strong>by Paul Collins – Chicago, IL – 15 October, 2017</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>I believe that I have discovered a procedure for resolving the problem of Hard Drive (HD) drives/partitions not being mounted (assigned a drive letter) in Windows.</strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I had looked through hundreds of web posts for a solution but found no procedure that worked consistently for HDs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I eventually found this solution for FDs that also worked for HDs because I changed the way I thought about the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I will explain with more details later. </span></p>
<p><span>I will get to the point and outline the solution here, but I encourage you to read through the entire post to understand how I came to these conclusions before you try this on your system.<span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>There should be no problem for you go ahead and try this procedure first, as nothing in this procedure will harm your system. But understanding why it works might help you solve other problems in the future.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>A SHORT VERSION OF THE DISCOVERY:</span></span></strong>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p><span>After investing in many, many hours over 2.5 months on this problem, I surmised that this behavior was the result of a driver and/or registry issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While the system behavioral evidence pointed to a possible driver issue, it turns out that the problem was
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span></strong> the result of missing, corrupted or outdated drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There appears to have been a problem with the loading sequence of drivers for HDs connected via USB controllers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most “solution” procedures I found on the web involved uninstalling (and reinstalling) the HD devices, but this did not work for my situation. What did work was
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">uninstalling (and reinstalling)</span></strong>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all USB controllers as well as the HD devices</span></strong>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When Windows restarts after the uninstall procedures are completed, Windows will detect all controllers and devices and will reinstall and load all drivers in the correct sequence.</span></p>
<p><span>While looking through a Device Manager Snap Dump of what the system was doing when attempting to mount a USB HD or FD, I came across the message
<strong>“Outranked Drivers”</strong> at the very point when the system seemed to be trying to mount a Partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>To my thinking, this message indicated that a USB device or controller was trying to load a driver that was superseded by a driver that was already loaded. My assumption at this point was that
<strong>both a USB device <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and</span> USB controller</strong> uninstall/reinstall might be all that would be needed! - As opposed to Microsoft’s suggested solution which was a complete Windows OS reinstall, followed by
 the reloading of all Applications &amp; Data.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>A google search on “Outranked Drivers”</span></strong><span> led me to a USB Controller uninstall/reinstall solution that had worked to resolve Device Manager
 Error Code 43 for FDs. I surmised that this procedure might also work for HDs with a Device Manager Error Code 29.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Using knowledge I had gained in my search for solutions, <strong>I added the uninstall/reinstall of all HD hidden devices</strong> to this procedure (except for “Storage volume shadow copies).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Fortunately after the Windows restart, and the automatic reinstallation of the USB HD and USB Controller drivers by Windows, the drive letter assignment problem for both HDs and FDs was permanently resolved.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>THE SOLUTION:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>This solution is written in detail for not-so-technical people,
<em>so if you are a hi-tech person you will know where you can take short-cuts.</em></span></p>

</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Good Luck!</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>I hope this procedure clears up the drive letter assignment problem for you.</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>I read many web posts made by lots of people who were upset and frustrated because they thought that the data on their HDs was lost forever.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A number of these posts were from people who were working under strict deadlines and I understand their anger and frustration with Microsoft.</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>Luckily, I was able to mount my USB HDs on other Windows computers and I was able to verify that the various HDs structures and the data were intact – in spite of what “experts” told me – about deficiencies
 of the NTFS file system or about the HD possibly being corrupted or damaged. So I knew that drive letter assignment problem was unique to a single computer.</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>While I feel that the probability is very high that this procedure is a “universal solution” for the drive letter assignment problem, there is a small possibility that this procedure may not solve
 all such problems.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong></li><li><strong><span>Most of the definite “Solutions” that I found via Web searches did not solve my particular problem, though many people reported that these solutions worked for them.</span></strong></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This solution may also apply to all versions of Windows (WIn10, Win8, Win7, Vista and XP) because I have seen the same problem described in multiple posts for these Operating Systems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A Partition not being mounted means that for some reason, no drive letter is assigned to the HD Partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As a result, no folders or files on that partition are accessible by a Windows Operating System.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Here are some of the symptoms and/or error messages associated with drive letters not being assigned and partitions not being mounted:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Disk Management Console: Cannot assign drive letter because Disk Management Console is not up to date (You can change the Partition Label but cannot assign/change the drive letter)</span></li><li><span>Device Manager Error Code 29 (for Hds): Device disabled because firmware did not give it the required resources</span></li><li><span>Device Manager Error Code 43 (for FDs): Windows has stopped this device because it reported problems</span></li><li><span>You may observe that a drive letter is assigned briefly in the Disk Management Console and then it disappears</span></li><li><span>When an HD is formatted with Disk Management Console, the format will not complete and you get a Disk Management Console error (cannot remember the exact message)</span></li><li><span>Using 3<sup>rd</sup> party software such as Partition Master or Partition Wizard to assign a drive letter, you will observe that a drive letter is assigned but that assignment is revoked and you get a message
 like “Mounting Volume Failed” or “Operation Not Completed”</span></li><li><span>Using 3<sup>rd</sup> party software such as Partition Master or Partition Wizard to format an HD, you will observe that the format completes, but you get a message like “Mounting Volume Failed”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the formatting is done outside of windows, when Windows restarts after formatting, the partition has no drive letter assigned.</span></li><li><span>Using 3<sup>rd</sup> party software such as DriveLetterView, when attaching the HD on a USB port, you may see the drive letter appear briefly then disappear.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>I have found variations of this problem in MANY, MANY places around the web.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Promising Solutions that worked sometimes but mostly not</span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>One suggested solution was to delete the Registry Keys for
</span>"Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices", but while this seemed to allow for the mounting of FDs, it did nothing for HDs. The problem for FDs usually returned and I had to repeat the key deletion from time to time.</li><li>Another suggested solution was to run DISKPART and then to execute the “AUTOMOUNT SCRUB” command.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Like the above solution, the fix was only temporary.<span>&nbsp; </span>This proposed solution deleted the very same registry keys as the above proposed solution.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes FDs would mount for a while. On a couple of occasions, HDs would mount for a few times and then not.</li><li>Many other proposed solutions suggested uninstalling/reinstalling<span>&nbsp; </span>
various combinations of HD device entries from hidden device lists in Device Manager, but none of these procedures suggested deleting the USB controller drivers in addition to these HD devices.</li></ul>
<p><span>I found the ultimate solution as a result of speaking with a friend who is very technically adept, but who is a very linear thinker. This person downplayed my theory that it was a driver or registry issue,
 saying that I had no concrete evidence that this behavior was the result of some kind of driver issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Speaking with him helped me realize that I was also thinking linearly about this issue.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I was just as certain that there was some kind of driver-related issue going on, so I decided to re-frame the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps there was a driver problem that was <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not associated with</span></strong> an outdated, corrupt or incorrect driver.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I started to look for different evidence to support my theory.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I recalled that I had seen the “Outranked Driver” message in a Device Manager Snap Dump of the system that occurred just as the OS attempted to mount an HD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But I had not pursued what that message might signify.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>THE INNOVATION:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>When I considered what the term "outranked driver" might mean, the real problem stuck out like a sore thumb.
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>I had been looking all over the place for more recent or updated HD drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There were no such new drivers that I could find.<span> There were no such drives to be found.&nbsp;
</span>Device Manager’s “Update Drivers” option always said that I had the most current versions of the drivers. I then inferred from that “Outranked Driver” phrase that the OS was trying to mount an HD but was unsuccessful because some other device driver
 was overriding an attempt by another driver to perform whatever operation(s) it was supposed to do.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>That inference turned out to be correct.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I googled on "Outranked Driver", I found references to a problem that was
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not exactly the same</span></strong> as my problem for HDs. This post dealt with system behavior that was similar to my problem with HDs, but it related to FDs instead.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The solution for this problem had resolved the drive letter assignment problem for FDs, so it might work for HDs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The bigger question is what caused the problem in the first place. This was a new Win10 system that worked fine for 2-3 weeks and then, suddenly one day I could no longer mount HDs or FDs.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I suspect that this problem started when I installed Acronis Backup on this Win10 system.
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Acronis installs some of its own proprietary drivers.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I had been using Acronis for years with Win7.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, I was never able to get Acronis to work on this new Win10 machine. I did not uninstall Acronis immediately.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>I had been using Acronis for years with Win7.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, I was never able to get Acronis to work on this new Win10 machine. I did not uninstall Acronis immediately.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now, it’s possible that Acronis did not work because of this very device/controller driver conflict, but as I could no longer mount USB HDs, I put the Acronis issue on the back burner.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps when Acronis installed its drivers, something in the load order of drivers for controllers and devices was modified which resulted in this drive letter assignment issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Several months after having given up on Acronis Backup, I uninstalled Acronis. I now suspected that since this problem started when I installed Acronis, perhaps it might clear up after I uninstalled it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>WARNING:</span></span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you want to uninstall Acronis
 Backup, download and execute the “Acronis Removal Tool” from the Acronis website.
<em>Uninstalling from Windows (as normal) or uninstalling with some other utility software such as CCleaner does not remove all of Acronis.</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Immediately after uninstalling Acronis, I was able to mount two HDs (that had not mounted for weeks).<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Problem solved?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Nope!<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>This was not the end of the drive letter assignment problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After a few minutes of testing with these 2 HDs, I tried other HDs and the drive letter assignment problem returned.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thinking about why this happened in retrospect may make sense.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had deleted the profiles for these two HDs from the hidden device lists in Device Manager.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These two devices continued to mount intermittently after other HDs failed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In all cases, the two “revived” HDs would mount with drive letters whenever I restarted Windows.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But I still had not considered removing the controller drivers at this point, so the other HDs were still not mounting.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>I thought about what that “Outranked Driver” message in that Snap Dump might mean and that led to the solution!</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>EPILOGUE:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Engineers and Tech Support staff at Microsoft and Hewlett Packard took a look at this behavior and could not figure out reasons for this behavior.
 We did TeamViewer sessions and sent log files, screen shots, etc.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><span>They recommended reinstalling the Windows OS from scratch and guaranteed that this would solve the drive letter problem.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong>
<ul>
<li><span>A Windows reinstall would probably have resolved the problem, but what would I do if and when the problem returned?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>My biggest concern about reinstalling Windows was that reloading the OS, Applications and Data would be highly time-consuming and highly risky.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What if I missed restoring some data stored in an obscure location or forgot to install a critical application?</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Engineers and Tech Support staff at EaseUs and Partition Wizard also took a look at this behavior and could not figure out reasons for this behavior.</strong><span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>We also did TeamViewer sessions and sent log files, screen shots, etc.</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>They suggested that the HDs that would not mount either had corrupted file systems or were damaged.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong>
<ul>
<li><span>That was not the case as I could load these HDs on other computers and confirm that all data in the NTFS partitions was there.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li></ul>
</li><li><strong><span>They also suggested re-formatting the HDs on this new machine and then copying data to the newly formatted drives.</span></strong>
<ul>
<li><span>That was not possible because the new machine failed to format any of these HDs because the last step of formatting is to assign a new drive letter.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><span>I always suspected that there was an easier way, and it turned out that there was, though it took a lot of time and effort to make this discovery.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>DISPOSITION:
</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Now I have a fully functional system, and</span></li><li><span>I may have discovered the root cause, and</span></li><li><span>If the problem returns, I have a fix for it.</span></li></ol>

<br />
<br />    The currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupt
<br />    Your PC requires an update for issues that may conflict with a USB external hard drive and Windows
<br />    Windows may be missing other important updates hardware or software issues
<br />    Your USB controllers may have become unstable or corrupt
<br />    Your external drive may be entering selective suspend
<br />    Your PC motherboard may need updated drivers
<br />
<br />Resolution
<br />To resolve this issue, follow the steps in the methods below in the order listed. If the first method does not fix the problem, proceed to the next.
<br />
<br />Method 1: Uninstall and then reconnect the external hard drive
<br />This method resolves issues where the currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupt.
<br />
<br />    Select Start, type Device Manager in the Search box
<br />    Select Device Manager from the returned list.
<br />    Select Disk Drives from the list of hardware
<br />    Press and hold (or right-click) the USB external hard drive with the issue, and select Uninstall.
<br />    After the hard drive is uninstalled, unplug the USB cable.
<br />    Wait for 1 minute and then reconnect the USB cable. The driver should automatically load
<br />    Check for the USB drive in Windows Explorer
<br />
<br />Note Connecting your USB external hard drive into a non-powered USB hub can cause a lack of enough power to operate the external drive. Instead, plug it directly into your computer.
<br />
<br />If your problem still persists, proceed to Method 3.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Install the latest Windows Updates
<br />This method will install the latest device drivers for your USB external hard drive.

<br />
<br />If your problem still exists, proceed to Method 5.
<br />
<br />Method 4: Disable USB selective suspend setting.
<br />This method prevents your USB external drive from powering down.
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, type power plan in the Search box, and then select Choose a power plan.
<br />    Next to your currently selected plan, select Change Plan Settings.
<br />    Select Change advanced power settings.

<br />    Select Apply &gt; OK.
<br />
<br />Method 5: Install your motherboard's latest chipset drivers.
<br />This method updates your motherboard's chipset drivers, so your computer will recognize your USB external hard drive.
<br />
<br />    Review your computer's documentation which should contain the name of the motherboard manufacturer.
<br />    Visit your computer manufacturer's support website. For a list of computer manufacturers' support sites, see Computer manufacturers' contact information.

            <p>​Hi <strong>Dave</strong>,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community forums.</span></div>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div><span>From the issue description, I see that you are unable to use Vuze Software on the computer it crashes.</span></div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div><span>I</span><span> can imagine the inconvenience
 you have experienced.</span><span> We are here to help and guide you in the right direction.<br />
<br />
</span></div>
<div><b><span>To resolve this issue I may need few more information:</span></b></div>
<p>1. What exactly happens when you try to open Vuze?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error messages?</p>
<p>3. Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if the version of Vuze that you are using is <span>
</span><span>compatible
</span>with Windows 7 in the below link.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You will need to check with Dell Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in the Dell Forums<br />
about any known issues. Could be there is a hardware issue however as OEM Dell is responsible for the<br />
proper operation both of the hardware and Windows.<br />

                    has anyone found a fix for the touch screen not working on part of the screen when I use finger touch. The pen works fine on all of the screen. The problem first occurred after the 26 July 2018 upgrade.

</p><p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0b194267-a359-44ae-8bc7-0550487be133" title="jvgwg">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for raising your concern here in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An update was release for Surface Pro 4 devices on January 2019 to improve the system stability for Surface touch firmware. Please check the version of your firmware by opening
<strong>Device manager&gt; Expand firmware&gt;Surface touch. </strong>Latest version should be
<span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>107.0.106.3</strong>&nbsp;<span><span><span>and
<strong>107.3.106.6</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, the device should be running windows 10 version&nbsp;1809 to get the updated release. If in case the device is not up to date, you may check for updates by opening
<strong>Settings&gt; Updates &amp; Security&gt; Windows update&gt; check for updates</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the response. Since the issue is also present while you open UEFI screen, It could be a hardware related issue. You may need to use a USB recovery drive to reinstall windows. Please visit this link:

<p>
</p><p>As long as there is not crack in your screen &amp; it just has an area that is not responding to the pen or touch download the
<a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/downloads/W0009338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Touch screen calibration tool</a> &amp; run it, reboot and everything should be working normally. If not then you have bigger issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should do a backup or at a minimum create a restore point in case you need to revert back.</p>

    <title>How to Fix Audiodg.exe High CPU Usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fordcom  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Fix Audiodg.exe High CPU Usage</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2"><strong>What is Audiodg.exe?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The audiodg.exe file made its appearance in Microsoft Vista, which explains why I haven’t seen this file before. When I viewed the properties of the file, the description stated Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation, which doesn’t help explain what it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing a little research I found out that the audiodg.exe file hosts the audio engine for Vista, and from what I hear Windows 7 as well. All the DSP and audio processing is performed within this file. Vendors are able to install their own DSP and audio
 effects into the audio pipeline, which will then be processed by audiodg.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this can also lead to some problems. How do we fix the problem? Lets take a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disabling Audio Effects</strong></p>
<p>In order to fix the high CPU usage, I disabled the audio enhancements processed by the audiodg.exe file. To disable the audio enhancements, use the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click the speaker icon in the lower right corner.<br />
Select Playback Devices from the menu. A list of devices should appear on the screen.<br />
Double-click the device that has a green checkmark. The properties windows for that device should open.<br />
Click the Enhancements tab at the top.<br />
From the list of enhancements, uncheck all of them, or click the Disable all enhancements checkbox.<br />
Click the OK button to save your changes and close the window.<br />
Click OK to close the Playback Devices window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this help solve the problem.</p>

<p>Re: FileNotFoundException 0x8007007E </p>
<p><br />
The solution is in the error message "...FileNotFoundException" means there is a file missing, that is, one of the files your program depends on is not deployed.</p>
<p><br />
Run SFC /Scannow to make sure there is no system corruption. </p>

Run CheckSUR to verify there are no system packages that have become damaged.</p>

    <title>I can&#39;t launch Metro Exodus no matter what I&#39;ve done or tried - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cain3482  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t launch Metro Exodus no matter what I&#39;ve done or tried</h2>
                    So I've opened up a ticket with the Metro Technical support but I'm gonna paste what I sent to them here as well, because the resolution could come from them or relate to Xbox (Beta), Windows Store, Xbox game pass and/or PC game pass not properly functioning.
 Here is what I sent to them:<br />
<br />
"I can no longer play Metro: Exodus as when I press play through the Xbox (Beta) program nothing happens. I've checked my tskmgr and no Metro Exodus program started for me to try to kill and restart. Originally I tried a couple dx12 fixes (in addition to trying
 MULTIPLE times to turn dx12 off but I couldn't) and that worked for a day or two. But now nothing I do will get it to run. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, safe mode, running through the Windows Store, running through Xbox (Beta), running from my
 start menu (which opens up the Microsoft Store to the "Gaming Services" page that then tells me the product is already installed) and all of the above in administrator mode(s) as well (where I could). I've also added the metroexodus.exe to the exceptions for
 my antivirus, and I've tried it with the antivirus disabled AND un-installed.&nbsp;I also have done a driver and windows update.<br />
<br />
If there is any known way to fix this please let me know, thank you."<br />
<br />
<br />
I know my spec's aren't the newest but I know those aren't really the issue here, yeah they aren't helping but when the game was actually running it was smooth and everything stayed at a good temp. The real issue here is that the game won't event start.
<br />
<br />
For reference though I have a GTX 970 FTW, 24 GB DDR3 1600, i7 3770 @ 3.4, and the game is installed on an SSD with my primary (boot) partition being on another SSD.

            Just now adding that this has extended to Void Bastards as well. Clicking on Play no longer does anything for that as well, and it doesn't respond in the same manner from my start menu.<br />
<br />
I have now also tried uninstalling the Xbox (Beta) app and reinstalling it, as well as resetting it from the Windows Settings menu.

            Im having the same problem. I was able to play the game before, but it did often give me game launch trouble (random metroexodus.exe not responding messages) but now the game flat out wont respond at all, making no visible effort to launch.

            Yup, that was one of the last things I mentioned in the copied email to the Metro team. I updated drivers and Windows updates before and during this process (including using the Update assistant which was needed to force my pc to update to even be able
 to download the game in the first place).

            Hey Cain,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you too are having this problem and unfortunately you're going to have to stay awhile and listen. There is another thread here with the same issues, see it here:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/metro-exodus-crashes-on-launch-on-windows-10-xbox/ff7f0ae7-4ec9-4a93-8b8a-3d2400fe425c">Metro
 Exodus crashes on launch on Windows 10 Xbox</a>. The state of Metro Exodus is not good. Bugs ranging from unable to launch the game, Freezes and story progression issues have been known about since launch back in Feb. 4A doesn't appear to be serious in fixing
 the game at this point, seeing it is now July and the issue is on Xbox One, and PC's Steam, Epic and XGP.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At this time, it feels as if they will release a redux version of the game like they did with Metro: Last Light which will fix these issues that you will need to buy again at a discounted cost if you own the original. I sincerely hope you do get some traction
 with 4A. Good luck to all of us.

<p>I've recently ran across the problem as well.&nbsp; I had been playing this game with no issue, until recently.&nbsp; Now when i click play from Xbox(beta) game pass.&nbsp; the only thing that happens is the notice that the xbox window is closing notification, then nothing.
 Doesn't even look like the game tries to launch.&nbsp; &nbsp; I had uninstalled the game and reinstalled the game.&nbsp; Made sure i had the latest drivers / windows updates.&nbsp; The issue remains.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was able to launch my other game installed through xbox gamepass (Void
 Bastards).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a solution?&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a blatant violation of the user agreement I and Microsoft made when I signed up for Xbox Live.&nbsp; I am currently looking into filing a class-action lawsuit against 343 Industries and Xbox Live/Microsoft for breach of contract and violation of the user
 agreement.&nbsp; Anybody who is interested in getting in on this lawsuit please reply to this thread before Microsoft blocks it because they are afraid of the truth.&nbsp; They are getting sued and it will not go well for them.&nbsp; If they had halfway decent customer service
 it might not have come to this.&nbsp; Too bad for them.</p>

<h2>            Kick people out for not playing the objective.</h2>
                    
<p>I hop in a domination game and the match starts. There's 6 people and its just me and this random guy playing the objectives. The other 4 people just pubstomp and don't even go near a flag. They didn't even attempt to get the starting flag! Amazingly, we
 won and I preferred the guy who played the objective. They didn't even do good if they were just trying to get kills; I'm just here trying to get the DEVGRU Intimidator headgear.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I just think that for every 90 seconds or 80 points, you should at least have one capture. I'm just sick of trying to cap an opposite flag and a lone wolf runs past me and I lose the flag.</p>
<p>Oh and I recognized the GT of the people and the members were a pubstomping clan on YT called
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2 vs a whole team doesnt win in dom. The other guys' "pubstomping" probably had something to do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm saying that from a capper's perspective. Two of us capping and the rest of the team making it possible = win.</p>

<p>Noob is right, dom has been infested by killl/death , spawn trappers, just people who are allergic to caps.</p>
<p>Winning or losing, these guys will rarely cap.</p>
<p>A clan member wanted to play it, and I said "I don't play dom anymore because some of you guys don't cap."</p>
<p>He responded "I just want to get my K/D up."</p>
<p>I called another guy out and he said "I'm not about to go on the cap and get shot."</p>
<p>Without spawn camping games like CTF and Demolition, those players are trying to get high K/D ratios in Dom and Blitz.</p>
<p>No respect for players like this.</p>
<p>TDM is too slow, and they can't maintain in Cranked, so they look for easy kills by not doing the objective.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Thats just it.. &nbsp; people say they dont like it because noone caps .... well .... cap.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You cant complain about other people not filling a position if you dont want to do it yourself. Like I said, it only takes one or two cappers when you have a team of decent slayers. I've won many a game of dom being the only one capping. i'd rather be
 the only one capping than be on a team where everyone wants to cap.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Its just plain stupid to put 3 or 4 guys on a flag. One half decent player can take out all of them and then cap himself before they have time to get back.. Back off and let them try to take it again and he just earned some good rewards.</p>

<p>You're not trapping a good team, and they will bring strong forces to cap the B flag and no way just 1 person is going to hold off a good team.</p>
<p>So what do you do when you can't keep them in the spawn?</p>
<p>What do you do when your 1 or 2 guys can't hold the caps and you're losing?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all are you talking about a good team and a bad team, 2 good teams,???? The op I assume is playing with randoms from his description. ( if not he needs to find a different team if he doesnt like the way they play)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If its a team of randoms they arent likely to outgun a good team. Their best bet is to separate and take up safe positions that have a line of fire on 2 flags.Its a lot easier to defend a flag than take it no matter how many guys you have going for it.
 You are more likely to cap with one or 2 guys sneaking in while the others hold back the other team...... even just having them draw fire while the cappers cap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When he meantioned one guy just running right by when he was trying to cap.I dont know the exact scenario he was in, but if I see a single teammate capping and enemies nearby .... I'm not likely to jump on the flag. I'll try to draw as much attention
 to me away from the flag and give him a chance to cap. If I jump on the flag too, we are both going to die and definitely not get the cap. Same thing if I'm on the flag. stay away from me unless its completely safe. i'm a pretty sneaky capper and if there
 is a gunbattle going on.... keep it away from me else I might just get dead because of you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; If you have a really good team who all cap and all are good at killing that may work great. But it just doesnt work for a team of randoms. &nbsp; If you are a mediocre team, or a team of randoms, you just dont want to put them all out in the open in one bunch
 for the enemy to massacre.</p>

<p>Noob is right, dom has been infested by killl/death , spawn trappers, just people who are allergic to caps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I'm talking why I DO play dom (and blitz ) solo, and why it works for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If everyone is capping you need to work as a team. But if you have a room full of random killwh*res, that works great for me ( a lone random capper). Let them kill and I'll cap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I play with randoms 90% of the time and have pretty good success. I usually have a good win rate, and win or lose I usually have the most caps in the whole lobby. Its just about filling that position that needs filled instead of expecting someone else
 to help me and play like I want them to. I cant change them. But I can change my own strategy to work with whatever they are doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as blitz goes. I like that even more. I always play with randoms and almost always win. I carry about a 5.5 avg caps per game and the only time I have bad games is when we have too many players capping. ( And thats partially my fault because I
 insist on capping rather than taking a defensive role)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My whole point is if you are a capper, there is no reason to complain about teammates padding their k/d. If they are killing, you can cap. If you cant , its because you have the same mindframe as them and not a capper. .</p>

<p>This whole thread is a bit pointless if I may say.... I mean the OP states that his team won, ATOG backs up the strategy quite well - whilst not saying that this is the best way to play every game and not saying that they are not stat padding, but think
 about it, its a team game...., if everyone in the team just went for caps, its more likely that the whole team would be killed whilst trying to cap and actually that tactic would be easier to defend against.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Whilst I agree that team members not playing the objective when the team is losing is annoying.... Op's team won and yet still complaining... would you be happier if they all played the objective and lost?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In every team - not just in COD but in every team, each member has its job to do - defense / attack / support / whatever...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for not going for the start flag... there is actually a very logical reason... by avoiding the first cap, they give themselves the chance to get to B dom and prevent the opponents capping it until their own team has capped the start Dom, then moved to
 B - which to be fair, is the usual tactic....</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Think back to Convoy - everyone would sprint to cap Bdom on the bridge as it is easy to defend, touch to cap, so getting B Dom straightaway from the start is actually a better tactic than just getting the easy cap with the start flag.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Not saying I am right but it is an alternative perspective.</p>

                    I got a few calls from 714-707-3350 on my cell some time back and tonight looked it up on the Internet. Some people said it was a scam, some said it was an&nbsp; service to avoid scams, ans some said it was from Microsoft Account Verification. I don't have
 an Xbox just windows 10 on my PC where I have a microsoft account that I rarely use. I don't even remember what it's for! Should I be concerened?

<h2>            The whole screen above the taskbar goes green when updating computer&#39;s performance score.</h2>
                    When I click to update my computer's performance score the whole screen above the task bar goes completely lime-green. Windows side bar and all desktop icons dissappear. The taskbar remains and the mouse and keyboard work.
<br />
<strong>(1)</strong>Pressing "Esc" aborts the process and brings the normal screen back.
<br />
<strong>(2)</strong> If the process is started again allowed to continue, right clicking over the&nbsp;corresponding little window in the task bar brings up a pop-up box and clicking "minimise" in that results in a percentage count-up in the little taskbar window.
 When that reaches 100% the desktop returns to normal.<br />
<strong>(3)</strong> If the process is started again and allowed to continue, doing nothing results in the screen returning to normal when the task is complete.<br />

            Hi D.R.W,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
As you are aware the Customer Rating Index is based on the performance mixed with components of the system.<br />
<br />
A slight test is conducted on certain parameters, involving Processors, Video Display adapters and Memory, as well as other components.&nbsp; The primary ones are listed in the Customer Experience Rating section.<br />
<br />
As these are reviewed to display the end rating, it sounds as though one of the components in that lineup are in need of either a driver/firmware or possibly a stress test done on the items may review some hardware malfunctions.<br />
<br />
I suggest you performing a good backup of your system then updating all system Bios and firmware, updating any drivers from the components manufacturers website, then if your hardware vendor has some 32 bit diagnostics to run outside of the operating system,
 you may run a 2 loop stress test to confirm that all your components are in sound working order.<br />
<br />
Verify the above suggestions are in place and see about finding a stress test from your computer vendor, if it is still under warranty you might run through some health checks with your hardware vendor.<br />
<br />
Please let us know the results of what you find.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            <p>Hello, i had the same problem with my HDMI home-theater, i couldn't get HDMI&nbsp;sound passtrough 5.1&nbsp;(error&nbsp;0x80bd0009) probably due to 4K resolution. I found a solution so i hope it could help you, it just need to be configured first&nbsp;in&nbsp;manual&nbsp;1080P, it's just a bug of the autodetect resolution&nbsp;mode that almost never works for passthrough sound even in 1080p now. First you need to switch in display and sound TV connection from Auto-detect to HDMI. Then you'll have a poor resolution. You'll have to switch to 1080P and then accept all the options available in advanced video&nbsp;options and&nbsp;on the right&nbsp;for games and apps, don't forget to select :&nbsp;Allow 4k. When you'll have done this you'll need to go in audio output and select under&nbsp;speaker audio HDMI audio and 5.1 passthrough (or 7.1 depending on your home-cinema). Here you shouldn't get the error code (0x80bd0009). Then you'll just need to get back to Display and sound and go back to Display

<h2>            Windows Mail App tries to open then closes seconds later.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing a problem with the Mail App in Windows 10 and am wondering if someone knows a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking on Mail the Mail window opens, does not show anything other than the blue background and then closes 2-3 seconds later. This has continued to happen after a restart, clean boot, SFC and DISM scans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are the details of the error from the application event log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Melowin Mar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks for your reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I had made no changes to my computer before the issue.</span></p>
<p>I did not try the App Troubleshooter no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only just switched my computer on today and tried the Mail App before replying to your message. Strangely It has started working again. :) I had restarted my system several times yesterday and restarting made no difference then so I dont know why
 my computer being off overnight would be any different to a restart yesterday. Very weird.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue happens again I will try the App Troubleshooter and let you know the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again. :)</p>
