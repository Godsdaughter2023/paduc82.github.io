<h2>            Desktop not showing at startup, no icons, just plain black screen</h2>
                    At the moment my computer startsup I see nothing at all, no desktop, no icons. just a plain black screen and sometimes i can start task manager and then<br />
from there start explorer but sometimes that is impossible.<br />
<br />
I saw another entry in this forum about it and i did what it says but I had<br />
no luck at all.<br />
<br />
the other entry link is http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaappearance/thread/1823caee-f574-4559-88ca-65b0e4c1222b<br />
<br />
I already download the Windows Vista recovery disk and tried the startup repair and the program says that there is no issue at all,<br />
then i tried a system restore and same bad luck.<br />
<br />
So there is another way to fix this without format and install everything again?

 Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the things you can think up if only you try!

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers forums!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have Windows vista installation disk?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try this out first:</span></p>
<p><span>Open the Task Manager (Ctrl + Alt + Delete), then the tab processes, select and end explorer.exe. Then click a menu in the toolbar, select and run as a write explorer.exe, then accept.<br />
<br />
This process will make the Windows desktop restarts.</span></p>
<p><span>If not,</span></p>
<p><span>Check what happens when you try to boot in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>To start your computer in safe mode, you can refer the below link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to boot to safe mode, try the following changing registry&nbsp; settings:</span></p>
<p><span>You have to set the default value for the windows shell setting:<br />
<br />
In the Windows Registry (open 'regedit')<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon\<br />
<br />
Set 'Shell' variable = 'Explorer.exe'</span></p>
<p><strong><span>REGISTRY EDIT DISCLAIMER:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However,
 serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more
 information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

            Hi Anneloye,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
This is the Q/A on uninstalling from IncrediMail website:<br />
<br />
<span>Q: How do I uninstall IncrediMail? <br />
<br />
A:</span> To uninstall IncrediMail, simply do the following:
<ol>
<li>Click the Windows <span>'Start'</span> menu, scroll to <span>
'Programs'</span>, select <span>'IncrediMail'</span> and click
<span>'Uninstall IncrediMail'</span>. <br />
<br />
<span>Note:</span> When uninstalling IncrediMail, you will lose all unsaved data. It is recommended to backup your IncrediMail data before uninstalling, in case you will want to use it again in the future.
<br />
</li><li>Select the <span>'Uninstall IncrediMail'</span> option (marked in
<span>red</span>) and click <span>'Next'</span> (marked in
<span>blue</span>). When asked to verify the uninstallation process, click
<span>'Yes'</span>. <br />
<br />

</li><li>Once the uninstall completes, restart your computer. <br />
</li><li>Browse to: <span>C:\Program Files\IncrediMail</span>. <br />
</li><li>Delete the <span>'bin'</span> folder to completely remove IncrediMail from your computer.

            To make sure I am on the same page. Did the firmware update install not work? Or was it already up to date? Or after the firmware update, you are still seeing the same issue?
<br />
<br />After you plug in the webcam could you restart your computer and leave the webcam plugged in during the process. Then run a windows update?
<br />
<br />After this does it work?

 can get on the networks before and after modem restarts. The only thing that can't get on the networks is our two xboxes........I have restarted router/modem at least ten times and did factory resets on the xbox network settings...it refuses to get on the
 network...but again the only devices that can't get on is the Xboxes....Kindles...I pad....and PC's not problem.</p>

I have a similar problem with a laptop running Windows 10, except that it goes to sleep after 2 to 3 minutes. All of the power and sleep options are set to default option which is at least 15 minutes, and the computer is always under AC power.<br /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The window that appears allows you to choose any bitmap (.bmp) file to use as a mirror texture. There aren't any already available in the folders on your computer, you will need to find one. I searched for "gold textures" using
 the image search option on Goog: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?as_st=y&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=ift:bmp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=gold+textures&amp;backchip=g_1:metallic+gold&amp;chips=q:gold+textures&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK-Nqyi-zVAhUCK1AKHSEPCPoQ3VYIJygA&amp;biw=1305&amp;bih=694&amp;dpr=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Google search results for">
Gold Textures</a>, and I imagine similar results could be found with other search engines.<br />
<br />
Once you have found something that looks shiny (keep the image relatively plain: complex images will get lost in the animation) save it somewhere you can find it (eg the Pictures library)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">If the image you find is .jpeg or .png you will need to convert it to .bmp - do this by opening it Paint, and choosing "Save As" and on the filetype option choose "24bit Bitmap"</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Using the "Custom Reflection" option will move the image separately from the movement of the text, adding to the reflective effect. "Custom Texture" will keep the image on the same place on the text (eg for wood grain effect, or
 bricks, or a tie stripe)</p>

<h2>            Cannot change port used by Scanner</h2>
                    I have a Brother Multi function printer that was installed by USB until we got a Network port installed that it could be plugged into. I have no problem changing the printer properties to the correct port but when I go to scan properties it still has the
 USB port and it will not allow me to change anything. Where do I need to go to change the port assigned to the Scanner. I tired looking in the Device Manager but I do not see a separate listing for the scanner.

<p>Hi Alisida,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wrong configuration settings may be the possible reason why you're unable to change the port of the scanner. To assist you better, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes prior to this issue?</li><li>Have you tried checking the manual of your scanner?</li></ul>
<p>

<p>No there have been no changes and everything was installed per the manual. The manufacturer instructions do not include changing the port for the Scanner. When I looked up on their support site they said to go to camera and scanners in Windows and change
 it there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finally able to find it in the Device Manager under Imaging devices but it would not let me edit any values there.

<p>Thank you for the details you have provided. The best way to properly configure a multi-function printer that is using the network port is to uninstall it first. Then reinstall the software driver. Most installer includes a device setup wizard that will
 help you properly configure these devices to use the proper port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're still unable to setup the scanner to use the correct network port, for better assistance, we highly recommend that you contact the device hardware manufacturer.<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>I am aware that you should be able to fix it by uninstalling the multi-function device and reinstalling it with the new port options.&nbsp; However this is not a fix it is a work around. Sometimes when you uninstall the printer it leaves remnants of the scanner
 so you have to go into the device manager make sure the scanner is removed, which is problematic if you have two of the same device installed since unlick the printer the scanner is not renamed what you name it. It has just the device name so it is difficult
 to identify the separate devices. Then you have to reboot the computer check that all remnant's are gone which often includes uninstalling any of the manufacturer software that came with the device and reinstall everything. This is incredible time consuming
 and as I have found over the last year has many things that you have to check to make sure it will even work. One of the issue that I have is on reinstall Windows wants you to select the printer from the list, whoever if you do this it tries to use the Brother
 Network name and not the IP, depending on the subnet the device and the computer on&nbsp;this does not work and i have to set it to the IP. But I don't know this until after I try it. Then I have to go through the who process again then try let me manually install
 the device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I see it this is a functionality of Windows that should be fixed. If you change the name and or port of the Multi-Function printer it should also change it for the Scanner record that is part of that printer, since in essence they are the same device.&nbsp;If
 not that then it should at least let me change the port on the scanner port of the device. This would be a much simpler fix than the reinstall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are too many occasions where a device is moved and the port needs to be changed but there is nothing else different.&nbsp;There is no reason I should have to go through all the trouble of reinstall a device when all I did was change the port it is using.
 For example I have an employee that has moved office 3 times in the last year and each time the device has to be given a different IP than it had before because it is on a different subnet. This also takes time to get set in our IT office, on one occasion
 she had to wait for a network port to be installed. So we temporary needed it to use USB port then switch it to the new IP Port. I see no reason why I should not be able to change the port on the scanner especially when I can change it on the Printer. This
 is the only thing causing problems and requiring me to spend over an hour uninstalling and reinstalling.

<p>To further assist you, we'd like to know if you've tried contacting the hardware manufacturer. The setting that must be changed or you're looking for is related to a third-party device. It may be related to that device's software driver and might be found
 in the software driver from the manufacturer. That is why it is important to contact the manufacturer for proper assistance.</p>

<p>This response just tells me you did not actually read my last post. I don't need to contact the manufacturer and the manufacturer provides no help with this. It is an issue of Windows not letting me do a simple fix of changing the port number that the scanner
 uses. I can fix the issue and did. The problem is the amount of work and time that is required that should not be. I should not have to uninstall the device and reinstall it when the only change is the port. And just so you know like most device the manufacturer
 points to what windows shows the port is and&nbsp; has not option in their software to change the port it points to. if you try it just pulls up the windows scanner list. I have yet to come across a single device, HP, Cannon, Ricoh, Brother, Espson..... that&nbsp;includes
 the ability to change the port in their driver software. There would be no point since this is and should be managed by windows.

    <title>Why do mapped drive letters vanish and then become unavailable for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why do mapped drive letters vanish and then become unavailable for re-mapping&#63;</h2>
                    I have noticed that my Windows 7 Ultimate machine has a tendency to lose one of my mapped drive letters for some reason.&nbsp; Other machines mapped to this same share and same drive letter never lose their mapping to this Y share drive.&nbsp; The first time that
 I lost this share mapping, I also lost my use of the drive letter Y, which was originally assigned to that share.&nbsp; I am no longer able to use that drive letter.&nbsp; I am able to remap the share to a different drive letter, but just no longer to drive Y, so that
 it matches all of my other machines.<br />
<br />
This is only happening to a single share folder and only on a single machine.&nbsp; In my drop down list of mapped drive letters, all are drive letters are accounted for except for drive Y, which is just missing completely from the list.&nbsp; I was originally able to
 map to drive Y.&nbsp; I was originally visible in the drop down listing.<br />

This has been an ongoing&nbsp;problem since the very beginning of the backwards compatibility program. You sign in on your Xbox One and during the launch of a backwards compatible game you see the pop up buble telling you that you are signed in to Xbox Live but...low and behold! The game immediately says otherwise when it comes to accessing any online content such as extra “downloadable” content or multiplayer content or anything that requires you to be signed in to Xbox Live. (Please be aware that according to the network testing I am behind a cone NAT. &nbsp;open)&nbsp;Now the interesting thing I have also seen is that I have access to account information and other info that seems to indicate that I am indeed signed in to Xbox Live but the game does not recognize this at all. I have tried all of the (exhaustively) suggestions in forums in many places here and in other places online and what I have seen i

            <p>I detect that the packages KB3099862 &amp; KB3097989, affect the runtime engine when the reports run over MS Framework 3.5 or 2.0, and try to export to PDF. Also have problem with the numbers of instance to be running over the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can uninstall these two updates to back to normally run, and check if Sap Business create a Service Pack or hotfix to resolve this issue.</p>

    <title>Fingerprint reader on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jellybean103  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fingerprint reader on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10 Pro on HP Probook 4530s (upgraded from 8.1). I cannot seem to set up fingerprint sign in after the upgrade. I tried reinstalling the Validity fingerprint driver and HP ProtectTools. HP ProtectTools does let me enroll my fingerprints
 and set up the account, but it doesn't show up at the login screen. I have enabled biometric log on in Policy Editor, and yet it does not work.</p>
<p>The search results, when I type "fingerprint" shows "Set up fingerprint sign-in". When I click on it, nothing related to fingerprints is shown.</p>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update</strong><strong>: </strong>I switched to a local account (from the Microsoft account I had been using)&nbsp;and now I can use the fingerprint sign-in and other credentials provided by HP ProtectTools! Is there a way I can use my Hotmail account
 AND ProtectTools together? Because&nbsp;Cortana needs a Microsoft account&nbsp;to function properly ._.</p>

            This solved my problem. Created another account, setup the fingerprint for the new account, and delete it. Suddenly the I can log in to main account&nbsp;using the fingerprint. Thx Jellybean103.

            <p>Yip, &nbsp;same problem. Dell latitude laptop with built-in fingerprint scanner. &nbsp;After two days chatting with Dell and Microsoft I gave up. &nbsp;I too have no option to activate fingerprint scanning in Windows 10. I reinstalled drivers to no avail. Installed Dell
 Security but it is not working with Windows 10 at all. A search on Windows 10 finds fingerprint sign in setup, &nbsp;but when you click on it, &nbsp;it only gives you password, pin, picture sign in option. &nbsp;My windows don't have "windows hello" anywhere?
</p>
<p>I tried Jellybean's solution, &nbsp;but it did not work either. </p>
<p>Dell's solution was to roll back to 8.1!!! That made me mad as their website stated my Laptop was ready for the upgrade, &nbsp;when clearly it is not. &nbsp;Just tell me it is not ready, &nbsp;then I will wait?&nbsp;</p>

            What model is your sensor VFS300 by any chance as I have that working on a Dell Vostro 3500 but it wasn't after the upgrade as Windows 10 installs the Validity Sensors (VFS300) driver and not the Validity Sensors (WBF) VFS300 driver.

            <p>I upgraded in place from Windows 8, to Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; The AuthenTec fingerprint reader in my Toshiba Satellite laptop worked better than it ever did as shipped by Toshiba in Windows Vista.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I did a clean install of Windows 10.&nbsp; Now the fingerprint reader does not work because I need to activate Windows Biometric Framework.&nbsp; How do I do that?&nbsp; I could see a greyed-out option for the fingerprint reader one of the settings window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AuthenTec&nbsp;&nbsp;Protector Suite 2012 Common version ps_common5.9.8.7279-64bit that I installed and it works very well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The common refers to machines without WBF&nbsp; Windows Biometric Foundation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the Common version I checked in Settings again and there is no entry for fingerprint reader any more but I did notice a biometric device and driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the clue for this device at least is to use software that does not depend on WBF.</p>

            <p>This is my workaround to let Validity Sensor VFS300 work with Windows Hello after I updated my Dell Vostro 3700 from Windows 7 Pro x64 to Windows 10 Pro:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall the stock fingerprint software (mine was DigitalPersona), then reboot.</p>
<p>2. Uninstall and delete the original driver (mine was called "Validity Sensor VFS300") from Device Manager\Biometric Sensor, then reboot.</p>
<p>3. Check for the new driver (mine is called "Validity Sensor (WBF) VFS300") installation in Device Manager\Biometric Sensor.</p>
<p>4. Check for Windows Hello to show up in Settings\Accounts\Sign-In Options and activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for me DELL driver doesn't work, but the auto updating one does.</p>

<p>Windows 10 is very fast, but upgrade from previous versions sometimes has some problems. For best performance you have to do a clean install</p>

            <p>I've got a little problem with the fingerprint sensor, the same I had with the old driver in Windows
 BTW password and PIN options do work, so I can step in as well, but I'd like to know how to correct this issue.</p>
<p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean reinstall
<br />You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<h2>            Windows 8 with Intel Centrino Wireless N 2230 Wireless Connection Issue</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently purchased an Asus laptop with Windows 8. &nbsp;I was enjoying the experience until today, during which I randomly lost wireless internet connectivity, and have since been unable to reconnect to the internet through the same router.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here are some interesting tidbits of information:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;I am using an Intel Centrino Wireless N 2230 adapter, and have downloaded the latest drivers for that device listed for Windows 8 64-bit from Intel's website. &nbsp;That did nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Since I can connect to the wireless router, but am *not* getting an IP address successfully through DHCP, I checked the Event Log to see if there were any hardware / system / application level warnings or errors that tipped me off to the problem. &nbsp;I
 found that every time I tried to connect, there was a log entry indicating that I could not get an IP address from DHCP. Yay. &nbsp;There was an error code 0x79; which I have found in other Microsoft Answers can be caused for a variety of reasons.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. &nbsp;I made sure that Intel Pro Set Wireless application was not running, because I read that it can interfere with the wireless connection process in Windows. &nbsp;Task manager's process view indicates that no such task is running, and I disabled any of the
 Intel wireless services from starting up (and verified that all services were currently listed as 'stopped'). &nbsp;After doing this; the problem ceased to be a limited connectivity / no IP problem, to now; I see "Can't connect to this network"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4. &nbsp;Booting into Linux; I can connect to wireless just fine and get an IP address / connect to the internet, so it does not appear to be hardware-related. &nbsp;All devices in my home that establish wireless connections are currently on, to eliminate the possibility
 of a multi-device conflict / configuration issue, and my router is not having any issues giving out plenty of IP addresses through DHCP, even to this same computer through Linux. &nbsp;The problem appears to be with Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>5. &nbsp;Everything had been working fine for 4 days since I bought this machine, it just stopped working between when I shut the PC off yesterday and booted it up today. &nbsp;I haven't checked to see if a stealth Windows update killed my configuration somehow,
 perhaps that is the cause?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>6. Windows' built-in troubleshooting mechanism is less than helpful. &nbsp;I thought I would give it a shot since I am new to Windows 8, and perhaps the feature had evolved. &nbsp;It keeps telling me that perhaps I should try to connect to an available wireless
 network. &nbsp;Sigh.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!!</div>
                </div>

            Dear Microsoft,<br />
<br />
It is indeed annoying - my brand new HP Envy with Windows 8 and Intel Centrino Wireless N 2230 worked excellent until yesterday, 20th of November, 2012 when Windows told me that it will restart within few minutes in order to complete an important update. I
 had no even choice to postpone the restart. After the restart my wireless and even Ethernet cable network adapters are gone!<br />
<br />
"Ipconfig /all" command from shell does not list wireless/Ethernet adapters any more.
<br />
<br />
Windows troubleshooter says - "The wireless network adapter is experiencing problems" and "Windows couldn't automatically bind the IP protocol stack to the network adapter".<br />
<br />
I tried to do system recovery to the state before last critical updates - no success, still no network.<br />
<br />
I downloaded from Intel's homepage latest drivers and software - now I can associate with wireless router - am connected to router as indicated by software and can be seen on routers management console, but Intel's software says "An administrator profile failed
 to obtain an IP address from the DHCP server".<br />
<br />
The only strange thing I noticed is that Windows troubleshooting report identifies different driver information as is shown on adapter in device list. Troubleshooter report says for network adapter WiFi driver information that provider is Microsoft and version
 is 14.8.8.75, but in Device Manager -&gt; Network adapter -&gt; Intel Centrino Wireless N 2230 -&gt; Properties -&gt; Driver it is shown that Provider is Intel and version is 15.5.6.48.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that there is indeed a problem with IP stack. If Windows couldn't automatically bind the IP protocol stack, please give me instructions how to help it do manually.<br />
<br />
I desperately need the solution to this problem... If you need more specific details, let me know what do you need and how to obtain them and will provide it.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Ivars<br />
<br />
UPDATED:<br />
After more than 20hrs googling and trying to get back network adapters and IP stack, I gave up and tried almost ultimate step - "Refresh my PC" which is one step before complete "Reset my PC". It helped, now network is back. And it works even with the latest
 drivers&amp;software from Intel. So it definitely was a problem in one of the last updates... Now my updates are turned off :(<br />

            I posted below in a&nbsp;different&nbsp;thread some time ago. I resolved my problem by changing the Router.
<div><br />
<div>"I'm having the same problem - Windows Store Apps doesn't connect to internet, whereas IE/Chrome from desktop has no problem. &nbsp;I've&nbsp;exhausted multitude of solutions from various forums including Vendor support and Microsoft support. What&nbsp;I've&nbsp;learnt spending
 hours of troubleshooting is that the problem is either in the driver of WiFi adapter or in the firmware of the Router.&nbsp; Mine is Dell Inspiron 5423 laptop with Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2230 running on Windows 8(factory installed) and Router is Cisco Linksys E1200.
 &nbsp;My router is serving all WiFi devices ( TV, smartphones, laptops, network printer) in my home effectively. I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;suspect it for quite some time. The options&nbsp;I've&nbsp;at present are either change the router or wait for patches.&nbsp;I've&nbsp;tested it with Belkin router
 in my friends place and also direct wire connection to DSL modem and it works just fine in both the cases. &nbsp;Just thought this would help fellow Windows 8 Guinea pigs struggling like me!"</div>

            Yup. &nbsp;As with Vards. I blame the Updates - on a new PC this week everything was fine with strength 4 of 5 on the wifi via the&nbsp;Intel Centrino Wireless-N 2230. &nbsp;Then, Windows 8 announced an essential update, which I chose to install as it had "security update"
 all over it, and I know to keep Defender up to date.
<div><br />
<div>Straight away, the wireless strength dropped to 1 of 5; the Windows Store lost contact with us; and internet became intermittent or "Limited".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've temporarily installed an external USB&nbsp;adapter&nbsp;to maintain connectivity, and have tried to re-install the old driver but Windows 8 didn't like putting anything older than the new driver on the machine. &nbsp;In the end I did some copy and pasting of the
 files, which didn't work either. &nbsp;I've now Restored the machine back to before the updates, but the problem persists - so back to the USB WiFi.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Summary:</div>
<div><br />
<div>* Worked fine from factory</div>
<div>* Windows update destroyed connectivity</div>
<div>* Microsoft problem</div>
<div><br />
<div>My next step will be to return to my PC's vendors for help nagging Microsoft - or at least a clean copy of the old driver it came with to try and over-install it again - but Vard's "Refresh" seems worth a look before I have something to loose other than
 bags of my valuable time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>(!) C'mon Microsoft, this issue has been going too long. &nbsp;Fix it (if you work in an agile environment it is long, long over due).</div>

            Same problem here with an HP Envy DV7-7203. I have made a "Reset my PC", everything working fine, and then, after a ton of updates, it gets broken.
<div><br />
<div>So I agree with the conclussion, it's a Microsoft problem</div>

            I purchased an ASUS notebook in November and am having what appears to be the same problem. Notebook came w/Windows 8 and the wireless card is also Intel Centrino Wireless N 2230.&nbsp;
<br />
It worked great for about 2 weeks then suddenly quit getting a wireless signal.&nbsp; All wifi in the house comes from same router with no problem.&nbsp;
<br />
At first I would unplug/replug the modem and generally I would get the signal back after the first or second try.
<br />
3 weeks ago the un/replugging the modem quit working.&nbsp; <br />
I spent an hour on the phone w/my brother taking command-line instructions.&nbsp; At that time the ipconfig /release &amp; renew appeared to work- according to my semi-techy brother it appears modem and router are working fine but that wireless n 2230 is having problems
 w/the IP address.&nbsp; <br />
The Windows 8 format really turned me off to MS. Every time I think I might be getting accustomed to this back@ssward system I lose my wifi.&nbsp;
<br />
Is it worth contacting MS to find out if they are aware of this problem- will they give any advice? Or did I waste my money?<br />
Mean while I will switch to Ubuntu.&nbsp; It doesn't have the MS Office tools that I need.&nbsp; But it works GREAT in so many other ways.

            Hey Guys,<br />
<br />
I've had the same problem as well, with Dell Inspiron 15z.<br />
after Dell renewed all hardware without result, I have tried deleting all drivers.
<br />
<br />
This was the procedure: <br />
- Uninstall Intel WiFi Dashboard<br />
- Uninstall adapter from Computer Management, DO also uninstall drivers.<br />
- Restart computer<br />
- (do the last step 3 or 4 times, until you reach Microsoft drivers 14.8.8.75, date 5-12-2011)<br />
<br />
This helped and my problems are now gone!!!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Jeroen<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are you trying to uninstall the
 Microsoft games which comes default with the operating system?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If not, what is the name of the
 game you are trying to uninstall?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>How are you uninstalling it?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are referring to the games included with&nbsp; Vista, you&nbsp;may try&nbsp;this:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To uninstall them,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the Start button,
 click Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the Windows Features
 dialog box, uncheck the Games check box, and then click OK.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If you are prompted
 for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>This will remove the
 games. If you want it again select the games folder in “Turn Windows Features on or off”.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Someone else is using your account</h2>
                    <p>Hey everybody !<br />
Well i have my skype for about 6 years, i never changed password, E-mail i changed but i don't really remember it, i was young so i was bad on these things ^^<br />
So as i said i used it for about 6 years, never changed pass on the whole 6 years, never had problem, till yesterday it says in French "Someone else is using your account"<br />
I'm sure that nobody else uses my account except me.<br />
<br />
The problem is that i can recover my password, skype says that my email is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but mine is @live.fr , i remember 1 week ago i verified my emails and i had 3 recovery emails, i removed the first *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 are the same, the difference is just @live.fr ... I didn't get it ...<br />
<br />
Can i do anything in this situation ?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You said that you changed your email previously but you do not remember, it could that one of the listed email address on your account is one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have removed one email address which serves as one of your <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-and-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
security info</a>, then please be reminded that updating your security info will take 30 days, so the reason why you still see the email address in your account is because the changes hasn't kicked in yet. Please update your account security information to
 those that you have access. <em>Check <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-and-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>For better account security, I would suggest that you set up <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12408/microsoft-account-about-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
two-step verification</a> so whenever your account is logged into a device that isn't a
