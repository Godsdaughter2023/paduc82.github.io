<h2>            Nokia S&#47;W Updater V1.3.0en not working</h2>
                    Hi ppl<br />
The latest version of the Nokia S/W updater or rather the firmware updater is not working..... The application crashes everytime it is started.... Trying to use older versions of the S/W is of no use as a message from the updater insists on installing the new
 version for usage.<br />
<br />
Are any of u facing the same problem?<br />
If there are any patches to this problem pls post the patch.

            Works fine with me. Have you installed the latest version of PC Suite? If so, try a FULL re-install. firstly, uninstall ALL Nokia-related software. Then go to the Nokia Website and download the Nokia Registry cleaner. Execute the program, stating you want
 to "Clean your computer". All Nokia-related registry keys and values shall now be removed from your PC. Now Restart your PC. Then download both the newest Nokia PC Suite version (even though you might already have it on your PC)and the Newest Nokia Software
 updater. then install both programs, starting with Nokia PC Suite.<br />
Now try again.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists, please post a screenshot (link). I might be able to help you.

            thanx for the reply buddy! Tried out each and every step you had mentioned BUT OF NO AVAIL. The same old CRASHING problem with this version of the application. Things have only become worse this time. The new USB drivers do not seem to accomodate connectivity
 to my phone<br />
My mobile's firmware version is as follows<br />
V 5.0609.2.0.1<br />
01-03-2006<br />
RM-84<br />
I have an update for my firmware and that would be<br />
V 5.0638.2.0.2<br />
Could you please give any additional inputs on the same.<br />

Did you try and summon some System Information in Nokia PC Suite? To do this, go to Help and click About Nokia PC Suite (sometimes just About...) Then, in the dialogue that appears, click the "System Information" button, and check whether either the "Cable
 Connectivity Drivers" or the "PC Connectivity Suite" is installed. One of those should be installed at least. If both show NOT INSTALLED, something is going wrong in the recognition of the signatures within the package. This is quite a bit of a technical explanation,
 but it comes down to the fact that one or more of the registry hooks aren't created in the right way, which would then cause Nokia PC Suite to assume the drivers not to be present.<br />
By the way, can you use other Nokia PC Suite Applications without problems? I'd suggest you try Nokia Content Copier (menu item may be called Backup &amp; Restore). If this application does work, then the drivers should be OK. If the phone isn't recognised at all,
 please try to connect the phone to a different physical USB port on the system. You might want to connect it directly to a USB port on the back of the PC, so as to rule out the problem being caused by any non-powered USB hub. Please note that ANY USB connector
 on the front of a PC is referred to as a USB Hub, because they are not located directly on the system's circuit board.<br />
I'd think that, previously, you were able to connect the phone to any old USB port on your system, as you should be. The above step of connecting the phone to a totally different USB port is to check that there are no conflicts being caused by the sloppy way
 in which Windows sometimes tends to deal with USB Device Management. Windows detects each device on each USB port. This means that, should you connect a device to port A at first, it will be detected. If you connect the very same device to port B the next
 time, then it will be detected AGAIN, as opposed to the way *Nix deals with these situations: the device's connection parameters will be re-used, instead of the device driver being installed twice.<br />
I'd suggest that, if you seem unable to use Nokia PC Suite at all (i.e. your phone is not recognised), you try to use a different port. If the problem still persists and you do have the option to use a different PC for this time, please try whether you CAN
 get NSU to work on that PC. If you don't have this option, and your phone becomes usable again but NSU still crashes, please post the EXACT message with which the system crashes, and state a crash type (i.e. BSOD, Microsoft Error Report, Nokia error code,
 etc...).<br />
BSODs shouldn't be occurring in your case, as BSODs generally tend to be caused by genuine driver and/or hardware conflicts or issues with memory.<br />
<br />
I hope you will be able to get on with what I wrote in this post; it seems to be really frustrating sometimes...

            On this topic, I am having similar problems in that It only runs once and then crashes the second time I try to run it. Found that ending process called "nsl_host_process" in task manager lets it run ok again.<br />
<br />
Also, to those having trouble where the software gets stuck on "searching for connected phone" I found that if you are using a proxy server - you have to set it to bypass it for secure connections (which is what updater uses) Just go to internet explorer -
 tools - options - connections - lan settings - advanced - untick use same settings for all protocols - and then just delete the entry out of the secure section. This worked for me, being behind an ISA server at work.

I also tried configuring the Firewall client to not pass through traffic from the Nokia Software Updater and again it works once - but not again.<br />

Thanx a lot for that patient explanation! The problem here does not seem to be with the ports which I use... It seems to be with the recognition of USB drivers by the PC Suite... The latest version of PC Suite does not seem to recognize the latest version of
 USB connectivity driver(which gets installed when the new version of NSU gets installed)..I am unable to classify this crashing problem under any of the categories you have mentioned<br />
either a Windows error report abend<br />
or a BSOD abend or a NSU error message abend...<br />
None of the above seem to surface... the application simply CRASHES...

            The problem is, that IF these devices are not recognised, the UNDERLYING problem still might be the USB port. I had the same issue when trying to update my sister's 5500 Sport. I first tried to use the same USB port as I used for my N73. At first, it worked
 great. Then, when I started NSU, the phone had disconnected itself and future detections had failed. Windows recognised that a new device had been connected (the Hardware Connected sound came up) but NPCS did nothing. Then I tried connecting the phone to a
 different port, and all of the sudden, everything worked OK again. So even IF there is a recognition problem, you still might want to try and use a different USB port. Windows is extremely fussy about hardware detection. If you'd turn up the volume of your
 sound card, and enable ALL windows sounds, you might even hear windows flick out the CONNECT_FAIL sound. This is a series of three short, low bells, indicating that there is a problem in connecting the device. This is often solved by just connecting to a different
 port.<br />
Unless I'm much mistaken, you're saying that the crashes happen without a report whatsoever (no application error, neither a Windows Crash Report). Did you perhaps turn off the "Error Reporting" feature? You can check this by Right-clicking My computer and
 selecting Properties. Then go to Advanced and click Error Reporting. If the "Disable Error Reporting" radio button is selected, please enable error reporting by clicking the relevant radio button, and enable the subsequent options as well (Windows Operating
 System and Programs).<br />
if error reporting isn't disabled, then please check the Event Log (the Application log, to be more exact). find any Error logs that have occurred right after the crash.<br />
<br />
The issue here is, that Windows would normally ALWAYS display a WCR if Error Reporting is enabled. This is because Microsoft thinks you'd find their help useful in solving your problem. If you've had many of these reports, you'll probably have chosen to disable
 the Windows Error Reporting feature, even though you might not remember this. If you use an illegal version of Windows, and you have used a WGA disabling crack, then that might also be the reason for WER to be disabled. WER sends information about your computer
 to MS. Normally, this information is completely anonymous. However, your Windows Serial Number and Product ID are also sent to Microsoft. This would eventually have enabled them to track you down (although they cannot use this 'feature' because international
 laws do not allow this). That's why many WGA hacks also disable WER.<br />
If WER IS enabled, then please notify me of this and I'll try and find a solution to your problem, as it is VERY uncommon for Windows applications to crash without a notice, whatsoever. There should at least be an entry about the crash in the Event Log (to
 be found via Administrative Tools in Control Panel) and/or a WER. You might want to find out, in case WER is enabled, whether the Dr. Whatson service is also enabled. This is a service that is very important for WER to function properly.<br />
Now, even though it might sound unconvincing, I'd suggest you try and use another USB port just this once to see whether that WILL work (I already said it did in my case, even though it seemed just a driver issue). If that doesn't work, please check whether
 WER is enabled. If it's not, then enable and retry. Please post back stating WHICH of the internal processes has crashed. If you can't seem to get over it, please report back and I'll try to find a solution.

            buddy kudos for the amazing deal of patience and enthusiasm you possess!<br />
<br />
I tries all the work-arounds you suggested. Mine is a legitimate copy of Windows and I have never made any attempts to disable error reporting.<br />
<br />
I had purged everything once again and had done a complete re-install. The connectivity problem was solved but the CRASHING problem relating to the NSU seems to be some sort of a serious BUG which is causing it to crash. I had tried installing NSU and PC Suite
 afresh on my laptop as well. The CRASHING problem surfaces even there. That too without displaying a single error<br />
<br />
The only thing I am able to observe with regard to the processes is that nsu_ui_client.exe process terminates. The nsu_host_process.exe continues to feature in the list with 0% CPU utilization. Nothing seems to be happening.

            This is the first time I have seen NSU causing such a pain in the **bleep**... It's genuinely strange that TWO of your PCs seem to experience the exact same problem. Now that you mentioned that you installed NSU on your laptop, would you mind trying whether
 the crashing also occurs if you try looking for updates using somebody else's internet connection? Some people have reported their internet connection's inability to work with NSU to be the cause for the software crashes. That is: because of some limitation
 (for example, a transparent Proxy Server (these are usually invisible to the user)) with the internet connection NSU is unable to determine whether updates are available. I have heard of reports stating that this then would lead to NSU crashing. However, that
 would be stramge in your case, as you seem to have used older versions without problems... However, I'd like to suggest you try using NSU on your laptop from another internet connection.<br />
If this is to no avail, would you mind telling me which locale (language) of Windows and Nokia PC Suite/NSU you are using?<br />
I have been able to use NSU 1.3.0en without problems... That's just why I'm doing all these perhaps somewhat curious suggestions. I hope you don't mind me hammering on some aspects. I'm just taking you through a trouble shooting sequence, and of course my ultimate
 target would be to get the software to work for you as well!

    <title>Inking into a Drawing Canvas with the Surface pen is no longer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petersteier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inking into a Drawing Canvas with the Surface pen is no longer possible - what shall I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was using Drawing Canvases to hand-write mathematical formulas into typed text with the Surface Pen. It was convenient because with the mouse I could group-select strokes, erase them with the pen eraser, scale them induvidually... I only had to be careful
 that the canvas was really selected before inking, because otherwise the new ink-everywhere feature inked over the formula in a new layer, which then would not move with the formula.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a break of one month this no longer works. If I want to ink into a canvas, it is automatically deselected, and ink-everywhere (or whatever this is called) takes over. I can no longer edit my old documents with formulas. This would maybe be acceptable,
 if the new ink-everywhere feature would not be so ridiculously disfunctional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to select individual strokes of the "Canvasses" produced by the new feature; there is no option to increase the size of a canvas to have space to write more text into it, but it always stretches the content if the canvas is resized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to give a lecture on nuclear physics next Wednesday, and I have to prepare it. I did prepare all previous lectures with the Word Drawing Canvasses. This is actually why I bought my Microsoft Surface Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do NOT suggest to use the Formula Editor (which simple takes much too long) or the Ink-to-Math feature (my Formulas are simply to complicated for that toy).</p>

<p>Congratulations, Microsoft developer team and Tucker. I can confirm that my problem is now generally solved, without workarounds. I can now again use the drawing canvasses for hand-written mathematical&nbsp; formulas&nbsp; inline in the text, though I have updated
 my office to the newest Version (Microsoft Office 365 Version 1709 ,Build 8528.2193 Click-to-Run) and I have enabled in-range inking, i.e "Options:Advanced:Pen:Use pen to select..." not checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pen now correctly inks into the canvas (if it is selected before), in new and older documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, a strange bug where the view jumped to the beginning of the document when the cursor was traversing over a lowered inline canvas ("Home:Font:Advanced:Position -&gt; Lowered") has diappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are still some minor nissances left: sometimes strokes far away from the eraser position&nbsp; are erased when erasing is the first action inside a canvas after selecting it. And strange vertical lines up to the top of the page sometimes appear, apparently
 a glitch wher the vertical coordinate is missed during drawing. It seems to appear mainly for documents with a lot of formulas. It is not a hardware problem, as it does not show up in in-range inking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, good work. I have to admit that, though I have a critical mind, see no alternative to MS Office on the market for my user case.</p>

                    <p>Please help me resolve the following - yesterday Skype pushed me to update from Classic to the recent version, and I can't have a normal call anymore. People say they either can't hear me at all, or my voice is constantly breaking up. I'm using Windows 10
 with all the latest system and driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did/checked:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Reinstalled audio drivers</p>
<p>- Tried to troubleshoot the mic, no issues found by the system</p>
<p>- Reinstalled Skype</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing helped, I still can't make a proper call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help as I use Skype for business and have a dozen call conferences a day.</p>

<p>Here's what helped me have several normal calls today, with people being able to hear me more or less fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply switched off "Automatically adjust microphone settings" in Skype settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether it's gonna be a solution in the long run, will be testing.</p>

                    <p>After update to (9860) My Original windows 10 Profile had a broken few things going wrong. I came up with Brilliant Idea create New one and start almost over. What a Plan Still I did it Now I created a whole new set of Issues. Pinball FX2 won't recover xbl
 Profile loads but there's nothing prompting to recover the Pinball Tables I had purchased Last year and up till win 10 was Available My .net passport Microsoft ID Now&nbsp;12 years old and fragged up Pretty bad I keep getting One Drive settings Prompt upon signing
 into to this Mess I call a window 10 Profile. I can't sync nothing&nbsp;to many trusted devices I suspect some of the Problem. I can't get some things to Behave now I'm not signed in But I am kind of thing so apps and some games from app store won't sync back up.
 Can I fix any of these Issues with Microsoft just sync back up in time ?&nbsp; Looks Like I'm abandoning ship here till Next build so I can refresh My setup

    <title>Password Protection in Word not working from Hyperlinks - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Password Protection in Word not working from Hyperlinks</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several Word documents which are password protected to modify however if these documents are access via a hyperlink in an Excel&nbsp;spreadsheet then the password protection does not work and the user can open the files without being prompted to enter
 the password and can then modify the documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 2013 however some of my colleagues are using Office 2010 and have the same problem. Hyperlinks from email or Word are fine. Only hyperlinks from Excel are an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem also only exists if you already have the Word application open. If Word is closed then the user is prompted for the password from the Excel hyperlink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help.</p>

            <p>No, those references are controlled internally to Excel.&nbsp; And as you delete a lower numbered shape, the ones with higher index numbers shift to fill the empty space.&nbsp; That's why the code I showed earlier:</p>
<p>Sub DeleteAllShapes()<br />
&nbsp; Dim AnyShape As Shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do While ActiveSheet.Shapes.Count &gt; 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Shapes(1).Delete<br />
&nbsp; Loop<br />
&nbsp;End Sub </p>
<p>
</p><p>will work for any number of shapes on a sheet - as you delete .Shapes(1), then (3) moves to (2) and (2) moves to 1, etc, until in the end the very last one, originally with the highest index number, becomes .Shapes(1) and is deleted and .Shapes.Count becomes
 zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This type of thing almost becomes one of those "you have to know the answer before you can ask the question type of things".&nbsp; When you create a shape, you can assign it a name that you could use to reference it later - but then you have to 'remember' the
 names, either by having them as part of the code somewhere, or keeping a separate list on a hidden worksheet (I've never done it that way, but can envision doing so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you know something unique about the line(s) in question, you can loop through all shapes and test that unique feature - perhaps the .Left and .Top values or start and end points, or height/width - or it's .Name and once you find it, then you deal with
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will show you another problem with it all:&nbsp; Open a new workbook, and put a shape on a sheet, put a couple more.&nbsp; Notice that Excel may (or may not) assign them numbers in sequential order beginning with 1.&nbsp; But if you then delete them all and go through
 the same process without closing Excel, the next "first" shape you add to the sheet is NOT #1 again - in its name, although it is .Shapes(1)</p>

<p>I know I can use the import to add new term sets within the service application, but I would like to add terms to an existing term set. Is that possible? I have dozens of new terms to add within an existing folder/term set. &nbsp;When I use the import it creates
 a brand new term set with the terms from my csv and I don't want that.</p>

<p>hi martinh,</p>
<p>we can import term sets to an existing one. see the screenshots below:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ee655128-ca76-4930-b6fe-a849540d4dbf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dee655128-ca76-4930-b6fe-a849540d4dbf" /></a></p>
<p>about the detailed steps to import a term set, you can refer to the article below:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-term-sets-168fbc86-7fce-4288-9a1f-b83fc3921c18?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us&amp;fromar=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">import term sets</a></p>
<p>if the method above is not what you are looking for or you encountered an issue, could you provide some screenshots to specify it?</p>

<p>Thanks Ran. &nbsp;Maybe I am not creating the import template correctly. &nbsp;Using your example in the screenshots, can you create csv to import Country terms and take a screenshot of that? &nbsp;That would be very helpful.</p>

    <title>Zune 30 Leap Year bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vardogr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune 30 Leap Year bug</h2>
                    On Jan. 1, 2009 my Zune 30 was unresponsive. After reading the Zune forums (and over 900 posts about this exact issue) it was concluded that due to a leap year error in the program (2008, leap year, had one extra day) the Zune 30 would be asleep and would
 work again by 12:00 GMT on Jan 2 2009. Apparently the Zune 30 only recognizes 365 days and is inactive on the 366 day of the year. This became known as the Great Zune 30 crash of 2009.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yes, my Zune 30 started working on Jan 2 as stated by the techs on the board, but since 2012 is another leap year, will my Zune 30 do this same thing on Jan 1, 2013? And if so, will I again have to wait until 12:00 GMT on Jan 2 for it to work again?</div>

                    I purchased a subscription to Office 365 so that I could share a few documents within a small group for simultaneous editing. &nbsp; I set up the document in the SkyDrive folder from laptop #1 and can see it from Laptop #2, but neither laptop can edit. &nbsp;The
 permissions for the folder are set so that identified users can edit. &nbsp; I tried turning on shared use from within Excel, but when this is turned on the 2nd laptop cannot view the document due to a 'file locked' error.

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
1. Are you trying to upgrade from previous Build 9926 or different operating system?<br />
2. Do you get any error message?<br />
3. Did you check if your computer is meeting all the system requirements?<br />
<br />
<br />
First, I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices except mouse and keyboard, press the power button and re-start the computer and check if you are able to boot to the desktop.<br />
<br />
If you are able to boot to the desktop, then I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link to upgrade to Windows 10.<br />

    <title>Alternate to Adobe Flash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g_r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alternate to Adobe Flash</h2>
                    <p>Adobe Flash player is supposed to be imbedded in W10.&nbsp; And it does work in many web sites, but not all.&nbsp; Too frequently the spot on a web page that has requirement for Flash will advise that Flash needs to be updated or installed.&nbsp; Clicking on the link brings
 up another page that reminds us that Flash is included in W10, and even provides a link to click to verify that it is installed and functioning; and each time it is verified.&nbsp; But the page with the Flash component is still not seeing the presence of Flash
 installed.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of an alternative to Adobe that will play the flash content and is compatible with W10?</p>

<p>In my original post I described going through the process of checking that is in the link that you sent, as well as the built in utility that confirms flash enabled and working.&nbsp; Not sure if you didn't read completely, or...., well not really sure why you
 sent me that link to check if it is enabled.</p>
<p>Also, if you check the link you sent for 'latest version adobe flash' (which I am familiar with) there are two choices to make. 1st, to identify your operating system, 2nd, whether you are using chrome or firefox.&nbsp; So obviously that link does not apply to
 W10 and IE.</p>

    <title>Office 365 &#47; OneDrive issues sharing .docm&#58; file locked for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 &#47; OneDrive issues sharing .docm&#58; file locked for editing</h2>
                    <p>I've had no problem sharing and editing a .doc between two people on Word 2016 and OneDrive, but as soon as we try to share a .docm, the troubles start. We constantly get messages telling us the other user has locked the file for editing. The three possible
 reasons Microsoft gives for this don't seem to apply here and I'm not seeing many other people having this problem with macro-enabled docs. When we go back to working with a .doc, everything works fine. As soon as we try the same thing with any .docm, the
 locking happens. Why could this be?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this the first time that you encountered this concern? If so, did you notice any changes to the computer prior to this concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I've started using OneDrive recently, and it has worked fine for .docs. No uploading problems. Without changing anything on the computer, the first time I tried using a .docm, I got this problem. There have been no recent changes to the computer, OneDrive,
 or Office, that I know of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Out of the 3 possible reasons Microsoft gives (https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/313472/the-document-is-locked-for-editing-by-another-user-error-message-when), none seem to apply, except maybe the third one. But keeping the document open should not
 be an issue, it never has been an issue when making changes to a .doc. Both users can have the .doc open and keep uploading with no issues, but if both users have the .docm open, only the first one to open it can upload anything. In more detail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restarted both computers to make sure neither is holding on to some process or not fully shutting down the document. The first time I open the file on either computer, I enable macros and make it a trusted document. I've created a dummy test.docm but
 that one fails to upload changes properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that when I close my Word, the other computer suddenly is able to upload and I can see it in the preview on Office 365. So now they have the .docm open and can keep uploading changes while mine is closed. If I now open mine, I get the message that
 the other user is now blocking me. It's only until the other user exits Word that I can start uploading changes again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, when working with a .docm, one user needs to close their Word for the other user to be able to upload. But this issue doesn't happen when working with a .doc file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried removing the actual macro from the doc on both computers, while keeping it in the .docm format but it still gives me issues. So it doesn't seem to matter if there are any actual macros in the document; if it's a .docm, I run into issues.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Office 365 plan are you using? Is it Office 365 Home or Office 365 for Business?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>My license is an Office 365 A1 Plus for students, I'm using the Office 365 provided by my university, it says Office Online for Education and SharePoint Plan 1 for EDU...so I'm guessing Office 365 Home?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you send a screenshot of the error message that you are getting?&nbsp;</li></ul>

            Thanks for the reply but changing the File Block settings doesn't seem to have done anything. Any other ideas? The UserVoice system seems to be more like a feedback thing and right now I don't have much feedback other than ".docms are not being shared
 properly". Should I bring this to their attention anyway?

<p>I am thinking to repair your Office program and see if there will be any changes. To do that, follow the instructions found in this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>. I also advise following the instructions under
<strong>Running Repair didn't help. Now what?</strong> found in the same article in case repair didn't work. Now, if repairing and reinstalling your Office didn't fix the issue, then it is time to post your concern to our
<strong><a href="https://word.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word UserVoice</a></strong>. In this way, our engineers and developers will be able to check the issue you are experiencing and may tweak some settings that can allow or permit .docm
 to be shared.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I was sent an unsolicited MS Office Excel trial, which has just ended.</p>
<p>I don't want to buy it, but need to save the data I've tabulated. </p>

            You can't edit in an expired trial, so all of the information you saved up to this point in Excel is still stored in your XLSX spreadsheet file. Probably in your DOCUMENTS folder.<br />

<h2>            Latest Insider build bug</h2>
                    <p>Updated today via Insider program to new windows Insider version and notice that my PCI-E sound card do not work any more.</p>
<p>Drivers are installed,Device Manager detected her and it is working normally but in sound options there is no sound card.Only what is detected is front panel with microphone.</p>
<p>So,why to upgrade to new version when it is useless to me?</p>
<p>Build 18277re.prerelease 181102-1446 work perfectly for gaming and all other stuff.</p>
<p>Build after that my sound is gone and it is useless for me to upgrade.</p>
<p>Stop expire build until this bug is fixed</p>

            <span>Yes this is the reason for the Preview program is to find issue with newer beta builds, if it worked every time without any issue would be no need for the Preview/Insider program, too many people are trying to use
 these beta builds as an everyday system.</span>

<p>yes but 920 Build is the same.and I have reported that bug in Build before and nothing is changed.</p>
<p>And now build will expire and what then?</p>
<p>Knowing Microsoft it is dead end.</p>
<p>They are focused on on board crap sound cards not on internal cards and for me any build that do not use my sound card is useless</p>
<p>And what after build expire?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They should state that build will expire when I have join Insider Program and i would not join it.</p>
<p>Now I am in limbo</p>

            As I said in reply to your other post, the problem may not be with Microsoft. It's quite possible that your sound card's developers haven't updated their code yet.

<p>If Device Manager detect card and drivers and show no errors and in sound options is detected only front panel that is not driver code issue but windows code issue.</p>
<p>Win developers do not look at internal cards because there was code 39 error that Windows Defender was making because it did not let some drivers to get installed if you had virtualization on.</p>
<p>You had to turn off virtualization or in Windows Defender to turn off Core Isolation&nbsp;</p>
<p>So,this is Windows issue not driver issue.</p>

<p>I did 2 times but nothing.in last build same problem.</p>
<p>Send pics and everything but nothing.</p>
<p>More Important is how win 10 will look.like it is a children book not an OS</p>
<p>I bet many players use internal sound cards because they shift sound workload from processor to card and boost performance.</p>
<p>On board card is a sound hell.</p>
<p>Tell those lazy devs to fix that.</p>
<p>They read what they want not want is important.</p>
<p>If new win 10 pro official release will have same problem I think to sue Microsoft for selling broken products&nbsp;</p>

<p>App is there in Store but i cannot install that app.</p>
<p>it is showing Gestures &amp; Touch is not currently available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to turn off vibration when I tap on Navigation keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also unable to install somany apps.</p>
<p>While installing apps it is giving some error and stops installation.</p>
