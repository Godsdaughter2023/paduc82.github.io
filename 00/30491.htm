<h2>            password protect a tile&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to password protect a tile? That would be better for tiles like Mail, Messaging and many other apps?</p>

<h2>            Why does my vertical scroll bar freeze sometimes when I&#39;m filling in forms.</h2>
                    When I open a web site, almost any, and it has blanks to fill in, when I go to scroll down, the scroll bar turns blue and hangs up. Sometimes I can scroll down with the arrow keys and some times with the mouse, but most of the time when it freezes, I have
 to close the page and start over.&nbsp;

<h2>            windows server 2003 updates failure</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I have a windows 2003 sp2 server with only TFS 2010 installed. I recently installed TFS 2010 SP1 (KB2182621). install was success. But after that, I found the server had&nbsp;3 auto updates keep trying to install and keep failed. The ongoing
 install and failure cost server resource and drag performance. I need help to stop and get rid of these updates.
</div>

<p>- Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x80070643: Update for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 (KB2813041).</p>
<div><span>- Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x80070643: Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP x86 (KB2836941).</span></div>
<div>- <font>Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x80070643: Security Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP x86 (KB2844285).</font></div>
<font>I&nbsp;searched and ran "Fix it" from Windows update result link. But apparently, it did not help.
</font>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>I also tried uninstalled the .net framework 2.0 sp2 update which already shown in control panel, but got fatal error and unable to uninstall.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I am kind of out of all ideas and urgently need help.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for&nbsp;any help!</p>

<p>Okay, So I first send the gamertag I want a friend request and it doesn't show up which means theres no gamertag. &nbsp;Then I check the xbox.com website and check if its there and its not. &nbsp;So I go to change my current gamertag to the one I want, and its say
 its currently being used but its not showing up as anybody's. &nbsp;So does that mean it is banned?</p>

<p><span>It's probably in use with different spacing. You're "aYo DaZe"; if somebody "checks the website" or send a friend request to, say "aYoDaZe" (no space), it will look like it doesn't exist but nobody can change their
 name to it because you have the version with a space.</span></p>

The only real way to know if you can have a gamertag is to try to change yours to the new one.</span></p>

    <title>Lower CPU power throttling states not working correctly for Intel Atom - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mkxy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lower CPU power throttling states not working correctly for Intel Atom BayTrail tablets</h2>
                    <p>First thing, I am really annoyed by this, because I have reported the bug several times over the past 0.8 years, yes, years, through the insider tools. First I noticed this bug when I installed insider build 9xxx on my Dell Venue 8 Pro like 7 months ago.
 It was easily reproducible:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Let Windows idle</p>
<p>2.) Open TaskManager (or for example CPUz) and monitor CPU throttling</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bug is simple: Under Windows 10, the throttling seem to be broken for at least an Intel Atom BayTrail (3700 series). The CPU always stays around 1.3-1.7GHz @ 1-3% CPU load. The same idle behavior under Windows 8.1 results in the processor correctly using
 it lowest energy states between 0.5-0.8GHz. This results in a way noticeable faster battery drain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd bug, mostly related: The battery drain in connected standby is about 3 times higher (~1.1mW/h), compared to Windows 8.1 (~0.33mW/h).&nbsp;The normal drain, by Microsoft itself, is 0.3mW/h for a device supporting connected standby mode.<br />
</p>
<p>Now that Windows 10, maybe... may be, that Microsoft devs will look into this, because it has huge&nbsp;impact on using a mobile device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested it on my Ultrabook and my Desktop too by now, and there it seems to work normally, and the CPU goes correctly to its lowest throttling state in a low idle environment.</p>

            This is a serious issue that practically renders the device useless for a day to day device on all baytrail devices and microsoft fails to fix this bug. This and also breaking the scale of all my hand written onenote notes! I can't read my notes because

</p><blockquote>
<p>1.) Let Windows idle</p>
<p>2.) Open TaskManager (or for example CPUz) and monitor CPU throttling</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bug is simple: Under Windows 10, the throttling seem to be broken for at least an Intel Atom BayTrail (3700 series). The CPU always stays around 1.3-1.7GHz @ 1-3% CPU load. The same idle behavior under Windows 8.1 results in the processor correctly using
 it lowest energy states between 0.5-0.8GHz. This results in a way noticeable faster battery drain.</p>

            Hi Abhik, that is a reference to a malware infection that since been removed by Windows Defender or your chosen Anti-virus. All that remains is the file reference
<br />
<br />Download the Free version of MalwareBytes and run a full scan with that. When the scan completes, restart your PC, you can then uninstall MalwareBytes if you wish!

<br />
<br />Scan using Malwarebytes:
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />Perform a Windows Defender Offline Scan:

<h3> johnhateswin8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 logging out automatically - How do I change that&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I went ahead and updated to Windows 10 and now have some questions. <br />
<br />
First, How do I stop it from automatically logging me out when it's left alone? My&nbsp; 5 year old daughter watches videos, etc, then leaves for a bit, and when she goes back, my wife or I have to log her back onto the computer. It is annoying.<br />
<br />
Second, I had to give an email address with Windows 8 to set it up and didn't know that the whole family had to have my password to log onto the darn computer. Window 10 continues the same way, requiring my email to log on. Can I take an email log on off of
 the computer altogether so that it can just be used without having to be tied to an email, you know like all of the other computers that I have used since 1995? Or at the very least, can I change it to another email so I can create one that is easy enough
 for even my 5 year old to log onto?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</p>

            I need a solution to this problem that isn't 2 years old. Following these instructions no longer fixes this issue. My brand new computer with Windows 10 keeps logging me out whenever I go to the bathroom &nbsp;or get up for a snack. Its irritating and possibly
 the WORST thing Windows has ever &nbsp;thought to do.&nbsp;

<p>Hey Guys! I have been playing the base FNV story for a while and haven't bought any dlcs yet. So, I was wondering which ones I should buy. I think I'm going to skip dead money. Also, at the moment I'm only looking to get 2 of them. So, should it be HH and
 OWB, HH and LR, or OWB and LR? </p>

<p>I'd get them all, but that's just me. One of the NPC's in DM is supposed to show up in OWB, but I haven't seen her yet. I didn't think DM would suit me, but I wound up liking it enough to play again on my offline profile.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<p>Thanks for your reply, it didn't work, half way through reboot it undid all changes and said something had gone wrong. Did the one which keeps your files. If I do the full reiinstall will it delete everything including device software like Radeon? All came
 preloaded with machine so I don't have any separate installation disks or files. Thanks again</p>

            You should check the Hard Disk and RAM beforehand.
<br />
<br />1.- First, close all the programs and files that you have open.
<br />2.- Click with the right mouse button in the Windows Start menu and select Control Panel. Then choose the category System and security. On the next screen, look down Administrative Tools on the right and click on that option.
<br />3.- One of those tools is the Windows Memory Diagnostic. Double click on it to open it.
<br />4.- The diagnosis gives two options to choose from. See what each one does and click on the one you prefer:
<br />
<br />     Restart now and check if there are problems. It is best to select in most cases. Make sure to close all programs as I have asked before. The PC will reboot on its own when choosing this option. Right after, the check also starts automatically.
<br />Then check the Hard Disk.
<br />1. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Press the Windows + X button at the same time, then choose Command Prompt (Admin))
<br />2. Type the following command, and replace the X with the drive letter you wish to scan: “CHKDSK X:
<br />3. Hit the enter key, Command Prompt will now start CHKDSK.

<h2>            keystrokes beep when using bluetooth headphones</h2>
                    Last night when I finished a transcription job, the computer was working fine. This afternoon the keyboard wouldn't work, and I narrowed it down to somehow the tablet mode got turned on. Now when I type using my Bluetooth headphones to hear the audio for
 the transcription work, I hear a beep for every keystroke.&nbsp;It does it on both sets of wireless headphones I have, and I cannot get it turned off. I have the setting for keyboard sounds turned off, I muted the mic as suggested in a post on&nbsp;another forum when
 I did a Bing search, but I cannot get the annoying beep to go away. Someone please help! I have both a&nbsp;transcriptionist class and work I need my headphones for.

<h2>            Is it possible to fire your gun while holding the flag&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>If yes, how? If not, I think I might have caught somebody hacking! There was somebody in a CTF game that was walking around with the flag that looked like it was impaled in him instead of being on his back. I have the video to prove it! He was firing his
 Magnum and this DMR while carrying the flag!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not a hack, is it a glitch?</p>

<p>Sppedflag and Speedpile are technically action sack game modes. They were designed more for fun rather than competitive play.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>It's also called SPEEDpile and SPEEDflag for a reason. For example, when carrying a flag, using sprint and evade get HUGE boosts. I played a Speedpile game on Hemorrhage some time ago and I had 3 flags on my back. I pressed Evade and jumped literally halfway
 across the map from tapping the button once. They're different game types, so they have different rules.</p>

<h2>            Display settings not maintained</h2>
                    I have an external monitor in addition to the Surface screen.&nbsp; In settings, I set the displays to duplicate, then click on retain settings.&nbsp; When I logout or the machine goes to sleep, often (but not every time), when I log back on, the two screens are
 not duplicated.&nbsp; I have to go through the process in settings again.&nbsp; Why is it not retaining the duplication setting?

            <p>Thank you so much for your response.&nbsp; I have followed those steps many times.&nbsp; Problem is, my machine does not retain the command to Duplicate The Displays.&nbsp; It is completely random as to when I next turn on the computer, or it comes off of being asleep,
 that the setting fails, and reverts to Extend The Displays, but it continues to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now, I just changed the Advanced Power Settings to not require a password upon startup, and it too does not work.&nbsp; I powered off and back on, and had to use my password.&nbsp; I then went to settings, and the correct button is clicked, but I had to use my
 password....</p>

<p>What is a PIN and why is it required?</p>
</b>
<p>A PIN is a unique 27 alpha-numeric code used to verify Windows Anytime Upgrade was purchased at a participating retailer. Customers will go to
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/need-help-to-get-product-key/www.windows7.com/getkey"><u>www.windows7.com/getkey</u></a>
 to exchange their PIN for an Upgrade Key. A PIN can only be used once to obtain a Product Key.</p>
<p>Where do I find my PIN?</p>
<p>The PIN is printed inside the package that you purchased. To find your PIN, open the packaging and pull the tear away tab to expose the 27 character alpha-numeric code.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Sample PIN format: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XX</p>
<b>
<p>Is a PIN the same thing as a Product Key?</p>
</b>
<p>No. A PIN is used to verify Windows Anytime Upgrade was purchased at a participating retailer and is used to obtain a Product Key. The Product Key is used to add features to Windows 7. You cannot use a PIN to upgrade.</p>
<b>
<p>My PIN is not working, what should I do?</p>
</b>
<p>If your PIN is not working, try the following:</p>
<p>1. Verify the PIN was entered correctly. PIN is not case sensitive and is alpha-numeric.</p>
<p>2. Make sure the PIN has not already been used to obtain a Product Key. A PIN can only be used once to obtain a Product Key. If the PIN has already been used, you can log into your account with your Windows Live ID (if you established it when the PIN was
 first entered) to access your Product Key or you can check your email for the confirmation email you received when the PIN was first consumed to access your Product Key.</p>
<p>3. Contact support if you are still having issues: </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/need-help-to-get-product-key/www.windows7.com/getkeysupport"><u>www.windows7.com/getkeysupport</u></a>.</p>
<p>What is a Product Key?</p>
<p>A Product Key is a unique 25 character alpha-numeric code that is used to unlock additional features and upgrade Windows 7. It is used to verify that your software is legitimate.</p>
<b>
<p>Why do I need a Product Key?</p>
</b>
<p>Product Keys are used to unlock functionality and add additional features to Windows 7. It is important to keep your Product Key in a safe place.</p>
<b>
<p>Do I need a Product Key to upgrade?</p>
</b>
<p>Yes. You will need your Product Key to upgrade.</p>
<b>
<p>Why should I use my existing Windows Live Account or create a new one?</p>
</b>
<p>Using your existing Windows Live account or creating a new account will allow you to access your Product Key at any time online in the future. It is important to use an account and password that is familiar to you to allow you to obtain easy access to your
 information and to receive email confirmation that will include your Product Key.</p>
<b>
<p>Will you send me an email confirmation with my Product Key?</p>
</b>
<p>Yes. An e-mail containing your Product Key will be sent to the e-mail address associated with your Windows Live ID or to the e-mail you provided if you skipped account setup. Note: If you are using an e-mail spam blocker tool or junk mail filter, make sure
 you can receive e-mail messages from microsoft.com.</p>
<b>
<p>What happens if I lose my Product Key?</p>
</b>
<p>If you lose your Product Key you can return to </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/need-help-to-get-product-key/www.windows7.com/getkey"><u>www.windows7.com/getkey</u></a>
 and sign in using the 'Sign In' link in the top right corner of the page. This will retrieve your Product Key if you established your account with your Windows Live ID. If you did not setup a Windows Live ID account initially there is no record of your Product
 Key online. Check your e-mail since this is the only record of your Product Key.</p>

<h2>            Network connection times out our shuts off during periods of inactivity losing internet connection</h2>
                    running vista 64 home prem on a dell studio xps 435mt, i seem to periodicly lose my internet connection.&nbsp; this occurred numerous times during a 200-song itunes download where a message would appear indicating the download failed due to my network connection
 timing out.&nbsp; i also notice that i initially have no network connection when i use my computer after a period of inactivity.&nbsp; the network icon in my tray quickly goes from having a red x through it to a re-established connection after&nbsp;i "wake" my computer w/
 the mouse.&nbsp; this is especially frustrating during long/large downloads because they sometimes get dropped completely.&nbsp; my power plan is set to "performance" and my monitor is the only thing that shuts down after inactivity.&nbsp; everything else is set to run always.<br />
<br />
my computer is wired to a satellite modem (wild blue) through a linksys wrt54g wireless router.&nbsp; the firmware for my router as well as the driver(s) for my network adapter ARE up-to-date.<br />
<br />
i've read about network adapters having power management options where one can uncheck a box to turn off the computer's ability to reduce power to/thru the network adapter.&nbsp; when i go to the power management tab on my network adapter's config, i so no such
 check box.......<br />
<br />
anyone know what could be going on?

<h2>            Sound will randomly cut out until I &#39;Test&#39; the speakers</h2>
                    Hi All!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I have an odd sound problem, one that I consulted with many techy people about, and they are all stumped. So, I'm hoping the wonder of the internet and all those who reside can help me out a little. I'd offer cookies as reward, but ya know...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyway!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is this -&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The sound on my laptop will normally (not always, but normally) work from start-up. It will then randomly, like a ninja, cut out. The first I know about it is when I go to play something and there's no sound. As a temporary fix normally I have to close
 whatever it is I'm trying to play sound through, open up playback device options, 'test' the speaker (which nearly always works) and voilà, sound is miraculously back, like a zombie from the grave.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How long this temporary fix works for depends on the quality of the zombie, some times it'll last 2 minutes, other times it'll last hours.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I notice this most frequently when using Youtube, or Upworthy, etc. I'm running Chrome but I have tried IE and have found the same problems. It might just be that I notice it most here because I don't tend to use my laptop for video/audio files that are
 stored locally, preferring instead to run them through a TV (which again, always works). I have however noticed, occasionally, the problem with VLC before.</div>
<div>If the problem is through Chrome, then I'll have to close all my tabs completely, then test, then reload. Sometimes it works first time, other times it does't.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've noticed its been getting worse lately, at the moment I'm struggling to play more than one Youtube clip at a time with sound. Literally, I can be on the same tab, play one video fine, click on a related video, and not have sound. &nbsp;Like a ninja.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Its so sporadic that I've yet to pin it down to a particular cause/time/whatever. The only thing thats even remotely consistant to my eyes is that it is almost guaranteed to cut out when I launch Skype, however my temporary 'test' fix brings it back to
 life.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Currently its taken to telling me 'The device is being used by another application. Please close any devices that are playing audio to this device and then try again.' I've obliged, closing everything that was ever open ever, and still it will tell me
 the same thing. I've even tried un-installing odd little programs like Apple helper or Bonjour (also by Apple). Whilst its doing this, I cannot fix the problem, other than with a reboot (and even this sometimes doesn't work) and I am doomed to live in deathly
 silence.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Its also rather irritating if you're wanting to use Skype at that particular moment.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So! Down to the techy stuff.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Dell <span style="color: rgba(35, 35, 35, 1)">Inspiron 17R 5720&nbsp;</span>laptop</div>
<div>I'm running Windows 7 Professional, 64bit including Service Pack 1. The laptop did come with Windows 8, I asked someone to change it for me, and I know they updated the drivers accordingly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only items listed under 'Sound, Video and Game controllers' in Device manager are -&nbsp;</div>
<div>High Definition Audio Device, working fine and up-to-date drivers, and&nbsp;</div>
<div>IDT High Definition Audio CODEC, also working fine with up-to-date drivers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have double-checked all my sound drivers on the manufacturers website and made sure they're up to date that way too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

</div>
<div>This isn't me, but I feel it accurately portrays my frustration at how weird this problem is.</div>

            Unfortunately, I have no solace to offer and therefore deserve none of your cookies, but I wanted to let you know that you're not suffering deathly silence alone. I'm in the same boat, also getting the message&nbsp;'The device is being used by another application.
 Please close any devices that are playing audio to this device and then try again.' That pops up whenever I try to test the speakers or sound quality. I'll just add my situation and what I've done to try to fix it, just in case someone with a solution doesn't
 find your wall of text to be sufficient and would absolutely enjoy another lengthy description.
<div><br />
<div>I've never gotten the sound to pop back on by doing those speaker tests, as you have. It really needs a reboot to get things back in working order. I'm glad to hear that you use Chrome and notice it with YouTube videos as well, because I've found that
 it almost exclusively happens after watching a video. I'm also glad to hear that you've found the same problem with IE, so I don't have to torture myself with that browser to rule out Chrome. The funniest part is that if I wait long enough, simply because
 I'm putting off rebooting until I NEED sound, the sound occasionally comes back on its own. That's exactly what happened while writing this post.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do have a tid-bit of extra information to add, though, so it's not all "me too!" Although no sound plays at all on my computer, and the little green bar that should hop up and down in the volume mixer as sounds play doesn't even show up, my microphone
 does work. As in, it records, but if I set it to be audible in my headphones, I can also hear myself. I'm guessing that means that the sound from my microphone runs straight through my sound card, back out to the speakers or headphones and doesn't get touched
 by Windows, but that also gives me the feeling that Windows itself is somehow part of the problem. And again, even though I can hear my handsome, seductive voice flowing straight back into my ears for my own enjoyment, Windows' little green volume indicators
 adamantly insist that no sound is playing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, to rule out some other stuff, I have a completely different computer to your notebook. I run Windows 8.1 on a self-built dohicky, so none of the components are similar to what you have, ruling those out as well. The sound card is a Creative Sound-Blaster
 X-Fi Titanium, with the proper drivers and all. Disabling and then enabling things like the speakers in the Device Manager makes no difference. This also only started happening some two or three months ago.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On a side-note, your message was hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable. This is the format in which all problem reports should be written and I'm happy to know that I'm not the only one that does it! I sincerely doubt we'll get a reply on this, considering
 my babbling problem descriptions never get anything but the laziest replies, but if you ever post another problem, let me know so I can read some more about the zombies and ninjas that plague your computer.</div>

            Luckily I am mostly unhindered by ninjas, just this one with a cruel sense of humour, or ones that are particularly well versed in ways to drive a person slowly insane, or maybe its both....
<div><br />
<div>Anywaaaay! I do have a couple of minions who are attempting to work on the problem. Turns out that whilst I know I updated my driver (I remember doing it damn-it! &gt;.&lt; Maybe those ninjas are developing the ability to subvert the conscious mind and plant
 memories....) It wasn't up-to-date...</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, having up-dated it, it seemed to work beautifully. But alas, it was not meant to be. It was but a false sense of security, for the next day the problem was back, and with a vengeance. This time when my sound cut out, it also cut off my mic and nothing
 but a reboot would solve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Most of the time however my mic will not cut, just my sound.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have discovered through arduous perils and death-defying feats that the problem is worse when I'm running on the low end of battery power....&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I swear that the ninja (who I am calling Nick from here on in) is trying to drive me slowly insane. Every time I think I've found a correlation, he changes tact.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At the moment I am content to allow my minions to attempt their fixing, I will post again if they arrive at a solution that seems to work for more than 24 hours.</div>

            So after conversing with a minion last night, and again, installing numerous drivers (it appears to be rolling back to old versions on its own). I restart and it works beautifully.
<div><br />
<div>Today, Nick the ninja is back again, and boy is he mad.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I now have no sound devices installed. No speakers, no mic, nada, zip.</div>

            I had this same problem for ages, sound cutting out of speakers randomly , almost gave myself a brain hemorrhage trying to work it out as wasn't sound problem when using headphones. i tried everything to sort it. was told it was probably motherboard fault
 or sound card problem, but don't despair i found cheap and quick fix for it. You can buy a USB adaptor (3D sound card) £1.59 on Ebay. Instant cure HOORAY! Hope this helps you.<br />

</p><p>I left off the KB # yesterday when I posted my question.&nbsp; Can't install KB3081704.&nbsp; This is the free DVD player. I keep getting error 0x8007064.&nbsp; The repairs that I saw on the internet involve doing things with internet explorer.&nbsp; Windows 10 does not support
 internet explorer so you can't make any changes.</p>

    <title>When shutting down I get error regarding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lesleygiggins  say:</h3>
<h2>            When shutting down I get error regarding WinAMRestoreWind&#58;iTunesHelper.exe</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7; Internet Explorer 9; Norton Internet Security 2011</p>
<p>I sometimes use a WD My Passport SE</p>
<p>I have iTunes on my Windows 7 PC simply because I was given an ipod but&nbsp;I choose to have Windows Media as my prime music centre. iTunes has been on my PC only for a few months without problem until recently. Not everytime I shutdown, but frequently I receive
 the message -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WinAMRestoreWind:iTunesHelper.exe Application Error</p>
<p>instruction at 0x10003691 reference memory at 0x00000000.</p>
<p>The memory could not be read</p>
<p>Click OK to terminate program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time this happened I clicked OK.</p>
<p>The next startup resulted in Windows not being able to start (Blue screen, white writing etc). Following on screen instructions the PC went through a restore/repair process. Nothing wrong was found and Windows started. Shutdown that time was clean. As was
 the shutdown the next day.</p>
<p>The day following I received the same message. Instead of clicking Ok I clicked on Force Shutdown ( Behind the WinAMRestore message was another telling me that 2 programs were stopping Windows from shutting down. This had been happening before the WinAMRestore
 message started, but had been flashing up too quickly to be read. - &nbsp;So, I guess I have two shutdown problems.) The next startup was OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am toying with the idea of removing the iTunes program. Drastic, but I don't use the the facility of ipod that often, although I would rather not.</p>
<p>Can anyone advise me how to get rid of the WinAMRestore Application Error if I don't remove the program?</p>
<p>Would removing iTunes mean I could not charge my ipod via USB?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Has anyone an idea what the other two programs could be? And how can I get rid of that message, too?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span><br />
You may uninstall and </span><span>reinstall iTunes.<br />
Refer the link: </span></p>
<p><span>"Removing and reinstalling iTunes, QuickTime, and other software components for Windows Vista or Windows 7"</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1923</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 2: </b>You may run check disk and check.</span></p>
<p>
<span>a Click Start, type cmd in the Start Search box, right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password
 or confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
b. At the command prompt, type Chkdsk /f, and then press ENTER. <br />
c. Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk next time that the system restarts.
<br />
d. Close all applications, and then restart the computer. Note During the restart process, Windows checks the disk for errors and then starts.<br />
e. After the computer has restarted, try to perform backup and restore.</span><b><span><br />
Warning:</span></b><span> Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted.
 For safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<br />
</span><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span><br />
</span><span>Reinstalling the video and audio drivers may help as well.</span></p>
<p><span>Try uninstalling and reinstalling sound card and audio drivers from device manager.<br />

    <title>SP 3, Docking Station, HDMI Output, Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timstone  say:</h3>
<h2>            SP 3, Docking Station, HDMI Output, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Before responding to this question, please read it COMPLETELY ... </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have a Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10 release build</li><li>All updates have been applied</li><li>I have an external monitor and the Surface to HDMI cable</li><li>If I plug the cable into the Surface Pro 3 directly, it will display correctly on the monitor ( which shows the monitor, cable, and SP3 are all setup correctly.</li><li>If I plug the cable into the docking station, the monitor shows "No HDMI Input".</li><li>If I plug it back into the SP3 directly, it works.</li></ul>
<p>Clearly the problem here is this:&nbsp; Under Windows 10, the Surface Pro 3 is not properly outputting the video signal through the docking station to the HDMI cable, and on to the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE do not tell me to do the things I have already explained above, or give me some generic script that says to do these things.&nbsp; I have already read all of the referenced bulletins before ever asking this question.&nbsp; I would appreciate a knowledgeable
 answer if you have one ( aimed at support staff ), and if not, please pass it up the line to someone who can give me a proper answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you if you have read this far.</p>

            <p>Ahh ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is a Surface Pro 3, and I only have one, so there is no way to "try a different computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the docking station:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supplies power to the SP3</li><li>Supplies the connected ( line in ) internet to the SP3</li><li>The USB ports work properly on the docking station and can be viewed on the SP3</li></ul>
<p>So, by a process of elimination, the only thing that does not work is the video port on the SP3 since the cable works when plugged into the SP3, but not when plugged into the docking station.&nbsp; Everything else is as it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I might point out one other small contradiction to your response.&nbsp; If you look at this forum, although my specific problem is not referenced, there are several reports of problems using external monitors with the docking station ... so to say it
 has no problems may be quite inaccurate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps someone else can provide suggestions for what I can check.&nbsp; And yes, it did work fine with Windows 8.1.&nbsp;

            <p>This seems to be a Windows 10 problem that's not specific to the SP3.&nbsp; I have the almost identical problem with a Dell 2-in-1 in a Dell dock with Dell external monitors.&nbsp; In researching the problem, I found your post regarding the SP3 and others with HP
 systems.</p>

            I am sorry to say that I have just encountered the identical problem since I upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday. Have you had any success finding a solution? I have read that perhaps it could be solved by switching out the HDMI to Mini Port adapter the the
 "active" type rather than the standard one that has worked very well with the Windows 8.1 configuration. Does anyone know if that could help? &nbsp;Thank you.

            <p>Sorry I didn't post something earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using a cable that I had purchased which went directly from the port to the HDMI input of the monitor.&nbsp; That cable was the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then purchased the normal port to HDMI adapter offered by Microsoft, and connected it to a standard HDMI to HDMI cable.&nbsp; Everything worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the previously available cable had a wiring error that allowed it to work in Win 8, but when further capabilities were applied, it was not sufficient for Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that time I have had absolutely no problems.</p>
