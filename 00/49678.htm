<h2>            Need help with installing Microsoft directx</h2>
                    <p>So whenever I try to install microsoft directx, (i download the dxwebsetup.exe from the website) and I try to run that .exe, I get an error, Error creating process &lt;C:\Users\Kishan Patel\AppData\Local\Temp\IXP000.TMP\dxwsetup.exe&gt;/ Reason: indows\system32\adcpack.dll<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95fd9e3c-3d9d-4da7-92fe-32a8950325f6" /></p>
<p>I then tried to go to where it said the error was being had, and I found a .exe called dxwsetup. I ran this, and got this error.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec885a7e-2fc1-4a28-8679-f69a89e33000" /></p>
<p>I was unable to find either of those two error logs</p>

            This is a moon-shot, but I would try this first.&nbsp; Dave the downloaded dxwebsetup.exe file to your Desktop instead of running it from your temp folder.&nbsp; Once it's on the desktop, right-click and "run as administrator" to launch the setup.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can try running a full system virus scan. A virus could be preventing the installation. Are you using a paid subscription or freeware?</p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>You could run the system file checker, since advpack.dll is supposedly causing the problem.</p>
<p>To do this, open an elevated command prompt by typing <strong>cmd </strong>into the start menu search box. Then right click on the cmd icon that comes up, and click
<strong>run as administrator</strong>. When the window launches, </p>
<p>type&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow </strong>and press <strong>enter.&nbsp;</strong>The System File Checker will then scan you system files for problems.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Dead Rising 3 Problem Joining Friend - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dead Rising 3 Problem Joining Friend</h2>
                    
<p>So my wife and I played DR3 together fine the first night. The next day we tried doing the same awful party system but it would not let either one of us into the others game. The best we could get was a message saying that one of us were added to the game.
 I spent an hour and a half trying different things and nothing worked. I wanted to reboot the system but couldnt figure out how to do it and I didnt want to unlplug it to do it.</p>
<p>I ended up clearing both of our Mac Addresses which forced the system to reboot (which took ages). After that we were able to join each other as we did the first night. This&nbsp;was really annoying!!! Also why the heck can we just not click on a friends name
 and join the game?</p>
<p>I have been a loyal Xbox fan since the very first system. I purchased two Xbox's, three 360's (one as a gift),&nbsp;and&nbsp;four&nbsp;XB1's (two as gifts) and kind of&nbsp;regret it. I kept getting so angry with the party invite system and snap feature and as soon as I started
 doing a little searching I see im not the only one.</p>
<p>Sorry about the rant.....what caused our issue joining each other? Was it a home network issue? I would think not we have been playing with two systems on the same network for years. Is it something we are doing wrong with the new party system? I just dont
 get it! I mean like I said above it said we joined each others game but we never actually went into it until I cleared the Mac Address.</p>
<p>So did the reboot fix the issue or the Mac thing? I have no clue has anyone else expierenced this?</p>

<p>I have the same issue. Last night I was playing fine with a friend, then it kicked me from his game and ever since we cannot connect to each other. I thought maybe it was one of our connections, but I just chatted with a MS Tech Support Rep and they said
 its a known issue they are working on. </p>

<p>I think I found out how to shut the system down hold your finger over the power light for 10 seconds. Will you guys try that and see if it lets you join your friends? If that does not work try clearing the Mac address under Network Settings. That will also
 force a reboot, be patient it takes a few minutes.</p>
<p>Then report back and let us know if either of those methods fixed the problem. I can not test it for a few days due to work, no time to play.</p>

<p>Well here we go again. Last night we played COD Ghosts for the first time, we tried Squad mode to get used to the fresh controls and weapons. Everything worked fine, sent game invite, which forced a party, then sent another invite, which put us in the same
 lobby. Played for a few hours then went to bed.</p>
<p>We tried to play this morning before family came over and had the same issues as we did with DR3. We were trying to play the extinction mode this time but we could not get in one another's lobby. It just kept saying added to game. After an hour of system
 reboots and router resets we finally decided to try with random people. We both launched our own game and were in lobby's with random people. When my game started my wife was on the screen in front of me and the randoms were gone.</p>
<p>We played until we lost then stayed in the lobby. Two more people joined us and we played with them until we lost. We backed out to take a little break and it put us in separate lobbies. At that time we tried hitting join game on each other but it was greed
 out with a lock symbol. Mind you we are still in a party of COD Ghosts......I ended up just not even playing the rest of the day or tonight. I probably will not even try again tomorrow. I'm pretty beside myself over this garbage.</p>

            <p>Hello Cha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the model number of your Sony Vaio laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either due to corrupt drivers and settings or if Windows startup files are damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Perform startup repair</strong> and check the issue. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>",
 do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the Windows recovery environment, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Startup repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may create Windows 8.1 installation media using this article:<br />
<strong>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If startup repair is successful, then I would suggest you to update display driver in step 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Update display driver from the computer manufacturer's website</strong> and check the issue.<br />
You may refer this article:<br />
<strong>Download and install drivers</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

</p><p>-When touching/hovering over the bar on the top of a program, the pen goes right to the X of the window. This only happens when the program is on full screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-When doing continuous, repetitive strokes, the pen most of the time does not register them, and a circle appears below the cursor (might be double clicking? )&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Manuelawz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your concern with us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The inking issue may be related to the touch interface on your Surface. Can you tell us what&nbsp;troubleshooting steps&nbsp;you have already performed? If you haven't tried running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit, I suggest that you go to&nbsp;this
<a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;to download and run the tool. It will help you check for software issues that may be affecting your Surface
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may also need to restart your device or perform a two-button reset altogether so the drivers will be reloaded. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shutdown your Surface.</li><li>Press and hold the power button for at least&nbsp;20 seconds.&nbsp;The Surface&nbsp;may boot to UEFI. This is normal. Have the customer exit UEFI.</li><li>Restart your Surface normally.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try using Sketchpad to check if the inking will work. You can also reset the Pen's tip and/or its batteries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if the issue will be resolved, just a friendly reminder, we would highly recommend&nbsp; that you check updates from time to time by performing SDT, it's good that your device is updated all the time to avoid any issues in the future.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance by replying this thread. We'll get back to you as soon as we can. Thank you!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Lexmark Printer x4550 not communicating to PC Windows 7.</h2>
                    Installed Lexmark (wireless)&nbsp;printer x4550 driver onto new computer with Windows 7. Printer is not communicating with the PC. Have a lap top using Vista, which does communicate OK with the printer. Ran the printer troubleshooting software and it indicates
 a problem that it is unable to fix. Is there a compatability problem between Windows 7 and the Lexmark?

<p>Hi Dun na ngnall,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>a. Do you get any error message when you ran the Troubleshooter?<br />
b. Which edition of Operating system do you have? Is it a 32-bit or a 64-bit Operating system?<br />
<br />
As, I checked the compatibility of the printer with the Windows 7 Operating system it shows that it is compatible with both the 32-bit as well as 64-bit Operating system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=Lexmark Printer x4550&amp;type=Hardware&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=Lexmark%20Printer%20x4550&amp;type=Hardware&amp;os=32-bit</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=Lexmark Printer x4550&amp;type=Hardware&amp;os=64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=Lexmark%20Printer%20x4550&amp;type=Hardware&amp;os=64-bit</a></p>
<p>I suggest you to download and install the latest updated drivers for the printer&nbsp;which is compatible with the Windows 7 Operating system from the manufacturer’s website from the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lexmark.com/index?page=home&amp;locale=en&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;segment=DOWNLOAD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lexmark.com/index?page=home&amp;locale=en&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;segment=DOWNLOAD</a></p>
<p>If you have the drivers for the Vista Operating system, you may even install them in Windows 7 Operating system using the compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to do the same:</p>
<p>1. Locate the <strong>executable file</strong> for the driver installation program.<br />
2. Right-click the <strong>file</strong>, and then click <strong>Properties.</strong><br />
3. In the PackageName <strong>Properties</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.<br />
4. Click to select the <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode</strong> for check box, click Windows Vista in the
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode</strong> for list, and then click <strong>
OK.</strong> <br />
5. Double-click the executable file to start the installation program.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Update causing computer to crash on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: I need to cancel a windows 10 update because it crashes my PC every time it tries to install</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just upgraded from Windows 7 Home to Windows 10. &nbsp;I have an update appearing in the Windows Update that causes my PC to crash each time I try to install it. &nbsp;I need to get rid of it from the 'updates waiting to install' list but I can't seem to. &nbsp;Can
 someone provide some advise on how I can delete a specific Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further details of the issue and what I have tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Update is "Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000"When I open the Windows Update window it is sitting in the Right hand frame under "Updates are available". &nbsp;There are also 2 NVIDIA driver updates sitting in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on "Install now" in the Windows Update and then click on the "Details" link I can see that the Intel update is "Installing". &nbsp;After about 15 seconds the screen goes black and then the computer restarts. &nbsp;After the restart when I look in the
 Windows Update the Intel Corporation driver update is still in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running the Microsoft "Show or hide updates" app. &nbsp;I can select the Intel driver update from the Hide Updates list. when i click Next it comes back advising that the Intel Driver Update is "Fixed" but when I open Windows Update the Update is
 still in the list. &nbsp;I have rerun the app and checked in the Hidden list and the update is in the list so the actions that I performed worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried looking in the View Installed Updates list and the Intel Corp HD Graphics driver is not in the list. &nbsp;I have uninstalled the Intel Graphics software but that has not helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Windows Update Troubleshooter but it does not find any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to download and install the Intel Drivers from the Intel website. &nbsp;When I try to install I get the same behaviour as when I install via Updates (15 secs then restart)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I see it, there is only one thing I need/want to do and that is cancel the damn update but Windows 10 fails to give me the ability to do that. &nbsp;Has anyone got any suggestions on how I can cancel one update that doesn't seem to want to cancel?</p>

this page</a> to cancel that update, then clear the update cache so it won't get installed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use the official "Hide an Update from installing" tool</a><br />
<br />
then...<br />
<br />
</li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset Windows Update to clear the update cache</a></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It worked for the person who originally posted under "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/hidden-updates-return-and-install-anyway-how-do/e337f698-9e98-4e71-a63b-d0fdbc352813">Hidden
 updates return and install anyway - how do you hide longer?</a>" and I think it will work for you as well.</p>

            Hi Shawn,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I have now tried the following (multiple times) with no luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
I performed the steps detailed in the "Reset Windows Update" link.&nbsp; After performing the actions detailed in that link the "Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000" is no longer appearing in my updates.&nbsp; I then used the Hide an Update
 from installing and selected to hide "Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000".&nbsp; It appears twice in the Updates list and I select both instances of it.&nbsp; On the final screen it confirms that the update has been added to the Hide list,
 and viewing the Hide list shows that it is appearing.<br />
<br />
<br />
But when I then go and run Windows update, the update that is retrieved is "Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000" and the computer starts crashing again.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have also tried the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
Downloading the Intel Driver Update Utility and running it.&nbsp; When I run it, the utility identifies that the drivers for "Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000" need updating but it BSOD while updating.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have downloaded the driver files from intel and tried installing it.&nbsp; It also BSOD while updating<br />
<br />
<br />
In the Device Manager the Intel HD Graphics appears under "Other Devices&gt;Video Controller". I have tried uninstalling it but as soon as I restart the computer it reappears and BSOD again.&nbsp; I have disabled it but this does not stop the Windows Update from downloading
 the file.&nbsp; I have tried updating the driver on the device in the Device Manager - BSOD.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no idea how I am supposed to fix this.&nbsp; Any help will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
Simon

<p>It sounds like your order is backwards.&nbsp; You'd want to hide the update with the tool, then flush the windows update cache entirely.&nbsp; At least that's what some others have reported back to me as successful.</p>

    <title>best headset for xbox 360e since optical is gone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            best headset for xbox 360e since optical is gone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>my current turtle beach headset uses optical so i apparently can't use it with the 360e... there are too many new models and i don't know how they all connect...there's a port on the back of the 360e that says A/V and looks like an old analog mini head phone
 jack...not sure if that is capable of pumping out dolby digital, my guess is just stereo. i'm not clear on why optical was gotten rid of....</p>

<p>Really ridiculous to not have an optical S/PDIF but Turtle Beach made a HDMI pass through that will give you optical out. $40 bucks for something that really should have been built into the console.

<h3> guyinthesky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 &#40;Toshiba&#41; laptop not recognizing USB mouse&#33;</h2>
                    So I recently purchased a brand new Toshiba Satellite C75D-B7200 laptop. I connected my wired "onn" USB mouse and
<strong>it worked perfectly fine</strong>! About two days went by (today) and i plugged in my mouse, and the
<strong>computer automatically began installing the drivers for the mouse and keyboard</strong> (there was no external keyboard so i dont know why it did that)... the mouse light was glowing and everything, but the mouse wasn't working. I then
<strong>went into the control panel to make sure the device (the mouse) was enabled and it was</strong>. just note that the mouse shows up as "<strong>HID-compliant mouse</strong>" in the control panel (I dont know if that's important)... &nbsp;I double clicked
 the icon and went to properties, and it said "<strong>This device is working properly</strong>." So then I went into the device manager, and
<strong>uninstalled the mouse driver</strong> thinking it would just re-install next time I plug the mouse in... I restarted the computer, and
<strong>plugged the mouse back in, and nothing happened</strong>! the mouse lit up, and then I got the
<strong>message at the bottom of the screen saying that the device is not recognized</strong>. I looked in the control panel again I saw, "HID-compliant mouse" so it did obviously recognize it (i could be wrong)... now when I plug the mouse in, the
<strong>computer still says that the device is working properly, and is up to date.</strong> But it still isn't working! The
<strong>mouse also disconnects and reconnects every minute or two</strong>. I'm not sure why. By the way, I did try using all of the other USB ports, and I tried using a different mouse and got the same results!. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi <strong>Conrad</strong>,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>​Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry to know that you are facing an issue with keyboard and you want to know how to reset keyboard settings to default.</p>
<p><b><span><br />
<br />
Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.<br />
</span></b>1. Do you get any error messages?<br />
2. Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Let’s first try the steps in this article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Change keyboard settings</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-keyboard-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-keyboard-settings</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue is not resolved, I would suggest you to try the steps in the article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mouse, touchpad, and keyboard problems in Windows</span></strong><b><br />

</span>
<p><br />
</p>
<div><b><span>Method 3:<br />
</span></b><span>If the issue persists, try to connect an external keyboard to check if the issue occurs.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>
<div><b><span>Method 4:
</span></b><span><br />
If the issue persists, try to place the computer in clean boot and check if it helps:<br />
<br />
<br />
By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />
</span></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
<div><b><span><br />
Note: </span></b><span>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in
<strong>Step 3</strong> in the above KB article.<br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
Additionally you may use on screen keyboard and check if the issue occurs. Follow the steps in the link:
<br />
<b><br />
<br />
“Type without using the keyboard (On-Screen Keyboard)”</b><br />

Give this a go; I’m confident you will find what you need here. But if you have any trouble with this, come on back to this post and I’d be happy to work with you on other options.</span></div>

            <p>My God, I really hate all these tech forums; you clearly wanted to seem knowledgeable, but you failed to answer his basic question: HOW TO RESET YOUR KEYBOARD TO DEFAULT SETTINGS? Regardless of the WHY what is the HOW?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know my language seems rather frustrating, but after spending countless hours trying to just do something which should be rather basic, I have been spinning my wheels with these forums because regardless to how I search the web, all leads back to Rome
 aka microsoft.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in short, I am needing to RESET my keyboard [i.e. short-cut key commands, etc.] just like Conrad inquired years prior as if my system was a fresh Windows 7 out-of-the-box PC powered up for the first time today. With all the bizarre 'Sticky Keys' and other
 things built in to the OS that can get activated accidentally, I want my keyboard back to how it was when I installed Windows 7 WITHOUT having to reinstall my OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there a SIMPLE way to reset or to restore some sort of GLOBAL setting so that every shortcut key combination, etc, functions as it did from day one? And before you or anyone asks a bunch of roundabout questions of 'did I check this, that or the third',
 this is a new keyboard now (very generic one like the previous with no drivers to install), completely different USB port on the completely opposite side of the PC and yet still, certain original functionality has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, please don't ask what I am trying to accomplish or why I need to, because that has already been stated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, what happened to the early days of Ask and Answer. I think Wikipedia was the death of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael</p>

<p>Hi there JeT LiFE,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues with your account.<br />
<br />
The first thing I would suggest doing is double checking the e-mail address and password you are using when you download your profile. Did you migrate your account when you changed the GT?<br />
<br />
If you've double checked all that and are still showing this old GT, I would recommend getting in touch with our
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Phone Support</a>. They should be able to help you look into your account and see where the error may be.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have further questions, <strong>please keep us posted in a new thread</strong> so that we don't commandeer this.</p>

<p>Listen people, I really hate people not enjoying what they love so I found the solution. Try to find the email address exactly as you put it since it will not even take you to the password part unless you gave the right email. Then, look for the right password
 because the error is not even an error, you just have the wrong pass. Hopes this helps for anyone stuck on this subject and have a wonderful time playing games!</p>

<p>I am 100% positive this is the solution because I ran multiple test's and everything checked out. The issue was the Logitech equalizer that I had turned on&nbsp;inside driver&nbsp;application,&nbsp;for some odd reason triggered this error message &amp; audio problem for me.
 Many other's have had the same issue &amp; hope they read this so they can solve this issue.</p>

<h2>            Unable to open some photo&#39;s when transferred from my mobile to the computer with Windows 10</h2>
                    Since transferring all of the pictures off my mobile phone to the computer I have around 500 pictures that will not open. Each time I try I get the message "Photo Gallery can't open this photo or video. The file may be unsupported, damaged or corrupted".
 This has also occurred for around a dozen movie clips also taken from the mobile. All other pictures and movies are opening correctly. All pictures are JPEG format and have been saved as .JPG and I can see no difference between the ones that will open and
 the ones that will not. Can somebody please tell me how to rectify this?

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>I have ran both of these with no difference. The system file checker reported back that there were no corrupted files. I also ran the system update readiness toll, checked windows updates and then restarted the computer.</p>
<p>The photographs that I am unable to open are all from a 2 month period as when I organise the folder by date they are all together. I cannot understand how these could be corrupted when all others are okay?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way that I will be able to access them please now that these checks have not worked. This must be a common issue as I see numerous other people have encountered the same when researching online.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>How to recover a Video file that may not have been created&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nabilshaik  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to recover a Video file that may not have been created&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been doing a video recording during which I thought the camera got stuck and directly removed the batteries. Since it wasnt the usual case of battery power being emptied, the camera didnt save the file (as it would with the battery getting emptied).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the issue is that, the recording has occupied the space on the memory card - but a file wasnt created for it (I checked my memory card and it shows that 1GB space has been occupied, but no file shows up for that space).</p>
<p>I would like to know how to get this file to be viewable. Scandisk doesnt help because it would simply try to mess up this file along with other stuff and make a chk file which would make no sense to any application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expected file is of the AVI format and the application I want to use is VLC player. Can someone help me with it??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>You may put the memory card onto the camera and see if you’re able to view the file. You may also check if
 you’re able to view the file by connecting the memory card to a different computer</span></p>

            Sorry, that doesnt work. The issue isnt that the file is hiding.<br />
In some camera's such as this one, after you record, you have to stop the recording - at which point, it gives the display of "processing". At this point, it starts to give the file a name, etc and creates the file.<br />
My general thinking is that, when the recording starts, a stream is being written to the memory card and the file is still as if it were a temporary file. Once, its done, the file is properly given a name and stuff - but I am not sure.<br />
<br />
All I sure off is that, the recording did take place and that the memory card does show that it has used up space for doing the recording - but doesnt show up the file!<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi Volunteer J.</p>
<p>The issue is that the file is not deleted, due to which recovery softwares are failing. One software did show this file in CHK format (the scandisk way to recover damaged files). But when I try to open it in vlc, it fails (if a video file is corrupted, then
 scandisk fixes it, and gives a chk file - but then again, that file's extension could be changed or it made open in vlc, and it works). But here, it doesnt seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Its like a chunck of memory is written in the stream format, without the file structure of the mmc knowing about it :(</p>

            <p>I was thinking on the same.</p>
<p>But the problem is that, there is no delete option. It has format and it was a bit too risky for me to opt it :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the defragement option, and then I was able to see the chunk of memory being allocated. Problem is that, I need to refer it :(</p>

            Could you&nbsp;import the file into a conversion program? <br />
Maybe you could convert it to .WMV and the result&nbsp;<br />
would be playable.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
the following links are just examples.<br />

<h3> tim gollie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Save New Calendar Items in Windows 8.1 to Sync Back Up to Server</h2>
                    <p>I cannot save new or update existing Calendar items in the Calendar&nbsp;App on&nbsp;my Surface Pro since&nbsp;installing Windows 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It looks like the Windows 8.1 upgraded&nbsp;Calendar App doesn't work properly with Exchange 2003. (Similar to how the 8.0 Mail app would not function properly in downloading attachments from Exchange 2003 when the Surface Pro first came out in early 2013. This
 was subsequently fixed by Microsoft in an update to Mail.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I enter a new 8.1&nbsp;Calendar item (or modify an existing item) on my Surface Pro, I get this error message: "There was a problem saving your changes to "EVENT NAME" on "DATE" and "TIME". The&nbsp;options are then "Open event" or "Close", neither of which help.
 The new (or modified) event will then be saved on the Surface's Calendar, but will not sync through to the Outlook Calendar on other devices.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Windows 8.0 version of the Calendar App worked just fine. Why not this one? The 8.1 Mail App seems to work just fine. Ditto with the 8.1 Contacts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft, please fix asap! I would not have downloaded 8.1 if I knew I was going to lose this critical Calendar App functionality in 8.1.....</p>

            <p>Thanks Basith for your suggestions, but I really have no interest in using a Google calendar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I simply want a Microsoft product (Outlook and Exchange 2003) to work with another Microsoft product (Calendar App in Windows 8.1) just the way it did in Windows 8.0 before this 8.1 upgrade, which was a step backward for me. Backward integration is pretty
 basic stuff that should not force someone to make a switch to a Microsoft competitor (Google) or not consider upgradig to the new Microsoft Surface 2 Pro product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you would forward this problem on up your chain of command so that a fix can be implemented for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Just wanted to let the people here know that I am currently facing the same problems with my Windows RT 8.1 Surface tablet.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Our own Exchange 2003 server does not allow for items to be added from the tablet back to the desktop. The other way around works perfectly fine, also, when deleting a desktop made task using my tablet that also works fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>New appointments in the calendar made on the tablet do not appear on the desktop.</div>

            <p>I am also experiencing problems with the Mail and Calendar apps in Windows 8.1 Pro (64</p>
<p>x).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can add items/events to my Camendar but they do not sync with Outlook.com, or my phone (with the Outlook.com app loaded).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can even invite others to events, which are then emailed, and their replies accepted - but still no syncing to Outlook.com (https://bay04.calendar.live.com/calendar/calendar.aspx).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In both Mail and Calendar the message *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is unavailable is displayed in the top right hand corner when I sync, or press F5. Mail still downloads to both Windows 8.1 Mail and Outlook.com and to my phone, but no new calendar items.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>New items created via the web on Outlook.com sync immediately with my phone, but not with Mail on &nbsp;Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

            Good Afternoon Basith.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>After looking at all the replies and comments it seems clear to me that there are potentially many affected users, and that is a single problem that requires attention:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div># Calendar will not sync with any device or with Outlook.com or Exchange Server #</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mail works, Outlook.com works, People works with other devices and Exchange works with other devices - it's just the Calendar app that is causing grief.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is not related to Google or EAS as far as I can tell as I am only using a Microsoft Outlook.com service and have not linked Mail or Calendar to any other email addresses - I only connect to my Windows 8.1 64x laptop with my @live.co.uk account.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anything that can be done to rectify this problem (which was not present in Windows 8.0) would be very much appreciated; I'm sure there are many others affected who are not technically savvy and are not signed up to these kinds of support forums and therefore
 have no way to determine what the problem is or how to fix it. An fix via Windows Update would be the ideal delivery method for any patch.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks in advance, and I look forward to hearing from you and your team.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Dear Basith,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please can you provide an update on this question, as per your request above Tim (and others) have added information to your response, but as far as I know there has not been any further movement or communication.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's clear that this is not an isolated problem so any news - even if it's just to say that the question is still 'active' and being looked - at would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks,&nbsp;</div>

            I am experiencing the same problem and also mail app is not syncing either. Everything works fine in the browser and through Outlook 2010, except that there are always loads of sync errors when using the outlook connector for outlook.com.

            Possible Solution that worked well for me:<br />
<br />
After I installed 8.1 I did have the same issues as you people have stated.&nbsp; What I did after the 8.1 update is uninstall the APP and re-installed the APP through the Windows Store.<br />
<br />
Everything seemed to sync perfectly after that with no issues.<br />

            Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it did not work. However, I solved the problem by reducing the number of folders in my outlook.com email. For some reason, mail and calendar seem to be connected.

</p><p>Just <strong>uninstall updates KB2966826 and KB2966828</strong> and it will help you.</p>
<p>For the moment this the only way. It may change in the future.</p>
