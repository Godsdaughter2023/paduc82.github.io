    <title>Concerning Xbox One issues... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Concerning Xbox One issues...</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I've been having a number of issues with my Xbox One lately, such as most times whenever I try to play NHL a message keeps coming up saying "insert the disc", even though the disc is already in, as well as other issues where my system will pop in and
 out of the game, where it goes from the loading screen to home screen repeatedly. I've had my system for a few years now, and have only begun getting these issues within the last year or so, and it is INCREDIBLY frustrating! My console has also started shutting
 of on its own as well as ejecting discs on its own! It's even had the Error Code 0x903f8001 pop up, as well as Eror Code 0x82d40004! I've tried everything, and nothing's worked, which is why I'm here. If anyone can help me with this, I would HIGHLY appreciate
 it, because I have NO idea what do anymore! Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I would recommend clearing your cache for the issue with it closing down randomly out of games.</p>
<p>https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</p>
<p>It could also be an overheating issue, just check that all your vents are clear on your console with nothing restricting airflow, also make sure that your power brick is also well ventilated, if theres theres an accumulation of dust id recommend using a
 can of CO2 to clear debris from the inside of your console.</p>

<p>Would doing that delete all of the downloaded games/save files that I have on my Xbox One? And would that actually fix the disc-reading problems? The disc-reading problems are the main concern here- the error codes are as well, since they are connected to
 the disc reading issue, but overall, the disc reading issue is the main concern!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Actually, all of your saves will be fine as long as you sign into the corresponding gamertag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might help if your console is experiencing some kind of software problem rather than a hardware issue. Usually strange behavior is caused by an update that was not applied appropriately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If neither reset helps with what you're experiencing, then it might be best to start considering getting your console repaired. If you are interested in getting your console repaired, then I would contact customer support so that an agent can help outline
 your service options .&nbsp;</p>

            The Virtual Machine's hardware is pretty limited, it emulates a bog standard audio card and a video card with no 3D acceleration.&nbsp; So you will find that most non-2D games won't work in it.

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Just as&nbsp;the movie ticket serves as a controlling agent between the demand and the seats in a theatre, similarly virtual memory are like tickets to processes that must occupy slots in the physical memory (RAM). If Physical Memory
 is running to full capacity, then the processes committed&nbsp;with a ticket in virtual memory will have to wait till some processes exits Physical Memory and makes room for the new processes to enter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>A process is essentially a set of tasks contained in a program, one or more of which executes through a sequence of instructions called threads. Processes run on the operating system and the operating system manages
 the hardware resources for all the running processes. The operating system provides a
<strong>Virtual Memory </strong>to all processes which must run on Physical Memory.&nbsp;</span></span>The address space of the virtual memory in bytes is (2^address bits), where the bits corresponds to the physical address lines in the system architecture (32 bit
 Or 64 bit). <span><span>The address space of the physical memory depends on the amount of RAM installed. The virtual memory manager of the operating system applies a method called
<strong>Paging</strong>&nbsp;to map the virtual address space to the physical address space, in such a way that all processes can get to run on the physical memory</span></span><span><span>. If Physical memory is sufficiently large to accommodate all processes,
 then the&nbsp;committed virtual address space is mapped to physical address space at once. If Physical memory is less than the combined memory demand of all processes, then the virtual memory manager will have to load each process sequentially on the physical memory,
 wait for the process to end, and then rewrite a new process on the physical memory and repeats this till all processes committed to virtual memory are executed.</span></span></p>

</p><p style="text-align: justify">The operating system (OS) acts as a platform and interfaces all processes by&nbsp;its Virtual Memory, and on the other hand the OS gets to run these processes on the Hardware by mapping the processes in its&nbsp;Virtual Memory to the&nbsp;Physical
 Memory. This mandates&nbsp;all processes to be designed specific to an OS, thereby disallowing processes to directly communicate with the Hardware which remains shielded and under the sole control of the OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">This renders the processes to become&nbsp;<strong>Platform Independent</strong>, meaning that processes designed for a particular OS will always work&nbsp;irrespective of the hardware platform on which the OS is installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The Virtual Memory manager of the operating system use special Paging techniques namely
<strong>Disc Paging</strong> and <strong>Demand Paging</strong> to&nbsp;overcome the space limitation of Physical memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><strong><span>Disc Paging</span></strong><span> extends the computer’s physical memory (RAM) by reserving space on the hard disc called
<strong>Page File </strong>which the processor views as non-volatile RAM<strong>.</strong> When there is not enough memory available in RAM to allocate to a new process, the virtual memory manager moves data from RAM to the Page file. Moving data to the Page
 file frees up RAM making room for the new process to complete its work. However, accessing data from the Page file degrades the system performance considerably. Disc Paging is of use only on systems with limited physical memory which would otherwise not allow
 a large process or multiple processes to run concurrently. Increasing virtual memory will not improve performance on such a system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>When a process references a virtual memory page that is on the disc, because it has been paged-out, the referenced page must be paged-in and this might cause one or more pages to be paged-out using a page replacement
 algorithm. If the CPU is continuously busy swapping pages, so much that it cannot respond to user requests, the computer session is likely to crash and such a state is called Thrashing. If thrashing occurs repeatedly, then the only solution is to increase
 the RAM.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The concept of disc paging evolved when systems had 256 MB or less memory. In modern systems with sufficient amount of memory (
</span><span>≥</span><span> 4GB), the use of Page file is limited to caching pre-fetched data. However with advent of mobile devices, Disc Paging&nbsp;is an attractive option to extend RAM with ultra-fast Solid State Drives.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><strong><span>Demand Paging</span></strong><span> is key to using the physical memory when a number of processes must run with a combined memory demand exceeding the available physical memory. This is achieved by segmenting
 the process into smaller tasks. Only the threads corresponding to a specific task are loaded to memory which are required for immediate processing, instead of allowing the entire process to get into the memory. Services that run in the background are typically
 threads of a larger process. The exception is the Graphics and Hardware Drivers for which memory is reserved and is not available to the Memory manager.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>T</span></span><span><span>he amount of physical memory used by a process is called a
<strong>Working Set</strong>. </span></span>The Working Set of a process is comprised by its
<strong>Private working set</strong> and its <strong>Sharable working set </strong>
both of which are owned by the same process. The Private working set is the amount of physical memory in use pertaining to tasks that are dedicated to the process. The Sharable working set is the amount of physical memory in use by the process pertaining to
 tasks that can be shared with other processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p>Working Set of a process = Private Working Set + Sharable Working Set.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>For example, when you open a Word document, the winword.exe remains in the Sharable working set and the contents of the document is put in Private working set. Thus several word documents opened simultaneously can share
 the same winword.exe while their data is private and distinct. Shared system resources such as DLLs, System drivers (Kernel/OS.sys files) exists solely as a Shared process with no private working set. Tasks and Services comprise the executable processes (.exe)&nbsp;which
 are primarily private working sets having a sharable resource.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The <strong>Commit</strong> and <strong>Working Set</strong> of all running&nbsp;processes can be viewed on the Memory tab of the
<strong>Resource Monitor.</strong> The Commit is the amount of Virtual Memory reserved by the operating system for a particular process. This amount is only an estimation of the Page File size needed by a process, and is not allocated till it becomes necessary
 for the system&nbsp;to page out the Private working set of a process in physical memory to the Page File. It is for this reason, the Commit size is always larger than the Private working set of a process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The sum of all process Commits therefore indicates the Virtual Memory demand by the system which needs to be met from the Page File. However, the Page File size can be configured much less than the Virtual Memory demand, as the
 system will essentially become non-functional if the private working sets of all running processes are to be paged out.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><em><strong>Virtual Memory</strong> also refers to the Operating System's abstraction of memory into a process directory, where each folder is a collection of

 Physical Memory. This enables the OS software to sequentially index through the pages of a process and execute the codes by referring to the physical memory location of the page in the Page Table.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>When a machine boots up, the operating system&nbsp;creates two dynamically sized pools in physical memory to allocate the kernel-mode components. These two pools are known as the Paged Pool and Non-paged Pool.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The <strong>Paged Pool </strong>value (247 MB,<strong>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><strong><span>Hardware Reserved</span></strong><span> (296 MB) is the memory space reserved by hardware drivers which must be always remain on the RAM. This memory is essentially locked and is not available to the memory
 manager. A major part of this is the dedicated Graphics Memory reserved through BIOS.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><strong><span>In Use</span></strong><span> (1648 MB) memory is the sum total of Working Sets of all running processes owned by the operating system, kernel (non-paged pool), drivers and the various applications.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><strong><span>Modified</span></strong><span> (52 MB) memory contains modified pages that have been removed from process working sets, because it was idle for long. Modified memory contents must be written to disk before it
 can be repurposed. As such it is currently not in use but can still be quickly pulled into service if needed. If memory demand runs high or the modified list have grown beyond a certain threshold, the memory manager arranges to write pages from the modified
 memory to the page file on hard disc, and moves those pages from the Modified to the Free memory.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><strong><span>Standby</span></strong><span> (1111 MB): When a process exits normally, the memory manager moves the unmodified pages in the working set to the Standby memory, which effectively makes the Standby memory a true
 cache of recently used files. By keeping these pages on the Standby list, the memory manager reduces the need to re-fetch the&nbsp;information from web/disk/network location&nbsp;which is more involved and time consuming, should the pages be required again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>When a process requests for a page, the memory manager first looks for the page in the Standby memory and if available, returns it as a working set. This is called repurposing a page. If the page is not present in Standby,
 the memory manager loads it from the Hard Disk into the Free Memory which then becomes part of the process working set.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>All pages on the Standby list are available for memory allocation requests. The memory pages in Standby list are prioritized in a range of 0-7, with 7 being the highest. When a process requests additional memory and
 there is not enough memory in the Free list, the memory manager takes a page with low priority from the Standby list, and releases it to the Free list for the new process to occupy.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The<strong> Free</strong> (989 MB) memory are the locations that have not yet been allocated to any process OR were previously allocated but returned to the memory manager for reuse when the process ended. All memory

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The memory manager maintains a thread that wakes up periodically to initialize pages on the Free page list so that it can move them to the Zero page list. The Zero page list contains pages that have been initialized

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>Every process needs a space in memory to store its data and codes. This is called the address space of a process. The original idea of virtual memory was to expand the physical memory with a reserved space in hard disc
 called Page file which the program would view as RAM and this was termed as Disc Paging. Subsequently the virtual memory concept was redefined so that processes run on the operating system and the operating system provides a
<strong>Virtual Memory </strong>to all processes while it manages the physical memory on behalf of itself and all its processes.
</span></span>This virtual memory is limited only by the theoretical address space possible on the computer architecture, thus maximising the address space interface to a process. Virtual Memory also
<span><span>helped to establish memory protection by disallowing processes to directly address the physical memory which is unaware of other processes using the memory.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">A process runs from the virtual memory provided by the operating system, while the CPU interfaces with the operating system to fetch and execute the instructions from the physical memory<span><span>. The operating system maintains
 a translation table called Page Table ordered by the virtual memory addresses assigned to&nbsp;each process, having cross-reference to&nbsp;the physical memory addresses.
</span></span>The CPU incorporates a hardware logic to sequentially generate the same virtual addresses and gives it to its own
<strong>Memory Management Unit (MMU),</strong> which refers to the Page Table and locates the physical address where the instruction is stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The Virtual Memory Manager (VMM) of the operating system manages the memory requests made by all processes. The VMM allocates consecutive address in the virtual memory in units called
<strong>Page</strong>, to each process which must run. Initially each Page is initialized with the storage locations of the process files on hard disc which are subsequently replaced by the physical memory addresses once the process files are loaded to memory.
 This allows an operating system to provide an address space to all processes in the virtual memory, irrespective of the size of physical memory available.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The mapping of a Virtual Page to Physical memory occurs in units called
<strong>Page frame</strong> which are of the same size of the Page and formed by consecutive bytes in physical memory. However, while Pages are continuous in Virtual memory, the corresponding Page frames are randomly distributed in Physical memory.
<span><span>A Page frame is an array of memory bytes and is essentially a higher unit of memory size, appropriate for allocating to processes.
<span><span>A Page frame is an array of memory bytes and is essentially a higher unit of memory size, appropriate for allocating to processes.
</span></span>The collection of all page frames of a process comprises its <strong>
Working Set.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Thus the operating system maintains a<strong> Page Table
</strong>for each process, containing the process pages in virtual memory mapped either to its page frame in physical memory Or initialized to the page location on hard disc. Page Tables of all running processes are created on the physical memory at system
 start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Each process can access the entire virtual address space (2^32 bytes Or 2^64 bytes) on its own without any restriction and so each process use the same set of virtual memory addresses for its pages.<span>&nbsp;</span>The virtual memory
 manager knows the process owning the page by the Page Table ID and will map them to separate page frames in physical memory.
<span><span>Conversely, multiple processes can individually own a shared process by defining pages in their respective Page Table, which map to the same page frames in physical memory.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span><span>A Page is a virtual entity and therefore its memory space has no physical existence. A Page exists only in the form of a page address on Page Table which is a physical entity.
</span></span></strong><strong>This Page Table is essentially the Virtual </strong>
<strong>Memory and a Page is analogous to a ticket in virtual memory. </strong><strong>The counterpart of Page is the Page Frame&nbsp;Array&nbsp;in Physical memory and is the physical identity of the Page.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>A Page Table is a collection of Page addresses in an array, where the indexes of the array represent the virtual page addresses, and the array values called
<strong>Page Table Entry (PTE) </strong>contains the corresponding Page Frame address in physical memory. PTEs also contain
<strong>Process Control Information</strong> and is typically <strong>4 bytes</strong> for 32 bit systems.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span><strong>Control bits</strong> provides information about the state and attributes of a process. These Control bits are
<strong>Valid bit </strong>(address refers to a page frame on physical memory), <strong>
Modified bit</strong> (process data modified), <strong>R/W Access protection bits and Process ID bits.</strong> These bits helps the memory manager to understand the status of a process and initiate action accordingly.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Page Size</strong> actually refers to its real world counterpart – Page Frame, whose size&nbsp;is typically between 1KB and 8KB and is generally 4 KB for 32 bit systems.</p>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>32 bit Address Space = 20 bit <strong>Virtual Page Number (VPN)</strong> + 12 bit
<strong>OFFSET</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The VPN and OFFSET can be thought of transforming the 32 bit address space from a single array into multiple arrays arranged in rows,
</span></span>where the 20 bit VPN is used as the address of each array and the 12 bit OFFSET is used as an index (position) to identify the elements in the array<span><span>. Thus 2^VPN are the number of arrays (Pages) and 2^OFFSET are the number of array
 elements (bytes) which is the array size (Page size).</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The Offset is implemented in the CPU hardware and is used in the system in various context. The Offset bits are used as an index to sequentially access the bytes in a Page frame. The Offset is therefore a counter which increments
 in bytes to index into the memory elements of a Page frame. The Page size is fixed by the Offset maxima which sets the upper limit of a Page frame in physical memory. In a Page Table, the Offset bits are used to store process control information as it has
 no significance in the virtual context.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">When a Page Frame array&nbsp;is created in Physical Memory, it is assigned with&nbsp;a 20 bit array address called
<strong>Physical Page Number (PPN).</strong> The Offset defines the Page Frame size which is 2^12 = 4096 bytes = 4KB. While VPNs are consecutive indexes of a page table, PPNs are also consecutive frame address in physical memory. However each VPN is assigned
 with a random PPN depending on the availability of 4096 consecutive bytes of free memory for loading the frame data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The address of a physical memory location is formed by concatenating the PPN with Offset.
</strong>In other words, a physical memory location is specified by the address of an array (page frame) together with&nbsp;the index number (offset) of an element in&nbsp;the array.</p>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>Unlike Virtual Address Space where each process can occupy the entire space on its own which is 2^32 = 4GB, the Physical Address Space can be a maximum of 4 GB which has to be ultimately shared by all processes. Sharing
 require processes to enter the physical memory in batches, get executed by the processor and then exit the memory to make space for a new process. This is further optimised by loading only a part of the process in page table to memory comprising of only the
 essential tasks which came to be known as <strong>Demand Paging </strong>and </span>
</span>is an improvement on pure virtual paging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The 4GB address space limitation in 32-bit systems is overcome&nbsp;by a mechanism called
<strong>Physical Address Extension or PAE.</strong> PAE systems are actually 36 bits, meaning that they have 36 physical address lines, capable of addressing 2^36 = 64 GB physical memory.&nbsp;However, processes must run in virtual memory in 32-bit mode to comply
 with instructions created specific to the platform architecture either in 32-bit or 64-bit. The operating system in turn has to read and write to the physical memory in 32-bit mode, which demarcates the lowest 4GB memory space within the installed RAM (greater
 than 4GB), as the active region to run processes. The higher region memory being outside the scope of 32-bit operation remains passive, but is usable in the 36-bit (long) mode. When a process ends, the operating system relocate the page frames from the active
 to the passive memory by switching to long mode and changing the PPNs in the process page table to map to the passive memory. Increasing RAM in effect&nbsp;enhances the capability of the system to cache more processes&nbsp;in passive memory thereby minimising the need
 for disc paging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Demand Paging is a memory management technique based on principles that are independent of the system architecture or installed RAM and applies to PAE as well as 64-bit systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>Demand Paging</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The operating system is responsible for managing all information related to a process in a Process Control Block (PCB) within the OS kernel. These are broadly classified as process identification data, process state
 data and process control data. The process identification data hold mappings between Process ID and
<strong>Page Table Base Address (PTBA)&nbsp;</strong>which is the starting address of a Page Table in the physical memory. Every CPU has a
<strong>Page Table Base Register (PTBR)</strong> which is accessible only to the operating system to store the current page table base address. During a process switch, the operating system simply makes a change of the page table base address in PTBR.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The CPU has a <strong>Program Counter </strong>which holds the virtual address in 2 parts. The high order bits contain the VPN which is a counter that increments by virtual page number and the low order bits contain the Offset
 which is a byte counter to index into the memory elements within a page. The VPNs are identical for all Page Tables because the virtual memory addresses generated by the Program Counter is the same for all processes. This Program Counter is driven by the logic
 set in the CPU hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The <strong>Memory Management Unit (MMU)</strong> of the CPU first refers to the Page Table Base address in PTBR to access the Page Table in physical memory, and then refers to the VPN part of the virtual address in Program Counter
 to index into the Page Table and identify the PPN corresponding to the VPN. The MMU generates the physical address by concatenating the PPN with the Offset part of the virtual address in the Program Counter and stores this physical address&nbsp;on the
<strong>Memory Address Register (MAR)</strong> of the CPU. The CPU reads the address in MAR to fetch the instruction from the physical memory and execute it. The Offset in the Program Counter increments to point to the next virtual memory location and the cycle
 repeats. When the Offset crosses its maximum value (all 1s), the VPN part in the Program Counter is incremented to point to the next VPN in the Page Table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>A process execute by the VPNs arranged sequentially in the form of virtual memory which is translated to PPN by the MMU for accessing the instruction from physical memory.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>In the language of the OS software, the processor executes a process by sequentially fetching instructions from the virtual memory, where the virtual memory address indexing the page table array serves as&nbsp;a MEMORY POINTER&nbsp;to
 the PTE containing the physical memory page address. </strong><strong>Thus all memory R/W operations are performed by pointer instructions referenced to virtual memory.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>When a process initiates, the operating system creates its page table by mapping virtual addresses to physical address of the process files in hard disc. The OS marks a Valid bit = 1 for Pages in the page table that
 correspond to tasks that are required to be loaded in memory. Pages that are not to be loaded into memory at the initial stage are marked as invalid with Valid bit = 0. Next, the Page Frames are created on physical memory, and are loaded with codes from the
 process files in hard disc. Finally the Page Frame address (PPN) replaces the physical address of the page in page table which was initialized with the file location in hard disc. This is the essence of Demand Paging.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40287acb-8eac-4d46-b9ec-1ea1aa4e0465" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Once all Page frames are created and the process is ready for execution, the OS updates the PTBR of the CPU with the Page Table Base address and resets the Program Counter. The MMU indexes into the Page Table and loads the MAR
 only if the PPN has a Valid bit = 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>If a fetched instruction is a pointer to another memory location containing the actual instruction, then the MAR is updated to the memory location of the pointer address. The image of PTBR, Program Counter and all CPU
 registers are saved in memory before the execution jumps to the memory location updated in MAR. On completion of the instruction(s), the return statement reloads the registers with the saved image so that the execution returns to the original virtual address
 and resume sequential operation. This is called <strong>Context switching.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The MMU generates a <strong>Page fault</strong> if the virtual page address has a missing frame number in the page table Or the frame number does not exist in physical memory Or the physical address is not part of the
 current working set but is in standby/modified list.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The Page fault invokes the <strong>Page handler</strong> of the operating system which tries to find a resolution depending on the type of page fault. The Page handler first ensures that the page request is genuine.
 If it is found to be not genuine, the process is terminated. If it is a genuine request, the operating system determines the missing code/data and loads it from the hard disc to a free location in memory thus creating a new page frame. The new Page frame address
 is updated on the faulting page in the Page Table and the page is marked as valid with a valid bit = 1. If the Page frame is in standby/modified memory, the MMU has to simply update the frame number on the faulting page which brings the page back from standby
 to the working set. The Page handler finally returns to the original process resuming execution at the faulting page.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">When a process needs to execute a new task, the operating system creates the new task in physical memory and updates one or more VPN of the task initially marked invalid on the Page table with a valid bit, and define its corresponding
 PPN in the PTE. If this new task is a shared process, then the PTBR is updated with the Page Table Base address of the shared process which triggers&nbsp;the execution of the task. Alternately the page frames of a shared process can also be mapped within the Page
 Table of another process.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The performance of a Page Table is improved by implementing
<strong>Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) </strong>which is a cache maintained on the registers of the processor's MMU, to store the recently used pages of the page table. When the MMU needs to read a Page from the Page Table in memory, it first tries to read
 it from the TLB by default, which is much faster than reading from the memory. If the Page does not exist in TLB, then the MMU first copies the Page from the page table into the TLB and then reads it from the TLB.
<strong>The TLB memory is associative </strong>meaning that memory elements are addressed by contents (values) rather than an address. Thus both the VPNs and PTEs of a Page Table reside as values in TLB.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The success of the TLB rests on the statistical principle of locality which states that a page accessed recently will be required to be accessed shortly again called
<strong>Temporal Locality</strong>; and page numbers&nbsp;nearby an accessed page has a high probability to be accessed within the next few memory references called
<strong>Spatial Locality.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>Temporal Locality is supported by caching of recently accessed pages in TLB&nbsp;whereas Spatial Locality is supported by
<strong>Prepaging</strong> which is to cache all valid Pages in a Page Table before they are actually requested. Thus on a Page fault, all pages that were earlier part of a working set are added to the TLB instead of only the faulting page. This checks the
 need to invoke&nbsp;the Page Handler repeatedly for every missing page in the TLB.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>When a page is found in the TLB, it is called a
<strong>TLB Hit</strong> and when a page is not found, it is called a <strong>TLB Miss.
</strong>A TLB hit<strong> </strong>eliminates the need to access a Page Table in memory, whereas a TLB miss incurs a Page Table access in memory. The principle of locality is the cornerstone of TLB success with a hit rate of more than 99%. In other words it
 means that a Page Table access in memory is required once in 100 times.</span></span></p>

</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>Segmentation</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>Segmentation is a comprehensive memory addressing method by itself and can be implemented independently to directly manage the Physical memory with 16 bit addressing called
<strong>Real Mode</strong> Or implemented as Virtual addressing in 32 bit system architecture called
<strong>Protected Mode</strong> and this can be further combined with Demand Paging.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The earliest memory addressing method was in 16 bit Real Mode, where programs would be loaded directly in the physical memory in segments at fixed locations. The processor would execute the codes sequentially by the address generated
 by the Program Counter<span><span>. The <strong>Segments</strong> started from the lowest address in
<strong>Code</strong> (Text) segment, followed by <strong>Data</strong> segment, then the
<strong>Heap</strong> segment and the finally the <strong>Stack</strong> segment at the top address, with a
<strong>Free</strong> memory segment located between Heap and Stack both of which can grow into the Free segment.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The Code segment contains the machine code from the program executable and is read only. The Data segment stores the external data that a program needs to process or compute upon. The Heap segment holds data that are
 globally available to the program such as addresses of shared processes and Dlls. Stack contains the intermediate results of a process calculation in temporary variables. They also contain parameters passed as arguments to a function and its return values.
</span></span>Further, the highest Stack address is reserved for the Program Counter to store its current address when the program has to jump to another memory location either to fetch data or to execute a subroutine. The return statement in the program loads
 the Program Counter with the main address stored in the Stack.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">With the advent of 32 bit systems, programs were organised in virtual memory to overcome the space limitation&nbsp;imposed by physical memory<span><span>. Thus many programs could exist on virtual memory but only a few at a time could
 take up physical memory.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>A program is a collection of segments of various size. The free segment was eliminated as Stack and Heap segments could be enlarged dynamically during system runtime.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The virtual address space of a process is defined in a
<strong>Segment Table</strong> held in associative memory within CPU by a <strong>
Segment Table Base Register (STBR). </strong>The Segment Table&nbsp;contains a fixed set of
<strong>Segment Numbers</strong> as virtual addresses with corresponding physical address specified by
<strong>Segment Base, Limit </strong>and <strong>Segment Protection Information.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The <strong>Segment Base </strong>is the start address of the segment in physical memory and is the CPU's reference to a segment. The
<strong>Limit</strong> defines the segment size which is variable and depends on the size of the segment defined by the program. The Segment Table therefore defines the virtual memory where each virtual segment number maps to a continuous block in physical
 memory specified by the Base Address and the Limit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Unlike the PTBR which holds the address of Virtual memory i.e. the Page Table, the STBR hold the Virtual memory itself i.e. the Segment Table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">A process is ready for execution when all segments of a process are created in memory and the operating system loads the
<strong>STBR </strong>with the segment table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The Program Counter resets and generates&nbsp;the first virtual address with the high order bits containing the Segment number and the low order bit containing the Offset to index into the memory bytes within the current segment limit.
 The Offset counter incorporates a logic to check that it does not exceed the Limit defined for a given&nbsp;segment. The MMU&nbsp;reads&nbsp;the segment number in the Program Counter&nbsp;and refers to the Segment table to obtain the Segment Base.&nbsp;The Base address is concatenated
 with the Offset in the Program Counter to generate the physical address which is stored in the MAR. The CPU fetches the instruction from the memory address in the MAR and executes the instruction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Since a segment number can define a larger unit of virtual memory than a page, only a few segment numbers is sufficient to constitute a process. The Segment Table size composed of 5-10&nbsp;virtual segment numbers is considerably less
 compared to a Page Table size composed of 2^20&nbsp;virtual page numbers.&nbsp;However a Segment number mapping to a large segment in continuous physical memory locations will cause
<strong>External Fragmentation&nbsp;</strong>resulting in <strong>Memory Leakage,</strong>&nbsp;<span><span>when too many free memory slots are lost between segments which fall short in continuity length to allocate to a segment. This happens because, when old processes
 are removed from memory and new processes are introduced, the new process if larger cannot take the segment space of the old process thereby creating gaps, and if smaller will create free space between segments.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">It&nbsp;should be noted that memory leakage is a more general phenomenon which can occur due to factors other than fragmentation, such as bugs in a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>External fragmentation require compacting of physical memory by repositioning segments or paging out entire segments to hard disc when free memory runs low thus degrading system performance. This is why modern operating
 systems does not implement memory segmentation which offers too much memory management leverage to programs which has no prior knowledge of the availability of free physical memory in a target system and thus puts up the burden on the operating systems to
 free up space.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>This shortcoming in pure segmentation was sought to be improved upon by combining
<strong>Segmentation with Demand Paging</strong> where </span></span>each segment is composed of consecutive pages defined in a Page Table with corresponding Page Frames scrambled in physical memory<span><span>.
</span></span>This achieves to eliminate the source of external fragmentation due to structuring a physical segment in continuous memory locations.
<span><span>Thus we have one segment table per process, one page table per segment. The
<span><span>Thus we have one segment table per process, one page table per segment. The
<strong>Segment Table</strong> contains the same entries i.e. the Segment number, Base and the Limit. But here the
<strong>Base</strong> refers to a Page Table Base Address&nbsp;<strong>(PTBA)</strong> in the physical memory
</span></span>and the <strong>Limit </strong>refers to the number of virtual pages in the page table of a segment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09052a20-da4d-4532-8116-af78f8feca69" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The Page table entry contains the page frame numbers and process control information. Read/Write protection can be provided in the Segment Table as well as in the Page Table depending whether the protection is required
 for the entire segment (eg. code segment) or at page level (for read only constant data).
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The segment table is located in the CPU's
</span></span><strong>Segment Table Base </strong><strong>Register (</strong><span><span><strong>STBR)
</strong>in associative memory whereas the Page Table resides in physical memory. Both table information are derived from the Process Control Block in the OS kernel. The Page table per segment has variable number of pages depending on the size of the segment
 and thus each page table has varying virtual address space&nbsp;built</span></span> by page units of fixed size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">A process initiates with the operating system loading the
<strong>STBR </strong>with the Segment Table containing the Page Table Base addresses. The Program Counter resets and generates the first virtual address. The highest order bits&nbsp;comprise the Segment number counter, followed by the middle order bits containing
 the VPN which is a virtual page counter, and the low order bits contain the Offset which is a byte counter to index into the memory elements within a page. The virtual page counter incorporates a logic to check that it does not exceed the Limit (number of
 pages) defined for the Page Table&nbsp;of the currently executing segment.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The MMU reads the segment number in the Program Counter and refers to the Segment table to obtain the Page Table Base address in physical memory. The VPN part in the Program Counter&nbsp;is then used to index into that Page Table and

</span></span>Segment Limit can be increased dynamically to allow Process growth which becomes easier to manage by simply adding pages to the segment's page table whose page frames gets randomly distributed in physical memory.

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>On the downside, segmentation leads to slower address translation due to two level of addressing, which reduces performance. However this is largely controlled by setting up the Segment table in the CPU register and
 Page table in the TLB. Context switching is heavier in segmented systems since both the page table and segment table need to be saved during each context switch.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>As we shall see in the following section, Page Table size becomes enormous in 64 bit system and so memory addressing by Segmentation with Paging is not viable beyond 32 bit systems. Thus 64 bit processors support segmentation

 average that the uppermost page frame in a segment to remain 50% free. So larger the Page size, the more will be the unused space in the uppermost page of a segment. This level will vary from process to process but the sum of all free and unused spaces leads
 to <strong>Internal Fragmentation.</strong> It has been found that Page size in the range 1KB to 8KB provides an optimal trade-off between Page Table size and internal fragmentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">If we assume 100 running processes each with 5 segments, then the approximate internal fragmentation for 4KB and 2MB page size will be (0.5*4KB)*5*100= 1MB and (0.5*2MB)*5*100= 500MB respectively. Page size is set in the CPU hardware
 depending on the system architecture and size of RAM installed.</p>

<strong>(</strong>or smaller&nbsp;Table index&nbsp;bit size used for allocating page numbers<strong>)</strong>&nbsp;and therefore smaller Table size. The size of these multiple Page Tables will essentially add up&nbsp;to the size of the Linear Page Table. However, each of these
 smaller Tables represent a process and so the Operating System can choose to selectively load Page Tables to memory as per memory availability and page out a Table to Hard Disc when the process become inactive or is terminated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Multi Level Page Tables are arranged in hierarchical groups, such that each entry on a page table identifies another page table down the hierarchy forming a tree of page tables. The last level in the hierarchy contain the process
 Page Tables while the ones higher up in the hierarchy, helps to identify the process table at the end of the tree.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Increasing the number of hierarchical levels is aimed at further splitting the Page Count
<strong>(</strong>i.e.&nbsp;Table index&nbsp;bit size used for allocating page numbers<strong>)</strong> of the Page Table structure at the last level in order&nbsp;to reduce the process table size, but at the expense of increasing the count of process tables at the last
 level.&nbsp;This allows the Operating System to gain finer control for allocating page tables to physical memory. However increased number of levels also increases the number of indexing required to identify the process page table and this becomes less efficient
 but for the TLB which helps to speed up the indexing by caching the address translation tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Let us consider a 2-level Page Table in a 64 bit system with 4KB Pages.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc4091ff-5413-4739-a350-6e21720329a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc4091ff-5413-4739-a350-6e21720329a6" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The address space are split into 3 fields: A Page Table Directory containing Page Table Base Address of all processes (highest order bits) + one Page Table per process (middle order bits) + Offset for the Page Tables (lowest order
 bits).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">We have, Offset = Log 2-base (4KB Page Size) = 12 bits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">As in 32-bit architecture, let each process have a Page Table with 20 bit VPN, 12 bit Offset and we have a 10 bit Page Table Directory (PTD) to account for 2^10 = 1024 processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Thus, Address Space (42 bits) = PTD (10 bit) + VPN (20 bit) + Offset (12 bit).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The virtual address sequence in the Page Table Directory (PTD), the virtual address sequence in the Page Table (VPN) and the Offset comprise three distinct counters generating the complete virtual address within the Program Counter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The MMU of the processor uses the highest 10 bits of the virtual address to index into the Page Table Directory and determine the page table base address. It then uses the next 20 bits of the virtual address to index into the Page
 Table and look up for&nbsp;the Page Frame&nbsp;address in physical memory. The lowest 12 offset bits in Program counter is used to index into the Page Frame and locate the instruction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">When the Offset reaches its maxima and resets to zero, the VPN gets incremented in the program counter. When the VPN crosses its maxima and resets to its initial value, the PTD increments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The size of a 42 bit Linear Page Table</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">= Count of pages in Page Table * PTE size</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">= (Address Space/Page Size) * PTE size<br />
= (2^42/2^12) * 5 bytes</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">= 2^30 * 5 bytes = 5 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">This is the Page Table Size of a single process. So for a typical of 100 processes the memory requirement is
<strong>500 GB!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">When the 42 bit address space&nbsp;is split into two or more levels of indirection, the 30-bit Table index of its Linear counterpart used for allocating page numbers,&nbsp;gets distributed on the multi levels (10 bit + 20 bit), while the
 Linear Table's&nbsp;Page Size (4 KB) and PTE (5 bytes) remains constant for all table across levels. Count of Page Tables at any level = Sum total of Page Count of all tables at preceding level. Thus by our example, we have 1 PTD with 2^10 pages and therefore 2^10
 Process Tables.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>So the Total Size of 42-bit Multi Level Page Tables:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">= (Size of PTD) + (Count of Page Tables * Size of each Pagle Table)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">= (Count of Pages in PTD * PTE) + (Count of Page Tables * Count of VPNs * PTE)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">= (2^10 *&nbsp;5 bytes) + (2^10&nbsp;* 2^20 *&nbsp;5 bytes)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">= 5KB + 1024 * 5MB = ~&nbsp;5 GB.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">However here it implies that the Page Table Size of a single process is 5MB and 5GB is that of&nbsp;1024 processes. So for a typical of 100 processes the memory requirement is
<strong>5</strong><strong>00 MB.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The essence of Multi Level Page Table is to control the Page Table occupancy in Physical Memory by retaining only the Page Tables of current processes in the Physical Memory while paging out the Page Tables of non-current processes
 into the Hard Disc. Since the Page Table Directory (5 KB)&nbsp;is nodal for all process management, it must remain in Physical Memory at all times.&nbsp;The PTEs in the PTD are the Page Table Base addresses which may refer to a memory location Or a Page File location
 in hard disc for Page Tables that have been paged out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The operating system will try to retain all created Page Tables in Standby list in physical memory. If the free memory level runs below a certain threshold, some of the Page Tables in Standby will be Paged out to Hard
 Disc and those Standby list will be released to Free memory.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">System designers control the size of Virtual Memory by limiting the virtual address space and/or defining more than 2 level of Page Tables to span the address space and/or setting an appropriate Page Size in the hardware. For example,
 Page size of 2 MB is used to gain system performance when large processes need to run on the target system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>We have, Virtual Address Space = count of Page Tables * count of pages in a Page Table * Page size.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">When Virtual Address Space and Page size is constant, the count of Page Tables becomes inversely proportional to the count of pages in a Page Table. Increasing the number of levels beyond 2 level does not necessarily reduce the
 overall size of all Page Tables. What is does, is to reduce the size of a Page Table and increase the count of Page Tables. This allows the Operating System to gain finer control on physical memory utilisation by the virtual memory (page tables).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>But for the TLB, a multi-level page table would have had considerable performance loss, due to multiple indexing involved through two or more levels of page tables to locate a page frame in physical memory. The TLB
 helps to eliminate about 99% memory referencing by storing a cache of the Page tables from memory into its registers.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>In the language of the operating system software, the virtual memory address is a pointer to the physical memory address, which in the case of multi-level page table resolves through a chain of indirection where one virtual
 address is a pointer to another virtual address spanning across address tables, leading to the physical memory address at the final level.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify"><span><strong>Inverte</strong><strong>d Page Table</strong></span></p>
<p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The first Windows 64-bit Server solution was built on Intel Itanium 64 bit platform which implemented the
<strong>Inverted Page Table (IPT).</strong> IPT initially remained a frontrunner for 64 bit systems particularly in UNIX and Solaris. However Multi Level Page Table became the preferred choice for Windows as it embraced 64 bit technology to develop into the
 future for both desktops and servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The Inverted Page Table is a strategy to reduce page table size by defining a Page table where the address space refers to the physical address space of RAM instead of the virtual address space. This makes sense on
 server systems having large amount of installed RAM to meet the demand of all running services. While a normal Page Table is indexed (addressed) by VPN to the PTEs containing PPN, the
<strong>Inverted Page Table is indexed by PPN to the PTEs containing VPN - </strong>
</span></span>thus limiting the virtual memory space to the physical memory space.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In a normal implementation of virtual memory, every process has its own page table with each page table having the same set of virtual addresses, and so the virtual memory space is
<strong>variable</strong> depending on the number of running processes. In an Inverted Page Table, the virtual memory space is
<strong>fixed</strong> by PPNs indexing a <strong>Single Page Table</strong> shared by all running processes, whose VPNs are randomly distributed in the table. Allocating a process in continuous pages will lead to internal fragmentation of the Page Table itself
 !</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Since the virtual address set has to be same for all processes fixed in the Program Counter, a process identifier (PID) is required in each PTE of the IPT to identify the VPNs corresponding to a process, as processes can no longer
 be distinguished by individual page table base address. The PID is 2-byte long and is part of the process control information in the PTE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Shared processes are not mapped within the virtual address set of a process, but are executed by a call-return statement to the shared process existing in the IPT.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba957b44-e678-48a6-8c34-056c40c10c91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba957b44-e678-48a6-8c34-056c40c10c91" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>An Inverted Page Table (array) first gets created with the PPN as index, which is then updated by the PID and VPN, and finally the Page Frames are created in physical memory in the index (PPN)&nbsp;sequence of the Inverted
 Page Table.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>Let us calculate the Inverted Page Table size for a 64 bit system with PTEs comprised of 40 addressable bits (5 byte) + 2 byte Process ID + 1 byte for Control information, 4KB Page Size and 32 GB RAM.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>Address Space = 32 GB RAM = 2^35 bytes</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>PTE size = 5 + 2 + 1 bytes = 8 bytes.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Page Size = 2^Offset = 2^12 bytes = 4KB</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>Page Table Size = (Address Space / Page Size) * PTE</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><strong><span>Page Table Size</span></strong><span> = 2^23 * 8 =
<strong>64 MB </strong></span></span>which is only&nbsp;0.2% of the 32 GB RAM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>An Inverted Page Table is an array whose index corresponds to the Page Frame Address in physical memory (PPN) and PTEs are a reverse mapping to the Virtual Page Address (VPN) of the process owning the frame.
</span></span><strong>This does not change the&nbsp;principle behind the virtual memory operation, where the virtual memory address serves as a memory pointer in OS instructions to access the physical memory.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In the light of above it implies, that instead of indexing into a normal page table by the VPN generated in the Program Counter, the VPN and its corresponding PID has to be
<strong>searched</strong> from the PTEs of an IPT in order to obtain&nbsp;the PPN. The search time in locating the PID &amp; VPN is substantial making this an extremely inefficient proposition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>The search function is therefore eliminated by a Hash Table which is an array whose index is formed by reducing the PID &amp; VPN by a hash function into a hash key, while the array entries correspond to the PPN. Thus the
 Hash Table is in essence a normal Page Table derived from the Inverted Page Table.
</span></span>The time and space overhead in creating an extra&nbsp;Hash Table, far outweighs the otherwise performance loss in directly using the IPT.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">A task executes when the operating system changes the PID in a CPU register which resets the VPN in&nbsp;Program Counter.
<span><span>The processor use the hash function to generate a hash key from the PID &amp; VPN, and index into the Hash Table with the hash key. The PPN value stored at this index of the Hash Table is used to further index into the Inverted Page Table for its PTE.

 If the PID &amp; VPN in CPU&nbsp;matches with the PID &amp; VPN at the PTE of the Inverted Page Table, the PPN is used to generate the Physical address by concatenating it with the Offset in the Program Counter. This physical address is used to fetch the process code and
 data for execution. If no match is found between the CPU data&nbsp;and PTE, a hash collision resolution technique is used to determine the PPN, by chaining hash entries to point to other entries in the hash table. A pure search of the PTEs in the Inverted Page
 Table can alternately be enforced.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">All these jugglery is just to ensure that least amount of physical memory is invested on the Page Table (virtual memory) which manages that very physical memory present as a limited resource.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify"><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">RAM evolved to serve as a buffer between the low speed magnetic hard disc storage and the high speed processor. RAM can get obliterated in future if hard disc speed can attain the speed of RAM. Currently, the storage technology
 has advanced to Solid State Drives (SSD) and SD cards delivering significant speed, robustness and miniaturisation necessary for mobile devices. But these drives cannot effectively replace RAM because of their limited write cycle endurance&nbsp;defining its life
 span. As a storage device, SSDs has an inbuilt controller which distributes the write cycles uniformly to all its usable space to improve the life span to a minimum of 5 years. However this strategy will not extend the life of SSDs if made to emulate as&nbsp;RAM,
 because write cycles are overwhelmingly large in RAM where objects like webpage, apps and data are created or edited all the time. In fact, the RAM acting as a buffer has&nbsp;to write all objects that are read from storage locations, be it in web/network/local
 storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">There is yet another possibility of RAM eventually getting merged with the processor cache, when technology has sufficiently advanced to produce highly miniaturised and low power consuming memory chips,&nbsp;viable to attain&nbsp;the saturation&nbsp;size
 in system design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In the&nbsp;present scheme of things, the purpose of memory to run processes, remains distinct from the purpose of hard disc to store data and send stored process files to memory through Device I/O operation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The exception is the page file on hard disc which is mapped into the memory address space and acts as a secondary&nbsp;cache when memory demand of processes&nbsp;run higher than the installed memory. Due to slow response time of the hard
 disc,&nbsp;the page file&nbsp;is never a true replacement for RAM and is applied only as a contingency measure to free up memory space. Increasing the size of page file will not enhance the performance of the system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The 4GB memory limit and 2TB storage space limit in 32-bit systems, makes a quantum leap&nbsp;in 64-bit systems, which is way beyond the maximum capacity of RAM and Hard Disc that can be currently supported in an high end system. Thus
 64-bit systems remain vastly open-ended to allow for all future developments in technology&nbsp;over the next decades.</p>

<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>

<h2>            Slideshow with an external hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I want to set up my screen saver to run a slideshow off the 10K plus family photos in multiple folders on my external hard drive. I'd like this to automatically appear after 10minutes of inactivity and to run for an hour, or optionally longer. It should
 be able to go through multiple yearly and monthly folders within a single "photos" folder. In an idel world I'd also like to have the change to select photos I'd like to see again somehow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Developers - I'd be willing to pay $10 for this luxury.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open Windows settings (Windows key + I).</span></li><li><span>Then click on Personalization. </span></li><li><span>Then click on Lock Screen. </span></li><li><span>Then select slide show from the drop down menu. </span></li><li><span>Then click on Add a folder and navigate to the folder on your external drive.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>

Please note that the drive should always be plugged in when computer is idle. If you unplug the drive, the screensaver will be set to default. You will also need to change the options in Power settings. Here is an article to help you<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">:

<p>G'day,</p>
<p>Is this on a XBX1 or X360?</p>
<p>Is the TV you are trying to watch the movie HDCP compliant? Check the TV make and model on the brands website for info or the manual.</p>
<p>Some older model TV's can't play movies because they are not HDCP compliant.</p>
<p>Let us know here with some extra info about your setup so we can help you further.</p>

    <title>Explorer.exe keeps freezing Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Explorer.exe keeps freezing Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Community,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recently bought an Acer Aspire R7 with Windows 8.1 Pro on it and I am very satisfied with this product and your operating system.</p>
<p>Everything was working fine except that the explorer.exe freezes here and than. This happens mostly when I'm using IE11 and I switch to something else.
</p>
<p>E.g. I switch to the tiles overview and I can click on the tiles but nothing opens. And when I switched to the Desktop, the explorer itself also froze and when I restart the explorer.exe with the task manager everything is working fine again.</p>
<p>So this is really getting annoying and I hope you can help me with my problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Kindest Regards,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            Hi octothrope. 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/32efaa76-c235-40cf-b681-eac18f5f14bd" title="SaFKaN0">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have gotten another external power supply unit and the Xbox One is still not powering on, then the console has a hardware failure internally and it will need to sent in for repair or replacement. You can try power cycling the console and try plugging
 it into different wall outlets and see if that makes a difference. Go ahead and do a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the console does not turn on then take a look at this support article for more information on getting your product serviced:

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            When did you buy this new Xbox One? If it's fairly new, and doesn't turn on, then exchange it at the store you purchased it at because it should be under warranty.
<br />
<br />
In regards to the orange light on the power brick, I would suggest making sure the console is off, then unplugging the power cord from the wall and the console itself. After that, wait a couple minutes before plugging everything back in, and then try turning
 it on again. Also, try plugging the power cord directly into a wall outlet (not a power bar / surge protector)<br />
<br />
If the console doesn't turn on, and the light is still orange on the power brick, then chances are it needs to be serviced.

<h2>            Why after deleting files, process still listed in Services.msc&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I hope my question doesn't bore you, because it's not so alertly urgent and important to be answered, but still this matter annoys me.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Why after deleting files, process still listed in Services.msc?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is what happens: I am working on deleting all AskToolBar files of my PC. Since there was no Uninstall option in ControlPanel-Programs, i downloaded "Malwarebytes Anti-Malware" - a good one! , and manually traced all ask toolbar files and deleted them.
 Also there were some other going along with it, i got rid of them too. I removed all AskToolBar influances of my 2 browsers (InternetExplorer and Chrome).<br />
<br />
OK, so I entered services.msc and Stopped the Ask options there too, but why when i already deleted Ask-s, this ASK UPDATE SERVICE still remains there? Could i remove it from there as well?<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I made some pics to show you that, when try to Start it again it confirms i've already deleted the files, but i want to completely remove this, is it possible?<br />
<br />
Thank You!</div>

<h3> a tim named bro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Booter</h2>
                    
<p>So my friends and I&nbsp;were all in a game of zombies on black ops playing Moon, when some kid named
<strong>[mod removed]</strong> joined and lagged my friend out of the game and party. We were almost done the Easter egg on moon so it was very frustrating. When i asked why he did it he simply said, " I was bored". I was extremely&nbsp;mad like anyone else would
 be so i cursed the kid out. Bad move on my part because guess who his next target was? Whenever i sign online i get kicked right off. I believe what he has is called a booter, Im not sure though. I filed a complaint&nbsp;AND called xbox but i don't think justice
 will be served. Im paying for Xbox live and i can't even use it because of hacking scum. Im posting this to get the attention of Microsoft and for the community to let me know if there is a way to prevent it. People like this should have their Xbox's banned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Burns4444</p>

<p>You've filed a complaint and I assume set him to avoid so you've done all you can XBL wise. As the suspension forum has shown time and again these people are whacked on a regular basis. As for the booting issue switch your router off and on again to force
 a new IP to be assigned. If that doesn't work phone your ISP to get a new one sorted.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message when you run MS Paint?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>Try to open MS Paint application from the following location and check if you’re able to run it.</p>
<p><b>“C:\Windows\System32\mspaint.exe”</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If you can run MS Paint from its above location, the issue may be due to corrupted shortcut icon. If this is the case, you may
 delete the shortcut icon by right-clicking on the <b>‘mspaint.exe’</b> file and select
<b>‘Pin to Start Menu’.</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>If the issue persists then, p<span>erform SFC scan and then run MS Paint and check if that helps. The SFC /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
</span></p>
<p><span>For more information how to do SFC/ scan, please follow this link:

    <title>Skype Calls from a Cellphone to a laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Calls from a Cellphone to a laptop</h2>
                    <p>I'm new to Skype and have only used it thus far to do video calls from one laptop to another. I understand that in order to use it on a mobile device you have to either purchase credits or a subscription plan. Here are my two related questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Can I use Skype on my cellphone to make a voice call to a person on their laptop? (Just as I have the option on my laptop to make either a video or voice call)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If I can do this, I know that I will have to pay, but would the person on the laptop have to pay as well or would it be free for them since they are just receiving a call and not making one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may already be common knowledge, but I appreciate the help. Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi Arcane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get the <strong>activation error </strong>“<strong>0x8007007b</strong>” or “<strong>0x8007232b</strong>” when you try to activate your Windows 8, then probably you use a generic Windows 8 product key during installation and the activation wizard cannot
 find a valid&nbsp; KMS (Key Management Server) to activate your copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the suggestions from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/80d312eb-78ca-451d-a3fd-e58321f530ca" title="Deepak_Krishnan R">

<p><span>Hi Scott,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your screenshot, </span><span>When "</span>Require Wi-Fi for video or meeting content<span>" is On, this mean that&nbsp;</span>Skype for Business
 won’t use your cellular data connection for video or meeting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please help to change the <strong>Voice Settings</strong>&nbsp;to the "</span>VoIP always<span>". when "V</span>oIP always" is selected, which means that Skype for Business will use Wi-Fi
 to make Skype for Business calls. When you’re not connected to Wi-Fi, it will use your data cellular data connection or mobile minutes, instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this issue persist even you changed the setting, please send us some screeshots about "What I end up doing is physically dialing the number and entering the password to the meeting...but when in Wifi, I just click the join button and it connects me automatically"
 for further analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            How did you "run a recovery"? Recovery using what? A restore-to-factory condition disc for your OEM computer? I don't see how this could have happened using the computer mftr.'s restore process. Something built into Vista? Frankly at this point perhaps
 you'd be best off backing up your data and doing a clean install of Windows but since I can't see your computer and I'm still not sure what you did, maybe you should have a professional who can actually

<br />
I'm sorry I was unable to help you.

<p>That sucks, it doesn't stay saved in the servers or anything? I had it happen in the beta a couple times and the only thing it affected was any custom settings I changed such as controls or a/v. I mean with all the stupid loading and saving in this game
 you would think it's saved to one of DICE or EA's servers.</p>

<p>Its the forcing in shutting down that corrupts the hard drive, but you have no choice as the freeze locks the system up, the Xbox needs to go through the closing down procedures. I contacted Xbox support this morning and they confirmed this.

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't BF3 have problems with corrupt saves as well? I myself don't remember having a corrupt save on it but I think plenty of others did. I only had the random freezes every couple games on BF3 but was lucky enough to not get
 a corrupt save on it. Seems a lot of people are getting both on BF4.</p>

<p>It only deleted my single player save and all my controller settings, Multi player wasnt effected being there server side based thankfully</p>
<p>Never had a prob on Bf3 either</p>
<p>Still a pain in the ***,i dont think i can handle playing thur again with irish/omar hes was terrible in this,i killed him first lol</p>
<p>i noticed alot of places you can get stuck on MP already also.. and one game it would make me spectate some team mate while i was alive on defuse !! then it would jump back to me</p>
<p>And some times the spawn menu would be dim or blacked out</p>

<p>good to see i am not the only one this happened too...</p>
<p>BF3 did have save corruption issues, but i never finished the campaign because its all about the multiplayer so i did the Co-Op and finished it for the extra unlocks.</p>
<p>now you get multiplayer unlocks from playing the campaign so i played it and it corrupted once and had to play it again. Still have to finish finding the collectables.</p>
<p>but i've gotten three new releases in the last three months and every one has locked up and froze and i've learned that i'm not the only user to have this happened with those games. I am suspecting it's something really to do with the Xbox 360s dashboard
 system that causes this. When i see the notifications icon pop up for achievements and when friends come online some time it lags with showing of the graphic, it never did that years ago with earlier versions of the dashboard.</p>
<p>I think that MS has plastered so many versions of the dashboard in the 360 that its got hidden bugs that cause it to crash with recent devoloped games. I really feel that the game developers don't ever play the game with older xboxs or even with and 360
 or PS3 i've read about similar problems with the same games locking up and freezing the PS3 also, so it's a mix of poor developers and the systems them self.</p>

<p>It's not just the xbox that is having the problem. It's the same with PS3. Been that way since BF3. Random freezes happened for me then and it was on a brand new slim 250gig at the time. So it's not just an issue with older models of the 360. Just search
 google for BF3 or BF4 freeze and you will see plenty of people from both consoles and the pc that have and are still having the problems.</p>

<p>It happened again... had to redo all my controllers AGAIN</p>
<p>MP normal mode is complete garbage also, The boats are pretty much Invincible and the bigger PT boat took like over 10 rockets and stationary rockets to sink</p>
<p>The little bird machine guns are pathetic, do no damage to vehicles and can barely even kill one soldier</p>
