            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. See whether resolution of your screen is properly set or not.
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; System &gt; Display &gt; 1920x1080 is the recommended resolution for most of the laptops. You can see which resolution fits you.
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Display Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer

            Hi,
<br />Appears that your resolution is not correctly set.
<br />Change it what according to your monitor:

            Hi Mark
<br />
<br />Right lick your Desktop, choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Make sure Resolution is set to the one marked (recommended)
<br />
<br />Make sure Scale is set to 100%
<br />
<br />That is all the settings you can change on your PC, if that does not resolve this, are you using a PC with a monitor
<br />
<br />If so, on the side or bottom of your Monitor is a menu button, press that
<br />
<br />On the new menu that appears on your display, if there is an AutoFit option, choose that, otherwise look for a horizontal and vertical scaling option and use that to being your full desktop into vies . . .

<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: </strong><em>T</em><em>he windows 10 version doesn't start up with Windows why is that?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype for Windows 10 version does not have the option to be automatically launched when Windows starts. This function is only available for the classic Skype (7.40) and new Skype (8.xx).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To isolate your issue about missing contacts, I am requesting for the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Were you automatically logged in after launching the Skype application? If you weren't, did you sign in using
<em>Skype Name, email or phone number</em>?</li><li>Have you checked if there are other&nbsp;accounts connected to your email address? If you haven't, please go to this link:
<strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics</span></a></strong><span><strong>​</strong>, type your email and select
<strong>Continue</strong>. All of the accounts connected to your email will be shown on the next page.</span></li><li><span>Sign in to Skype for Web: <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>Hi andhunt88,</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Was it working fine earlier?
<span>What changes were made to the system between the time everything last worked and when you noticed&nbsp;the problem?</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would like to confirm which application you are trying to open.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Who is the manufacturer of the program?</span></p>
<p><span>The application is misinterpreting the operating system version and is trying to call a procedure in the legacy windows version of
 the <strong>Dynamic Link Library (DLL</strong>) that is unavailable in current windows version.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the followings steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Check if the application is compatible with windows vista; see the windows vista compatibility link below:<br />
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/compatibility/windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/compatibility/windows-vista/</a>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the application is not compatible with windows vista, you need to check with the application manufacturer for an update or a higher version of the software
 that is compatible with windows vista.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the application is only compatible with windows XP, the next best step would be to run the application in windows XP SP2 compatibility mode on windows
 vista.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Run the application in windows XP SP2 (service pack) compatibility mode, see the link for more information:<br />

                    <p>Original title: KB 915597 Def 1.115.1674.0 print spool keeps stopping after update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated the definition update for windows defender today and immediately my printer disappeared and I got the message "windows can't access add printer" and the message that spooler had stopped and to restart it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have restarted it several times but within a few seconds it stops again.&nbsp; This is definitely a windows update problem as I have 2 laptops both using Win 7 on the home network, yet the&nbsp;other lapyop is fine but it hasn't downloaded the update.&nbsp; The printer
 has worked fine for over a year with no problems.&nbsp; I have downloaded the latest&nbsp;printer driver but no joy. If I delete the printer and try to add it again I get an error when I click on add printer as above.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to uninstal the update but it says you can't uninstall this update, I am stuck and now can't print anything.</p>

<h2>            Forced to change gamertag and was charged for it.</h2>
                    
<p>On Sunday June 1, I get an email stating that xbox maintenance team has changed my gamertag because of member complaintss. So they sent me a link how and where to change m gamertag if I did not like the generic one they gave me. After choosing my new gamertag,
 I noticed I had to pay for it. I was furious!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>For one, my original gamertag was not against xbox policy. Secondly, I have no clue how many complaints I even received to be forced gamertag change. Either way, I changed my gamertag, I made sure it is not against/offensive to any other members and I would
 like to be refunded because I didn't want to change my original gamertag. I also heard that they can let you change your gamertag without being charged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So why am I charged?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>For any inquiry regarding bans, suspensions or forced gamertag changes you can create a post here: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../41.aspx</a> </p>
<p>It is the only place to get a response from the Xbox Live Enforcement Team.</p>
<p>when you receive a forced gamertag change you do not get a free change, in the past it was free (a while back) but people abused it and changed it into something offensive again, so that's probably why the change has to be a paid change now.</p>

<p>You were issued a Forced Name Change. The change it, you had to pay. That charge was also confirmed, I believe, twice before going through. You clearly skipped those and went ahead and did it. It's a legitimate charge.</p>

<p>It's just another slap in the face from MS. You have no problems taking the money in the first place though... The gamer tags shouldn't make it past paying for them in the first place, and you talk about customer loyalty.. I've yet see this so called loyalty
 you speak of MS..</p>

<p>he is complaining, that a gamertag which is violating the coc can be chosen in the first place, which the gamer is paying for and then after a while is recieving a forced change, possible and most likely ending in a 2nd change by the player</p>
<p>its a stupid namingsystem making it possible instead of simply "gamertag can not be chosen, please use a different one" but as anyone agrees to the coc, they have to be a bit more careful could be what micosofts motivation might be</p>

<p>Nope you have to remember that a you can mix words or letters or numbers to get past any word filter
</p>
<p>To get every single possible combo of a curse word including numbers aannd letters would be imposssible</p>
<p>People will just think of new ways to spell a bad word</p>
<p>It's just better to use common sense</p>
<p>What you can't says in front of a child don't do it </p>
<p>Most services already have this rule and usually comes with a suspension are you sure you want to question reporting rules?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Media Creation Tool USB Stick problem</h2>
                    <div>
<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please, if anybody would have some solution to this problem of mine …</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I have been searching/reading tens-tens of posts regarding this USB creation problem, but none of them have been helpful enough, seen on many trials, ab. 2hrs/each …</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>OK, the problem comes up just on the end of the MCT procedure, previously with error code 0x80070005-0xA0019 , but, after doing also the clearing of the readonly, with error code 0x80042405-0xA0019 .</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The processing laptop details are, PB AMD A6-3420M, Windows 10 Pro 10.0.15063.540 v1703.&nbsp;
</span></span>T<span><span>he USB Stick is a SanDisk Cruzer Blade 16GB</span><span>, on an USB 2.0 port</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Following are the details of the latest procedure details applied:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>AntiVirus -&gt; OFF</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Write protect/readonly -&gt; OFF</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Run MCT as Admin</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Sharing the USB Stick (needed or not?)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>USB Stick clean/format commands:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Command prompt Admin</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>diskpart</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>select d</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>attributes disk clear re</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>assign letter=E (not needed, already the same)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>exit</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Still not applied SFC or DISM</span></span></p>

<p><span>UPDATE 25.08.2017</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note! Below there you have the main procedure repeated corrected/completed.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Further procedure steps, if problems arise, suggested by some helping colleagues, Thanks!:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Restart the processing machine (always recommended after a failing trial)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run Windows Disk Cleaning incl. System Files for main OS disk (may take quite a while, if not run lately or at all)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On Windows-folder delete $Windows.~BT and $Windows.~WS, (and, also possibly found install.esd, installx86.esd and installx64.esd, 2+GB/each, down
 there close to the pagefile.sys)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Before MCT start close all open folder/explorer windows’, or shut all explorer.exe on Task Manager/Processes/Applications, but not the one, residing
 on the full process list</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And, still some more hints:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try all the procedures with another target USB, with FAT32, on 8/16/32GB Stick, mounted on USB 2.0 port</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try changing the processing machine running all the procedures with it</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Apply sfc /scannow (probably no problems detected, but maybe yes in some case)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Still not applied DISM /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth {| /scanhealth | /resorehalth } (maybe not even needed, but just in case)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Status now:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After some 15+hrs 10+trials struggling, with all these points taken in consideration, everything is now working fine, on two different processing
 machines, having now 7 SanDisk Cruzer Blade 16GB USB 2.0 Sticks with v1703 both x86/x64 and the same also on one Kingston Data Traveler 100 G3 16GB USB 3.0 .<span>&nbsp;
</span>The last 2 SanDisks did have the problem in the end of MCT with the error code 0x80042405-0xA0019 , but finally, maybe after the restart of the main processing machine and all the given procedures gone through, finally got these USB Sticks finalized
 into a good operating mode.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just wonder, why this error code 0x80042405-0xA0019 is not recognized almost nowhere in the net and do not have any noting or clarification either on Microsoft pages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>_________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>OK, here you have once again the main procedure repeated corrected/completed:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AntiVirus -&gt; OFF</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sharing the USB Stick with full rights for everyone (needed or not?)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>USB Stick clear readonly/clean/format</span></p>
<p><span>Command prompt Admin</span></p>
<p><span>diskpart</span></p>
<p><span>list disk (may see stick free 0 or more)</span></p>
<p><span>select disk</span></p>
<p><span>attributes disk clear readonly</span></p>
<p><span>clean</span></p>
<p><span>rescan (if asked)</span></p>
<p><span>list disk (just to check after rescan, or, for seeing the stick is all free)</span></p>
<p><span>select disk (if not yet selected)</span></p>
<p><span>create partition primary</span></p>
<p><span>list partition (just to check it’s selected and seeing that a minor offset is valid)</span></p>
<p><span>active</span></p>
<p><span>format fs=FAT32 label=1703 quick</span></p>
<p><span>assign letter=<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>(not needed, if already an appropriate one)</span></p>
<p><span>exit</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before MCT start close all open folder/explorer windows’, or shut all explorer.exe on Task Manager/Processes/Applications, but not the one, residing
 on the full process list</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run MCT as Admin</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After MCT ending click ready for closing, and you’ll see the USB Stick is re-named as ESD-USB.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>OK, probably still no need for DISM</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note! If problems arise, please check also the suggested actions above in this post</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>_________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And, note also this alternative full procedure:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Rufus Free formatting, with Windows 10 v1703 ISO,<span>&nbsp;
</span>x86, x64, or both, downloaded all smoothly by MCT, or, first making a single x86 or x64 ISO with BurnAware Free directly from an installation-DVD, or the combined x86/x64 ISO with BurnAware Free directly from a combined installation-USB.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This Rufus procedure will be more easy and quicker, anyway, all the ISO have to be copied into every needed single USB Stick.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Tested working also on USB 3.0 Stick, but, sorry, not tested, may work also on an USB 3.0 Port ...<span>&nbsp;
</span>And, note, Rufus will format into NTFS, even FAT32 is initially set as default on the settings window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, will work on boot all well, and even it’s an USB Stick, with a CD/DVD-like boot initiation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>By Rufus the USB Stick is named as ESD-ISO, compared with MCT naming it ESD-USB.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Bookings App and Skype for Business Integration</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the bookings app offer Skype for Business integration. I would like to give the client the option of an in-person meeting, or click to automatically create a Skype meeting without me having to manually create it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, does the app allow for a client to book with the first available team member or do they have to look at each team members availability?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>Looking for mature Reach players that like to have a good time for some matchmaking and custom map and custom game sharing. Reach rules but I'm getting tired of playing with random people and annoying people. Also getting to play some good games on my custom
 maps and others maps would be cool. So if you're interested send me a message or friend request.</p>

                    <p>Is Microsoft aware of the problem with the security update &nbsp;KB3110329 for Windows 7 x64-based systems? Have they repaired it? Thanks to John Butler for isolating the configuration problem with updates of January 12, 2016.

<p>Dear Jayant Gupta,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Thank you for your response. When I tried to install the updates of January 12, 2016 on my Windows&nbsp;7 computer I encountered a problem at the stage where I have to shut down the computer to complete the process. When configuring the updates it remained at
 12% for a very long time and then finally returned to the logon and when I checked the update history&nbsp;eleven x64-based updates were listed as failed.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter. I didn't try to reset Windows Update components for fear of making things worse. I see that at least one other user, John Butler, &nbsp;encountered the same problem and he identified the&nbsp; security update KB3110329 as causing
 the configuration problem.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Later I downloaded the updates again and hid them, and then successfully&nbsp;installed them&nbsp;all&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;KB3110329 unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>At this time I have KB3110329 hidden and await notice of its repair.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>

<p><br />
Having no idea what all you really have tried...</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Check your date, time and timezone.</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>. Remove whatever is found.</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Get the System Update Readiness Tool (save it) and right-click on it and "Run as Administrator". Choose the right one for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=167366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">All supported x86-based (32-bit) versions of Windows 7</a></li><li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=167367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">All supported x64-based (64-bit) versions of Windows 7</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Let it run/fix things.</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Try updating.</p>
<p><br />
If it is still failing, attempt this next:</p>

<p><b>**Important**</b> The following issues occur when you do this: </p>
<ul>
<li>Updates that are currently downloaded but that have not yet been installed have to be downloaded again by using Windows Update or Microsoft Update.</li><li>When you delete the Software Distribution folder, your download history is removed.</li><li>If you currently receive updates from Microsoft Update and from Windows Update, you will have to re-select this option from the Windows Update Web site.</li></ul>
<p><b><br />
**Note**</b> If the issue is resolved and you can successfully download and install updates, you can safely delete the SoftwareDistribution.old directory to recover disk space.</p>

Honestly - nothing there is hard.&nbsp; Time consuming, but spelled out very precisely and fairly easy to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
Maybe you don't have time, but as for difficulty... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also - you might not have to do it all.&nbsp; It's given in a order with testing in-between.&nbsp; You might get lucky and be fixed after the first part.</p>

    <title>A little confused - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A little confused</h2>
                    
<p>So up until now, I've been thinking that my Xbox disc drive is faulty, but now I have reason to believe that might not be the case. I just want to know, is my drive faulty and therefore needing attention, or is it just bad discs that the Xbox doesn't like</p>
<p>Long post, please read<br />
I have an Xbox 360 250GB Slim that's 14 months old and I have some weirdness going on with some discs which until now was caused by drive failure<br />
<br />
CoD4 will not play at all. The drive spins up as if it realises it's a game and then it hits a piece of code that stops it starting and it spins down again saying one of the following<br />
- Unrecognised disc<br />
- Unreadable disc (03-80-00)<br />
- Mixed Media Disc<br />
- Play DVD Error (complete with the to play this disc error, which sometimes glitches out as well)<br />
See what I mean here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs6Yz-PK4pU<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs6Yz-PK4pU<br />
Before when I still had it installed it would play every now and again, or it would say play game and show the CoD4 picture, but then error out when I try and play. Now it's not installed it doesn't play at all<br />
<br />
I thought it was in playable condition, but on closer inspection, every inch of it is covered in scratches (light ones) from usage and the label on the other side has a bit of damage, so it's possible that that could be the disc at fault. I have not tried it
 on another system.<br />
<br />
Batman Dark Knight DVD<br />
There is a specific part where it starts stuttering and gives attempting to read media, once it clears that bit it plays fine. Initially I thought it was the drive at fault, but I inspected the disc and there are two scratches (one quite a bit more than your
 light surface scratch) near each other on the outer edge. Again, it could be this bit it's trying to read when it starts stuttering, but I tested it on my Blu Ray player and laptop, both have no issues.<br />
<br />
Tintin DVD<br />
When I boot it from Dashboard and say Play Movie in the DVD's menu, the 360 kind of hangs on a black screen and says Attempting to read media and skips forward two minutes and plays from there (looking at Smartglass, the counter that says how far into the movie
 you are will actually still be going when it hangs). But if I manually hit skip forward when it's hanged, it plays from the very beginning of the movie without skipping the two minutes and without issue. Also, if I let it skip the two minutes and then rewind
 back to the very beginning it plays without issue. It did this when the disc was brand new and still does it now.
<br />
Cause:Unknown<br />
<br />
Tekken Tag 2<br />
This happens very rarely. Sometimes when I put this game in it says Unrecognised Disc. Issues with this disc started after CoD4 went funny. Sometimes when it spins down to start reading from the install it sounds like the drive is struggling, although this
 has only happened once or twice.<br />
Cause: Unknown<br />
<br />
All other games, DVDs and music CDs play absolutely fine and without issue, some of them load up a lot faster as well.</p>

<p>It could be the disc drive that is starting to worn-out, the unreadable disc, the mixed media, skipping in content are all signs of that.</p>
<p>The fact that it doen't happen with all disc is because not all disc are masterized in the same way.</p>
<p>For now don't worry too much, just be careful that those scratches on some dvd aren't made by the dvd drive.</p>

<p>Really hoping it's not the drive, because I'm not in warranty anymore. I've had two consoles have problems with discs before the 1 year mark. Issues with the Slim started to pop up during beta (not drive related issues though). Current issue is up to months
 apart, that I forget about it.</p>

<p>no that should be ok. the worst thing to do is to move or accidently knock the console while playing a disk that can damage the laser and damage the game</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open&#47;run any .exe files. Everything has turned into a LNK file.</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know what happened but all my files on my computer have turned into a LNK file. Every file, no matter what it is, is&nbsp;now a LNK file type. Everytime I try and open anything a box comes up and says "Paint cannot read this. This is not a valid bitmap
 file, or it's format is not currently supported". Every file has .lnk at the end. Anyone know how to change the file type manually or any other way? My&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;is Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I tried the following based on a suggestion.<br />
<br />

<br />
I followed all the instructions but when I tried to enter them in the Command Prompt or DOS as I rememeber it I got the following message...<br />
<br />
<span>ERROR: Error opening the file. There may be a disk or file system error.<br />

<br />
Anyone have any suggestions? I have to go through MY COMPUTER to access my programs, files, etc. All my icons have the "paint palate" on them and they are all lnk files. So basically all my stuff is still there but I can't directly access it through my links.
 If anyone knows how to fix this I would really appreciate it. My new laptop is only a week old and this is very frustrating.

            After messing around with my computer for a while I figured out some kind of a solution. I'm not sure if it'll be a temporary one or a permanent one, but things are running normally now.
<br />
<br />
I went to the start bar and searched up "system recovery" The 4th one down says "restore your computer to an earlier time." I clicked on that and followed the directions to restore my computer to the way it was as of the 23rd of December, it did not delete
 any of my files such as pictures and word documents. <br />
I hope that's some kind of help. <br />
<br />
A HUGE note, however, is to make sure your anti-virus program is turned off. The first time I tried to do a system recovery it failed because of my anti-virus program.

            <p>Hi,<br />
Thank you for posting your queries on Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be some application running that in the background which Windows is not able to terminate properly or it could be&nbsp;an issue with Malware infection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to assist you better, could you please confirm a couple of things like:
</p>
<div>1. Were there any recent hardware or software changes on your Computer?</div>
<div>
<p>2. Does the issue persists when you log in to a different user account?</p>
<p>3. What is the Operating System you are using?</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Nevertheless, to know what all processes are running in the background, you can follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>Step 1: Using the Task Manager:<br />
Task Manager displays the programs, processes, and services that are currently running on your computer. You can use Task Manager to monitor your computer’s performance or to close a program that's not responding.<br />
to know more about task manager and how to end non responding programs follow this link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-Task-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-Task-Manager</span></a><br />
<br />
Step 2: Using the command "tasklist" :<br />
This is a more advanced Command line option which displays a list of applications and services with their Process ID (PID) for all tasks running on either a local or a remote computer.<br />
To use this command, open command prompt and type in the command "tasklist" without braces. It would pull up a list of all running services and applications running in the background.</p>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, I would request that you run the Microsoft Safety Scanner to check that your machine is not affected with any malwares.&nbsp;The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware,
 and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</div>
<div>Please download and run the scanner from this link:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information was helpful.<br />
Please get back to us with the updated status on the issue and we would be glad to assist you.</div>

<h2>            Broken Shortcuts in Windows.old</h2>
                    I reinstalled Vista&nbsp;this week, and it copied the previous Vista installation to Windows.old.<br />
<br />
That's great, but now many of the protected shortcut folders in Users no longer function because they direct to some location in the SystemRoot, and the folders&nbsp;they're trying to find are actually in Windows.old.<br />
<br />
How do I get to the folders those shortcuts used to be able to see?&nbsp; How do I find out where they used to point?&nbsp; Shortcut folders like Local Settings won't show me their Target, so I don't know where to look to find their contents.

            Hi Lex,<br />
<br />
The "shortcuts" you are referring to are actually <strong>symbolic links</strong>. (see&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754077.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754077.aspx</a>)&nbsp; They are mainly there for compatibility
 between Windows Vista and older Windows operating systems like XP.&nbsp; For example, some older programs will not install or function unless they can write to the Local Settings folder.&nbsp; The symbolic link provides a "folder" with that name that actually sends
 the data to the correct area.<br />
<br />
The way to view where that symbolic link is pointing:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>. </li><li>In the Start Search box type <strong>CMD</strong> and press enter. </li><li>type <strong>cd \windows.old\users\(whatever user profile you wish to view)</strong>.&nbsp;(ex: "cd \windows.old\users\lex") and press enter.
</li><li>type <strong>dir /al</strong> and press enter.</li></ul>
<p><br />
To read the display, after&nbsp;the word (JUNCTION) will be the&nbsp;folder name followed by the actual path.</p>

    <title>ELAN Touchpad has no two finger scrolling - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ELAN Touchpad has no two finger scrolling</h2>
                    <p>I am not totally sure if this is able to be answered here. I have an MSI GE60 with the ELAN touchpad. I was recently having some troubles and got a blue screen. I came here and someone told me the drivers were all out of whack, which later turned out to
 be true, but ever since I updated all of the drivers my touchpad cannot do two finger scrolling. I still have the option for both two finger scrolling and two finger zooming but neither of them are functioning. Someone suggested getting this program called
 two-finger-scroll but it is only for synaptics touchpads. Although scrolling does not work, I can do two finger clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance if anyone can help me.</p>

<p>I would only expect the zooming to work in W8.&nbsp; The Touch language was redefined for W8 to make multiple fingers irrelevant (except for zooming or rotation, where supported).</p>

<h2>            My laptop turns off by itself randomly like someone switch off the light.</h2>
                    I have this problem for a month now and I don't know what to do to fix it. My laptop was working fine and this problem suddenly occurred it turns off randomly after few seconds sometimes after a few minutes. But when I plug in the ac power adapter my laptop
 will not turn off randomly and it's working fine I can play games for hours I just let it charging. Am I having a battery problem or is there something else that causes my laptop to turn off by itself? Please I really need your help thank you.

            <p>hey Jairus, I'm no expert as far as techy things go; however, personal experience does come in handy when you want to help others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have a laptop and have had for several years now (albeit different laptops). I also had a problem of my laptop randomly shutting down. There were two things that I experienced with two separate laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one laptop, when it began shutting down, I noticed it was because the lap had gotten quite hot. It had to do with the fans that keep unit cool (it will always have warmth to it when in use, but HOT is NOT cool lol) So, in that case it would shut off as
 a safety feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that situation, I got a small fan that blew directly into the laptop via a side vent. However, if you do not have the space or prefer not to clutter your desk with a fan, another option is to purchase a cooler pad (chill mat) that your laptop sits upon.
 If inner fans are not working, this pad will keep your lap cool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a Lenovo where I used a chill mat to keep it cool because it constantly overheated (quickly) when in use because the inner fan(s) seized. It was an older laptop (about 5 years old approx) at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jairus, if your laptop is not overheating, then obviously that is not the problem. But think about this, Jairus. If your lap randomly shuts down anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes (if I understood you correctly), but it works for unlimited hours
 when you use the adapter, instead of using the battery, it is most likely that it is your battery or connector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But FIRST and foremost, is your battery charged when you try to use your lap. When it is plugged in and you are using the adapter, check on your lower taskbar, where the symbol for your internet connection, clock, etc is. You should see the icon for your
 battery (I always call it the square head farmer holding the pitchfork lol ---but it is actually a symbol of a batter and plug.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will show you how much your battery is charged. If the white line is very low (near bottom or if you do not see any white at all in the battery symbol, then there is NO CHARGE (power) in the battery. &nbsp;Use your adapter, and allow your battery to charge
 (icon will be white when it is fully charged).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, you can remove the battery and have it tested (I've had this done where technicians work on computers, whether commercial or private business). The test will reveal the strength of the battery and whether you have to replace it or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They can also look at the back of your lap, where the battery sits normally, to see if any damage has been done to the parts that the battery connects to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long post, but I am trying to cover all the bases. &nbsp;If your lap shuts down when you are only using the battery, but stays on when you plug in the adapter and can play games for hours, I think you answered your own question, Jairus. It would
 definitely appear to be battery-related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps somewhat. Perhaps another will post more ideas. Two head are better than one lol so the adage goes. Cheers Jairus!</p>

            <p>Friend, Thank you so much for your quick response I really appreciate it. So yes My laptop battery charge normally to 100% when I'm using it with the adapter plugged in. I just let it that way I'm afraid to unplug my laptop because it will turn off unexpectedly.
 For now I have to get used to it (Using my laptop while charging) and I'm gonna save money for the repair lol&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Turtle Beach Earforce X12 makes continuous buzzing sound with stereo headset adapter&#47;xbox one controller</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the xbox one stereo headset adapter so that I could use my turtle beach earforce X12 headset on the xbox one. I checked the compatibility page and the earforce x12 was compatible with the stereo adapter. When my xbox one controller is plugged
 into the xbox one via usb cable (no batteries or battery pack) and my turtle beach headset is plugged into the controller (via the stereo headset adapter), I get a constant buzzing noise in the headset like there is interference or something. If I connect
 the controller to the xbox one without the usb cord (using battery power), there is no buzzing sound and the headset works fine. I just really don’t want to have to keep buying batteries and/or get a battery pack so I was hoping there is a way to power the
 controller with just a usb cable (no batteries/battery pack) that doesn’t involve plugging it into the xbox one system directly since this appears to cause some interference and the buzzing sound. The same thing would happen on my xbox 360, but all I had to
 do to fix it was plug the controller (using the plug and play cord only, no battery pack) into a usb outlet in the wall so that the headset and controller weren’t being powered off of the xbox 360 (I also tried plugging the headset into a usb outlet and leaving
 the controller plugged into the xbox but I still had the buzzing noise if I did it that way). If I try this method on the xbox one, the contoller won’t power on when plugged into a usb wall outlet. Is there any way to get the controller to power on when it
 is plugged into a usb wall outlet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here is what I did to hook the headset up to the xbox one in the first place:</p>
<p>I hooked up the stereo headset adapter and updated my xbox one controller. I then used the following instructions to hook up my turtle beach headset:</p>
<p>1. hooked the stereo adapter into the controller,</p>
<p>2. attached the 2.5mm-3.5mm cord adapter into the stereo adapter,</p>
<p>3. plugged my turtle beach headset cord into the 2.5mm-3.5mm cord adapter,</p>
<p>4. plugged the audio cord on the headset into the audio out on the monitor,</p>
<p>5. plugged the headset usb power cord into the xbox.</p>
