    <title>How to get Excel VBA to show current variable value in Debug&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coffent3  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get Excel VBA to show current variable value in Debug&#63;</h2>
                    Normally when I run an Excel VBA program in debug mode and hover the mouse over a variable, it shows its current value.&nbsp; For some reason this has stopped working.&nbsp; I have both "Auto Quick Info" and "Auto Data Tips" checked in Options.&nbsp; If I right-click
 the variable and select "Add watch" I can see the value in the Watches window.&nbsp; But the hover method doesn't work.&nbsp; Any ideas why?<br />

            Thanks for the suggestion, Andreas.&nbsp; I found the cause of the problem.&nbsp; I'm using a third-party application that adds cross-hairs to the cursor.&nbsp; When I turned it off, the problem went away.&nbsp; I should have thought of that earlier, but I've had no problem
 using it in other applications, including both the Excel spreadsheet itself and Visual Basic 2013.&nbsp; The problem seems to be unique to VBA.

<h2>            Cleaning Out All Gmail Accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually had one question, but two. The first is that I have a @gmail.com under my outlook account avatar that I to get rid off. The second which has arisen logging in with my hotmail linked with my Xbox Live Gold profile, I have been directed to another
 gmail account profile. In fact I do not even recognize this profile name, but not to say I could have used this name way back and forgotten. I did have issues with my MS account being hacked, so it would make sense that I created a temporary Gmail account.
 The question now is, how can I clean my account of all Gmail references? Looked through the settings and can't find any info. Help appreciated.<br />

            <p>No no, I don't have a gmail account, that is what I meant by temporary. I need rid of the profile data within outlook, as I must have had to use a different email as a outlook security measure when my account was hacked, and consequently locked. There is
 no gmail account, or secondary email account linked to outlook now. Obviously some trace files or data, or whatever you want to call it, is &nbsp;needing to be cleaned out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply anyway,</p>

    <title>Taking an individual account offline in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> selfyjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taking an individual account offline in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    I have an Exchange account with my old college that is configured in Outlook. As I am no longer a student at this college the account is no longer active,so every time I start Outlook it prompts me that it can't log in to the account and needs a password.
 I have other accounts that I manage in Outlook and while I know that deleting the college account would fix my problem, I have quite a number of emails on the college account that I still need to access frequently, so is there a way of taking the student account
 offline so Outlook does not try and synchronise it, so that I can continue using the other accounts without disruption and have ready access to my old college emails?

            You should create a local PST and move the messages from the old college account to the local PST.&nbsp; Do this with Outlook offline.&nbsp; Once you're done you can then remove the old account and still have access to the data.

<h2>            Lumia 920 LTE</h2>
                    
<p>Is there any way to know the actual LTE bands of my lumia 920 phone?</p>
<p>I am not sure that the phone specifications shown on Nokia web site of the country where I purchased the phone are the same as those of the phone. There is no mention of LTE on the box. It only states GSM 850 900 1800 1900 and WCDMA 850 900 1900 2100. &nbsp;</p>

            check the RM number that is stated on one of the stickers of the box, or if it isn't there, then it is stated inside the phone when you remove the microSIM tray. There are two variants of the 920, both are described on this page here, for RM-820 and RM-821:

<h2>            Newest Update 16.13 removes collapse&#47;expand menu items</h2>
                    <p>MacBook Pro</p>
<p>Office 2016 for Mac</p>
<p>Outlook 16.13</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the latest release, the menus were updated so that the "arrange by" menu (which included expand/collapse) is no longer available. Instead you have to use the toolbar button. Now my custom app shortcut that I setup will no longer work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY?! Why, would you remove from the menu Office team? Seems like an oversight/error to me.....</p>

            Hello my name is Yohandi
<br />
<br />It is a pleasure to have your participation in the Microsoft Community
<br />
<br />I suggest you perform a Rollback of the Office applications 
<br />
<br />It is possible that this is due to the update of the version of word that you have installed, as of version 16.xx this incident has been experienced. I recommend you rollback to version 15.xx 
<br />
<br />How to go back to Office 2016 for Mac 15.xx versions from 16.xx

<br />
<br />if you want to perform the rollback for all Office applications before making the rollback it is advisable to make a backup of the information, here I attach a link with the step by step to be able to make the backup in Outlook for MAC.

</p><p>It looks like you're showing the "Arrange…" menu item in Excel…which I'm currently seeing in Excel on 16.13.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the question is about Outlook. Slight difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the "Arrange by…" menu item (used to be found under the "View" menu) back on the Insider/beta version of Outlook you have?</p>

            Thats some thing I used infrequently but agree its definitely gone. Probably part of the continuing loss of features in MAC office. I've got VBA features that have been lost since release 16 that are marked as faults for well over 14 months now. I don't
 think most of these will ever return. Best to find a alternative way of doing what you need unfortunately.

<p>Hi Kevin A Durr,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my research, Sort by replace Arrange by in the menu bar of Outlook for Mac 16.13.1.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e22c6e38-cdac-4edf-8fc4-16b2b4291b50?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e22c6e38-cdac-4edf-8fc4-16b2b4291b50?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>You can now find the Arrange by option under Organize tab. And you can also click on By:<span>……</span><span>
</span>to arrange your messages.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f5f5f83-b89b-4cc7-8ca0-163df81a1129?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f5f5f83-b89b-4cc7-8ca0-163df81a1129?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I totally understand your concern to bring this option back. I suggest you submit your ideas via the following link:</p>

3. Under RESET, tap Reset Excel.<br />
4. Slide to enable Delete Login Credentials.<br />

<h2>            Outlook email address showing up as numbers and letters instead of actual email address.</h2>
                    <p>I set up my bosses email address with Outlook but the address that I setup isn't his default address&nbsp; instead it is a garbled bunch of numbers and letters and I can't change it.&nbsp; I tried the advice shown by going into the account settings but the option
 to edit doesn't work.&nbsp; I believe I must have connected my account to my bosses by mistake.&nbsp; However, when he goes to email someone he has to pick his email address (the one I setup) each time from the "from" bar</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go to the account settings you see only the garbled email address and not the one I set up.&nbsp; When I am at my home office I see the garbled address and mine.&nbsp; By the garbled address it says Microsoft Exchange and by mine I see Exchange ActiveSync.&nbsp;
 How can I get rid of the garbled email address and have his actual email address as the default?</p>
<p>

                    How can I forward unanswered calls to another Skype account AND THEN to voicemail if there is no answer on either?<br />
<br />
It seems that this is another useful feature that has been removed from Skype. Is there a way to do this nowadays? If not, will this feature be brought back?<br />
<br />
Also, any chance you all will allow users to make custom voicemail greetings again?<br />
Thanks

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2007 Trial Activation Key</h2>
                    It seems that&nbsp;I require some help&nbsp;aquiring&nbsp;the 60 day&nbsp;trial Activation Key for a preloaded version of Microsoft Office 2007. No documention came with the new computer for this activation. The notebook is an Asus and they say to contact Microsoft. After
 reading through some of the other questions posted on this forum, I get the impression that I am not alone in this. That said, the responses to the forums I did read were as useless to me as there were to the people who originally posted them. Accordingly
 there is supposed to be a free 60 day trial period for the Microsoft Office Suite, but this support team doesn"t seem to understand this.

    <title>Leaving from conversation is bugged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Leaving from conversation is bugged</h2>
                    <p>Skype has a feature of leaving group conversations, which seems to be easy to use with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>But in my opinion it has a crucial bug, which in particular situations negates that feature totally.<br />
The thing that negates leaving feature, is that anybody who stays in group conversation, have an ability to re-add you in the chat after you left. So to leave a group chat is not up to you, but also everybody who is in it. Maybe there are some ways to avoid
 that situation, but option to leave a chat is definitely is not very well thought through, and is implemented poorly, since anybody can "reject" your leave.</p>
<p>Are there ways to leave group chats without having such problems, or should it be fixed in later Skype versions?</p>

<h2>            Daily Task List - partial completion of task</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd be grateful if anyone can help me with this issue:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to start using the Daily Task List for a couple of sales people to focus them on what activities they are doing, and to maintain a historic record of what they've actually done.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem I'm having is, if they partially complete a task one day, I want to leave the fact that they did work on it on the day they partially completed it, but apply the task to another Daily Task List also to allow them to complete the balance another
 day, rather than them move the entire task to another day (which will ultimately be the day when 100% task completion is achieved) which would leave no historic record of what they worked on on a given day in the past.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is that possible?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It would be great if it is, as it'd be a simple way of maintaining a history of their activities without use of an additional spreadsheet or some such thing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for any help you are able to give,</div>
<div><br />
</div>

    <title>Office Outlook 2016&#58; Default Save Location for Email Attachments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m von zedtwitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Outlook 2016&#58; Default Save Location for Email Attachments</h2>
                    <p>When I want to save an attachment, my outlook (Windows 10, 365, Outlook 2016, desktop/laptop) always kicks me into the default directory "This PC &gt; Documents".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is utterly annoying as I don't use this folder at all, and I then need to browse around until I find even just the Desktop. I have not been able to find a simple feature where I could reset the default file/attachment save location to e.g. "Desktop".
 All online searches, including this forum, deal with Outlook 2013 or earlier, or with Outlook.com. I remember from my earlier Outlook that it was a simple procedure, and I hope MS didn't kill this functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody here who can help? Maybe I'm just not seeing the obvious...</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Max</p>

            <p>Hi Prabhavathi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your help. The Support link above doesn't explain how to set a default save-file location. By default save-file, I mean a location in the file system, e.g. "Desktop" or "C:\" or "Desktop\MyAttachments" or really any folder where I want the attachments
 to be saved BY DEFAULT when I click on "Save Attachments" in the email message in Outlook. Usually (although the frequency varies -- as so often, the incident is not as predictably repeatable as one might wish), my default save-file location is "This PC \
 Documents". I either need to manually change it to "Desktop", or I save it in "Documents" and then need to move it manually from that folder onto the Desktop view or my eventual folder destination. This all takes extra time and clicks, which I like to minimize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to force set a default location?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards, Max</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can hook you up, if you haven't found out already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to find this registry key using regedit: (*don't worry video below* if you have never done this, but don't touch anything else in there!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Options</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new string value called DefaultPath</p>
<p>
</p><p>enter the path to your folder and refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dude in this video will show you how it's done for Outlook 2013. Just go to the 16.0 key, not the 15.0 key like he does in the video.</p>

            <p>Thanks KenovaOne! It never ceases to amaze me how: 1) So many useful functions and options that Microsoft users value and rely on are killed when new versions come out. 2) How Microsoft support staff are completely unprepared to deal with the inevitable
 complaints and protestations that result. 3) How when said complaints arise in these forums, 9 times out of 10 the support staff do not understand the issue 4) The solution is almost always supplied by a fellow user who has found some work around to restore
 the functionality that Microsoft has killed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate if the Microsoft response was something along the lines of "oh yeah, we got rid of that functionality. It was a really hard choice, but it allowed us to do X instead. Here is a workaround we prepared in anticipation that some users
 would need it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, a boy can dream...</p>

            <p>I'm glad it helped, Max. I'm guessing Microsoft Support staff are warned against offering registry adjustments. That said, registry tweaks can make a PC a truly custom experience. Something not available to Mac users. And yes, anticipation of complaints
 with explanations would be a bonus! It would be an easy data crawl through these forums to have their support team adequately prepped with solutions.</p>

<h2>            Warning on renewing Office 365 contracts - don&#39;t until current contract expires</h2>
                    
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Warning about Microsoft stance on users renewing upgrading packages.</p>
<p>I just renewed my Office 365 Business Premium account with Microsoft.&nbsp;My old package has been discontinued so I had to upgrade to a new package on renewal, which actually expired 3 weeks from now. Since MS had been emailing me for a couple of weeks pushing
 me to renew early, I decided to do it today. After the renew was processed, I found that the new contract started from today's date (rather than when my original&nbsp;contract expired in 3 weeks).</p>
<p>A little surprised, I called MS Support to&nbsp;check and they told me that this is normal by default, but since I called in they would arrange a manual refund for the&nbsp;3 weeks I had lost….</p>
<p>I'm getting the refund, so this post isn't for me. It’s just to warns others not to&nbsp;renew/upgrade packages until the current one expires.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I am truly appalled that&nbsp;MS would resort to such underhanded ways of steal additional revenue from its customers!</p>

<h2>            That&#39;s NOT an event, so why are you suggesting I make it a calendar entry&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, First, I'm deeply disturbed that Outlook is "reading" my e-mail to then say "We think we've found an event."&nbsp; It feels like a real invasion of privacy without my consent that your programs are looking at the content of my emails.&nbsp; I didn't ask for
 that when I signed up and I don't think it is fair to have that invasion of privacy foisted upon me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I have already turned off Automatic Processing of Events from Email.&nbsp; This should either (1) also preclude the "we think we've found an event" feature; or (2) there should be an option to also turn off the "we think we've found an event" feature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, this feature is stupid (as in not competent).&nbsp; I mean, when you read the email, it's obviously NOT an event that would need to be calendar.&nbsp; It is my friend talking about her future dinner plans with her family, it starts with LOL, and she lives several
 states away.&nbsp; So, yeah, not a dinner I've been invited to and not one I'm attending.&nbsp; I wish I could tell you the sentence so you can see how utterly stupid it was to suggest that I calendar it, but I don't want to help your AI learn.&nbsp; I'd rather you allow
 me to turn your AI off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    I have been a loyal-hear me? LOYAL!-Zune customer ever since day one when it all started. I have had every Zune player to come out and I love my Zune HD 64GB player. I have been an ardent supporter of Microsoft Zune services and products because I BELIEVE
 in them and because they have offered superior music experiences for me and my family. I have fought the whole Apple music thing from day one because I just LOVE the Zune Pass and Marketplace. Microsoft messing up the Zune product with lame (or should I say
 ZERO) advertising and aggressive product development plus the whole Xbox thing has screwed everything up for Zune. Poor implementation. Like the Kin...another great product that shouldn't have died so awfully. I have used Zune Software (latest version right
 now) on my computer for YEARS without a much of a hitch. I have had a Zune Pass account for YEARS without much of a hitch. Today is the last day of this 30-day period in which I can use Zune song credits or I'll lose them. Howeve

            <p>So I can see there's a ton of stuff going on here. First off, nothing with your Zune Pass changes with any of the transitions. It is all honky dory and working fine. I know, because I have a legacy Pass. The emails that we do get can be confusing, but support
 can usually clarify any questions that you have. </p>
<p>~ </p>
<p>The issue you mentioned, buried in that hard to decipher wall o' text, is actually a small bug going on right now. In almost every case it's easy to fix. You can use this option to chat with support: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#2:3:1 (chat is
 the only option actually available, but there are people 24/7). The fix, as far as I've found, for the "no subscription" or whatever,&nbsp;is simply to forget the account (Switch User Forget your login data restart Zune) and manually sign in. You might have to
 do some simple cache clearing (clear IE data/browsing history since the program uses it to store data and delete the Temp files from %Temp%).
</p>
<p>On that note, it's probably directing you to purchase, instead of download, because it's not registering the account correctly. The above troubleshooting should fix that. Another way to check that your account is working fine is to sign in and stream from
 music.xbox.com. If it's broke there, something more problematic is going on. </p>
<p>~ </p>
<p>On another point, you mentioned the promotional points for the change to Zune to Xbox Music and loyal members. Those were promotional points, which means they expire, but they definitely are not clear on the when. A good rule of thumb on anything promotional
 is try to use them within the 6 month or year mile markers. It's an annoying quirk of the Microsoft billing system, but it is consistent across all the platforms that used Points. I've lost a couple thousand Points myself from not paying it too close of attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;~ </p>
<p>One last thing, the credits are not based on your local time zone. It's actually based on the Universal dateline to keep things consistent. Since you made a point of reaching out to support (even if on the forums and not the chat) and you did lose the credits,
 they might be able to do something about it. I've chatted in - they can be nice people.

            <p>Yeah, well that didn't work.&nbsp; I reset my password and so on.&nbsp; Cleared my cache.&nbsp; Cleared all of Internet Explorer history and cache, etc.&nbsp; Forgot my login in in the Zune software.&nbsp; Restarted the software.&nbsp; All in the order you suggested.&nbsp; Logged in fine.&nbsp;
 Don't see the "no Zune account for this Windows Live ID" error but when I go to attempt to use my song credits, I get "unknown error".&nbsp;&nbsp;Did go to Xbox music online and logged in&nbsp;plus was able to stream music without a problem.&nbsp; I still get "an unknown error
 occurred" when attempting to buy tracks using my&nbsp;song credits.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other available albums and tracks require me to buy instead of download.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The promotional points that disappeared did NOT happen six months later.&nbsp; It was less than a month.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and chat isn't available.&nbsp; I clicked on that support link and all I got were two options:&nbsp; forums and twitter support.&nbsp; So much for the 24/7&nbsp; people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What a joke.&nbsp; So much for downloading and enjoying music according to the TERMS OF MY CONTRACT. Plus&nbsp;I'm going to lose this month's worth of song credits,&nbsp; All&nbsp;because MS can't get its stuff together.</p>

            <p>You have a month to redeem your credits, if you wait until the last minute to use them that's your fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chat support is available 24/7, but occasionally there's a technical issue that causes a lapse, it happens, I've worked at a call center where the phones died for 5 minutes for the entire center.&nbsp; If you tried more than once and it was showing as busy
 all the time then the problem is likely on your end, I would suggest trying a different browser or computer.</p>

            <p>Hello mtnmedic:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum and for your feedback.&nbsp; We are disappointed to hear you have had such a bad experience recently and hope that between this forum and chat you can get this resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to start by addressing the issue using credits.&nbsp; At this time you should have a new batch of credits to attempt to use.&nbsp; If you get this error when trying to use credits there are two things I have see work for others and on my own account.&nbsp; One is
 to make sure you are attempting purchases of individual songs and not of full albums.&nbsp; The other thing I have seen help this issue is to try the purchase multiple times.&nbsp; From my personal experience, I will sometimes get this error on my first 2+ attempts
 but the credit typically is taken and the song is downloaded within a few more tries.&nbsp; We understand this is not the best work around but it should allow you to use your credits.&nbsp; I will also be sure that this issue is brought to the attention of our engineers
 so more permanent solutions can be developed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I want to address&nbsp;your concern about the credits you had an issue using.&nbsp; At this time the credits would have expired.&nbsp; It does seem clear you have made an attempt to use the credits and seek assistance with a technical issue that arose.&nbsp; With that
 said we do suggest you try contacting support one more time.&nbsp; As mentioned, chat is available 24/7 and should be available via the link provided.&nbsp; If you continue to have issue getting the chat option, please try another browser or computer.&nbsp; I have copied
 and pasted the link provided earlier and I do see the chat option.&nbsp; As one other way to get to chat you can try the following
<a href="https://support.live.com/default.aspx?productKey=oepzunechat&amp;locale=en-us&amp;st=1&amp;wfxredirect=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
portal.</a>&nbsp; This is Windows Phone support but you will have the option for Xbox Music and they will be able to assist.&nbsp; After selecting Xbox Music from the drop down, click the contact us button and you will see the 24 hour chat support option.&nbsp; They are great
 and will do all they can to help you with the credits you could not use as well as help figure out what happened with the points that look to have disappeared.&nbsp; You may want to have a link to this forum post available to further show you attempted to address
 this immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again we appreciate your patronage and hope that this unfortunate string of events can be resolved and put behind us.&nbsp; If you have any other questions or concerns, come back anytime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

            <p>Unbelievably, I'm getting "unknown error" every time I try to claim my 10 song credits.&nbsp; I pay $14.99 every month.&nbsp; This is the third month in a ROW that I haven't been able to claim my credits because of this "unknown error".&nbsp; I don't have the TIME to sit
 here on the phone and at the computer for hours trying to figure out something that MICROSOFT couldn't sort out in the first place.&nbsp; Every stinking time I deal with a problem having to do with Microsoft products I am stuck on the phone with support and at
 the computer for 1-3 hours.&nbsp; Ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm properly signed in.&nbsp; The Zune HD is properly signed in.&nbsp; Internet Explorer works and no problems with it( believe it or not, IE DOES affect Zune, though it SHOULDN'T), etc.&nbsp; I get it that some albums just can't be purchased anymore but when I select
 tracks and the system calculates the total and moves forward for download to apply the credits, I suddenly get "unknown error" and it doesn't go through with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a fix not a run-around.</p>

</p><p>When you get the Unknown Error, is there an error code provided with that?&nbsp; Without an error code we'll be flying a bit blind with where to start.&nbsp; Even though the error itself says Unknown, there's usually a code that gets us pointed in the right direction

            <p>My first thought is that its a connection related issue.&nbsp; If possible, it's worth trying on a different network connection.&nbsp; If not possible, a 5 minute full restart of your network is something to try as well; basically, just unplug your router and modem
 for 5 minutes and then plug them back in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to try that could resolve this, would be to run our Security Component Upgrade.&nbsp; This needs to be opened in Internet Explorer:</p>
<p><a href="http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp?force=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp?force=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Upgrade button is greyed out, add the full URL as a protected site in Internet Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't resolve the issue, I recommend getting in touch with one of our chat support agents to take a look at your account and subscription to make sure there's nothing going on from that end of things:</p>

            <p>Okay apparently I can get it to work now (or maybe it was already working) but still when I attempt to use my song credits on one or two albums I still get the "unknown error".&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I know a couple of albums/several songs&nbsp;from this same artist return an
 error stating "unavailable for purchase" when I attempt to claim my credits on them. However, this "unknown error" appearing with one or two albums from the same artist.&nbsp; You would think that if they weren't available for purchase it'd say so as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed recently that a Peter Gabriel album I downloaded (not purchased) months ago suddenly has 10 out of 11 tracks that come with error messages:&nbsp; "Can't sync...need to check usage rights...sign in to Zune with account used to purchase item...C00D1365"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought perhaps to delete these tracks and re-download them from Zune Marketplace (or whatever you call it these days).&nbsp; So when I go to delete one of the tracks I get a warning that there is a duplicate not seen in the album list and I am recommended
 to go to the songs list and delete the flagged duplicates. There are no duplicates.&nbsp; So I deleted just one song and then went back to the album in the Marketplace and while it showed the others as "in collection", the one I deleted is "not available".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, ever since Microsoft botched Zune and then killed it by moving to Xbox Music, etc. this really has been a messy experience for me.&nbsp; I'm now finding a LOT of albums I can't purchase with my credits (many saying "unavailable for purchase") as I used
 to do.&nbsp; It's really a crapshoot.&nbsp; I find the whole thing frustrating and I feel, as a LOYAL Zune customer for MANY years, a bit disenfranchised, especially now that I can't actually BUY new music through the Zune software because now I have to have Windows
 8 devices.&nbsp; My Dell XPS One A2010 is by far the nicest computer I've ever owned and it's been extremely reliable for me.&nbsp; It's a Vista device I upgraded to Windows 7 and I see myself using it a long time still.&nbsp; I have zero desire to move to Windows 8.&nbsp; I
 dislike it a great deal (yes I've played with it on someone else's computer).&nbsp; Windows 7, to me, is the best OS you folks came out with since XP, including Windows 8.&nbsp; Because I have no Windows 8 devices and don't plan on getting any in the near future and
 Windows 7 just works, I am unable to make any new music purchases.&nbsp; Disappointing.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 1020, camera stop working after WP 8.1 update &#40;Cyan&#41;</h2>
                    Greetings, my Lumia 1020's camera no longer work after the 8.1 update. I've tried every kind of reset: soft reset, camera reset, hard reset, nothing works. I have the official update, this mean that I cannot downgrade to WP 8.0 I really need the camera
 because my job and studies depend of it. Please, tell me if there is something else that I could try, thanks in advance.

<p>Hello Maria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. I've tried to install other camera apps, but the phone does not recognize its camera. It acts like if there is no camera and, in order to download the app, I would need the camera feature. This is the information provided to
 me by the phone in relation to the camera. </p>

<p>I agree with you. My phone was working fine with the 8.0 as well, camera, apps, calls, data, everything with it was perfect. I update to Cyan, then the camera start crashing.. Should be some kind of&nbsp;software bug that&nbsp;needs to be fixed with priority because
 the&nbsp;software update 8.1 is affecting some phone features,&nbsp;the camera in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Same here with 1020. After black update my microphone worked intermittently. Then 8.1 killed that and my camera. I bought this phone for the camera, though not as great as I thought it would be. Figured cyan update would fix the problem as it seems more
 of a firmware issue. Guess ill just have to wait and see, won't be going out to buy a new phone anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update for more technical information:</p>
<p>I installed flashlightX to see if there was a way around to communicate with the camera at all. The app came up without crashing, but the camera light won't turn on. Can't turn button from red to green unless I hit the SOS button, but still nothing. Maybe
 denim will have the fix?</p>

<p>This is what bothers me from them, seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to recognize that the 8.1 software update is <strong>not working correctly</strong> with every phone, several phones are facing problems with this update and

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just cannot understand why they are taking so long, this problem is roaring for months, since the users were facing it when they downloaded the preview version of the update. Microsoft,&nbsp;please, understand,&nbsp;this is a market, we are clients, we have the

            Hi Folks,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I’m going write a few comments about my experiences with this issue, and hopefully they’ll be helpful to others.<br />
<br />
I also tried installing the 8.1 update onto my Nokia Lumia 1020, and thought everything went well until I tried using the camera a few hours later. Needless to say it didn’t work, and it continued to not work in spite of ever trouble shooting effort I could
 think of... (which basically included... Running every app that’s associated with the camera, reinstalling the main camera apps, resetting the phone (multiple times... with both soft and hard resets), and also applying the proper levels of determination, and
 stubbornness just for extra measure.<br />
<br />
And, Nothing worked... so I took matters directly to the technical support folks at Nokia, AT&amp;T, and Microsoft (via the Microsoft Store where I originally bought my phone).<br />
<br />
From the best that I can tell... it’s posible that the origins of this problem reside in an incomplete update being installed onto the phone. I did my update over a Wi-Fi connection, and in doing so, there might have been a drop-off during the download of the
 update files. And it might be possible that the files associated with the camera didn’t fully install. (but more on this later).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, and I don’t why things work this way,... but apparently it’s not possible to roll back to the previous version of the OS, having once already updated to a higher number... Additionally, it’s also not possible to re-format the phone’s drive and
 attempt a fresh install of the 8.1 OS. All of the reset efforts just revert back to the original flawed update attempt, and the same problem with the camera gets pushed onto every reset outcome. It’s as if the reset isn’t so much of a new install attempt,
 as it is going back to a restore point of the original problem (which I hope makes sense to people, with how I’m trying to describe this).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I basically had a phone which is still under warranty, and after working with tech support folks from each of the three companies involved with my phone – I had three different possibilities for a fix.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
AT&amp;T would honor the original manufactures warrantee (but it might have been a with a reconditioned replacement) but in fairness to them I don’t know that for sure since I never went down to their service center to see what they really would in person (the
 reconditioned replacement was just a possibility that was discussed during my talks with tech support – they might have swapped it out for a new one).<br />
<br />
Nokia, was going to replace it with a New model, but I’d have to mail in my phone to them. &nbsp;And that would require having to wait for shipping in both directions, in addition to the trouble–shooting work done by their service center.<br />
<br />
Microsoft, originally told me that I needed to send my phone into Nokia, since Nokia handles original warranty claims, but when I returned for a second visit into the Microsoft Store they kindly swapped it out for me (making an exception to the rule).<br />
<br />
– –&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At this point I had a new phone which had the Windows Phone 8.0 OS on it, and I was nervous to attempt another install of the 8.1 OS (for all the obvious reasons). But I figured I’d go for it, and if things went wrong a second time I’d send the phone into Nokia,
 and let them update the OS on their end. . . they do have the ability to reformat the phone and do a fresh install of an OS (but this isn’t an option for either AT&amp;T, or the Microsoft Store).<br />
<br />
Luckily enough, the 2nd attempt went well, and I’m now using the 8.1 update on my Nokia 1020, without the broken Camera glitch.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think the reason why things work out better the 2nd time around is in how I attempted my update... I Didn’t use the Wi-Fi approach the 2nd time around. Instead I used the Desktop app put out by Nokia, which they call the ‘Nokia Software Recovery Tool’. It’s
 free, and downloadable from their website. . . and it has the ability to oversee the installation of an OS update.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
– –<br />
<br />
This is a tricky problem, I think... On the one hand if the problem lies in an incompatible OS update (entirely within the software realm), then I would have expected to get the same results on both of the phones I tried this on, given that they were both the
 exact same models.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However in achieving success the 2nd time around, I have to give credit to the premiss that maybe the original issue lies with trying to install an incomplete update via a Wi-Fi connection.<br />
<br />
Not knowing very much about the details of how cellphones work, especially the collaborations between the various companies, and who’s responsible for what. . . I can only really guess on this stuff.<br />
<br />
It is true that Microsoft creates the OS, but it’s also true that the other companies Nokia, and AT&amp;T, can make modifications upon it. The lines are blurry here, and I’m just glad that things worked out for me.<br />
<br />
_ _ _&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
fwiw, It goes without saying that folks should have a working phone and the great camera that comes along with the 1020... &nbsp;In terms of possible advice I might be able to hand out here, it’s going to have to come down to persistence, and not accepting the outcome
 of a broken camera from a failed OS update. At the very least a failed update attempt should be able to resolve backwards to the previous version. . . and if not, then I guess matters should be turned over to Nokia, as they may very well be to only folks in
 the position of being able to flash and reinstall the new 8.1 update directly onto the phone.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Otherwise Cell Phone Carriers may be able to swap out phones for replacements, and if so then hopefully nobody has to encounter a 2nd failed update attempt.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Consider using the... ‘<strong>Nokia Software Recovery Tool</strong>’ for the 2nd update attempt. It worked well for me, and I’m pretty sure that from now on I’ll be looking for a hard wire desktop to cell phone connection whenever an OS update is involved.<br />
<br />
There’s a little more to risk here, given the lack of options available for when things don’t work out... (not being able to roll back to previous versions,... or, reinstalling from fresh onto a reformatted cellphone...).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Take Care,<br />
<br />
Jim<br />

            <p>thank you for that, never thought that would be the case. But wouldn't it be possible for a software/firmware patch to be put out and installed onto phones with this issue that can seek out the corrupt code/data strings and restore the apps program with
 the full update for just that segment? Rather than the full 8.1 update? It seems like a pretty simple rollout fix for anyone with this issue, something a developer over at MS Nokia would be happy to pick up and become a hero to us high end phone users who
 have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought my phone unlocked and have it under a gophone account; the only option I have without going a hundred miles away to nearest MS Store is back to AT&amp;T which is fairly useless to me.</p>

            <p>Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your in-depth reporting of this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, too, am having the same&nbsp;problem with my 1020.</p>
<p>My situation was complicated by the fact that my original 1020 started overheating and was losing battery capacity. Unfortunately, you can't replace the battery, like I used to do with my previous Samsung Focus. Fortunately, my 1020 was still under warranty
 (by two months!).</p>
<p>I was able to get an exchange for my 1020, which had OS 8.0 installed. I was anxious to get&nbsp;Cyan , especially for the Cortana update!</p>
<p>I made sure that my phone was fully charged and I did an upgrade via Wi Fi and it all seemed to go well.</p>
<p>That is, until I started using the camera! Yup... NG! Now, I had over 100 apps installed, including many "lenses" and 3rd party camera apps, as well as all the Nokia camera apps that were available.</p>
<p>I, too, tried every reset possible, as well as uninstalling EVERY camera app except for the default camera, which couldn't be uninstalled. I even removed 30-40 other apps, just in case it was a memory problem.</p>
<p>Needless to say, nothing helped. When I press the camera button, I do see a very quick flash of the three circle icons at the bottom of the screen., two small circles and one larger circle on the right. for selecting still/video.</p>
<p>I am going to try your suggestion of using the Nokia Software Recovery Tool and pray that it works, as I am starting to get very close to my warranty expiration date!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for you excellent "forensics".</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>
