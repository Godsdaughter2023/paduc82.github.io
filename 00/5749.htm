<h2>            Excel conditional formatting if cell is percentage higher than another</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 columns within a pivot table both of monetary values, I wish to show where one becomes 5 &amp; 10% greater than another column. &nbsp;I preferably want to use traffic lights but would settle for fill colour change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;5% showing green</p>
<p>=&gt;5% showing amber</p>
<p>=&gt;10% showing red</p>

            <p>Easiest with colour fill. &nbsp;Select both columns of data, and use the formula option three with formulas like</p>
<p>
</p><p>Green fill</p>
<p>=$C5&lt;($B5*1.05)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amber fill</p>
<p>=AND($C5&gt;=($B5*1.05),$C5&lt;($B5*1.10))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Red fill</p>
<p>=$C5&gt;=($B5*1.10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>where 5 is the row with the first value, and you want to highlight columns B and C based on C being higher than B.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know this isn't new but I have followed the posts on the community etc and I cannot and do not resolve this issue. &nbsp;It starts as "We need need your credentials to sync some libraries" and then comes up with&nbsp;"The Server you are trying to access is using
 an authentication protocol not supported by this version of Office".</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 Pro (with service pack 1) and have office 16</p>
<p>Posts followed are&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/416513?ss=8e29d69b-0bb4-4344-a4c5-ce718c2ae0bb&amp;ss-src=quicksearch&nbsp;and</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/410059?pi14985=1</p>
<p>In these I cannot (on my PC)</p>
<p>1. Find Microsoft Office Subscription in control panel</p>
<p>2. I can't find (and not through lack of looking)</p>
<p>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\Spw</p>
<p>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\OfficeFileCache</p>
<p>Groove.exe is as follows</p>
<p>Version 16.0.6001.1034</p>
<p>Size 0 bytes</p>

<p>So basically the threads don't work for me so what is next?????</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Vaughan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. Please confirm the following information&nbsp;to help&nbsp;us&nbsp;troubleshoot&nbsp;the issue:<br />
1. If you have installed Office, you should be able to find the Office program in Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features.</p>
<p>2. Could you let us know which folder you cannot find? <br />
The folder "AppData" is invisible by default. Go to Control panel (large/small icons view)-&gt; Folder options-&gt; View-&gt; under Hidden files and folders, select Show hidden files, folders and drives.
<br />
Also modify the "username" field.<br />
If it is not the case, please let&nbsp;me know more detailed information about your situation for further help.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can share a related screenshot to help us better understand your situation.<br />

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>Ok got to the stage of deleting folders "spw" and "OfficeFileCache" and got stuck as system says that "The action can't be completed because the folder or a file in the folder is open in another program"</p>
<p>This occurs straight after a restart?</p>

<p>Hi Vaughan,</p>
<p>You can close the local sync folder, end all the Office processes in Task manager to have a try (you can find them in the Processes/Details tab: groove.exe, msouc.exe, msosync.exe).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since you are going to delete the two cache folders, you may try another way to completely clear cache: Use the fix it tool.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627</a>
<br />
Note: Both methods can cause data loss. To reduce this risk, read the article above before you start clearing cache.</p>
<p>Let me know if you need further help.</p>

<p>Finally got it to work. &nbsp;The fix it tool didn't work, left it running for 2 hours and no progress so cancelled it and then deleted the 2 folders. &nbsp;That worked this this and after resync it worked (created new folder)</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Lumia 535</h2>
                    <p><span>Looking for a phone?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would love you to lend me a few minutes to read my personal opinion of the new Microsoft Lumia 535. Some of us may pay attention to the details, but definitely most of us pay much more attention to the price and the benefits of a product may bring.
 Of course a review may not make sense if you do not have a point of comparison.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To make it more interesting, let's start from not so distant past. Nokia was the most loved phone manufacturer until few years after the birth of phone running in Google Android Operating System and eventually phones running in IOS.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is a fact.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both Android and IOS are doing pretty good in the market. Nokia's golden age ended not because they couldn’t offer more but because they sold Feature Phones which turned out to be as one of their fatal mistakes. Google saw
 it as an opportunity and created an operating system that would give the user's common demands. No one in good mental capacity would resort to buying different Nokia Phones just to use it on different occasions and using its different features.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is quite impractical and pricey. Nokia of course tried its best to keep the throne using Symbian OS but suffered a painful loss. Let’s try to highlight the Google Android OS.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is cheaper, it is practical because of all in one features and a lot of developers support it because of the growing demands. A typical business story. The law of supply and demand. Let’s go the operating system created by Apple, the IOS. IOS offers
 just a bit of improvements that an Android Phones can do. But the most important thing the IOS can offer is the Prestige by simply having it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is a status phone indeed. Having an Iphone is synonymous to having an Android Phone at more pricey tag. Now, it is time for us to go to our main topic.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Nokia acquired by the Technology Giant Microsoft.<span>&nbsp; </span>We all know that Microsoft, though not technically true, started the technology revolution.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is the company behind the operating system that runs most of the computers in the world. There is a big chance that Windows might be the operating system that you use on your PC or Laptop. And you might just not aware of it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, Microsoft managed the development of the newly improved and the first Lumia Phone bearing the Microsoft logo, The Microsoft Lumia 535. This phone simply got it all. Practicality, Affordability and the Prestige (do I need to elaborate how
 prestigious the maker is). A combination of Google Android and Iphone. It has 5inch QHD Screen, 5 Mega Pixel front and back camera that works pretty well. It has most of the apps that the 2 other operating systems can offer plus many more. It offers even more
 that its competitor doesn’t have.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is one of the few phones that can work with your home and office computers without a puss since Microsoft office is already embedded on it (most of the other phones are Nokia Lumia Phones). You can transfer
 your files to your phone and work on it while travelling your way to the office and trying to do some last minute editing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is directly compatible with your office computer 99% of the chance. What's more? It offers 128 GB SD storage capacity that is perfect for a students who loves to study while having fun. They can save and edit their homework on their phone while checking
 updates on social networking sites. Did I mention that its browser is super-fast? On top of that, it is pretty cheap.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I bought mine for only 5,990Php or around $140. The catch? So far I can’t name one that is not fixed yet as of this writing. Consider this as a gift from Microsoft or as one of their unique marketing strategies. It is hard for most of us to try something
 new especially if we are already comfortable using the not so old technology running in our phones. I will not name all the benefits the Microsoft Lumia 535 can offer because I only promise to take just a few minutes of your time. It might take hours for me
 to enumerate all of it. Of course, like any other phones, Microsoft Lumia 535 has its own Waterloo. It has a touch issue by the time it was launched. The downside was fixed a few days after. It is now a history.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That is how fast and serious Microsoft is when it comes to their commitment to offer the best value for your money. They even fixed the problem a few days before the promise date.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In addition to the touch issue, I noticed just a couple days ago that the built in Music Player hangs every now and then when it is connected to the earphone that came with the package. And guess what? I just have downloaded the Fix when i tried to update
 it an hour ago. That is indeed an excellent customer service commitment. Fixing the problem on their own and without waiting for your complaints. Let’s admit it. All phone are not perfect. This is also true to Microsoft Lumia 535. None is. Even the Non-Windows
 8.1 phone that you may have or using right now. The point is, how committed the manufacturer is?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Have you asked yourself, when was the last time I receive an update for the known issues of my phone? You probably couldn’t remember it or might have mistaken the updates for your downloaded games and application.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That is not the case. It won’t fix the issue of your phone. All in all, I would like to clarify how exciting the Microsoft Lumia 535 is. It the most insanely low price phone coming from Microsoft. No, they are not struggling financially.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The phone is not a bargain. So grab the opportunity. This will not happen twice. Upcoming phones will be pricey.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That is also a fact.<span>&nbsp; </span>That is how businesses work.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I am not paid in any form when created this comment, though I would love it. LOL</span></p>

            I have read your post and totally agree with you. Your opinion is very well explained and confirmed that I made the right choice, thank you. I have just bought the new Microsoft Lumia 535 and love it. I am in Portugal where the cost was 149,90€. Fantastic
 value for money! &nbsp;I miss two features and hope that Microsoft will create apps for them. I'm sure they can if they wish, my friends have other brands of smartphones and have both apps. So... One is Silverlight [for Iris Online} which enables me to watch tv
 anywhere. The other is Nos Telefone, which enables me to use my fixed line home phone anywhere. I have both apps in my iPod, downloaded from the Apple Store, but when I travel I have to carry both, because the iPod is not a mobile phone. It would be so much
 more convenient if these apps were made available for Lumia 535! It would make an almost perfect smartphone really PERFECT!

            <p>Hello. Could you tell me if it is possible to print straight from this phone via wifi. I'm considering buying two of these phones for my teenage children so they can do their homework (PowerPoint). They often have to print off a hard copy to hand in for
 marking. &nbsp;We have a HP ENVY 4500 smartphone/tablet printer. &nbsp;It was not possible to print from our previous lumia 520 phone so I wondered if printing is now possible with the new model (535). Also it would be helpful to be able to print photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any advice you could give me would be gratefully received. Thank you.</p>

            Hi DaleVardy,<br />
<br />
Based on the desciption, issue is most likely to lie with client side.<br />
<br />
Please clear all browser cache/cookies to check this issue.<br />
<br />
When you say “<em>Just a problem with this PC</em>” ,do you mean that using with different PC Outlook Web Access works fine?<br />
<br />
Moreover, you may try to check this issue via using InPrivate browsing session in Edge or a Private window in Firefox or Incognito Chrome browser to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<p>I am running Office 2007 on Win 7 Ultimate and it keeps crashing on me. Everytime I go to close an office application it crashes and today I ran the diagnostic tool. When it was completed the diagnostic told me it couldn't find a proble and directed me to
 go to<strong> watson392.watson.microsoft.com</strong> .</p>
<p>I'm running FireFox at the moment and it threw up a warning telling me this was an untrusted site.</p>
<p>I had Office 2010 Beta running for a while and uninstalled so I'm not sure if that could have caused a problem but as I say the diagnostic tool says it can find no reason for office crashing on my system.</p>
<p>I'd be grateful for any ideas, I'd rather not have to wipe and reload the machine.</p>

<p>I'm using windows xp pro and office 2007. I keep having problems with word and excel&nbsp; crashing on me. Today after Word crashed the system came back and asked if I wanted to run diagnostics, which I let it to. It supposedly finished that process with no results,
 then tried to connect me to the watson32 site.</p>

<p><span><span>I am experiencing the same problem described above, particularly similar to that described by sashanik.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Problem Description: I ran MS Office Diagnostics (MS<span>Diag</span>) because Word 2007 Standard has been very unstable (see "Description
 of MS Word Problem" below). MS<span>Diag</span> runs successfully and my computer passes all diagnostic tests. When I click on "Continue" I see a dialog box labeled "Attempting to get next steps online". Progress bar goes halfway and
 stops moving after about 20 seconds. An Internet Explorer <span>
8 </span>window opens with what I think is a Windows Defender warning (red shield with white X) stating "There is a problem with this website's security certificate. The security certificate presented by this website has expired or is not yet valid. The security
 certificate presented by this website was issued for a different website's address." The website link on the Explorer navigation bar is https://watson392.watson.microsoft.com/dw/CwRedir.asp?V=12.0.6425.1000&amp;LN=en-US&amp;DRes=9.4.1.0&amp;DRes=7.4.1.0&amp;DRes=8.3.1.2&amp;DRes=2.4.1.0&amp;DRes=6.4.1.0&amp;DRes=1.4.1.0&amp;TRes=1&amp;UID=395b318e-e7b1-4266-87b6-8f799918925be2bd9bc7-5568-45a0-837b-1443b032b0cd&amp;enval=76830-902-6482701-65978&amp;RCUsed=0<br />
<br />
My security software is Norton 360 Premier. All system scans are clear (no viruses reported or fixed, system status is good). My Norton license is active, scans are automatic.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I have a valid copy of Microsoft Office, which I confirmed using the online validation link from Microsoft.</span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>Today I ran the "Guided Help" from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541 , which is supposed to address Word instability problems. The program ran successfully, but when I ran MSDiag the
 website security certificate problem happened again.<br />
<br />
I am writing because I am concerned that the MSD<span>iag</span> website certificate problem may be a sympton of a virus or malware. Even if this is not the case, I need to have MSD<span>iag</span> function properly.<br />
<br />
Thank you for you assistance.<br />
<br />

Description of MS Word Problem: MS Word 2007 Standard has been very unstable for past month or so (multiple error reports sent to MS). It seems to crash soon after I have more than one file open, particularly when I try to "Save As" a file (and maybe when I
 save a new file from a blank Document#). Symptom is that Word hangs, the hourglass icon appears and Windows Task Manager shows Word as "Not Responding". At this point, one of two things happens: sometimes a dialog box appears stating that Word has "terminated
 unexpectedly" and asking if I want to send an error report (I have done so, several times). The other result is that I terminate Word using "end task" in Windows Task Manager.<br />
<br />
This has happened frequently enough that sometimes when I start my computer a dialog box appears, stating that my computer appears to be crashing frequently and asking me to send an error report to Microsoft. This happened when I rebooted this morning following
 a crash and I sent the error reports to Microsoft.<br />

<p>Similar problem here. &nbsp;Running XP Pro, Office 2007 and have had similar experiences as the others. &nbsp;Every time I boot my machine, it gives me an error popup that explains Word or Excel had to shut down (wasn't running yet!) but then launches one or the other.
 &nbsp;Today I received the following:</p>
<p>https://watson392.watson.microsoft.com/dw/CwRedir.asp?V=12.0.6425.1000&amp;LN=en-US&amp;DRes=9.4.1.0&amp;DRes=7.4.1.0&amp;DRes=8.3.1.2&amp;DRes=2.4.1.0&amp;DRes=6.4.1.0&amp;DRes=1.4.0.0&amp;TRes=1&amp;UID=94ff4933-6aee-45d4-9e7a-f29fc2f6ff8fdbaf4877-08f3-4011-b9e4-a8a74c0c8419&amp;RCUsed=0</p>
<p>Not seeing a whole lot of input or response from MS on this yet. &nbsp;Hmmmmmmmm..........</p>

<p>This problem was first reported 41 days ago and now 10 people are waiting for a resolution. More importantly, over 1,000 people have viewed this topic, which suggests that there are a lot of users who are experiencing this problem.</p>
<p>My computer remains very unstable (two Word crashes today alone) and the Microsoft Diagnostics repair function continues to point me to a website with an invalid security certificate.</p>
<p>Microsoft Support - how do we escalate this problem???</p>

<h2>            Old Win 8.1 installation lost after installing Build 10049</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>After I upgraded to build 10041, in order to save space, I moved the Windows.old folder to another drive. However I was not able to move it completely. Only a few files got moved.</p>
<p>Now when I upgraded to build 10049, I forgot to put the moved files back. The upgrade stopped in between and it went into an infinite loop of trying to recover the old build. (This could be because of the missing files in Windows.old)</p>
<p>Using a bootable USB (of build 10041), I did a Reset of the OS and found that 10049 got successfully installed.</p>
<p>Now this was a clean install and not an upgrade (the reason being Project Spartan was pinned to the taskbar instead of Internet Explorer).</p>
<p>As a result, my previous installations (including that of a genuine Windows 8.1) were lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my question is when the Windows 10 RTM comes out, can I upgrade to it directly from the Technical Preview and will my upgraded OS be a genuine OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or do I have to reinstall Windows 8 first (since I have a Windows 8 key) and then upgrade to 8.1 and then upgrade to Windows 10.</p>

            <p><strong>Will I be able to upgrade from the Windows 10 Technical Preview to the final release?</strong></p>
<p>There is has been some debate regarding qualification for the final release of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/GabeAul/status/540579810880147457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Microsoft has noted the intention
</span></a>is to provide a direct upgrade path from the Preview to the final release. Of course, decisions can change. Recently, the company noted that
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-to-launch-this-summer-with-free-upgrades-for-pirated-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/18/us-microsoft-china-idUSKBN0ME06A20150318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>So, to be on the safe side, its best you ensure you have a valid genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 license installed in order to qualify for the final release.</p>

    <title>VBA to register a type library and add a reference - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimp46  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA to register a type library and add a reference</h2>
                    <p>I have an accdb application with multiple users. There is a reference to a type library.For some users the library has not registered. This generates an error on startup that there is a missing/broken reference. I already have code that registers the library
 and adds a reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to run the code before an error is generated? Is the solution to package the accdb without the reference and somehow trap for an error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I may have found a solution in the meantime (it appears to work but don't know if it is the best solution )</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ship the application without the type library registered</p>
<p>2. During the startup routine, run the following.code</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Set refs = Application.References<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Set ref = refs("MyTypeLibrary")</p>
<p>3. If the reference is missing, then an error is generated, and run the code to register the library and set the reference</p>
<p />

            <p>Note that one issue with this sort of process is that the very fact that you are missing a reference could cause your app to NOT run VBA correctly (or at all). While it may very well work in most cases, if you're deploying this to a lot of people you might
 find that you issues with the method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO, the right way to do this is to package you application with all needed dependent objects, and use a Windows Installer to handle the installation needs. Any decent installer will be able to determine if the target environment contains the necessary prerequisites
 and advise the user on what to do from there. InnoSetup is free and widely used, and has a very robust support community. I don't use it any longer - I use InstallMate now, which gives me a few more features that I like, plus it's fairly cheap at @100 for
 a small office license - but when I did i found it to be more than capable of handling Access deployments.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 is set to automatically recalculate, but its not doing it.</h2>
                    <p>I found a Microsoft blurb saying to shut down the file and re-open it to get your fields recalculated. That does work, but does
</p>
<p>anybody at Microsoft realized how retarded a "solution" this is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>DETAILS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm the only user of my excel files</p>
<p>- I don't load any files from the internet, I don't share files with anyone.</p>
<p>- I have simple, one directional links from one file one other file.</p>
<p>- the links in file 2 are merely pulling the result of a few fields with simple mathematical formulae in file 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've set everything to automatic from the Office tool and in Excel's own options.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now if I change some numbers in file 1 and the results of the formulae in file 1 change accordingly, the fields in file 2 do not update.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have NEVER had a problem with this in Office 2003, 2007, 2010 or 2013...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just a buggy mess or is Microsoft just disrupting people's work to increase the generation of Fnords?</p>

<h2>            Outlook IOS app, Adding Calendars from office365</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do I add a calendar from office365 to my outlook IOS app?</p>

<p>In Office 365 admin -&gt; exchange admin -&gt; I create a room resource mailbox. Just giving it a name and mailaddress.</p>
<p>In my desktop outlook client I righclick my calendar -&gt; add calendar -&gt; from room list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is the calendar now added to "my account"?</p>
<p>So when I use different mail apps, like Outlook IOS, and use my office365 credentials, will all the calendars under "My calendars" show upp in the app?</p>

<p>Maybe I've done something wrong but the only calendar showing up in outlook IOS is my default calendar, no other calendar I have added from my desktop client outlook.</p>
<p>Can somebody help with this?<br />
<br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>Yes. Officially, adding shared calendars is not supported at this moment, but I have seen some users&nbsp;being able to sync one calendar just like you. But it's not feasible to add other shared calendars into the Outlook for IOS app.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Lookup Column linked to wrong list in DIP - Relink lookup possible&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have a lookup column to a DocLib on the same site.</p>
<p>When you visit the DocProperties, you see the RIGHT values to choose from, it uses the RIGHT list. But when you goto the DIP (Office 2013, Excel 2013), it does not show these values. instead it shows all files in the current Doclibrary.</p>
<p>When you change the setting on the site, the 'changed value' is not saved.</p>
<p>So we cannot change it!!! Via DIP you cannot choose the right value. and via 'docproperties-page' your changes are not saved.</p>

<p>Is there a way to relink the lookup column to the right List?</p>

<p>Peter</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have reached the right forums. Let us try and fix this together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand, the desktop internet explorer opens when you open from Modern UI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like, you have pinned the desktop Internet Explorer to start. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us try the following steps to un-pin the desktop Internet Explorer from start, and pin the modern UI internet Explorer to start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1: </b>To un-pin the desktop Internet Explorer from start:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key to see modern screen</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Right click on the Internet Explorer icon and choose un-pin from Start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>To pin the modern UI internet Explorer to start:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows + Q keys to open Application charms
</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type Internet Explorer <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Right click on Internet Explorer from the search and select Pin to Start.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Now, try to open the internet Explorer from Modern UI Interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance, we will be happy to help you.</p>

            Still comes up in classic mode. &nbsp;I'd think it would have enough snap to realize I'm in 'modern' UI when it is called up and switch to that mode. &nbsp;

<div>BTW: Chrome can switch between modern and classic. &nbsp;</div>

<li>Open a new Visio blank Drawing.</li><li>Insert four Rectangles (Ctrl + 8)</li><li>Now try to arrange them vertically by:
<ol>
<li>Move the first rectangle to it's position</li><li>Take a second one and move it straight under the first one but hold the mouse button until the green arranging lines comes visible.</li><li>If I now drop it (release the mouse button) Visio crashes all the time.</li></ol>

<p class="contentStandard">What I've tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repaired the Visio Installation</li><li>Repaired the Office 2007 Enterprise Installation</li><li>Uninstalled Visio / Reinstalled Visio</li><li>Uninstalled Office and Visio / Reinstalled only Visio</li><li>Uninstalled all Office, Visio and all Office Runtimes / Reinstalled only Visio</li></ul>

            <p>Im not sure of the answer to OP 's question (but i too am seeing somewhat frequent crashes with Visio 2016 on win10 &nbsp;however i was seeing crashes about as frequently on visio 2013, &nbsp;so i think its just visio). &nbsp; &nbsp; I specifically see crashes when im loading
 or dealing with large Stencils sets consisting of many shapes (or even small ones, but crashes usually center around Stencils/shape usage/loading).</p>

</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- EMET is a&nbsp;additional&nbsp;application one can install (its from&nbsp;Microsoft) that provides extra security and protects against malware / viruses. &nbsp;Its very common in office / corporate settings,
 and suggested for all users to run (home users&nbsp;included). &nbsp;However if you have not downloaded and installed EMET (which i assume you&nbsp;haven't) than there is nothing for you to disable. &nbsp;(EMET is configured via settings you can enable/disable for specific apps)</span></span></p>

    <title>Locked out of Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarah.95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've been locked out of my Hotmail account for about three weeks now, I no longer have the phone number used for security (as I moved abroad), and the autorecovery form was not successful (I don't really send many emails, use skype that much etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted support via the online chat on two occasions for assistance; the first time I was told I need to complete the autorecovery form twice a day using the same answers and this would let me access my account, I was dubious as that doesn't seem
 very secure but did so anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing that, I eventually received an email stating the auto-recovery was unsuccessful and the only thing i could do would be to make a new account. I then contacted support again, they informed me that the only thing I could do is to continue to log
 the auto-recovery form (?). I then asked about the complaints process, as I would like to log a complaint, and I was linked to an FBI internet crime site to log my complaint (I find it hard to believe Microsoft has no internal complaints procedure?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite important that I get access to this account, I've been using it since I was about 16, it has multiple important emails saved to it, and it is my main point of contact for just about everything. I appreciate its for security and its my fault for
 not updating the telephone number when I moved to the UK, but it is not my fault I got locked out (apparently someone else tried to log into my account), and I don't think I should have to lose years worth of important data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my main questions are:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How can I regain access to my hotmail account? I can verify myself in multiple ways, I have ID, its my facebook login, I'm logging in from the laptop I've used for years etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, how can I log a complaint with Microsoft rather than the FBI?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, and help is much appreciated!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sarah.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi, how are you for posting in our microsoft community I'm here to help you solve your problem, friend I understand your concern and annoyance, really you feel with your hands tied and furious to lose something so valuable that has been had for years, you are not the only user who presents this problem, the form consists of several questions, generates an automated response , but you meet a high percentage of positive responses, the system will tell you that your account can not be restored and after some time it could be eliminated, I can suggest you start a case where your account was hacked and you need to recover it. There are different ways to communicate with Microsoft and expose your case.
<br />
<br />- Telephone support
<br />- Remote support
<br />- Virtual Agent
<br />- Live chat
<br />- Email
<br />- Safety equipment
<br />
<br />When they refer you to an FBI link they understand that your account was compromised so you can send an email notifying them. It is necessary because if your account was hacked any information of yours that is used to commit any crime could commit you, when you inform this to the authorities you are giving warning of what happened.
<br />
<br />I will leave the link where you will find the way to communicate with Microsoft

<p>I don't ever recall specifically checking the box in that link, I did have it set to remember my details on this laptop though, so I wouldn't need to enter the password each time I went to view my emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I don't think that's the same thing as a trusted device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said I have been using the same laptop for at least four years to log in, so surely that should assist in verifying I'm the account holder?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>to see how to install and use the various tools.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Using those tools, it is possible to perform the following types of merge that cannot be done with Mail Merge “out-of-the-box”:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Merge to e-mail messages either with or without attachments, with the documents created by the merge being sent as either Word or PDF attachments or as the body of the e-mail message.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Merge to individual documents in either Word or PDF format with the filenames being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many to One type merges, which can be used for creating documents such as invoices where there are multiple records in the data source that have common data in one of the fields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Merging to a document that will include a chart that is unique to each record in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Merging a document with Content Controls</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Merging a document that contains Legacy FormFields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duplex Merges</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Merging to a printer that will collate and staple the output created from each record in the data source.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letters type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message where relevant.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an Excel worksheet and that
 worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For the Chart Merge utility, see the Mail Merging with Charts document that is included in the Merge Tools Add-in Zip file for additional requirements for the data source for use with that utility</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row that are within the range
 of columns that contain the data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).

    <title>Using non-OEM chargers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using non-OEM chargers</h2>
                    
<p>What is the deal with chargers. Is Nokia purposely detecting that one is not using their OEM charger and making the phone charge slow?:cursing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got a Nokia Lumia 635 and when I plug it into the charger I have used with ALL my phones and my tablet (a surge protector with USB connectors specifically for charging) I get a slow charging message. If that is the case that is crap. 5V is 5V and
 as long as the charger provides the current (the OEM charger is 750ma and I have it on a 1A charger) needed there should be no issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You have it the wrong way around. Unless a charger specifically identifies itself as a fast charger the phone will assume it's a slow charging device. Have the exact same 'issue' with the Dell venue Pro which will not charge from my 13.000 mAh ANker batterypack/charger
 which has a 2A port but it will charge fine from the 750mA wall charger I have laying around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not really sure how a charger is a fast charger or is not. Seems to me it all comes down to 5V and the amout of charge current except ....:evil: Nokia has included logic in the charger to tell the phone when you are not using their charger. So still Nokia
 is playing games ...IMHO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the info.</p>

<p>No they don't, using a wall charger from, say HTC/Sony/Dell works fine. Also charging using a USB2 port on the PC is fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voltage has nothing to do with it, neither has the supported current really. Unless the charger itself identifies itself as 'fast' charger it will be seen as a slow one.</p>
