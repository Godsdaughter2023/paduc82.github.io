<h2>            Nokia Lumia Icon Reddish tint on screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I've read around there's an unfortunate issue with the screen, battery and body, where because of a firmware update from 8.1 to Denim (or in general from 8.0 to anywhere in 8.1) the screen is gathered a reddish/brown/purple tint only seen inside the Windows
 operati (because as I've seen myself, it does not appear on the NOKIA logo, or in the gears).</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is killing the AMOLED blacks saving battery on your phone, and somehow making the display yo heat the rest of the phone, and because of the aluminum body, making it hard to even hold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So bad I wasn't aware of this before buying the Icon, but don't get me wrong, I love the camera, I love the performance, and I most definitely love the phone itself, all of which forgives the lack of SD and Glance Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But ive seen a lot of people facing this issue, reporting theve managed to tweak as many things as they could and nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and Windows 10 v1607 hasn't obviously not solved it. So I've come down to my conclusions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a firmware problem, and I think it's a problem while updating to the 8.1, maybe if we could get our hands on the right Windows Phone 8.0 and First 8.1 GDR1 builds (and I really hope to, because is nearly impossible to find someone with said files,
 since the Nokia servers are down), we could then, update our Lumia Icon's straight to Windows 10 v1507, and so later to the 1607 or lastest Preview and skip the wrongly Denim calibration, which is also seen on the 930, shipping with WP8.1, which is causing
 our issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>since Microsoft/Verizon won't do a thing about this (because it's only a software/firmware problem and not hardware related) maybe we can do something about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if your a Nokia Lumia Icon user with the reddish tint sucking your AMOLEDs beauty, and&nbsp;you'd like to help, please comment an idea or if you can, please help me find the 8.0 Black and 8.1GDR1 update files for this Phone, so I can test it out with my Icon
 and make a guide, or if you're informed enough you could make up some sort of fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Im just tired of seeing people talking about it and crossing their arms with a deffective phone JUST because yes, because software and no that's not what we want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all anyway to read this thread, I hope we can find a solution, f it isn't that I've been living under a rock and such solution already exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note for the moderators: Please don't move this thread to anywhere else, as I believe I'm targeting those in, or out of the Insider program to seek a bigger audience of people with this same issue, regardless if they're using Windows 10, or 8.1).</p>

<p>that's because you're still installing a faulty rom. Whatever you download from that webpage will throw you the latest ROM for your phone, not the Factory made WP8.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>unless any of us manage to find said rom, I don't see we can fix this problem, sadly.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, it seems you have set up domain-based filtering. Please re-run the sync and check if you have selected all the domains that you want to sync to Office
 365. If no, please select the domains and then check if it syncs as usual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have selected all domains, we need to collect some information below to better understand the situation:</span></p>
<p><span>1. A screenshot about the filter setting page of your DirSync.</span></p>
<p><span>2. By saying “<em>I created mailbox under xyz.com</em>”, where did you create it? Your Exchange 2013 server?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Have you added the domains to the Active Directory following the steps in

<h2>            What do Microsoft need to do to pursuade us all to update to Windows 10 next year&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here we are in November 2014 using Windows 7 Professional SP1 quite happily and perfectly willing to continue to do so until 2020? Now Windows 8 (8.1) will have mainstream support until January 2018 and extended support until January 2023. Myself like many
 others here are using Windows 8.1 in one form or another now,&nbsp;but probably alongside Windows 7. Personally I like Windows 8.1, it has many new advantages over Windows 7 Pro; but it has not persuaded me to install it on my main PC.</p>
<p>But we are also using Windows 10TP now and early in 2015 we could be using Windows 10 Consumer Preview and come summer 2015 we could see the release of Windows 10 fully to the public?</p>
<p>If we have not fully taken up the offer of Windows 8.1 yet; what can Microsoft do to get us to convert our main PC's to the new Windows 10? Well I for one took full advantage of the pre-releases of Windows 7 &amp; 8 and bought a copy at reduced cost.</p>
<p>So<strong> IF </strong>Microsoft make this sort of offer again ( or better? ) with Windows 10 will it be enough to make us all ditch our tried &amp; tested Windows 7? Personally I am not sure yet.</p>
<p>Can they do more? If the tablet and mobile world is dominated by Android &amp; iOS can/should Microsoft attempt to make Windows 10 lean towards that side of the computer market? Or use the advantages of Windows 8.1 &amp; Windows 10 to lean towards loosening our
 grip on Windows 7? Remember that the commercial world clung to Windows XP until it's deadline had passed and then got Microsoft to extend their support.</p>
<p>Unless Microsoft do something really dramatic; and even if Windows 10 is really fantastic when it finally is released, I can see the world clinging to Windows 7 until 2020, by which time Windows 10 could be 5 years old and a new Windows ( 11? ) could be
 on Technical preview?</p>
<p>Most people, me included, tend to look at price first as well as quality. Bearing that in mind the bean counters at Microsoft had better take a long cold &amp; hard look at the sales of Windows 8&nbsp;( 8.1 ) and realise that they cannot afford&nbsp;to have 2 consecutive
 Windows editions to end up like Windows Vista!</p>

            <p>I would just like to see MS provide options so people can get either the Win 7 look/feel or the Win 8 look/feel, to me this would make people upgrading from 7 happy and also keep people who like 8 happy</p>
<p>
</p><p>with 8 they made too much of a drastic change and made the desktop appear as a small part of the os, metro was the main area that everything ran off, so this alienated the people that like the win 7 look</p>
<p>
</p><p>with 10 they have just gone the opposite of 8, made the desktop the focal point yet again and from what I can see this is going to be the case when the new features for touch get released, it is just going to be the start menu but bigger for touch users,
 still desktop based, annoying anyone who like the 8 style of working</p>
<p>*this is from early info about the features, will need to see in a later build how it looks/if its changed</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the price is right then it will be a worthwhile update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ms recently just seem to take features and do a complete U-turn on them</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ms did this with onedrive and just added the win 7/8.0 app to 10 instead of the integration that 8.1 had, this removed useful features, I am waiting to see how this is handled as there are a lot of unhappy people with this latest change</p>

</p><p>I would imagine that it is a painful reality for both Microsoft as well as us the consumers that operating software is being sent to the skip too soon, hardly been used and while still fresh like fresh foods in supper markets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I did suggest in one of my posts on this forum, for Microsoft to probably consider continuing support for some of their most popular operating systems. In that case, probably a pc user would be encouraged to continue running their favorite older
 version of Windows alongside the new in a dual boot. </p>

<h2>            &#34;Untitled&#34; slides</h2>
                    <p>In my <strong>Slide Master</strong>, I've got a slide that includes a text box with "Lesson Overview" typed inside, with the intention of that being the title for that slide. I added the "Lesson Overview" text in the Slide Master, because I don't want my
 team typing it in manually every time they use that slide layout, as it could introduce typos.
</p>
<p>When uploading the PowerPoint deck to a third-party app that turns PowerPoints into videos, it always shows that slide as "Untitled". When I look into the XML of the PowerPoint (by saving the .pptx file as a .zip and looking at the slide in XML), it also
 doesn't show "Lesson Overview" as the title of that slide. In the XML of all other regular slides, where my team has manually typed in the title of the slide when creating their presentation, I see &lt;a:t&gt;Whatever the slide title is&lt;/a:t&gt;. In the "Lesson Overview"
 slide, that &lt;a:t&gt; tag isn't even present. I think this is why it's saying the slide doesn't have a title and is unknown.</p>
<p>How can I get the title text added to the Slide Master to display as the slide title name in the XML, so that it isn't considered "title-less"?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p>The slide title is the text placed in the <strong>Title placeholder</strong> of a
<strong>slide</strong>. Creating a title on a slide master or layout dosn't meet those requirements. If it did, every slide would have the same title, which wouldn't be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think "Lesson Overview" is that complicated for users to type into the slide title, and there is a spellchecker in PowerPoint to alert them if it misspelled.</p>

<p>Using the <strong>Title</strong> placeholder in the layout for that particular slide in the
<strong>Slide Master</strong> makes matters even worse, as the title text doesn't appear in the left pane (thumbnails?) of the
<strong>Normal</strong> view. The title text appears in the slide in the main pain in the
<strong>Normal</strong> view, but it isn't helpful when it's invisible in the left pane, especially when you're scrolling through trying to locate that slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you've got twenty people creating hundreds of decks using the same template and using the slide layouts in the same way, you want everything to be as automated and efficient as possible. So while I understand it's not complicated to type in a few words,
 in increases the risk that a mistake will be made, and I'd like to avoid that. It's a shame that a "hardcoded" title in a slide layout can't be treated equally in the XML to a manually added title in a slide.&nbsp;</p>

            This may well be the case but&nbsp;it means you can't revert back to the old version if you don't like Beta, as promised. I can't think of a single positive&nbsp; not to show the actual date.&nbsp;It's not a concern.&nbsp; It's a severe irritation. And one can guess, but
 it's far from a definitive answer.&nbsp; I like answers, not guesses.

    <title>Unable to edit in Excel 2013 cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skchiang2001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to edit in Excel 2013 cell</h2>
                    <p>I have an intermittent problem with Excel 2013 where a cell seems to lock up and won’t allow edits.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Never had this problem with Excel 2010.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OS:<span>&nbsp; </span>Windows 7 Enterprise SP1, 64-bit.<span>&nbsp; </span>9GB out of 16GB RAM free.<span>&nbsp;
</span>360GB free out of 465GB HDD.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symptoms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can’t type text in formula bar for selected cell.<span>&nbsp; </span>No cursor is displayed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Same with typing in blank cell or pasting in blank cell.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once it happens, it doesn’t matter which cell you select in the worksheet.<span>&nbsp;
</span></li><li>Cursor shows when double clicking in a cell.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, typing a letter in middle of existing text moves the typed letter to beginning of text, but cursor stays put.<span>&nbsp;
</span></li><li>No response from mouse vertical scroll.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dragging vertical scroll bar works.<span>&nbsp;
</span></li><li>Have seen it on newly opened spreadsheet with no macro, no formula, just typing plain text.<span>&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Saving and re-opening file doesn't help.&nbsp; </span></li><li><span>Have seen it on two workbooks that are opened.&nbsp; </span></li><li>Have seen this right after Windows reboot.<span>&nbsp; </span></li><li>Have seen this on co-worker’s computer.<span>&nbsp; </span></li><li>Can go for months without this problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then it’s almost every day for about a week.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Happens randomly in the past 12 months.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have seen it worst where every cell freezes after fix below.<span>&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp;
<br />
</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fix:</p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to another sheet or another workbook, select a cell.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Go back to original sheet.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clue:</p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Sometimes when I hit ENTER after symptom 2 above, Excel jumps to another already opened workbook.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have not seen it jump to another sheet of the same workbook.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like some workbook/worksheet pointer is lost.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, the cursor pointer within a cell is also lost.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is an issue within Excel 2013 software.<span>&nbsp; This shouldn't be difficult for MS to fix.&nbsp;
</span></p>

            Delete the Aol account from outlook preferences -&gt; Accounts. Restart outlook and add the AOL account back, that should ideally fix it. Also make sure you have both iOS and office updated on the system.

<h2>            Annoying new emoticon tool imposes itself on video calls.  How to disable&#63;</h2>
                    Both Android and iOS versions recently added an Emoticon / Emoji tool which shows up as a slide out tool during video calls (default appearance as a red heart). &nbsp;I find this new 'feature' both useless and annoying and cannot locate a switch to disable
 it. &nbsp;Can anyone advise on a way to disable it?

                    <p>I have Office 2013 on a PC and sync a few Excel files to Android Office for use when I'm out and about. Normally they open ready for editing because I stay logged in. Today I got a bar across the top saying "sign in to edit and save changes to this file".&nbsp;
 When I clicked on this I was prompted to enter my email. When I enter the email I get the message "Can't add another OneDrive account". I don't know what this means, or what has changed. What do I do please?</p>

<p>Hi BastingLizard37,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The notification that you have received means that you need to sign in using the correct Microsoft account that is used for the Excel app. About the second notification, it is possible that you have entered a different email address or Microsoft account
 that is used to install the said app. Please try to exit and login again using the correct Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the issue persists, we highly suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the Excel application from your Android device. You can follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Settings.</li><li>Select Applications.</li><li>Tap Manage Applications.</li><li>Find and tap Excel app.<br />
</li><li>Tap Force Stop and then tap Clear data and Clear cache.</li><li>Once completed, uninstall the app.</li><li><span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">Reinstall the app from </span>Google Play store.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other concerns.</p>

 has no intentions of supporting this upgrade so therefore, I can no longer safely use this software, that I purchased, on my mac. &nbsp;Microsoft is forcing me to purchase something I have already purchased earlier. &nbsp;I do not care if there are newer versions of
 Microsoft Office. &nbsp;I purchased Office 2011 and Microsoft should still honor that purchase by providing the 64bit upgrade. &nbsp;I contacted support thru their chat box and was only directed to this site where I can look up or post my own questions. &nbsp;Really great
 customer support Microsoft! Thank-you! NOT. &nbsp;I wish to have a refund or a product key to another Microsoft Office that will run on Mac at 64bit. I'll be holding my breath awaiting even mo

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't be mislead. Office 2011 DOES work in all current versions of Mac OS X up to and including all versions of High Sierra 10.13 issued to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2011 works on all versions of Mac OS that it was designed to work on plus some new ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your license of 2011 is perpetual. It never expires. Your product will work until Apple changes Mac OS X. As long as you don't install an unsupported version of Mac OS, Office 2011 will run forever.</p>
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984189%28v=office.14%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Office for Mac 2011 system requirements</strong></a>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Office 2011 is 32-bit and will never be 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2016 started off as 32-bit and was upgraded to 64-bit in an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2019 will be 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each product has published system requirements. As long as you don't try to run them in other configurations, they will work just fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could have purchased an Office 365 subscription. The subscription option was offered before the end of life of Office 2011. If you had purchased 2011 by subscription, you&nbsp; would have received regular updates AND upgrades. Your install of Office would
 now be 64-bit Office 2016. Those who took advantage of the Office 365 subscription got the upgrades. Those who did not, didn't. In hindsight, I think the subscription option was the better deal.</p>

            I got a similar response this afternoon:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Marilyn, I got it checked with our back-end
 support team regarding the support status for Office 2011 for Mac products. Please note, Office 2011 for Mac product is obsolete now, so the official support for Office 2011 for Mac has ended in October 2017.</span>

            So should I just ignore the messages I am receiving and continue to use Office 2011? &nbsp;I find this lack of support really annoying. &nbsp;I bought and paid for Office for my MacBook Air. &nbsp;I don't see why I should have to pay more. &nbsp;I ignore the offers to upgrade
 as I get so much e-marketing I end up deleting when it looks like I am being sold on something I may not need.

<p>Official support for Office 2011 ended October 2017. There will be no future updates of any kind unless you were one of the few who purchased an Office 365 subscription that included Office 2011. If you purchased a subscription, you have already been updated
 to Office 2016 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did not purchase an Office 365 subscription you have a permanent license. Your license will never expire. If you don't update Mac OS past High Sierra 10.13 you can continue to use Office 2011.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Basically you are forcing customers to enter into your payment plan system for office. Microsoft have known that 64 bit architecture is coming in - yet have decided that office 2011 is a legacy item and CHOSE not to update it to 64bit. So standalone systems
 are no longer supported. Maybe my licence does not expire ( a sneky and obfuscating comment), though thanks to your decisions it is now as good as mammary glands are to a bull ie useless to all intents and purposes. One of a numbers of cases of 'Increasing
 Uselessness' &nbsp;I love my 2011, now love it or not I am FORCED to buy a new office SO MUCH FOR A LICENCE THAT IS ONGOING. Sorry Microsoft in this case you have not kept your agreement with me, had you done so 2011 would be 64bit. Lets face it to put it to 64
 bit would not have affected your bottom line as I the licence holder becomes the legacy item - all neww purchasers will still have to buy the current versions. Poor performance and even worse on microsofts part is the spin doctoring I have just read &nbsp;and I
 was a supporter 😟</p>

<p>Thank you for the humorous reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't work for Microsoft or Apple, so I appreciate the satire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty soon we'll be facing the same sort of situation when self-driving cars become mandatory. Car makers know this will be an eventuality. They should be prepared to make all previous model cars work with the roads that have no traffic lights, speed limit
 signs, etc. and do it at no charge, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2011 works on all the hardware and operating systems for which is was originally sold. Microsoft supported it through many versions of Mac OS that didn't even exist at the time it was released. They didn't charge anything extra. No one says you have
 to update your hardware or Mac OS. It's your option, and if you do, then there's a cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A key factor in the decision of Microsoft to require subscriptions for Office 2019 is just this scenario. You will always be kept up to date regardless of what Apple does with Mac OS. However, there will almost certainly be a trailing edge of support for
 older hardware and Mac OS versions, which will result in the opposite situation - you will be forced to keep your Mac OS and hardware up to date in order to use Office 2019 and later.</p>

<p>Hi there ! I really really agree with you. I have exactly the same problem. In 2013 I bought a Mac Pro in Bangkok and I paid apart the black box of microsoft office 2011. It cost me about 160-170 Euro. They SHOULD release</p>
<p>a Microsoft Office 2011 version running on 64 bit for their "old" customer. If not never mind... I do not expect so much from them and i will use the same version I paid for and I will not upgrade to macOS Mojave.</p>

            Office 2011 works fine under Mojave, but you now get warnings saying this is the last macOS release that will support it (and other 32 bit apps).

                    My computer worked perfectly fine the other night. However, this morning when i boot up my computer and log into my computer the monitor is flashing black screen and the home page. I cannot click anything, type anything etc... Then, when i go to shut off
 my computer and restart it up again the error code&nbsp;Error:The Instruction at 0x000fffeas2a4ddd2 referenced memory at 0x000000005e4120c4 pops up before shut down. I terminate it and turn back on my computer. Again, no problems at the login screen but when i
 log in it takes a prolonged amount of time to log in and then the same black screen wallpaper flashing on and off.

<h2>            wifi connected but no data flows</h2>
                    <p>Got an 830 and on Rogers cellular in Canada.</p>
<p>Just back from a trip across Russia.</p>
<p>Found wifi connected in some hotels but did not in others (very frustrating)</p>
<p>Got back to Europe where we have a temporary home and wifi service and still no connection at home.</p>
<p>Rebooted + have now have connection.....but no data is flowing</p>
<p>Router offers both 2.4G and 5G streams. Tried both. Tried rebooting a couple of times. Switched off the battery saver etc.</p>
<p>Phone (news, weather, gmail etc) all not updated for 3 days yet wifi shows connected (and connects automatically now).</p>
<p>Don't want to switch on the mobile data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to get the wifi data flowing.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Jack</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I re-booted the router + tried connecting at a couple of locations that I use to connect at.</p>
<p>In every case it shows good connectivity....but no data flows (my wife has no trouble connecting on her I-phone and my laptop is also connected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yesterday I switched off wifi and allowed roaming (I'm currently in Sweden). Everything updated (news, weather, e-mails etc). But today, even with wifi off and cellular data on, I'm back in the same spot. No data is flowing and everything (news, weather
 etc) indicate off-line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have to reset. This will cause me to loose the address book (will take me 2 hours to replace it) + all the apps I paid for and downloaded.... This I'm OK with. But what I am afraid about is loosing the settings (servers etc associated with my e-mail
 accounts). So until I get back to Canada (end of October) and can take my phone in, I'd like to find the reason without having to re-set.</p>

</p><p>If you decide to do a hard reset ALL of your contacts and calendar info will return AS LONG AS you use the same Live ID. You should verify that your info is saved in the cloud by using IE on a PC and navigate to www.outlook.com, log in to your account and
 verify everything is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for programs you have paid for you will NOT have to pay again since you own them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the settings on your email accounts you could always write down the info on paper ... I am laughing at that. We rarely ever have to do that but it always works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

<p>
</p><p>yes, the tabs I refer to are within the same worksheet. I am attaching a screenshot of one of the tabs here. All of the tabs have the same column headings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am trying to make it so the information
 that is on &nbsp;each worksheet will "roll up" and appear all on one consolidated worksheet within the document. This way, we can easily filter each column and have an overview of what is due or what the responsibilities of each team member are, etc. I would also
 like any new information that is added to any of the worksheets to auto populate to this same overview worksheet.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Rieyeciu,<br />
<br />
In some cases, 0x80131500 error can appear due to your antivirus or firewall. The first thing that you can try is to disable the antivirus that you're using. In addition to that you may also try resetting Store cache by following the steps below and check if
 it will resolve your issue:<br />
<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>to open the Run dialog.<br />
2. Enter <strong>wsreset.exe </strong>and press <strong>Enter </strong>or click <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
3. After resetting the cache try to start Windows Store again.<br />
<br />
It will help you clean the Store cache, then check if it’s working or not.<br />
<br />
With regards to your second concern, kindly answer the questions below to isolate the issue:<br />
<br />
• When is the first time that you're having an issue signing in to your OneNote account?<br />
• Have you made any changes prior to the issue that you're encountering?<br />
• Is the error that you're getting only happen when signing into OneNote or is it also happening with all the Office application like OneDrive, Word and Excel?<br />
<br />
<br />
To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.

<h2>            Francilienne around Paris</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a complaint about Nokia Drive.<br />
Coming from South of France on the A10 direction Paris, the overhead traffic information warn us for congestion and delays on the A10/A86. Luckily, we are just in time to take the "Francilienne", a wider ring around Paris (A104, N104, ..., A3).<br />
Somehow Nokia Drive is totally unaware of this alternative route to the north (Lille, Bruxelles), which is common knowledge, because for more that three quarters of that route, which is quite long, the voice attempts to convince us to take the next exit and
 turn back.<br />
Please make Nokia Drive aware of the wonderful Francilienne ring arount Paris East?<br />

    <title>Why has Synaptic touchpad destroyed the left-handed operation of the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why has Synaptic touchpad destroyed the left-handed operation of the left&#47;right buttons&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I NEED to use the Synaptics touchpad buttons left-handed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Buttons should not be labelled left ^ right, they should be PRIMARY and SECONDARY. However, when I updated to Windows 10 from Windows 7, the Synaptics program changed, and now there is ZERO facility to change the Primary and Secondary buttons operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Dynabook left-handed has made me feel disabled for its negative effect on my interfacing with the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has this apparently Chinese software company destroyed the left-handed facility? Do we all have to be the same?</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the 10074 build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>THERE IS NO FACILITY TO CHANGE THE PRIMARY SECONDARY BUTTONS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise the OS is partly on the right path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>Because of the problem, everything I do takes almost TWICE as long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could use a mouse (where I can reverse the mouse buttons); but on a laptop, I don`t want to; and often don`t have the space to.</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 won&#39;t activate</h2>
                    I bought Office 2013 online, and although I installed it following the link in the email sent to me by Microsoft it still wants my product key, and I don't have a product key, as I have to click on the link in the email. I have uninstalled it x3 and re-installed
 it following the link from the email and it says I need to activate it.
