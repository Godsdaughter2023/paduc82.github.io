<h2>            Microsoft Family locking my son out</h2>
                    <p>3 months ago I set up Microsoft family controls on my son's Windows 10 laptop to restrict his usage of the device.</p>
<p>This worked fine for several weeks with my son able to send me remote requests for additional time.</p>
<p>Now his laptop is permanently blocked by MS family and he is unable to send me requests.</p>
<p>When he tries to send me a request, it simply says "Something went wrong. The request could not be sent".<br />
The only way for him to use his laptop now is to click the "My parent is here option" and for me to lop in an authorize his account, which means I have t be physically present whenever he starts his laptop.</p>
<p>What is wrong with MS Family?</p>

            Try verifying his account:
<br />
<br />Common issues with device restrictions
<br />
<br />Settings don't take effect when I update them on the website.
<br />
<br />My child clicked "Send a request" but I don't see any requests.
<br />
<br />Device activity is blank, or some activity is missing.
<br />
<br />    Periodically, your child's Microsoft account may expire on their device.  When this happens, activity is not sent from the device, "send a request" will fail, and settings changes you make on the website will not take effect on the device until the account is verified.
<br />    To verify their account, have your child sign in to their device, go to <a href="https://aka.ms/familyverify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/familyverify</a>, and follow the prompts to verify the account.  You may need to wait up to a day (but usually only a few hours) before their activity will show up on the website again.
<br />
<br />Common issues with time limits
<br />
<br />I don't think time limits is working, because the time in the device usage report does not match what I observe in real life.
<br />
<br />    If your child uses multiple devices, then keep in mind that each device tracks their allowances separately.  For example, a child who is limited to 1 hour, but can sign into 2 Windows PC's, could use each PC for 1 hour, for a total of 2 hours of usage that day.
<br />    Time limits are enforced based on when they are signed in (even idle time), but idle time is not counted in the device usage report.  For example, if your child's allowance is 2 hours, and they sign in and don't do anything, the child would be locked out after 2 hours, but the device usage report may show as little as 1 minute of usage.
<br />
<br />
<br />You can also try removing him from the family temporarily:
<br />
<br />sign into your Your Family at the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> 
<br />
<br />Under the account, click More options, click Remove from family.
<br />
<br />Restart then check if you can sign into the account again.
<br />
<br />Change the account privilege 
<br />
<br />It is possible there is a profile issue, you could try changing the account privileges to Standard User from Administrator to see if it logs you in.
<br />
<br />In your current account
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Users tab
<br />Select the account, then click Disconnect
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Select the other account
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Group Membership
<br />Select Standard user
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK again
<br />
<br />Restart the machine, the try logging into the account.

<h2>            Associated Helper Application &#38;  Data Execution Prevention error messages.</h2>
                         <br />
 When trying to open attachments from emails I keep getting error messages like the one below:<br />
<br />
C:\Users\XX\AppData\Local\Temp\XXXXXXXXXX.doc could not be opened, because the associated helper application does not exist. Change the association in your preferences.<br />
<br />
They are usually accompanied by data execution prevention messages. I have tried removing the DEP from MS Word but this hasn't changed the problem.<br />
<br />
I am running Vista Home Version 6.

<h3> ron joshuatuanquin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - &#34;Windows can&#39;t setup a homegroup on this computer&#34; Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I previously had Windows 8 on my desktop and Windows 7 Home Basic on my laptop. I updated both of them to Windows 10. The "Get the Windows 10" app didn't appear on my laptop so I went directly to the website to download it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using Homegroup since it worked well between the two of my devices before they were updated. It didn't work. I made a homegroup in my desktop and tried to join using my laptop. I typed the password then it told me that "Windows can't setup a homegroup
 on this computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft Contact Center and they have now handed me to Level 2 of technical support but they still couldn't fix the problem. They reinstalled Windows 10 to both computers. After that, I tried making a homegroup on my desktop and now even my
 desktop says Windows can't set up a homegroup on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me with this.</p>

</p><p>I've few problems when I play on emulator with the sound. I have like 1 second delay whatever the emulator. I tested Memu, Nox, Mumu and Blustack, same issue for each ones. I thought the problem came from the emulator but it looks like it is for virtualisation.
 What could I do please ? It's really unpleasant to play with a sound delay.&nbsp;</p>

                    My wifi stops working whenever I connect my external hard drive. When I disconnect the hard drive my wifi comes back. I've tried updating my drivers and that has not helped.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There could be a system conflict that is why you're having this issue. To isolate your concern, we'd like to ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you encounter any error messages every time WiFi stops working?</li><li>Have you made any software or hardware changes on your device prior to this issue?</li><li>When did the issue begin?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick response.<br />
<br />
To isolate if the issue is in your Operating System, we recommend performing a clean boot.
<strong>Clean boot</strong> is a process which is being performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Choose the version of your Windows and follow the steps under
<strong>How to perform a clean boot</strong> in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            With doing the clean boot, even with programs and drivers disabled. The internet works and then once my external hard drive connects, my wifi has no connectivity. My other devices using the same wifi still work.

<p>Hi Andy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might be with the hard drive itself. Have you tried to connect other hard drivers to check if the issue will persist? Also, have you tried booting your device in safe mode with networking?
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem doesn't happen in safe mode with networking, then default settings and basic device drivers aren't causing the issue.</span> The steps on how to start in safe mode are provided on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Windows 10 Store Error Code 0X80073CF9 Cannot Download Game</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought Gears of War 4 Ultimate Edition for my Xbox One and I tried to download it to my PC and I got the above error code. I've been trying since the game came out and I cannot find a way to get it to work. Other games download and install fine as I just tested Killer Instinct, however the trial for Recore that I downloaded on my XB1 will not download for the PC so I wonder if it's an issue with the Play Anywhere titles. </p><p>For what it's worth, I am trying to install&nbsp;Gears of War 4&nbsp;to my E: drive, it downloads something like 46 MB and then errors out, but Recore&nbsp; errors while trying to acquire the license for the trial and does not even give me the option to choose which drive to install it on. My normal C: drive does not have enough space to install GoW4, though my E: drive has&nbsp;over 600 GB available.</p>

<h2>            Windows installer clean up Utility will not remove Blackberry desktop software.</h2>
                    &nbsp;As I have been trying to reinstall it.&nbsp;But it keeps telling me that the wizard was interrupted before Blackberry Desktop Software could be completely installed. Your system has not been modified. To complete installation at another time, please run setup
 again. This is what I have found out after many hours of research. And it was uninstalled but still shows up in Windows installer Cleanup Utility&nbsp;and that freezes up when trying to clean it off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyone out there that has an answer. I know that not
 that many people tether with there phone,but its that or Satellite INTERNET.

            Yes Marilyn :<br />
I re-installed windows 7. I think what caused all the problems in the first place was Adobe Master Collection cs3. I have not had any problems since I re-installed Windows 7. I would like to thank you and Chethan for responding to my troubles. The Adobe Master
 Collection cs3 works on my Desktop with Windows 7 but that is a 32bit OP. There are some of programs that dont have support anymore, those dont work. Anyway Thanks again.&nbsp;

<h3> jarie suicune  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to purchase Japanese DLC for Japanese game.</h2>
                    
<p>I got Dragon Ball Xenoverse imported from Japan, and want to get the new DLC for it. But when I try to use my debit card, it just tells me I can't use that card. What's up with that?</p>
<p>Physical location: United States</p>
<p>Xbox One Region-settings: Japan</p>
<p>If I could just use it to add funds to my account and pay from there, I'd do so, but I can't find such an option (I am new to Xbox, so I may not know where to look).<br />
<br />
I've done this on my Japanese Nintendo consoles many times before, with no problems, so what's going on?</p>
<p>I am not interested in buying a pre-paid points card.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear you're having issues. &nbsp;However, in order to purchase items from a different region your billing info must match the region settings. &nbsp;This means that your credit card must have been issued in Japan.</p>
<p>Also, please be aware that having funds in your account or having a Japanese credit card does not mean that you will get receipt of an item purchased. &nbsp;Some items are region locked and cannot be downloaded to a region other than where it was originally intended.</p>

<p>Excuse me? Visa cards work internationally, as other users I've found about have confirmed with this with Xbox One.</p>
<p>I know my Visa card isn't restricted by Region, as I frequently use it with my Japanese-Region-Locked consoles and for other purchases.</p>
<p>Or are you saying that Microsoft adds further Region Lock on even the ability to buy their services? I find this very hard to believe.</p>
<p>This is VERY confusing.</p>

<p>2) Is there someway of checking online if a product key is still valid?</p>

<p>3. If you bought it in a slim lined package, it is likely an OEM System Builder license - also genuine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the above and you just bought a key somewhere, then its likely not genuine.</p>

<h2>            i can&#39;t download Chinese language pack to my laptop which is running with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a laptop today and it came with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to have the display language to be in Chinese. I went to setting and added Transitional Chinese and Simplified Chinese, on the display language option and it advises me that I can download the language pack. I clicked at the option to download the
 language pack and waited for 3 hours, however, it still shows no progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help and advise what to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember making any changes to the system?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the link to see how to turn on or off system restore:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>System Restore On or Off</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-System-Restore-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-System-Restore-on-or-off</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the performance troubleshooter on the system and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Open the Performance troubleshooter</span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run SFC (System file checker) scan on the system and check whether the issue persists. Follow the steps mentioned in the article given below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></strong></p>

<span>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to start the computer in safe mode and check whether the same happen, refer the link:</span></p>
<p><span>Advanced startup options</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in safemode, you may configure the computer into clean boot and check if the issue persists. It will start Windows7 by using a minimal set
 of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts. </span>

    <title>Windows 10 Filmstrip photo viewer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markostl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Filmstrip photo viewer</h2>
                    <p>I find it interesting that MS response to this question is to sidestep or make other excuses to explain that the newer version of ways to view photos is better than the old Windows Xp Filmstrip view setting.&nbsp; The MS people writing the programs clearly do
 not work with 1000's of photos in their daily work, needing to skip from 1 to another pic with out actually opening a photo in some program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The filmstrip viewer did briefly make appearance is later versions but was removed with updates with the lame xtra large, large, medium, and small folder setting - all of these are the same thing, so why not eliminate all but the large, and go back to allowing
 the filmstrip view setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS programmers are so bad not knowing that when an "upgrade" is actually worse, they alienate their customers.&nbsp; As an architect I would love a setting on the homes of all MS employees that randomly changed the locks on their doors, what drawer their silverware
 was located, and many random things to annoy them and make their home perform worse each time they did an update to MS program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just fix it and bring back filmstrip and keep it there.&nbsp; Learn from your mistakes, and admit you are wrong, and fix it.</p>

    <title>Phantom Dust on Windows 10 won&#39;t start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thegunheart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phantom Dust on Windows 10 won&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>Been really hyped to try this, just downloaded, but even after rebooting the game, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling, every time I boot it it just shows me the logo splash screen for maybe two seconds, then closes. I don't understand what's going
 on, I'm well above the system requirements with Windows 10 fully up to date, an Intel i7 and an Nvidia 760 card (okay, that's pretty old, but it's still above the recommended requirements) and 16 gigs of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what could be wrong?</p>

<p>I have had to restore my windows vista studio book multiple times and finally just reinstalled the whole windows (due to startup problems).&nbsp; Unfortunately, the option to change settings for the dell touchpad has disappeared from mouse properties area and
 i'm unable to stop the 'double tap' or zoom from constantly screwing up my work.&nbsp; i need to get the settings tool back, and i would like to avoid losing all data/programs.&nbsp; can anyone help me?</p>

    <title>Windows 7 User Profile Configuration File Settings Questions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 User Profile Configuration File Settings Questions</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering whether anyone could answer my questions on some of the Windows 7 user profile configuration file settings particularly the ntuser.dat and Desktop.ini files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ntuser.dat - What other settings does this file have as well as linking Explorer and Outlook to the user's profile? Reason why I ask is that I had to rebuild a user profile due to no icons displaying in Windows Explorer when opening it up and found that
 if I imported this file from a backup of the profile into the newly created version of the profile i.e. deleting it from User Profiles under Administrator, logging back in as that profile, logging back off and importing the files from the backup of the profile&nbsp;into
 the newly created version of the profile&nbsp;using Administrator with overwriting the existing&nbsp;files and folders within the newly created profile the same problem would reoccur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop.ini -&nbsp;Where does the following code [.ShellClassInfo] LocalizedResourceName=@%SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll,-21769 IconResource=%SystemRoot%\system32\imageres.dll,-183 pull the background image from? I recall in Windows XP that all background
 image files were in C:\Windows&nbsp;but&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;be found in the same location in Windows 7, again something else I found when rebuilding the user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>RocknRollTim&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hello Tim, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to us on Microsoft Community. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to inform you that, <strong>Ntuser.dat</strong> file is a registry file. Each user's Ntuser.dat file contains the registry settings for their individual account. The Windows registry, as described by Microsoft, is a "central hierarchical
 the registry is supported by the current user's Ntuser.dat file. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>Ntuser.dat.log</strong> file, which is listed as a text file, backs up the Ntuser.dat file. If an error occurs in the Ntuser.dat file, Windows uses the Ntuser.dat.log file to correct it. If a computer is part of a network, it may
 also have an Ntuser.ini file. Ntuser.ini files are used to create a roaming profile for a user that does not get copied to the network server. When the DAT extension of an Ntuser.dat file is changed to Ntuser.man, it creates a mandatory user profile that is
 no longer user-configurable. In this case, whenever a user logs off any changes made to the user's preference settings are not saved.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Desktop.ini</span></strong><span> files are created by applications like Microsoft Outlook, by the system or by a user. A Search for Desktop.ini files will typically display several files of that name in the C:\Program Files and C:\WINDOWS
 directories, and in personal folders the user has customized. All Desktop.ini files are listed as Configuration Settings files in Windows Explorer file lists.</span><span style="color: rgba(89, 97, 102, 1)">
</span><span>The Windows Desktop.ini files are still text files that a user can open with a text editor, but unlike the straightforward statements in WIN.INI files in the older Windows operating systems, the statements are not easy to interpret. They are also
 Configuration Settings files and so should only be modified by a Windows technical expert. If you do not want to see these files in your folders, hide them using the task described in the "Hidden Desktop.ini Files" section.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.

            <p>Thanks Jericho Lap but I'd already been to that page and tried everything on it - that and several other forum pages here and elsewhere. Being a lad who's always prepared to be sceptical, I duly tried everything again...but with the same negative result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that&nbsp;may be&nbsp;noteworthy, is that the Windows Store App Troubleshooter does its stuff and reports that "Windows Store cache may be damaged. Not fixed". A-ha! A troubleshooter with a sense of irony! Peculiar, since it claims it'll fix repairs automatically.
 Even more curious since I'd run wsreset before running the troubleshooter - a couple of times, even...and rebooted to boot. Actually, I'd run that troubleshooter several times before my original post and got the same result each time (note that I am running
 AppsDiagnostic10 and not the earlier version). The only possible solutions from elsewhere&nbsp;I haven't tried is stuff about creating local/other identities or&nbsp;even a reinstall. Really? I have a life to lead...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many complaints around about this whole business of some apps not opening and it's been going on for over a year. In addition to Feedback Hub, some others on my desktop are also now&nbsp;misbehaving (e.g. Maps, Solitaire) but don't care about those since I
 don't use them. One day I presume, MS will get around to fixing the issue or offering a way for us to do so effectively. In the meantime, for all the joys of being an Insider, MS will be going without my feedback until Feedback Hub is fixed. I wonder if they'll
 notice...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fast losing the will to live on this one but if any thinks they do actually have a solution - not one that repeats what's already been said many times here and elsewhere - &nbsp;I'd be interested in hearing it.</p>

            <p>Thanks Jericho Lap. I run sfc fairly regularly and had done so before my original post&nbsp;but it reported no system integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, a couple of days ago, managed to fix everything - although not entirely sure which bit of the following made the difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had also been having problems with updating (Insider Previews) from build 15042 to 15058 then 15063. Wouldn't complete. Tried many tricks identified on various forums. The one that finally made the difference was disconnecting the DVD drive from a SATA III
 port on the motherboard and reconnecting it to SATA II (huh? - dunno, but others have also found it works). Then successfully updated to 15063.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the issues above. Confirmed the most up-to-date BIOS for the board Asus P8X77-V Pro. Reinstalled current driver for the NVIDIA GTX650.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some improvements in general functioning but most most of the the issues I've referred to above still remained.</p>
<p>Rather than repeat the various procedures identified previously, I downloaded FixWin 10.0.1.0 from The Windows Club and ran some of the troubleshooters including repair Windows Component Store using DISM, cleared and reset Store cache (previously done several
 times) and re-registered all apps (ditto). Then redownloaded AppsDiagnostic10 and ran.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't think to check the effect of each but, at the end of it all, problem fixed. And all apps showing in white on the Start menu - except Store. Ran 'Get-AppxPackage *windowsstore* | Remove-AppxPackage' then reinstalled. Fixed. Wouldn't initially update
 (?) but did a couple of hours later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So problem sorted. Which was the critical step? Not sure I'm afraid. Suspect it may have been the interaction of several...</p>

</p><p><span>Follow the below suggestions and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Reset Internet Explorer settings and check if it helps (Reset IE disclaimer).</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span>Sometimes websites don't look like you expect them to–images might not appear, menus might be out of place, and text could be jumbled together. This might be caused by a compatibility problem between Internet&nbsp;Explorer
