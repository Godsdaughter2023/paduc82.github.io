                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a complete documentation of the command line options for Skype for Desktop (<strong>not classic</strong>)?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>/?</em> , <em>\?</em> ,<em> \help</em> , <em>--help, --?&nbsp;</em>do not seem to do anything besides starting the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the <em>--username</em>&nbsp;(previously <em>/username</em>) no longer implemented? If so, why?!</p>

<p>Its really poor that skype removed the user and password option. I use business and personal skype side by side and its unneeded pain to type skype name and password again and again.
</p>
<p>With old skype i could start as many instances as I want from autostart and there are lot of users out there who want this feature back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please microsoft give that feature back to us.</p>

                    I though Applecare was bad, but check out how much time a customer has to spend at support and then also end up with an unsatisfying answer!!!<br />
Customers who buy the Surface clearly are not taken seriously!!!<br />
Please see my chat history below...my time spent on chat is ofcourse not even counting the time I spent on calls!<br />
<br />
Long story short: I was lied to by a Microsoft employee, and now I have to be the person jumping through their corporate loop holes.<br />
<br />
Let me say: I'm a huge Microsoft fan, I use Windows Phone, Visual Studio, Windows 8, SQL-Server etc etc....but this level of customer service has made me speechless.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw, if any Microsoft employee dares to delete my post as irrelevant I'll make sure that it will popup on other forums!<br />
<br />
I've anonymized my name below.<br />

<div>Crystal H: Thank you for waiting.</div>
<div>Crystal H: Did you set up an exchange with the windows store?</div>
<div>CustomerName: I was told that this issue would be escalated and that I would be contacted</div>
<div>CustomerName: which has not happened yet as you can guess :)</div>
<div>CustomerName: but I want this arranged asap so I can show my device of :)</div>
<div>Crystal H: I absolutely understand that this is very important. I'm just looking over the escalation right now for you. Do you mind holding for about three to four minutes please?</div>
<div>CustomerName: sure</div>
<div>Crystal H: Thank you.</div>
<div>Crystal H: I just wanted to check back with you, I'm still looking into this for you it will be about three to four more minutes if you don't mind.</div>

<div>Crystal H: Thank you for waiting. I got a hold of John from the Microsoft Store, he said the escalation takes 24-48 business hours. Since it was put in on Friday the 2nd you would get a call back by end of business day today. If for any reason you have
 not received that call by today, just call back tomorrow morning to the Microsoft Store ( 1-800-642-7676 choose option 2) and give them reference number and they will look into it further for you.</div>

<div>PS. THIS CHAT GOT REDIRECTED TO ANOTHER SALES REPRESENTATIVE HALFWAY THE CHAT</div>
<div>You are now chatting with 'Gary W'.</div>
<div>CustomerName: Please see my contact history and request here</div>
<div>CustomerName: I bought a brand new Surface on 28th of October via the German Microsoft store. I had contact with a service employee of the German store on Monday 29th of October at 9:22 AM. At this point I had not received the Surface yet, but I was inquiring
 to see if the white touchcover I had also purchased would be a German or English keyboard. The service employee made me hold for a few minutes, my guess is to validate my question with someone else. When she returned she confirmed that the keyboard would be
 in English and her literal words were that "this was standard Microsoft practice when sending a product to the Netherlands from Germany". This answer satisfied me, and because of this luckily I did not have to cancel my order. But when my Surface arrived last
 week I saw that it was a German touchcover! Which is totally unusable to me. Following this, I have had extensive contact with several Microsoft employees on Friday the 2nd of November, around 14:19: Timothy from hardware support (very helpful and friendly
 guy btw) who created contactnr: 1187108195 And next I was connected to Paul, from the UK store I guess, who created contactnr: 1187108883 On Monday around 17:27 I had a chat with Crystal H via https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us/. She
 helpfully tried contacting a store representative directly for me. But I was informed that the handling of issues take 24-48 hours. As you may understand, if the German store would only supply German touchcovers and had i been informed correctly about this
 I would have canceled the order and waited longer for my purchase. But as a dedicated Microsoft fan I couldn't wait to get the Surface in my hands! I hope you are able to help me continue having a great Microsoft AND Surface experience and will supply me with
 a white English touchcover. Surface serial#: XXXXX ps. all times are GMT+1</div>
<div>Gary W: Thanks for contacting Surface Support! My name is Gary. Please allow me a few moments to read through your notes ok?</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok</div>
<div>Gary W: I'm sorry for the trouble, CustomerName. Please allow me about five minutes while I check into the matter for you. Will that be okay?</div>
<div>CustomerName: sure</div>
<div>Gary W: Thanks for your patience! I just need about another 2 minutes ok? Thanks</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok</div>
<div>Gary W: I apologize for all the confusion. I am going to transfer you to the English Microsoft Store. They are equipped to get this issue resolved for you today. This chat will follow you to the Store agent so you wont have to repeat it. Will that be okay
 with you?</div>
<div>CustomerName: You are aware I purchased my Surface in the German ms store?</div>
<div>Gary W: Yes I am, however the products ship with hardware related to the region of purchase. I don't want you to end up with another German touch cover if it is of no use to you.</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok, thanks</div>
<div>Gary W: I am not able to ship you a touch cover but the Store can. And Crystal told me to be sure I take care of you right!</div>
<div>CustomerName: Great!</div>
<div>Gary W: I'll transfer you in just a moment. Thanks for contacting Surface Support!</div>

<div>Jamie B: I am sorry CustomerName looks like the previous agent was trying to transfer you to the german surface store correct, I am actually in the billing for apps dept in the US.</div>

 you to the Store agent so you wont have to repeat it. Will that be okay with you?"</div>

<div>Lorna H: Unfortunately the store location you want is only available through calling at this time. The phone number for it is 0800-026-0329.</div>
<div>CustomerName: but then I have to explain myself all over again??</div>
<div>CustomerName: I have called like 4 numbers already and this is my xth chat</div>
<div>Lorna H: That is for the Microsoft store in the UK, but it is the close English speaking store to you.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lorna H: Again I am sorry, unfortunately I do not have access to the information in order to exchange your keyboard at this time.</div>
<div>CustomerName: And now that I think of it, I have already had contact with the UK store via someone named Paul, who created contactnr: 1187108883</div>
<div>CustomerName: I'm getting the feeling I'm walking into a brick wall..and this is costing me a lot of (unnessecary) time</div>
<div>Lorna H: I will do my best to see how we can sort this issue out. I will need some more time in order to investigate further.</div>
<div>CustomerName: that's good to hear</div>
<div>Lorna H: Have you ever gone to myservice.surface.com.</div>
<div>CustomerName: no</div>
<div>CustomerName: just checked it, support is not available in my country</div>
<div>Lorna H: We are still looking into this , I will need a few more minutes, Please.</div>
<div>Lorna H: 2-5 minutes Please.</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok</div>
<div>Lorna H: Where did you buy this touch cover keyboard?</div>
<div>CustomerName: It came with my order of Surface in the German store</div>
<div>Lorna H: Have you spoken with the German Microsoft store.&nbsp;</div>
<div>CustomerName: Let me think, I think I have..</div>
<div>CustomerName: Yes, I remember now</div>
<div>CustomerName: I did</div>
<div>CustomerName: they told me they could not supply an English keyboard from there</div>
<div>CustomerName: And advised me to contact support.</div>
<div>Lorna H: So you did call the UK Microsoft store?</div>
<div>Lorna H: Correct?</div>
<div>CustomerName: yes, spoke with Paul</div>
<div>Lorna H: Was it Paul that said he would be calling you back?</div>
<div>CustomerName: Pfff...I have to dig deep now...</div>
<div>CustomerName: I don't think he said it</div>
<div>CustomerName: I think he was going to make sure I'd receive the callback</div>
<div>CustomerName: but I haven't spoken to anyone who was going to call me back</div>
<div>CustomerName: only people who said they would setup a callback</div>
<div>CustomerName: But it's not the callback I want...it's just a return of my touchcover..</div>
<div>Lorna H: Alright, I will need another few moments (2-5 minutes) Please.&nbsp;</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok</div>
<div>Lorna H: Yes they would need to call you back to set that exchange up.</div>
<div>CustomerName: ah ok</div>
<div>CustomerName: so I do need the callback :)</div>
<div>Lorna H: I will need a few more minutes Please. (2-5 minutes)</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok</div>
<div>Lorna H: What I am able to do for you at this time. I will set you up for contact from a CARE Team speacialist. They will be able to sort this out for you.&nbsp;</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok</div>
<div>CustomerName: Will they call/mail me or just sort it out?</div>
<div>Lorna H: Yes, it will be a phone call and everything should get addressed during that call.</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok, when can I expect that call?</div>
<div>CustomerName: and who can I contact if it doenst happen again?</div>
<div>Lorna H: Within 24-48 hours, if you do not receive your contact call the UK Microsoft Store. I am explaining everything that has happened in my notes to the CARE specialist so this should get the full attention it deserves.&nbsp;</div>
<div>CustomerName: what is the number of the Uk store again? And I don't know where the CARE team is located, not in the US I hope, because then my call would be setup very late/early?</div>
<div>Lorna H: 0800-026-0329 in the UK number. I will make a note that you are in the Netherlands and to consider the time difference.</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok, perfect</div>
<div>info: Your chat transcript will be sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** at the end of your chat.</div>

<div>Crystal M: Thank you CustomerName, I am just going over your case information. Please allow me another 3-5 minutes.</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok</div>
<div>CustomerName: Whatever your solution may be, I won't be accepting the solution 'you will receive a callback' anymore.</div>
<div>Crystal M: CustomerName, I understand that this is a very frustrating experience. I am going to do my best to find a solution for you.</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok</div>
<div>Crystal M: CustomerName, I know you did not want to explain this again, I am going to describe how I interpret your issue and you let me know if I am correct. Would that be okay?</div>
<div>CustomerName: ok</div>
<div>Crystal M: You purchased a Surface RT device from a store in Germany, on launch day, when you received it it had the wrong touch cover with it. Since then you have been told that you would be getting a call back which you have not yet received, nor have
 you received the correct keyboard.</div>
<div>CustomerName: correct</div>
<div>Crystal M: Thank you CustomerName, I am still looking into this for you.</div>
<div>Crystal M: CustomerName, thank you so much for your extreme patience with me while I look into this for you. I apologize &nbsp;for the delay in my response, you have a very frustrating situation.</div>
<div>CustomerName: I'd say yes</div>
<div>Crystal M: I understand that you have been promised callbacks, and have been referred to other support options.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Crystal M: At this point what the recommended course of action for you to take would be, return your entire device all the parts that you got with it and then purchase a new device that has the correct keyboard that you have been requesting.</div>
<div>CustomerName: what???</div>
<div>CustomerName: how about just sending me the correct keyboard?</div>
<div>Crystal M: Because we are over seas from you, that option is not available to me.</div>
<div>CustomerName: well, then contact the store that is able to do so</div>
<div>CustomerName: this is unacceptable!</div>
<div>CustomerName: I was promised the correct keyboard</div>
<div>CustomerName: I'm spending hours and hours on getting support, basically because I was lied to in the first place</div>
<div>CustomerName: and now "I" have to go through difficulties?</div>
<div>Crystal M: I am not able to contact overseas stores. I really do apologize for not being able to do that for you.</div>
<div>CustomerName: ...</div>
<div>CustomerName: I'm speechless on this level of service</div>
<div>CustomerName: I'm not accepting this</div>
<div>Crystal M: Because of your location, it makes it difficult to accomplish what you need.</div>
<div>CustomerName: as a customer I expect to be talking to Microsoft as a company, not to Microsoft office location X</div>
<div>CustomerName: I want a call or chat right away with someone</div>
<div>Crystal M: What I can do for you CustomerName, is provide you with the Nederlands support number.</div>
<div>CustomerName: Surface is not available in the Netherlands, so that won't help</div>
<div>CustomerName: contacting the german store won't help either, since apparently keyboard supply is regio specific and they can't provide the right keyboard</div>
<div>CustomerName: I'm done jumping through corporate hoops and just want this resolved by a Microsoft employee</div>
<div>CustomerName: and I honestly think I'm not asking too much here!</div>
<div>Crystal M: The same applies for this location as far as providing you with a keyboard.&nbsp;</div>
<div>CustomerName: so if my keyboard was broken (and not just the wrong language) I would ALSO have to send the entire thing back?</div>
<div>Crystal M: Yes that is correct.</div>
<div>CustomerName: ???</div>
<div>CustomerName: thats the weirdest thing ever</div>
<div>CustomerName: I will post my entire chat history regarding this service on various forums and hopefully then this, in my opinion, ridiculous process will change</div>
<div>CustomerName: I'd like to ask you to discuss this with your superior to see if something could be done for future customers with similar issues</div>
<div>CustomerName: I'm done for now</div>
<div>Crystal M: Thanks for contacting Surface Support and have a great day! &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Armin Jamshidi,</p>
<p><br />
•&nbsp;Any recent changes done on the computer?<br />
•&nbsp;What is the file format of the video you have for the dream scene?</p>
<p><br />
Windows Dream Scene supports only WMV and MPG video file formats.</p>
<p>Also check with any other video file set as dream scene, check if it works.</p>
<p>This mostly happens due some third party codec installed on the computer, if you have any codec installed on the computer like Klite codec try uninstalling it and check if dream scene works.</p>
<p>If the above step fails then try uninstalling any roxio product installed on the computer and check.</p>
<p>Also make sure that you have the aero feature enabled on the computer.</p>
<p>You may try running the fixit available in the below link and check if it works.</p>

            Hi Nicholas,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand your concern. But some devices can cause interference between your Computer and networks that might be in range. For example, microwave ovens and some cordless phones use particular frequencies (including 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) that are also used
 by some network hardware. </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><div>Bluetooth operates in the range of 2.4 to 2.485 GHz. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To fix this issue you may try the steps mentioned in the section, "<strong>There's interference from other devices</strong>" from the link below.</div>
<div><strong>Why can't I find a wireless network?</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/cant-find-wireless-network#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/cant-find-wireless-network#1TC=windows-8</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information helps. Please get back to us if you need further assistance.</div>

            <p>Hi Soumya, thank you for your response. I have taken the time to learn a lot more about bluetooth and wifi since your reply but still have some questions I'm hoping you, or someone you know could help me with.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I learned how to change the frequency channel on my router, but is there a way to learn what frequency the bluetooth device is using?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to force the bluetooth device to only use a smaller frequency range? or not hop to certain frequencies?<br />
Is there a way to force the bluetooth adapter in my laptop to only use specific frequencies?&nbsp;<br />
This way, I could pick a channel for my router that I know the bluetooth device wouldn't interfere with as much. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Directly from the FCC website, I learned the bluetooth device has the range "2402.0 &nbsp;- &nbsp;2480.0 &nbsp;MHz".</p>
<p>My router has available channels 1 - 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any ideas of how I can improve my circumstances, I would be happy to hear them.<br />
I appreciate all of the knowledge behind the Microsoft team. </p>

<h2>            Unable to update Windows 10 and error 0x8024014 in Store</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am inquiring about an issue I have, but I could not find a solution to nor figure it out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initial issue:</p>
<p>1) windows 10 would not update. &nbsp;"We couldn't get online to download your updates. &nbsp;We'll try again later, or you can check now. &nbsp;If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the internet"</p>
<p>2) microsoft store will not download/update apps. &nbsp;Error 0x8024014</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried:</p>
<p>I have checked multiple times for updates at different times, locations, and means of connection to the internet. &nbsp;I have tried to force update by re-downloading windows 10, going back to a previous version, looked into setting, etc. &nbsp;and I cannot find anything.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done the route of using command prompt and powershell. &nbsp;I have disabled wuauserv, cryptsvc, bits, and msiserver, changed the name of Software Distribution and catroot2 (which I was unable to change at all, actually), and re-enabled them. &nbsp;That did
 not work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have googled, bing-ed, and searched on mircosoft's websites. &nbsp;I searched loads of combinations with the keywords of catroot2, windows 10 upadate, 0x8024014, etc. &nbsp;(They just said to do what I posted above, just in different ways and with different wording,
 which I tried all variations I could find).</p>
<p>I even changed my clock/calendar... &nbsp;No dice.</p>
<p>I have done everything as an administrator, also. &nbsp;So, that isn't the issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent about 5 hours on this... &nbsp;So, please, help!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per the description, your computer is not able to start windows and stuck in System Recovery option.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The error which you receive (</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0xfc38ca53)</span><span><span>are mostly about memory, which is related to RAM but right now your computer is stuck in a Loop of System recovery option. So let’s try to get
 your computer back in to track to desktop.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In order to do that we first need to create a Bootable Windows 7 DVD/CD or USB so that we can run a System recovery option from DVD or USB.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may refer to the link given below to download Windows 7 ISO.</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After creating the Bootable media for Windows 7, Try to run a System repair from a disc.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persist please try run Bootrec.exe from the Windows Recovery option which mentioned below on the article:</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The easiest way might be to visit the mainboard manufacturer's website. This would normally have downloads for any RAID drivers needed to load Windows XP. The download may be an 'executable' that writes a floppy disk for you. It might also be something like
 a zip file with all the necessary files inside which have to be extracted and copied to a floppy disk.</p>
<p>If your PC doesn't have a floppy disk drive, life gets quite complicated.</p>
<span>
<p>Please mark this as helpful or answered if appropriate.</p>

<h3> arelbee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 taskbar mini-player is not working...Need professional help only please.</h2>
                    
<p>Until last week (for the previous 5 months since I have had this computer), I was able to minimize my Windows Media Player 11 to the taskbar as a mini-player.&nbsp; This function is no longer working.<br />
<br />
<strong>Facts:<br />
</strong>1) This worked for the past five months until last Thursday, November 18, 2009.<br />
2) I <strong>cannot</strong> do a system restore as <strong>I am not an administrator on this machine<br />
</strong>3) This PC receives updates via a "Personal Computer Version Manager (PCVM)" utility over a corporate network<br />
4) An update MAY have come across this machine that reset registry data concerning WMP (but I cannot verify this independently)<br />
5) The "Windows Media Player" option<strong> IS already checked</strong> on the toolbars option<br />
6) "regsvr32 wmp.dll" has been run successfully<br />
7) "regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\wmpband.dll" has been run successfully<br />
8) I have unchecked "Windows Media Player" on the taskbar, then rebooted, then reinstalled WMP 11<br />
9) #8 ran successfully but the mini-player still does not function properly<br />
10) All the multiple "minimize", "switch to compact-mode", and "restore down" options have been tried to no avail<br />
11) multiple search engines have been scoured and all the recommended steps in multiple forums have been tried to no workable solution<br />
<br />
Please help.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

Since this is on a Corporate network, I'd suggest talking to the Corporate IT guys about this instead....<br />

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I am running Windows XP (SP3) and Lotus Notes 6.5.&nbsp; I have recently installed the Widows Search Add-On for Lotus Notes that is supposed to allow me to index Lotus Notes emails.&nbsp; I have installed and configured the add-on per instructions&nbsp;(Mail File Location
 "Local",&nbsp;added to index list, etc).&nbsp; Problem is, no results are shown when a term is searched.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like it's not indexing (number of files didn't&nbsp;increase, didn't index after set-up, etc).<br />
<br />
Help!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div>I assume your using Windows 7 since you posted in this group so if you click the Start Menu Orb and then type System Restore in the search box and then hit return to start System Restore. Choose one of the
 entries that is dated before you made that change with the Windows Live Mail icon association and follow the prompts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This will not remove your data but if you have installed any other software since that time you will have to reinstall it.&nbsp; This should get you back to your correct associations.</div>

All of my icons are showing the internet explorer symbol.&nbsp; I don't know how in the world I did it but I truly need help.&nbsp; I am not very good with computers so please be patient.&nbsp; I tried the recovery option without any success.&nbsp; When this problem occurred was
 when I was trying to make my Window Live Mail icon to reappear after I removed it from the list in error.&nbsp; I was asked to associate it with a file, I clicked on the internet explorer file and all my icons took on that design.&nbsp; I thank you for your time and
 consideration.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h2>            Windows 10 Applications Randomly Minimizing.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am here because, as of late, any games I have been playing are randomly minimizing at an intervals between 5-10 minutes. It may not break my computer, but it is very annoying.</p>
<p>All the games that do this (that I have been playing lately) are...</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Every game I have played.</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p>I am looking for a way to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would guess that is has something to do with&nbsp;the "<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The beta feature EseDiskFlushConsistency is enabled in ESENT due to the beta site
 mode settings 0x800000</span>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>message I get whenever it happens and I am looking at the Windows Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me fix this issue.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several factors that may have caused the games to crash when you are playing them on your PC. It is possible that the graphics card is outdated or there is a malware or virus that causes the game files to corrupt. To properly isolate your concern,
 please provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the issue occur to all the games and apps installed on your computer?</li><li>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to resolve the issue?</li><li>Have you tried to update the graphics card drivers on your PC?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may <span>
click on this&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">link</span></a><span>&nbsp;for
 the steps to perform a clean boot. This process will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.&nbsp;</span><span>

    <title>Realtek wireless NIC causes heavy system load&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomhorsley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek wireless NIC causes heavy system load&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just noticed after a recent round of updates that the wireless adapter in my ASUS VivoPC (model VM40B) is apparently the source of gazillions of misaligned data interrupts. The "System" service is using at least 30 to 40% of the cpu all the time and poking
 around in it will a process viewer shows all the time going to those interrupts. If I go into device manager and disable the NIC, "System" drops back down to a more normal 3%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this sound familiar to anyone? Is there some property of the NIC or driver I can change to make it stop? I'm not sure if it was a recent update that caused it, I may simply have noticed it recently, but if there was an update to the driver, can I roll
 back to an older one and see if it works better?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. The adapter is a&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">RTL8821AE 802.11ac PCIe&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">Wireless</span><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">&nbsp;Network&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">Adapter

            <p>It was definitely worth a try, but it didn't seem to work. I get the same "System" using 40% of the CPU after enabling the NIC and installing the new driver (and even rebooting to make sure everything took). I guess I'll use the repeater for now and wait
 and see what happens with the Windows 10 upgrade in a few weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for finding the driver - I looked for a new one but couldn't manage to decrypt realtek's web site :-).</p>

            Hey! I got the Windows 10 upgrade yesterday and I can enable the wireless adapter without the CPU hitting 50% usage handling misaligned data exceptions, so it looks like Windows 10 did come with a better wireless driver for the realtek chip.

<p>We're sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>I understand the inconvenience this may have caused you but let me help you with that. As you mentioned, you're unable to click the "Remove account" as it was not highlighted. To address also your first concern, the folder pane is found on the left side
 of your Windows Live Mail where you found the Quick views. For your other concern, please make sure that you are right clicking your account and not the Quick views to remove the account. Here's a screenshot for a better view:</p>

<p>The box above in your answer does not appear when i downloaded windows live mail. I have 2 lines with send, delete, etc but not the box in your illustration. It happened to me earlier this year and i re-downloaded windows mail and the box and all its features
 as seen above appeared. Why doesn't it show up all the time when windows live mail is downloaded?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Clean out the side and bottom vents - be sure not to push any dust bunnies into the comptuer.<br />
Check to see the fan is actually working.&nbsp;Possibly add a cooling pad or other external fans.<br />
<br />
Check with a real computer shop, one that does its own in-shop service on Toshiba, or Toshiba's<br />
Support.<br />

<p>I actually use one of these on a P205-S6267 Toshiba - the internal fan quit working and this<br />
was a lot cheaper/easier than replacing the internal fan.<br />

<br />
There are a lot of cooling pads available - these are just a couple of examples<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 -I cannot print pictures</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I upgrade to Windows 10 I cannot print pictures.&nbsp; When I select the picture to print it goes to "not responding" and stays idle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called a support I.T group and I was told that "windows 10 does not have photo gallery" with the new upgrade and that Microsoft will need to upgrade it when they do future upgrades.</p>

<p>I called HP support team tech and they checked&nbsp; HP printer and they told me that he problem is with the Windows 10 software up grade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per HP tech team support: The reason why the HP desktop cant print to the HP printer because you can even open the pictures,it isnt even reaching the driver and the print option because we cant opent any JPEG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trouble shoot information you provided did not help.</p>

            Iwant to know what good Microsoft is anymore . Ever since I installed this 10 upgrade my computer is useless . Is Bill going to replace the one I had that worked ok sometimes on windows 7 ? I cannot believe that I have to sit here for over an hour just
 to try and print a GD picture. And when I make&nbsp; typo and have to backspace to correct it that doesn't even work right . What a total pack of effing useless azzholes Microsoft is now . I am so annoyed that I hope all of you overpaid pricks get some kind of
 disease. After posting this I am literally smashing this useless POS against the concrete out back . I am going to video it and then post it on youtube on how to fix the windows 10 printer problem . Then people can see what you solution is how totally useless
 it , all of you and windows 10 really is .
