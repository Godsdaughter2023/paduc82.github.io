<h2>            EAP-PEAP Authentication without Certificate - Is it fixed in Simbian Anna</h2>
                    
<p>Everyone knows the problem with Nokia devices have with EAP-PEAP authentication without certificates.</p>
<p>I know that there is no solution currently with Nokia devices running Simbian ^3 and because of this I am unable to connect to my office network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if this has been addressed in the upcoming "Anna" update to the OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is really shameful that everyone with an IPhone or Andriod phone is able to connect without issues and Nokia is not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to communicate with Nokia about this drawback...has anyone already done that? How about Maemo (the N900)..can you do this with Maemo (or the new MeeGo)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am really frustrated at the lack of solution for this very basic thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also hope that this issue will be fixed in Anna, although I wouldn't bet on it. Nokia has known about this issue for at least three years but refused to fix it, insisting that the way they have implemented EAP-PEAP is the only right way to do it. They
 don't care if you can connect or not. I believe the word describing this attitude is "sisu" in Finnish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, try this:<br />
1. On a laptop running Windows 7, connect to the wifi at your office. Confirm that you have internet access on the laptop.<br />
2. Go to Control Panel/Network and Internet/Network and Sharing Center<br />
3. In the middle of the screen, in the right-hand column, it should say "Connections: Wireless Network Connection". Click on this.<br />
4. Click "Wireless Properties"<br />
5. Click "Security"<br />
6. From top to bottom, you should see: WPA2-Enterprise, AES, Protected EAP (PEAP). Click on "Settings"<br />
7. You should now see a check mark next to "Validate server certificate" and "Connect to these servers:". (If "Validate server certificate" is not checked, check it manually and reconnect). Write down the web address of the server, in case you need it later.
 Scroll down on the list of "Trusted Certification Authorities" until you see one that has a check mark next to it. Write down the name of the certification authority (e.g., "Equifax Secure Certificate Authority"). Confirm that "Select Authentication Method"
 is "Secured password (EAP-MSCHAP v2) (don't change any settings, just make a note if these are not your settings).<br />
8. On your Nokia phone, go to EAP-PEAP settings/Authority certificate. From the pull-down menu, select the same certification authority that had a check mark next to it in step #7 above.</p>
<p>Try to connect now and let me know if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This worked for me and allowed me to connect my Nokia C7 to the wireless network at my workplace, a major university in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rationale behind the above method is that most servers do have a certificate even though they allow connecting initially without the certificate, as long as your wireless device also allows it (Symbian does not, unfortunately). You just need to find
 out what that certificate is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. It's Symbian, "Simbian". Although sometimes, like when dealing with these EAP-PEAP issues, I feel the most accurate name would be "Simian"&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>If you cannot find the correct certificate on your phone in step #8 above, you will have to download the certificate to your phone and install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this, use a laptop running Windows 7 to connect wirelessly to the WPA2 network. Go to step #7 above and scroll through the pull-down list. Write down the names of the certificates that have a check mark next to them. If there is only one certifcate
 with a check mark, that is the certificate you need to have on your phone. If there are several certificates with a check mark, uncheck them all, then reconnect. Windows may ask you to provide your userid and password to connect. After you are connected, go
 back to the list of certificates. You should now see only one certificate with a check mark next to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Again using your laptop, click on the Start</span> button, type <span>
certmgr.msc</span> into the <span>Search</span> box, and press ENTER. Find the certificate that you identified above. It should be under Trusted Root Certification Authorities or Third Party Root Certification Authorities.</span>﻿ Right-click on the certificate,
 the click All Tasks/Export. Export the certificate as a DER (.cer) file to your desktop. Copy the exported certificate file anywhere to your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your phone, use the file manager to navigate to the directory where you copied the certificate file. Tap on the file to install it. Now go to step #8 above, and you should see the new certificate in the pull-down menu. Tap on it to select it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your phone should now be able to connect to the WPA2 network. If your WPA2 connection works fine for months, and then one day stops working, a likely reason is that the person managing the wireless server decided to change the certificate on the server.
 (This happened to me recently). This is not a problem for anyone else except owners of Nokia phones, as all other wireless devices will automatically download and install the new certificate. But if you have a Nokia phone, you will have to follow the procedure
 above to find out what the new certificate is, and then either activate it on your phone or download and install it if necessary.</p>

<p>Hi kj55552009,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your attempt to bring up light in the darkness of Nokia EAP-PEAP.</p>
<p>Your recommendation to export the certificate from Notebook looks good.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it does not work.&nbsp;Neither on my E7 nor on E52. So I hope too,&nbsp;the problem is solved in Symbian ANNA. And for E52 in the new Version of Symbian which is available in the next weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, is there a way to switch off the certificate check in Symbian? I know, this is not the best solution, but it works. (Android and Blackberry do not check certificates, too)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>@Selbst: Thanks for your kind words!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The protocol I gave above for exporting the certificate using a laptop worked for me exactly the way I described in the protocol. I have a Nokia C7 running Symbian ^3, PR1.2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say exporting the certificate didn't work for you, can you be more specific? Were you able to identify the correct certificate using this method? Were you able to export it to a DER (.cer) file, copy to your phone, and install on your phone? Did
 the new certificate show in the pull-down menu on your phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To confirm that the certificate has been installed, go to menu/settings/phone/phone management/security settings/certificate management/trusted site certificates﻿</p>

<p>Hmm.. correct me if I'm wrong, but PEAP needs, by definition, a server certificate in order to make the secure tunnel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how an access point and/or android/iphones can work without a certificate.. unless they're calling it PEAP when it's not?</p>

<p>@reinob: According to this, a certificate is not required on the client side and it's up to the client to require it or not:</p>
<p><a href="https://supportforums.cisco.com/thread/2042239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://supportforums.cisco.com/thread/2042239</a>﻿</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some devices, such as Windows laptops, download and install the certificate automatically when they connect for the first time. I don't know if Android and iPhone do this or not. All I know is that they connect seamlessly, whereas Nokia phones require manual
 selection/downloading of a certificate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that if your WPA2 uses a proxy, I believe this is also automatically set up using a script downloaded from the server in Android and iPhone, but the proxy IP address needs to be entered manually in Nokia phones. Similarly, the primary
 and secondary DNS IP addresses need to be entered manually. In my case, I found these IP addresses on a web page of our information resources department.</p>

<p>Sorry for answering so late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@kj55552009: Exporting and installation of the certificate was no problem. I have deleted the old one and reinstalled the exported of my notebook. I can see it in the certificate management of my phone.</p>
<p>@reinob: My <span>colleagues with Android took the devices out of the box, saw our 802.1x ssid, connected to it and after typing userid and password the connection was done.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When&nbsp;I use a wrong certificate like Nokia&nbsp;Root CA, I see on my wlan controller that the authentification has failed. When I use our own certificate, I see nothing. It looks like, the device does not try to authenticate me.</span></p>

<p>@Selbst: Are you sure that your problem is not proxy settings rather than the certificate? Nokia phones, unlike Android and iPhone OS phones, are unable to download proxy settings automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your network requires a proxy, you won't be able to connect until you enter the proxy address manually in your phone. This was the case for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this. On your laptop, start Firefox (not IE) and confirm that your have internet connection. Go to Tools/Options/Network/Settings. If "no proxy" is selected, your network does not require a proxy. If "auto-detect" is selected, change it to "no proxy"
 and try to connect. If you are unable to connect, your network requires a proxy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact your network support for the proxy, or you can try this web page:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, we do not use a proxy - not compulsorily - only for users&nbsp;which have to connect to specific websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;more Nokia&nbsp;user with the PEAP problem. May it be, there is a problem between Nokia and Microsoft radius? What radius server&nbsp;do you use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm waiting for our system administrator. Then I will&nbsp;have a look&nbsp;on our configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any log files on the phone where I can see, whether the phone got&nbsp;our certificate? Or phone&nbsp;is waiting for certificate and timed out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience. I like my E7 and even more my E52. But I can not recommend it to our students and professors until PEAP works. They take more and more the "teenager phones" of other manufacturers ....</p>

    <title>The server you are trying to access is using an authentication - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas fehlmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version of Office.</h2>
                    <p>since windows update 1511, or since i installed the new office 2016 apps in my office 365 for small business environment, i got this message more and more frequently when my laptop starts, or tries to access the onedrive for business server using the groove.exe
 program. it was getting annoying. it lasts for weeks now. i tried several entries in the communities and found nothing helpful. i removed and reinstalled the office 2016 apps three times and nothing changed.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f3bea3bf-490d-4825-9b14-a376073b7dac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f3bea3bf-490d-4825-9b14-a376073b7dac" /></a></p>
<p>now i managed to identify where groove.exe resides (c:\program files\microsoft office\root\office16) and delete it to cap this nonsense. i know this solution does not help those poor people relying on microsoft and using good old groove under it's onedrive
 label to store and exchange sensitive data. i used it to share photos with my business colleagues; this no longer works but is not vital. the data once uploaded using groove are still safe on my sharepoint site and remain accessible using the browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i strongly urge microsoft to re-install the authentication protocol used by office 2016 because this issue turns its loyal users&nbsp;away from all its other cloud offerings. moreover, i expect a statement from microsoft why quality controls was not able to prevent
 this issue. it is a serious violation of the office 365 contracts with microsoft.</p>

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>Regarding the error message, I'd like to collect some information:<br />
1. Could you let us know the version of your OneDrive for Business (Groove.exe)?<br />
To check it, you can go to Task Manager-&gt; Microsoft OneDrive for Business (groove.exe)-&gt; Properties-&gt; Details.<br />
2. If it is 16.0, could you try the following steps?<br />
a. To check your Office 2016 client: Go to Control Panel &gt; Select the Microsoft Office Subscription &gt; right click &gt; Change &gt; Select Online Repair<br />

<p>Thanks, Jim, for your reply. I deleted Groove.exe because I was annoyed by the server authentication message. Even if not, your response is not helpful, as I won't delete anything in the OS that I don't know what it is. I expect from Microsoft Windows Update
 utility that it delivers what I purchased and payed for. I'm not willing to jeopardize sanity of my Office 365 that otherwise runs fine; I make my living from using Windows and Office, not from repairing installation.</p>
<p>However, I found it on my other laptop, and Groove.exe is Version 16.0.6366.2036 indeed. Going to Control Panel on the main laptop, there is no Microsoft Office Subscription. however, on 'Programs and Features' have four language versions of the Microsoft
 Office 365 Small Business Premium, en-us, de-de, it-it, fr-fr, all updated 2.1.2016, plus "Korrekturhilfen 2013 Deutsch" and "Proofing Tools 2013 Italiano". the latter two I wonder whether I should uninstall. &nbsp;There is nothing like a Groove or OneDrive apps.</p>
<p>Finally, I cannot see how deleting credentials stored in a cache should change server authentication protocols on server side. I regularly delete cache using CCleaner and Disk Cleanup. I know the URL of my.sharepoint.com but trying to reconnect the Groove
 client to it didn't help either. It looks to me like the server needs repair, not the client.</p>

<p>I found a technical answer relating to Windows 10:</p>
<p>community.office365.com/.../1059674</p>
<p>There are many other threads since May 2015, relating to the same problem. It is not fixed yet. Thus, the best suggestion is not to use OneDrive for Business. You cannot rely on it for your cloud data. I still cannot understand how deleting a cache can change
 server authentication. As a minimum, the above error message is telling the wrong thing. Maybe, Microsoft is no longer interested in SharePoint and Groove, and simply stopped due maintenance.</p>
<p>The fix should go into Windows Update and Office 365 install, not by deleting hidden folders. I won't re-install OneDrive for Business. As a reliable cloud service, I use TresorIt, anyway. So, for me the issue is solved. But for Microsoft, we have a problem.</p>

<p>Trying the technical fix didn't work - after deleting ...AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\Spw it was not possible to delete ...AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\OfficeFileCache because it helds the Microsoft Access Database. Repairing Office worked fine
 for a few other issues (Outlook didn't recognize .ics any longer) but not the Groove.exe issue. It restored the same oldish version 16.0.6366.2036 as anywhere else.</p>
<p>So, not even the technical fix works. When will Microsoft fix its products?</p>

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>I notice that you’ve reviewed thread here 
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/p/413010/1059674#1059674. Please understand that as explained there, the issue is related to the client side, and may occur after upgrading the OneDrive for Business sync client from 2013 to 2016. So, first we’d
 like to confirm that you’ve followed the steps to manually start the processes:</p>
<p>1. Open Task Manager and end the processes <b>GROOVE.exe</b> and <b>MSOSYNC.exe</b>.<br />
2. Find the <b>CSISYNCCLIENT</b><b>.exe</b>. (E.g. at <b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\vfs\ProgramFilesCommonX64\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE16</b>)<br />
3. Right-click on the file and select <b>Run as administrator</b>. (Check in Task Manager to confirm that it is running.)<br />
4. Re-run the <b>MSOSYNC.exe</b> and<b> GROOVE.exe</b> at <b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16</b> with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>If the issue remains, for involving the escalated team for further looking into the issue, I’ve sent a private message to collect some logs and your tenant information. You can access the private message via
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.</p>

<p>Hi LingYu, </p>
<p>thanks for trying again. I did steps 1) to 4) exactly as written, all works as you describe, but the issue remains exactly the same as before. I found (after re-installing Office 16 using the Repair feature in Control Panel). I don't think it's a client
 problem; the error message clearly points to the server not supporting the protocol used by GROOVE.EXE version 16.0.6366.2036. Although the error message itself might be wrong - faulty error messages are nothing unusual...</p>

<h2>            Cant see Video participants</h2>
                    With the new update to Skype for Mac(using Mac mini w latest Sierra, I am unable to see all the participants in a video group call. The others (including me) can see me but I could only see 1 other participant and others popped onto my desktop not within
 the Skype screen(which is smaller) once or twice.&nbsp; How can I fix it back where all others(2) are also displayed. I am getting the audio on all of the group. Same call my messages did not go through to several of the participants. The new format is very confusing.D

    <title>Lumia 1520 Battery Replacement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> no idlady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 1520 Battery Replacement</h2>
                    <p>The battery on my Lumia 1520 (27 months old) needs to be replaced, and for the life of me, I'm not finding who in the US provides fee-based out of warranty service.&nbsp; Can anyone please point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I've done all the troubleshooting -- the battery is just not&nbsp;holding a charge anymore.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried unsuccessfully to find the info on my own, so then I went into my carrier's (AT&amp;T) store where I purchased the phone -- they didn't know since Nokia is owned by Microsoft &amp; directed me back to the Microsoft web site.&nbsp; I
<strong>again</strong>&nbsp;got&nbsp;to:</p>
<p>"If these troubleshooting steps didn't help fix the problem with your phone,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.b2x.com/microsoftphonesupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">click here</span></a>&nbsp; for more help from our partners at B2X,
 a Microsoft authorized customer service provider."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After entering my IMEI, B2X&nbsp;continues to tell me:</p>
<p>"We currently do not offer out-of-warranty services in your country. Please contact your point of sale for support."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like I'm stuck in Groundhog Day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found the DIY instructions on the Internet, and if I wasn't recovering from thumb surgery, I'd give it a try.&nbsp; And I'm not interested in shelling out money for a new phone because there aren't current ones I'm excited about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't object to having to pay to have the battery replaced -- I just don't know who in the US does it and will appreciate being pointed in the right direction.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for the suggestion&nbsp;&amp; getting me to think outside the box!&nbsp; I live in a rural area -- we don't have any&nbsp;cell phone repair shops within 90+ miles.&nbsp; With one exception:&nbsp; we have a local computer shop that's also an authorized Apple&nbsp;service provider.&nbsp;
 I've done computer business with them for years&nbsp;&amp; think very highly of their PC work, but it never occurred to me to ask if they could replace the Lumia's battery because it's not an iPhone until your response.&nbsp; Thanks to your suggestion, I called and the
 wonderful news is that they've got a guy who probably can do it!&nbsp; I won't know for sure until Monday when he's back at work, but I'm optimistic.&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>

<p>I downloaded the cisco networking academy from my schools site. Once I opened the file I got a message that said and I'm paraphrasing"Windows Internet Explorer can't open these files and to try; Macromedia Flash or IrfanView. I tried to use Adobe MacroMedia
 Flash and that didn't even give me the avalon for cisco. But I downloaded IrFanView and it pulled up the index page which is the genesis to this networking academy. On this index page which I can now access since I downloaded IrFanView which was referred to
 my by Windows; and at the bottom of this page sais just like this </p>
<p>"undefined</p>
<p>ERROR" without the quotation marks but undefined on top of ERROR. When I click on Launch Course it sais "Internet Explorer can't download unspecified error." Now I got this message after I went to IrfanView which Microsoft told me to do. I was told from
 a buddy at work to go to Internet Explorer and go to Tools-Internet Options-Security-Custom Level-Enter and look at the settings and then change the settings from Medium-High (default) to Medium and see if that makes a difference and it did not. Please help
 as it would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Blank Help Topics in Microsoft Office Applications</h2>
                    Hello. Whenever I press the F1 key in an office application I get a blank help topic. I should get a list of links and a search box. This occurs in all of my Microsoft Office applications. I took my computer to the Microsoft store. The technicians backed
 up my data, reinstalled Windows 10, and restored my data. After doing all of this, I still get blank help topics in all of the office applications. I'm not the only person who has had this problem. if any of you have, please tell me how you solved it. Thanks
 so much.

            <p>The F1 key in Office should open up a Microsoft Edge window that searches Bing for the phrase "How to get help in Windows 10," which isn't much help, especially if you've chosen to skip installing Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get help within Office 365 (I'll use Word as an example):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Click into the lightbulb text that says, "Tell me what you want to do."</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47022311-98d7-4171-b8d8-91ff8acd5183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47022311-98d7-4171-b8d8-91ff8acd5183" height="241" width="383" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Now type the topic you need help with:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8eab1066-45dc-4ecf-95de-3041679a733c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8eab1066-45dc-4ecf-95de-3041679a733c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Here it's trying to guess what I need help with.&nbsp; You can select one of Word's guesses or Get Help.&nbsp; This is what you get selecting Get Help:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46151910-6356-43af-87ed-22660cd73650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46151910-6356-43af-87ed-22660cd73650" height="347" width="241" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, you can select Smart Lookup.&nbsp; This will open the Smart Lookup pane, which looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4998a6ad-39e0-40dd-9931-787d6dd85e39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4998a6ad-39e0-40dd-9931-787d6dd85e39" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason F1 is no longer the gateway for help in Windows 10 is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3e99c8b-5114-413b-b99f-ec6668ac556e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3e99c8b-5114-413b-b99f-ec6668ac556e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see what she has to say:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/669ade67-a3eb-4a99-98ab-c360bf17398e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/669ade67-a3eb-4a99-98ab-c360bf17398e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmmm, not much there.&nbsp; But these are all the current gateways to get help for Office now.</p>

            Hello TodAlbertson. Thanks so much for your reply. Yes, I activated the Tell Me What You Want to do option and entered some text. After entering text I got some help topics. When I press the Enter key to activate the help topic I still get a blank help
 topic. I tried this in both word and access. The Office Anter Desk support people don't have a clue. They just want me to create test profiles. I'm convinced that that's not the answer and that they are guessing rather than doing their job and getting to the
 root cause.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>For the F1 key, you should get a Microsoft Edge window.&nbsp; The Edge icon looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20a5457a-026c-43f1-bccf-1a210bdeb7a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20a5457a-026c-43f1-bccf-1a210bdeb7a7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you press the F1 key with an Office application open, does it open an Edge window?&nbsp; If it does and it's blank, you may not be connected to the internet.&nbsp; The Edge window should connect you to this page:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35f0f989-57e1-4195-9c45-e8adb6cd900d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35f0f989-57e1-4195-9c45-e8adb6cd900d" height="450" width="567" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As for built-in help, for the last two days (this is since I replied to your question before), Office has been displaying this message for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26dbfc72-dca0-4b19-bc01-4a3e0bc9b39d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26dbfc72-dca0-4b19-bc01-4a3e0bc9b39d" /></a></p>
<p>which suggests to me that they've disabled the functionality.&nbsp; This probably means that they are reprogramming Help and it will be available again in a future update.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The window says, "Help isn't working, but you can still go to Office.com to get the latest and greatest articles, videos, and training courses."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to fix this issue by resetting the browser, but I'm not sure that will help you.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you may want to try it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open Internet Explorer (not Edge).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click on the Tools icon (it looks like a gear).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Select Internet Options.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Click on the Advanced tab.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; At the bottom of the window, there's a button that says, Reset...</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Click on it.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I don't know if that will help you.&nbsp; It appears that in the new Office programs, F1 connects only&nbsp;to the online help.&nbsp; To get to the built-in help, there are three ways to do it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Go to the lightbulb box and type in a question; selecting the option with the blue-and-white question mark will open help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; When you hover over an item in the ribbon, help is accessed by clicking on the question mark within the ToolTip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Within an open window (such as the Format Paragraph or Format Font windows), there is a question mark in the upper-right corner of the window.&nbsp; Clicking on that will open help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to access the built-in help using F1 in all these contexts and in every single case, F1 opens up the Edge window for online help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a way to reprogram what&nbsp;the F-keys control (File&gt;Options&gt;Customize Ribbon&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts), but for that you'd probably be better off having someone do it for you (like a tech guy at the Microsoft Store).</p>

            <p>Hello TodAlbertson. I tried resetting the browser and no luck. When I activate the Tell me what you want to do and type in an Item, I can see the help topics but when I activate one, I get the blank window. I appreciate your help but have not been successful
 yet. I got a piece of advise from one tech support person that told me to rename the help folder and perhaps do a reinstall. I also went to office.com and couldn't find any help articles or tutorials.</p>

            Hi JuliCoady,<br />
<br />
Does the issue happen only on one specific account?<br />
<br />
Because from what we checked it seems that the error indicates receiving email address doesn't exist. Sounds like the person you are sending the email to does not have that email address any longer.<br />
<br />
As a workaround, have them send you an email then, you can get their exact email address and add or update your contact correctly.<br />
<br />
Get back to us with the outcome and don't hesitate to reply on this thread.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Could you pl tell me, why you have not provided calling option for fb messenger in WP8, model no. Lumia 520.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what reason you Microsoft have blocked that option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And DR Driving is also not available in WP8, Lumia 520.... Why you Microsoft are not releasing apps and games ???</p>

<p>Facebook is the developer for messenger, not Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Sharing Office 365  with 5 users&#63;</h2>
                    <br />
<p>I&nbsp; read this post (below)&nbsp; and have not seen an answer:&nbsp; I have the same situation with office 365 Home shared.&nbsp; I want to load on my home desktop as (1 of the 5 users); and&nbsp; both my husband and I will use this desktop but with separate log-ins (microsoft
 accounts).&nbsp; Is this possible?&nbsp; or is this considered 2 of the 5 users but on 1 computer?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we each have our own laptops; we each have our own Android smartphones; and we both have several&nbsp; tablets a piece (1 IOS &amp; 1 Android and 2 windows). Can we install office 365 Home on all of our devices using our personal microsoft log-in account?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Will&nbsp; these count as separate users??&nbsp; Or just 2 users (2 accounts); And subsequently will we still have 2 users left to share Offie 365 Home with?<br />
</p>
<p>FORMER POST I didnt see answer to:</p>
<p>I've been using Office 365, 2013 for some time now and I share my 5 installs with family members, wife and kids. We have one desktop with a 27in screen of which everyone has a login account on and my install is used on this one computer of which they can
 logon and use Office under their own account. The other four Office 365 subscriptions are used to install on their own personal laptops of which they can logon to and use Office with no issue. A few days ago I updated my Office 365 subscription to the 2016
 edition which is fine but now the issue is that the desktop computer of which everyone uses when they are home because of the nice large screen, Office is counting each login account on that one computer when they sign into Office as 5 separate installs on
 one computer. When they are at school or away and want to use their personal laptops they can't unless I log in and deactivate their account on the desk top which technically has only one install then they can log in on their personal laptops. Office 365,
 2013 allowed the family to share my one install on the one family desktop across all login accounts on that one computer while they still had their one install on their personal laptops. Now with Office 365, 2016 if 5 family members have 5 login accounts on
 one computer it counts as 5 installs on one computer, so Ive gone back to Office 2013 until there is a fix. Has anyone else run into this issue or is there something I'm doing wrong?

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be informed that installing Office application using Office 365 subscription on Windows PC and using it through two different Windows user account will not consume two license of Office 365
 Home. <span>&nbsp;</span>Office installation on different system will be counted as different license consumption for Office 365 home. So if you install Office 365 on Android phone and Android tablet using your Microsoft account will be counted as two different
 installation for Office 365 Home. </span></p>
<p>

    <title>Outlook Calendar saving meeting requests as blank ics calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnmarsiano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Calendar saving meeting requests as blank ics calendar</h2>
                    <p>In my Outlook calendar, I have multiple calendars called MeetingRequest.ics and MeetingRequest.vcs-1.ics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've gotten the same results setting up my credentials on multiple computers so I'm lead to believe it's a setting with Exchange. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think they're created either when I set up a meeting or accept a meeting, not sure which.</p>
<p>Any idea as to what could cause these to be created instead of just populating my default calendar?</p>

<p>Your "Application.ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs (Mypath &amp; Myname)" causes the BeforeSave event to fire, whichis why you see it twice.&nbsp; Disable events with Application.EnableEvents = False at the start and re-enable at the end.</p>

                    I am using Microsoft Word 2003. I can save documents using the icon or ctrl+S but the 'Save' option has disappeared from the File menu. This is the case in all Word documents on my computer, including new ones. Can anyone tell me how to get it back? Obviously
 there isn't a problem with saving per se, so why would it just disappear from the menu?

            <p>The thread that ahaap sent you to provides a number of things to look at. The error is a generic failure that can be cause by many things including conflicting security software, services disabled, file corruption, permissions, and registry problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It advises you to contact Support of all else fails, but in the US and Canada there is no longer any assisted support and you end up back here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll provide the generic reply, which echoes some of what ahaap has already provided:</p>
<p>What operating system and service pack?</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

            <p>Thank you for getting back to us, Anne. We suggest that you back up your photos and videos. It will automatically upload your photos and videos to OneDrive and get to them later from any computer or device that connects to the web. (This might use your data
 plan and incur charges.) </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To turn on auto upload:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the App list, tap <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Backup</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Tap <strong>Photos + videos</strong>, and then choose one of the following for your photos and for your videos:
<ul>
<li>Tap <strong>Don't upload</strong> if you don't want to automatically upload your photos or videos.</li><li>Tap <strong>Good quality</strong> to automatically upload photos at a resolution that uses less data and OneDrive storage space. (This option isn't available for videos on Windows Phone 8.1.)</li><li>Tap <strong>Best quality</strong> to automatically upload photos or videos at the highest possible resolution.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll need a Wi-Fi connection to automatically upload videos and best-quality photos.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop inking in Word 2010&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>In my Office 2010 Professional Word 2010 there is no stop inking command, either in the ribbon, or in the customize ribbon commands, as there was in Word 2007.</p>
<p>How do I stop inking? Once the pen is selected, I can't get out of inking, and this is infuriating.</p>
<p>I am also getting a shadow cursor alongside the pen, which changes according to the last pen tool selected, and which I can't get rid of.</p>
<p>I have tried repairing Office 2010 to no avail.</p>
<p>Help, please!</p>

            I wish it were as easy as that, especially as that is the obvious solution. It doesn't work. Nothing happens, the pens stay as pens. The bar remains highlighted. I do need a solution to this if anyone has one.

            I had the same issue, and can 't figure out why there is no "Stop inking" button. &nbsp; &nbsp;Pressing ESC on the keyboard was the only way I could reliably exit inking mode, so my work around &nbsp;for my tablet was to create a macro for the &nbsp;ESC key and place a button
 for the macro on myquick access toolbar. It comes in handy anytime I want to press ESC, but don't want to call up the on-screen keyboard, and works as a "Stop inking" key when making ink annotations.

            The escape key does work but I use the "select object" button in the Ink Tools ribbon.&nbsp; It's not intuitive.&nbsp; I would rather have the stop inking button back from Office 2007.&nbsp;

            <p>I have looked for how to "stop inking" in Word 2016. Online it tells me to look for "pens" in the File, Options, Advanced but it don't see "pens" there. I also don't have a "pens" category in the Review tab. Does anyone have any advice?&nbsp;I read&nbsp;that there
 once was a button in Word 2007 - has this been added again?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

 this page previously.&nbsp; I opened OneNote on my desktop, the page was there.&nbsp; As soon as I opened it, it disappeared as well.&nbsp; I looked in the History Notebook Recycle bin and it is not there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine if something like this is to be expected while using OneNote, then OneNote is not worth using at all.</p>

<p><span>Hi <strong>Jmonca</strong>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As what mentioned, a specific OneNote page has disappeared when you’re working on it through mobile and also on your desktop. To confirm, are you using an
<strong>Android</strong> or an <strong>iOS</strong> device? Did you open OneNote on your PC using
<strong>OneNote 2016</strong> or <strong>OneNote for Windows 10</strong>? See this image for the difference:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/858369c8-c4fb-4472-a531-8e3c6fcb1ed3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/858369c8-c4fb-4472-a531-8e3c6fcb1ed3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>Have you tried checking the <strong>other pages on your OneNote</strong> if the same behavior will be observed when working on those pages? Or is it just happening to a
<strong>specific page only</strong>?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For further isolation, I’d suggest that you open the same OneNote page through
<strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/notebooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote Online</a></strong>. Then, you may check if the page will also disappear from there or not. This will help us identify if the issue occurs across all platforms of OneNote or a conflict with a particular
 OneNote page.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In reference to the lost notes, you may check the suggested steps
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/find-my-lost-notes-32cb2bd7-afe7-44d2-a711-398a88421287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> on how to find or retrieve it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</span>

<p>I figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved a page from one section to another on my laptop.&nbsp; I put the laptop to sleep, it turns out the page was en route to the destination section when the laptop went to sleep.&nbsp; This meant the sync recorded the page leaving the original section, but not
 yet reaching the destination section. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening OneNote on other devices showed the page "missing" simply because the devices hadn't received the instruction to paste the page to the destination folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Thanks for helping.</p>

</p><p>Give us the FULL and EXACT error message text (and error code if any) you are getting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2013 introduced a new way of licensing office software. Sometimes they associated it with your email account rather than with the hardware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS "<em>improved</em>" the 2013 one time payment license terms to allow it to be installed on only one computer at a time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also "<em>improved</em>" the way the product key is stored on the computer so we no longer can extract the full key, just the last 5 char (enough to match it to a record of the full key).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have the full 25 character Product Key? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you take the option to "associate" your 2013 license with your email account. Log in to the MyAccount site with your email and see if you can find your license there. If you can, then you can install from there.</p>

<p>Office 2013 is a little tricky, it is an intermediate step between&nbsp; how activation was done in 2010 and earlier and how it is now done in 2016/365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2010 and earlier activation was associated with the computer / hardware.</p>
<p>In 2016/365 it is now only associated with a specific email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2013 it could be either one. By default it still went to the hardware, but there was an option (that most people didn't use) to also associate it with the an email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although as I understand, it is possible to use gmail accounts to activate Office, the second message implies that you did not use that account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last screen capture shows that you apparently used the MS email account to activate Office 2013.&nbsp; What does that screen say to the right of the Office 2013 Home&nbsp; &amp; Student entry, under the error box. Please translate it.&nbsp;

<p>under the error box there is the install button and the button to show the product key.</p>
<p>i have already tried to uninstall the program completely using the program in the page, then i reinstalled it and the same message comes out.</p>
<p>the strange thing is that One Note runs, while Word doesn't, so I don't understand.</p>

            Don't join the workgroup.&nbsp; Just stay with your system.mdw file.&nbsp; You use a SHORTCUT to open any databases using that other workgroup.

    <title>Windows 10 on Lumia 1020 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garethmostyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 on Lumia 1020</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know if Microsoft are going to allow the Lumia 1020 to upgrade to windows 10.</p>
<p>I am trying out Grove music but there is no point having it at all if I cannot use it on my phone. It can only be used on a windows 10 phone. So there is no point having it until&nbsp;MS allow my phone to&nbsp;upgrade.</p>
<p>I have seen no announcements saying they cannot upgrade the 1020 to W10 nor saying they&nbsp;do not wish to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am &nbsp;quite happy with my phone and I have no intention to buy a new one just for Groove music.
</p>
<p>Anyone have the answer out there?</p>
<p>

    <title>No thumbnails anymore in Photos folder in My Phone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No thumbnails anymore in Photos folder in My Phone</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>since a couple of days I notice, that if I want to view my photos in the My Phone web site that this doesn't work anymore. If I click on "Phone" -&gt; "Photos", I don't get any preview pictures (thumbnails) anymore, only the typical "picture" you get in any
 website when a picture can't be found on the web server (a red cross).&nbsp;If I click on a specific picture in the list, I get some sort of a "standard picture" (sea-view with hills and blue sky) displayed, but not the real picture itself.</p>
<p>If I download such pictures to my PC, the picture is ok.</p>
<p>So my question is: why do my pictures not correctly display within the My Phone web site (neither the pictures, nor the thumbnails)?</p>
<p>Looking forward to a hopefully helpful answer :-)</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Franz</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I checked it myself and my pictures are displayed correctly. Maybe there was a temporary problem with MyPhone. Do you still have the same problem ?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but the issue still exists as descibed above. Too sad, that I can't provide a screenshot here to clearly show the problem...</p>
<p>Any ideas what's wrong?</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />

            <p>I to only see the little blue microsoft circle with the blue line through it where the thumbnail should be. I also cannot see my photos in either slideshow or by clicking on them. All I see are filenames generated by the camera phone. The pictures are fine
 on my phone just the web interface for microsoft myphone picture viewing is completely useless.</p>
