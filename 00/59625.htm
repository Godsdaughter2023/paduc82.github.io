<h2>            possible scam</h2>
                    <p>I have an app Magic Jigsaw Puzzles. Just a few min ago I opened it. I got&nbsp; popup that states</p>
<p>"""The server activatenotification.win is asking for your user name and&nbsp; password. The server reports that it is from someone trying to steal your banking details, credit card details &amp; other logins. Please call Microsoft at 1-855-391-2888 immediately to
 prevent data loss""". I feel this is a scam but do need to know for sure. Can anyone advise me.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting error message for winsock.dll.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the below information.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Did you&nbsp;make any changes to the pc prior to this issue?</div>
<div>Do&nbsp;you have a wired net connection or a wireless net connection?</div>
<div>Which browser are you using on the pc?</div>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to run the network troubleshooter:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;On the bottom right corner, right click on the network symbol.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click on troubleshoot problems.<br />
c.&nbsp;Run the troubleshooter, and check what it shows.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Try to run the commands in command prompt and check if it helps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Click on start menu.<br />
b.&nbsp;In the search, type cmd.<br />
c.&nbsp;From the search list, right click on cmd and select run as administrator.<br />
d.&nbsp;In the command prompt, type the below command and press enter.<br />
IPCONFIG /RELEASE<br />
NETSH INT IP RESET RESETLOG.TXT<br />
NETSH WINSOCK RESET<br />
IPCONFIG /REGISTERDNS<br />
IPCONFIG /FLUSHDNS<br />
IPCONFIG /RENEW<br />
e.&nbsp;Type exit after command and reboot the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>If you are facing this issue with a wifi connection then you can try to reset the wifi router to check if that helps. Further you can also plug in an Ethernet cable to check the status.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>I hope this helps. Please let us know the results. Feel free to write us back for any further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

<h3> andrewc37  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I install a font when my computer gives me NO option to do so&#63; &#40;I&#39;ve tried everything&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My computer won't let me install fonts.<br />
<br />
I realize I'm very late to this conversation, but it seems like every tech help forum I go to regarding this topic is 5 or 6 years old. So here's hoping I get a response. I am a graphic designer and desperately need to use other fonts than the ones I have on
 my computer.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have tried every method suggested by forums and Windows Helpers on the Internet:<br />
<br />
- I have tried double clicking the TrueType font file. Nothing happens.<br />
- I have tried right clicking the TrueType font file to hit "Install." There is no "Install" option in the right-click dropdown menu.<br />
- I have tried dragging and dropping the TrueType font file into Control Panel &gt; Fonts. It does not appear.<br />
- I have tried copying and pasting the TrueType font file into Control Panel &gt; Fonts. It does not let me paste.<br />
- I have tried going into Control Panel &gt; Fonts and clicking File &gt; Install font. There is no "Install font" option under File.<br />
- I have tried moving the TrueType font file to my Desktop in order to install it from there. It does not allow me to move it to my Desktop.<br />
- My user account is an Administrator account. There is absolutely no reason my computer should be restricting me from installing anything.<br />
<br />
Thank you, and I pray you respond.</p>

            Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Also, you can try reinstalling your printer:
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X, click Apps &amp; Features or Programs and Features
<br />Select your printer.
<br />Select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R, type control, hit Enter
<br />Open Devices and Printers.
<br />In the Devices and Printers window look for your Printer. If you see it listed, right-click on it and choose "Delete" or "Remove Device.”
<br />
<br />Open up the run command with the "Windows Key + R" key combo.
<br />Type printui.exe /s and click OK.
<br />Click on Drivers tab.
<br />Look for Printer driver. If you see it click on it and click Remove at the bottom.
<br />Select OK.
<br />Select Apply and OK on the Print Server Properties windows.
<br />Close Devices and Printers.
<br />
<br />Proceed to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />If the problem persists, then I recommend trying a repair upgrade:

                    When I try to connect to a printer connected via USB to a Windows 8 PC from a Windows XP or Windows 7 PC, it asks for a username and password.&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; I never had to enter a username and password when the printer was connected to a Windows XP
 PC and would rather not now.&nbsp; Is there a way to disable this?

<h2>            Reset my Xbox Achievements &#40;XBLIT&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Xbox LIVE Inforcement Team</p>
<p>Can you reset my Xbox Achievements?</p>
<p>Games like Gears of War and Gears of War 2 are glitchy and have unlock all achievements in a unlegit way. I got my Xbox Account full privacy settings set up to me only so nobody sees my Xbox Achievements and can File Complaints me. The last thing I want
 to see is I got a BAN and my Xbox Achievements reset.</p>
<p>I thought I'd call Xbox UK today but they gave me the only thing they can and it is me asking the Xbox LIVE Inforcement Team on the Xbox Forums to try support me and reset my Xbox Achievements. Hopefully someone can.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

            <p>I have to add, that since the achievements were unlocked in a unlegitimate way, the gamerscore for the account will likely be reset in the future.</p>
<p>Which means all unlocked achievements for all games on that account will be reset to 0. You won't be able to get earn achievements again with the account.</p>

<h2>            Come promuovere un account bambino ad account adulto &#91;How to promote a child account to adult account&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Ho già letto molte discussioni su questo argomento ma non ho ancora trovato una soluzione.</p>
<p>Non riesco a far diventare adulto il mio account nonostante l'età registrata sia maggiorenne.</p>
<p>Grazie in anticipo&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation -&nbsp;I have already read many discussions on this topic but I have not yet found a solution.</strong><br />
<strong>I can't get my account to become an adult despite the age recorded.</strong><br />

<h2>            my mass storage device not showing on device manager</h2>
                    I was just given a mass storage device with vital data to transfer to my computer. when I connected the device there was an error in installing the USB mass storage device driver and I cannot find it in either the device manager nor my computer. I only
 knew that it was connected when it brought the USB mass storage device driver error. I've tried a lot of solutions that were posted online but still, nothing happened. I really need the data in there, urgent help needed, please.

<h2>            Elegiant BM-100FX Microphone and Realtek HD Audio Manager issues</h2>
                    I have an Elegiant BM-100FX plug and play microphone, and when i plug it &nbsp;into my computer and when it goes to the RealTek Audio Manager there are only 2 options, Headphone/Headset, and Speaker Out. I have tried updating the driver but it says it is fully
 updated. I look in the Recording Devices and it is neither the RealTek Microphone nor the Stereo mix. I have an Asus laptop (i dont know how to check the specs), and it works on my brothers laptop, which is also an Asus, but on his audio manager there is the
 Mic In option. Does anyone know what I can do to make this work?

<p>We appreciate the information you provided. Since your computer can't detect the microphone, we recommend contacting the manufacturer to check if this particular device model is compatible with the latest build of Windows 10. They'll also be able to tell
 you if there's a specific driver for this microphone that you need to install on your computer for the device to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after contacting the manufacturer.</p>

            My suggestion would be to go to the Cannon and locate&nbsp; the latest Windows 8 drivers for your printer and download and install them. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

<p><span><span>The error code 815 means that the broadband network connection could not be established on your computer because the remote server is not responding. Also, I notice that
 the connection was fine for a few days and broke suddenly. In this case, I suggest contacting your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to check the issue first.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the connection can be established by using other device/system, please create a new administrator account on the Windows Vista machine to troubleshoot the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click<strong>Start</strong> , type
<strong>user account</strong> , and click the <strong>User Accounts</strong> control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the User Account control panel, click<strong>Manager another account</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click<strong>Create a new account</strong> , type an account name, select

<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logoff and logon with the new account and establish the connection to check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<h2>            Reset Windows Update Components with package from Update Catalog</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft (and others),</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem that needs a bit of explanation. I work at a university and am trying to retire an old WSUS machine since we've moved to SCCM. The problem is that I have 9 computers that are still reporting to the old WSUS. These machines are no longer
 on campus nor are they part of the campus AD any more. These computers are owned by former students or faculty. I do not have physical access to these machines. Nor can I use the AD to configure them with GPOs. I do not have the ability to remote into them,
 contact the owners, run scripts on them, or anything of the sort. I don't want to turn off the WSUS machine and leave these people with machines that will have problems being patched. I want to reset the Windows Update components on these machines, and there
 are a number of ways to do that. But, as I wrote, I don't have the ability to access these machines either physically or remotely to accomplish this task with all the ways currently available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is one possibility. I can't do it but Microsoft can. These machines will trust updates signed by Microsoft, including ones downloadable from the Update Catalog. So if Microsoft were to create a package to reset the Windows Update components
 then I could solve my problem. I would download this package into the WSUS from the Update Catalog an assign it to the computers. The machines would trust the package and execute it, and the machines would be properly getting their updates straight from Microsoft
 and not my old WSUS server. Really all the package needs to do is to delete the keys in HKLM\software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate and set default Registry keys for HKLM\Software\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate. My testing shows this will
 solve the problem for me, so some of the other steps I've seen on TechNet don't seem necessary (stopping the services, deleting file directories, etc).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For information, the computers in question are mainly Windows 7 but there are a couple Windows 8 machines and one Vista computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, having written all that, would Microsoft be willing to create such a package and publish it to the Update Catalog for use?<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>-Craig</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As far as how to do it, see the other replies you will likely get. But let me say the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why do you want to do this? For most people it's usually a mistake. Here's the text of an article on the subject I wrote a while back:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*The Question*</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How many partitions should I have on my hard drive, what should I use each one for, and how big should each of them be?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It’s a common question, but unfortunately one that doesn’t have a single simple answer, right for everyone. Many people will answer with the way they do it, but their answer isn’t necessarily best for the person asking (in many cases it isn’t even right
 for the person responding).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*The Terminology*</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First, let’s get the terminology right. Some people ask "should I partition my drive?" That’s the wrong question, because the terminology is a little strange. Some people think that the term "partition" means to divide the drive into two or more partitions.
 That’s not correct: to partition a drive is to create one or more partitions on it. You have to have at least one partition on it to use it. Those people who think they have an unpartitioned drive actually have a drive with only a single partition on it, and
 it’s normally called C:. The choice you have is whether to have more than one partition, not whether to partition at all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*Some History*</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Back before Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (also known as Windows 95B) was released in 1996, all MS-DOS and Windows hard drives were set up using the FAT16 file system (except for very tiny ones using FAT12). Because only 16 bits were used for addressing,
 FAT16 has a maximum partition size of 2Gb.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hard drives larger than 2GB were rare in those days, but if you had one, you had to have multiple partitions to use all the available space. But even if your drive was no bigger than 2GB, FAT16 created another severe problem for many people–the size of the
 cluster was bigger if you had a bigger partition. Cluster sizes went from 512 bytes for a partition no bigger than32Mb all the way up to 32Kb for a partition of 1Gb or greater.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The larger the cluster size, the more space is wasted on a hard drive. That’s because space for all files is allocated in whole clusters only. If you have 32Kb clusters, a 1-byte files takes 32Kb, a file one byte larger than 32Kb takes 64Kb, and so on. On
 the average, each file wastes about half of its last cluster.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So large partitions create a lot of waste (called "slack"). With a 2GB FAT16 drive in a single cluster, if you have 10,000 files, each wasting half of a 32Kb cluster, you waste about 160Mb to slack. That’s a substantial portion of a drive that probably cost
 over $400 back in 1996–around $32 worth.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So what did people do? They partitioned their 2GB drive into two, three, or more logical drives. Each of those logical drives was smaller than the real physical drive, had smaller clusters, and therefore less waste. If, for example, they could keep all partitions
 under 512Mb, cluster size was only 8Kb, and the waste was reduced to a quarter of what it would otherwise be.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>People partitioned for other reasons too, but back in the days of FAT16, this was the main reason for doing so.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*The Present*</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Three things have changed dramatically since 1996:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. The FAT32 and NTFS file systems have come along, permitting larger partitions with smaller clusters, and therefore much less waste. In fact, with NTFS, cluster sizes are 4K, regardless of partition size.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Hard drives have become much bigger, up to 1Tb (1000Gb) in size.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Hard drives have become much cheaper. For example, a 500Gb drive can be bought today for around $100. That’s 250 times the size of that typical 2Gb 1996 drive, at about a quarter of the price.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What those things mean together is that the old rationale of having multiple partitions to avoid substantial waste of disk space is gone. The amount of waste is much less than it used to be and the cost of that waste is much less. For all practical purposes,
 almost nobody should be concerned about slack anymore, and it should no longer be considered when planning your partition structure.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*What Partitions are Used for Today*</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of different ways people set up multiple partitions these days. Some of these uses are reasonable, some are questionable, some are outright bad. I’ll discuss a number of common partition types in what follows:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. A partition for just Windows</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Most people who create such a partition do so because they believe that if they ever have to reinstall Windows cleanly, at least they won’t lose their data and won’t have to reinstall their applications, because both are safe on other partitions.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In fact the first of those thoughts is a false comfort, and the second is downright wrong. See the discussion of partition types 2 and 4 below to find out why.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also note that as time passes, many people find that their Windows partition that started out to be the right size turns out to be too small. For example, if you have such a Windows partition, and later upgrade to a newer version of Windows, you may find
 that your Windows partition is too small.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. A partition for installed programs</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This normally goes hand-in-hand with partition type 1, a partition for just Windows. The thought that if you reinstall Windows, your installed application programs are safe if they are in a separate partitions is simply wrong. That’s because all installed
 programs (except for an occasional trivial one) have pointers to them within Windows, in the registry and elsewhere, as well as associated files buried within the Windows folder. So if Windows goes, the pointers and files go with it. Since programs have to
 be reinstalled if Windows does, this rationale for a separate partition for programs doesn't work. In fact, there is hardly ever a good reason for separating Windows from application software in separate partitions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. A partition for the swap file.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some people erroneously think that having the page file on a separate partition will improve performance. That is also false; it doesn’t help, and often hurts, performance, because it increases head movement to get back and forth from the page file to the
 other frequently-used data on the </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>drive. For best performance, the page file should normally be on the most-used partition of the least-used physical drive. For almost everyone with a single physical drive, that’s the same drive Windows is on, C:.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. A partition for backup of other partitions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some people make a separate partition to store backups of their other partition(s). People who rely on such a "backup" are just kidding themselves. It's only very slightly better than no backup at all, because it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss
 of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers: head crashes and other kinds of drive failure, severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes, virus attacks, even theft of the computer. In my view,
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>secure backup needs to be on removable media, and not kept in the computer. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. A partition for data files</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Above, when I discussed separating Windows on a partition of its own, I pointed out that separating data from Windows is a false comfort if it’s done with the thought that the data will be safe if Windows ever has to be reinstalled. The reason I call it
 a false comfort is because I fear that many people will rely on that separation, think that their data is safe there, and therefore do not take appropriate steps to back it up. In truth the data is not safe there. Having to reinstall Windows is only one of
 the dangers to someone’s hard drive, and not even the most likely one. This kind of "safeguard" falls into the same category as a partition for backup of other partitions; it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of
 the most common dangers that affect the entire physical drive, not just the particular partition. Safety comes from a strong backup regimen, not from how you partition.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However for some people it can be a good idea to separate Windows and programs on the one hand from data on the other, putting each of the two types into separate partitions. I think that most people’s partitioning scheme should be based on their backup
 scheme, and backup schemes generally fall into two types: imaging the entire hard drive or backup of data only. If you backup data only, that backup is usually facilitated by having a separate partition with data only; that permits backing up just that partition
 easily, without having to collect bits and pieces from here and there. On the other hand, for those who backup by creating an image of the entire drive, there is usually little, if any, benefit to separating data in a partition of its own.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>By the way, in all fairness, I should point out that there are many well-respected people who recommend a separate partition for Windows, regardless of your backup scheme. Their arguments haven’t convinced me, but there are clearly two different views here.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6. A partition for picture files</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some people like to treat pictures and videos as something separate from other data files, and create a separate partition for them. To my mind, a picture is simply another kind of data, and there is no advantage in doing this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>7. A partition for music files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The comments above pertaining to picture files apply equally to music files. They are just another kind of data and should be treated the same way as other data.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>8. A partition for a second operating system to dual-boot to.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For those who run multiple operating systems (Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 98, Linux, etc.), a separate partition for each operating system is essential. The issues here are beyond the scope of this article, but it’s sufficient to note that I have
 no objection at all to such partitions</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*Performance*</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some people have multiple partitions because they believe that it somehow improves performance. That’s not correct. The effect is probably small on modern computers with modern hard drives, but if anything, the opposite is true: more partitions mean poorer
 performance. That’s because normally no partition is full and there are therefore gaps between them. It takes time for the drive’s read/write heads to traverse those gaps. The closer together files are, the faster access to them will be.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*Organization*</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think many people overpartition because they use partitions as an organizational structure. They have a strong sense of order and want to separate apples from oranges on their drives.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes, separating different kinds of files on partitions is an organizational technique, but so is separating different kinds of files in folders. The difference is that partitions are static and fixed in size, while folders are dynamic, changing size automatically
 as necessary to meet your changing needs. That generally makes folders a much better way to organize, in my view.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>True, partitions can be resized when necessary, but except with Windows Vista, doing so requires third-party software (and the ability to do it in Vista is primitive, compared to the third-party solutions). Such third-party software normally costs money,
 and, no matter how good and how stable it is, affects the entire drive, entailing a risk of losing everything. Plan your partitions well in the first place, and no repartitioning should be necessary. The need to repartition usually comes about as a result
 of overpartitioning in the first place. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What frequently happens when people organize with partitions instead of folders is that they miscalculate how much room they need on each such partition, and then when they run out of room on the partition where a file logically belongs, while still having
 lots of space left </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>on the other, they simply store the file in the "wrong" partition. Paradoxically, therefore, that kind of partition structure results in less organization rather than more.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>*So How Should I Partition My Drive*</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you've read what came before, my conclusions won't come as a surprise: </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. if your backup scheme is to image the entire drive, have just a single partition (usually C:);</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. if you just backup data, have two partitions–one for Windows and installed application programs (usually C:), the other for data (usually D:).
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Except for those running multiple operating systems, there is seldom any benefit to having more than two partitions.</p>

            What you've said was fine mister ty, but I want atleast one new Drive other than the c to store the media data, or in case of back up can be useful, my c has 450gb now what do I do to get another drive with min of 200GB?. I tried the shrink volume method
 it gives me maximum of 45GB, which aint enough, min of 120Gb is what I need! Any Solution?

<p><strong><span>Hi schee77mr,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Are you by any chance running a Bluetooth mouse with your system? What issues have you come across with the HID data?<br />
</span></span><span><span>This error is sometime related to hardware not having the correct drivers or software installed with the device. Make sure that any device you are plugging in is
 completely compatible with the Windows 7 operating system. You might want to uninstall the drivers for the device and try re-installing them in compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will also suggest you to perform a scan on your computer and then check–<br />
</span><span>You may use windows safety virus online scan and the other link for malware checking. Use the steps mentioned on your computer for scanning –</span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A yellow exclamation point next to a device in Device Manager means that Windows has identified a problem of some kind with that device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The yellow exclamation mark provides an indication of a device's current status and could mean that there is a system resource conflict, a driver issue, or, frankly, almost any number of other things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the yellow mark does do is confirm that something called a Device Manager error code has been logged and associated with that particular device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Keep us posted if you have any issue with Windows, we are happy to assist you.</span></p>
