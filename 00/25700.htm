<h2>            disappearing attachments.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 365 with Windows 10.</p>
<p>When I receive attachments and then another recipient replies to the sender, my attachments disappear.</p>
<p>I have searched the "Options" dialogue boxes, but cannot find a setting which looks as if it could cause this. can anyone help me??</p>

            <p>Thank you Roady,</p>
<p>in expanded view, the original message is there in all it's glory - but without the attachments.</p>
<p>That is my only (known) problem: the attachments have disappeared.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to imagine how the attachments are being removed, by someone else on the distribution list replying.</p>
<p>A pop mail account using a pst data file by default downloads all mail from the server to the local PC, and only the users of the local PC have access to the data file - what you describe is an impossibility</p>

Rachel341</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. What is the exact model number of your phone? Are you still experiencing the same issue? You've downloaded the music downloader app from the Store, right? Are you getting the same result regardless if you
 are using cellular data or Wi-Fi? We look forward to your reply. ^_^

    <title>Excel Data Entry Issues - Navigation Key Malfunction - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> starpilot13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Data Entry Issues - Navigation Key Malfunction</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently come across an issue in Excel 2010 (both myself and a co-worker) where navigation keys will stop working as per normal operations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal Operations = Tab, Enter, and Arrow Keys will move to a new cell after entering data into currently active cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an excel file is first opened, the navigation keys will operate under the above described "Normal Operations" for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in the past two days (previously no issues) I have found that after certain actions (such as the creation of a new Worksheet) that the operations of the navigation keys change:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changed Operations = Tab, Enter, and Arrow Keys will close a cell after entering data into currently active cell on first press, and will navigate to a new cell on the second key press.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has generated some frustrating situations in which either myself or my co-worker has thought we have entered in multiple cells of data, but has ended up only entering and overwriting multiple cells of data into the exact same cell. The issue restores
 back to "Normal Operations" when excel is closed and re-opened, however this creates more hassle than should be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a lot of research thus far trying to find an answer as to why this has occurred, but unfortunately most queries are related to Scroll Lock issues (which has been confirmed to not be the issue), Enter Key Editing Options from Advanced settings
 (also confirmed not to be the issue), or Lotus compatibility Transition navigation keys (also confirmed not to be the issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this problem has been answered in the past, I apologize for the repeat question, however it has been extremely difficult trying to find my particular situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>StarPilot13</p>

<h2>            Cuting a Simple Video on God Damn N86 Phone &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Maybe I can be doing something wrong, but I recorded a video that is 4 minutes long and I want to remove the first 2 minutes and always that I try to cut the God Damn movie the phone says: "Not Enough Memory. Please delete some files on C: Drive"</p>
<p>**** ! The phone doesn't even let me choose the destination drive...</p>
<p>There is a way to cut on the phone itself ?!?! (a.k.a choose the destination drive for the file) ?!?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I think it is more of a RAM issue. The phone will let you choose where to save after you have cut it. Do you have a RAM checking software on your phone? There are times when there are multiple hidden processes running in the phone eating up RAM.</p>

<p>Could be, could also not be. But the interface will also let you choose where to save the video file you cut after cutting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memcheck would be a good app to use, very simple interface. Just one click.</p>

<p>How much phone memory do you have anyway, and how big is the video?</p>

    <title>Test bed of Office 2003 and 2010 documents for conversion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alehecka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Test bed of Office 2003 and 2010 documents for conversion verification&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Did Microsoft ever publish a test bed of Office 2003 and 2010 documents, meaning Word, Excel, PowerPoint sample documents that could be opened as follows:</p>
<p>1) Open a Word 2003 document in Word 2010 and see that the document looks the same? Likewise for Excel and PowerPoint?</p>
<p>2) Open a Word 2010 document using the Office Compatibility pack on a pc that is on Office 2003 and see that the document looks the same? Repeat for Excel and PowerPoint?</p>
<p>Let's try to help those who may answer this:</p>
<p>When I say looks the same the setup is the business client has a laptop for testing Office 2010 and their current pc or laptop which has Office 2003.</p>
<p>In example 1 above, they would open TestDocument1.docx on the testing&nbsp;laptop with Office 2010 and then open the same document on their own pc with Office 2003. As both pc's would be sitting side by side the business client could look back and forth and actually
 see that the documents&nbsp;look the same.</p>
<p>Yes- I can start gathering documents from off the internet but aside from virus concerns I rather expect that the documents will&nbsp;all be simple and repetitive. I would be looking for a real test bed (sort of like unit tests in programming) of documents that
 exercise all (well, let's be real here:&nbsp;a good portion) of the features of Word, Excel and PowerPoint. As Microsoft did produce the compatibility pack I figure they must have had their own set of sample documents&nbsp;that they used to verify the compatibility
 pack when they wrote it. I've downloaded everything I could find from Microsoft on upgrading to Office 2010. I don't recall seeing any set of sample documents to verify the conversion from 2003 to 2010 or 2010 to 2003.</p>
<p>Yes- I have available tools such as OEAT and OCCI. That's not the issue. The issue is providing side by side viewing as described above. The clients want to see it for themselves.</p>
<p>Any help will be most appreciated. I've been on this upgrade to Microsoft Office 2010 project for over six months and there is no end in sight.</p>

<p><br />
I am not aware of any such "test bed of documents". However, hundreds of thousands of people have gone before you and switched from Word 2003 to later versions or have opened documents from later versions in Word 2003.</p>
<p>Whether or not the document will appear exactly the same will depend very much on the driver for the active printer as the way in which Word lays out documents is to some extend controlled by the features of the printer driver.</p>
<p>That said, there are a few differences between 2010 and 2003, one significant one in Word being the implementation of WordArt.</p>
<p>In six months, you could have created a pretty good test bed of documents yourself.</p>

<p>I am assuming that you are using Conditional formatting. If so then the following formula in the conditional formatting dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=AND(ISBLANK(R2),C2&lt;TODAY()-30)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are only applying the condition to the one cell then the above should be OK. However, if applying the condition to color a range of cells in row 2 then the following with the column Id's referenced as absolute (with the $ signs).</p>
<p>

</p><p>Your solution worked brilliantly! Thank you so much.</p>
<p>While I have your expertise, can I ask one more question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this formula be tweaked to include an exception?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If this cell is empty, and the date entered is this cell is more than 30 days old, color this cell red. BUT if there is information entered in this cell, leave it alone"</p>

</p><p>For context, we want it to work like if there is a comment entered in the another cell to leave the cell alone.</p>

<p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to add an exception on the formula given by <strong><em>OssieMac</em></strong> in the previous post, then check if the if else conditional formula will do the trick. Check formula below:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>=IF($O2&lt;&gt;"",$O2,AND(ISBLANK($R2),$C2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the formula above doesn't suffice, we'd like to ask additional information to provide you the appropriate resolution. Can you share the information below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>The data layout with some sample data.</span></li><li><span>The expected output in that example.</span></li><li><span>The cell which should be highlighted.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know should you need further assistance.</p>

                    <p>Just docked my Lumia 950 with the HD500. It opens up on phone screen with a message saying it needs to update HD500 software, but this message comes again and again in a loop and when I tap on the "Update" button the update doesn't happen. I can neither
 move forward without the update nor proceed with the update, phone is blocked in this loop until I disconnect the HD500.</p>
<p>Hints, anyone?</p>

<h2>            Access 2007&#58; Object or class does not support the set of events</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a Windows 7 Pro, 64-bit computer. The other day I was trying to import an Outlook folder into Access 2007 and got the following message:</p>

I'm not sure if this is the issue, but try running Access in adminstrator mode, to make sure it can update all references.</p>

<p><br />
If you have a shortcut to the database itself, then right-clicking on the shortcut won't offer the "Run as Administrator" option, because the database is not an executable.&nbsp; If you have a shortcut to the Access executable, then you should get the "Run as Administrator"
 option, and even be able, by clicking the Advanced button on the shortcut's property sheet, to set "Run as Admninstrator" as a default mode for theat shortcut.</p>
<p>As for other thoughts ... I have questions for you:</p>
<p>Are you running 32-bit or 64-bit Access on your 64-bit Windows PC?&nbsp; 32-bit is the recommended configuration, by the way, unless you really *need* the 64-bit&nbsp;version, so don't let my asking make you worry.</p>
<p>Do you have more than one version of Access installed?</p>
<p>If you open the VB Editor's References dialog (Tools -&gt; References...), do you see any broken references (marked MISSING)?&nbsp; Do the references you see correspond correctly to the version of Access?</p>

            <p>I only tried right clicking the Access 2007 icon. I tried the one in the Start Menu under Microsoft Office, I tried the one I pinned to the taskbar. Neihter gave the Run As Admin option. I had to go into the Program Files (86) folder and find the actual
 exe before I could get the Run As Admin in the right click menu. I did not right click any databases.</p>
<p>I am running Access 2007 32-bit AFAIK. Is there a 64-bit of Access 2007? It installed into the Program Files (86) folder so I assume that is the 32-bit version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only have the one version of Access 2007 installed.</p>
<p>I do not see any "missing" references in the VB Editor References Dialog. From what I see all that make reference to Access or Office say 12.</p>

<p><br />
The start menu shortcuts don't offer the option, because they aren't actually shortcuts to the executable, but specially handled somehow.&nbsp; However, if you locate the actual msaccess.exe executable and create a shortcut to that, you'll get the Run as Adminstrator
 option.</p>
<p>Yes, from your description you are running the 32-bit version.</p>
<p>I don't see anything at all wrong with the setup as you describe it.&nbsp; If I were you, I would first see if I have the same problem with other databases.&nbsp; If I don't, then I would conclude that there is something wrong with this particular DB, and begin a
 set of steps to eliminate any possible corruption.&nbsp; If I do, if the problem is installation-wide, then I would reinstall Access and see if that fixes it.</p>

            <p>I created a new database. I tried the import and got the same error. So I went to the Control Panel to repair or uninstall Access. In the list I found that the Access 2007 runtime was installed. Makes sense as I am the only one to use the full version the
 runtime was probably installed before the computer was allocated for me.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled the runtime and am repairing Access just in case. Will try again and see if it made a difference.</p>

<p>However...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then uninstalled Access 2007, rebooted, reinstalled Access 2007 and reinstalled Office SP3. When I started Access I did not get the error and was able to import a new outlook folder.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview Print From Firefox Issues</h2>
                    Loving the new Windows, however I cannot print from Firefox. I have seen others having issues with IE not printing, but nothing about Firefox. The OS thinks that it prints the document (or anything), however it never actually sends it to the printer. This
 is only an issue when I cannot save the document to the computer and print from inside the operating system.

    <title>Task - Reminder for sender about passing deadline, assigning tasks to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matdabr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task - Reminder for sender about passing deadline, assigning tasks to a few people with splitting and other task workflow</h2>
                    <p>Unformtunately Outlook is missing some easy to develop and cruitial functionalities...</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am a trainer of Outlook for corporations (i.e. Nestle, volkswagen group) and see what functionalities are missing in this product. A lot of corporations work still on Outlook 2010, and i am after a meeting with decision makers of a corporation that said
 they won't use Outlook, beacuase they have a CRM that give them more fucntionalities. What I often meet that is missing is:<br />
- assigning task you (as a Sender) will not be notified when deadline has passed (and receiver hadn't done the task). So if you can't react quickly when somebody fails, you have to check constantly task statuses. Tthis is cruitial for managers and should be
 easy to develop in outlook.<br />
- you can't assign tasks to a few people - there should be some split option when you type more than one receiver. Sometimes you give the same task to 25 people, and want to monitor them.<br />
- there is no CC option when assigning a task - sometimes you assgin a task to not your worker, but someone's worker (often&nbsp; case for Project Managers) and you have agreed with them that you can do it as long as you inform them.</p>
<p>- and one more - when you are a boss and have an assisstant and you're telling her what to do, you expect her to type the task and want to monitor it. But even if she's got a permission to manage/edit your task folder, she can't assign a task from your task
 folder to herself...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know solutions for such expectations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Sum of probabilities equal to 10 when using Excel distribution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waterandspirit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sum of probabilities equal to 10 when using Excel distribution functions</h2>
                    When I use probability density function in EXCEL (NORM.DIST or WEIBULL.DIST), the sum of probabilities [for all possible x's] is equal to 10, instead of 1. Why does that happen? Should not the sum equal to 1? When I do the cumulative distribution function,
 it does end in a 1 though...

            A probability density function is for a continuous-valued variable. A continuous-valued variable has theoretically an infinite number of values. When you set the Excel function "cumulative" argument to FALSE for a continuous-valued variable, the function
 returns the height of the density function. The height of the density function is not a probability. Instead, an area under the density function for a range of values is a probability, and the total area equals one. Theoretically, the probability of a specific
 value is essentially zero. Examples of continuous-valued variables are the normal and Weibull distributions.<br />
<br />
A probability mass function is for a discrete-valued variable. When you set the Excel function "cumulative" argument to FALSE for a discrete-valued variable, the function returns the probability mass function, i.e., the probability of a specific discrete value.
 The sum of probabilities for a discrete-valued variable equals one. Examples of discrete-valued variables are the binomial and Poisson distributions.<br />

 Please tell us more! :-)

            Digital River is an afiliate website of Microsoft's which provides digital downloads of popular Microsoft titles. If you already have a license for it, I see what would be the problem in downloading a license for something you already own.

            for what is't worth, in my opinion the downloads are useless if you don't have a valid key for the products. (even the bogus key sellers use the digital river downloads). In my opinion It would be unethical if not illegal to use the downloads if you don't
 have a valid license.

            <p>&nbsp;George, that's my concern too.&nbsp; I have a valid license, but I'm concerned about telling my students about this.&nbsp; I did download and install this version of Works in my test environment, and it looks exactly like my legal version, but unless I'm sure it's
 OK with MS, I don't want to tell other folks about it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;It would seem that logically if MS isn't going to sell or support Works, it ought to be OK, but what's legal and what's logical often don't match!&nbsp; I've never understood lawyers or bureaucrats, but I try to avoid butting heads with them because it's usually
 time consuming and frustrating!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Sometimes it can even be costly too.</p>

            Well the fact is these links are all over the internet if one chooses to look for them. ( including shady downloads full of malware and other various hacks)
<div><br />
<div>Like anything else they can be properly used or abused. It is not uncommon for some folks to squeal loudly when they use things in a bogus manner and install all kinds of software only to find out their windows is detected as not genuine. Usually this
 requires a install from scratch.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I typically don't provide any links unless I think their use is legitimate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make your own choice and be prepared for the consequences Most likely from students. ( I don't think anyone will be coming to your door for doing it.)</div>

            <p>&nbsp;Works doesn't require activation guys, so if you download it, it works.&nbsp; The old Works Suite used to require activation for Word, but Works itself never required it.&nbsp; I know because I've been using it since version 2 for DOS starting back in 1989. &nbsp;What
 you get from Digital River is an EXE file, not an ISO FWIW.&nbsp; I think it's great to be able to get it, I just don't know if I could get in trouble telling folks
<u>without</u> a license about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Anyone can click on that link you posted Andre and have a working version in short order.&nbsp; When you install it, you have to click on the "I agree" with the EULA button so conceivably a MS bureaucrat or lawyer could get on your case about it, right?&nbsp; I
 guess if I did mention it to anyone, I'd be sure to caution them about that unless I hear convincing evidence to the contrary.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Personally I'm delighted to see it posted here, I just don't want to get myself in trouble over it.&nbsp; I know a lot technically, but when it comes to the lawyers and bureaucrats, I 've always kept as far away from them as I could.&nbsp; They seem to take great
 delight in telling what you can't do and trying to make you jump through a lot of hoops for their own delight!&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>Hi shoeic</p>
<p>Create an Event Procedure for the On Click event of the control.</p>
<p>I used a button called cmdButtonName</p>
<p>This is the code you need for the On Click event.</p>
<p>Private Sub cmdButtonName_Click()<br />
On Error GoTo Err_cmdButtonName_Click</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox("Are you sure you want to continue?", vbYesNo + vbQuestion, "Confirmation Required") = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.RunMacro "YuorMacroName"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exit_cmdButtonName_Click:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub</p>
<p>Err_cmdButtonName_Click:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Description<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume Exit_cmdButtonName_Click<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            OneDrive error &#34;Please try again tomorrow&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm just trying to migrate from dropbox to onedrive included with my office, but after having uploaded around 500gb of files now, but today morning it was just showing an error, saying it can't sync and i should try again tomorrow.<br />
</p>
<p>This is probably due to a limit of how much data or how many files can be uploaded in one day, but i was unable to find any detailed information on those limits so far (just some about file restrictions like the max file size).<br />
Before switching over and canceling my dropbox i would like to be sure, that those limits will not be a problem later (like being unable to upload/download files when you want/need to).<br />
<br />
It would be great if anyone could point me to those.<br />
Also, do the "bigger" onedrives (business etc) have the same limits? If i'm happy with onedrive, i might start switching over work data also.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)<br />

            And the sync works again.<br />

Had it closed for ~ 2hrs now, and just started it, and all was good again.<br />

Still not sure what it was.<br />

            Hi OrigaNNN,
<br />
<br />This is because your System Date Format in Control Panel is set to dd/mm/yyyy
<br />
<br />If you put 17/4/2017 into B7 your formula will work
<br />
<br />You need to decide what short date format you want to use for everything on your PC and set that . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Region
<br />Click Additional Settings
<br />Then Click on the Date Tab and manually set your preferred Short Date format
<br />
<br />That's It!

<h2>            Nokia Series 40 Version 6 Update Suggestion &#40;Nokia X3-02&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am from the Philippines and I would like to post these suggestions with regards to the firmware of series 40 version 6 especially Nokia X3-02 since the model has a lot of limitations with regards to user experience, below are the following suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia s40v6 in X3-02 Things to Update:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;It should log the sender's time of sending its message and not the time when the message was received by the receiver.</li><li>If video is being played in the media player and accidentally or intentionally exits the media player, aside from continuing the video playback in the background by just playing the sound, the application should bring back the video itself when the dedicated
 key for media player is pressed.</li><li>The phone should switch between the conversations/inbox and compose message using the dedicated key for messaging and not just running the single instance of either compose message or conversations/inbox that needs to close the other application first before
 going back to other application.</li><li>In terms of design, since series 40 phones has the functionality in changing its theme, icons like the "Ovi Store" and others that are seen in the main menu should also have the ability to change its icon design.</li><li>When using the camera, aside from the button for switching between image capture and video capture, it should also have a button for switching between portrait and landscape mode without going to Options to just toggle between the two modes because this
 takes time when capturing important and memorable shots. And just like the camera set up of Nokia 2700, even if the phone is on low battery, the camera should continue to take shots.</li><li>When browsing files in Gallery (and the like), the user should able to change the view between List and Grid view just like the other series 40 devices and should sorts the items per folder and not in the whole gallery.</li><li>Should have an application for reading documents such as PDF and DOC.</li></ul>
<p>I know there are also users including me who don't like full touch phones so much. One of the reasons I think is because of difficulties in messaging that's why with these suggestions, it will maximize the functionality of s40v6 in Touch and Type phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>1. This is dependent upon network, and the phone which sent the message, if it sends the time of message sending. So its like taking into account variable things, and if the sending format is compatible. Not likely to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. s40 phones dont have the software and hardware to account for multitasking of videos. heck smartphones need to push their hardware to multitask videos. what more **bleep** s40 phones and they **bleep** hardware? There's a reason why processor speeds of
 feature phones for any brand arent published.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Again, the **bleep** hardware and performance optimization cannot do this. If you want this to be possible, go buy an E6 when that's available. Or buy an Eseries phone and install Free iSMS or ThreadSMS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. This is dependent upon the theme creators. If they did not make icons for Ovi Store and etc, then the icons wont change. You have to find someone who made a theme with Ovi Store icons. Most s40 themes available are old, made when Ovi Store are not in
 existence. You need to find a theme made after 2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. PDF and documents. Not very useable on an s40 phone. given the bad hardware, a 10page PDF file with heavy pictures might give it memory full warnings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the best things you should have done and gotten everything you want? You should have bought a C6-00 (full keyboard plus touch screen) or a qwerty Eseries.</p>

            With regards to the ovi icon, I already manipulate all icon design in series 40 using carbide.ui and also used it in editing the theme.XML file itself but it does not support ovi. And with regards to your suggestion in C6-00, thanks but I don't like a
 qwerty phone that is why if nokia could implement some of my suggestions then it's better. But thanks for he concern. I just hope nokia could have a more functional serIes 40 implementation.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            By the way, with regards to messages, I already tested that the time of messages in the log is the time you received that message because I turned off my phone for 10 minutes and I asked my friend to send me a message. After 10 minutes, I switched my phone
 on and received he message my friend had sent me and the time logged is the time that I received the message and Not the time my friend sends the message.<br />

<p>I am currently running Windows 10 Build 10162. The built in Microsoft Solitaire Collection app does not work as expected. The cards in the game are screwed up. They look really awkward, and the cards are not identifiable. How do I fix it? My family really
 wants to play the new game but it is totally screwed up and unplayable. How can I fix it? Should I reinstall the app?</p>

            Having the same issue with all games, (if this is what you mean by it looks really awkward) I uninstalled and reinstalled this app to no avail. Also followed graphics driver update directions and received an answer that my driver is up to date. I'm running,
 I believe, a 4th gen Intel i3 with integrated graphics, so I doubt that it's unsupported by windows 10 at this point. Help? haha

            I am running this build on a VM. It has 4 cores of processing power and 4GB of RAM. I just installed the build and found this issue. I don't know about other apps. It is a clean install in that VM. Updated all the graphics drivers, still no luck. Will
 this be the same in the final release?

            <p>Last night, Microsoft Solitaire Collection worked fine. Now, with build 10162, the game never appears e.g. click on today's Free Cell and the screen just shows a wait cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggestion that I have changed something since last night to obstruct the solitaires is not funny.</p>
<p>Also my graphics card is ancient, AMD HD 4650. Really not a card in need of updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the plus side: Magic Puzzles, another Windows App, was able to download July's puzzle collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been on board with Windows 10 almost since the start and on average every second new preview has had
<strong>new </strong>bugs on the app front. Build 10162 doesn't appear to fare better and I wonder what will happen if Microsoft releases Windows 10 prematurely. The 29th of July seems way to early.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is caused by, I am sure, the <strong>return </strong>of advertisements in the app (I haven't upgraded to the ad-free version). It just waits and waits for the ad - ten minutes and counting!!!</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Language Preferences ignores the choice for the Help Language</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the Office 2016 Language Preferences dialogue does not store the selected Help Language settings by the user. Please see the attached screenshots, how to reproduce.&nbsp;In Office 2013, it was possible to have different settings for the Display
 Language and the Help Language by setting the default values.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that the Online Help is displayed in a task pane now and no more in a separate window (of course, I can undock the task pane window). So, I have a question and suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean that it's no more possible to have different displaying and help languages; e.g. English for the Interface and German for the Help?
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If Yes, this would be unfortunate. And if Yes, then I suggest to remove the <em>
Set as Default</em> Button in the Office 2016 Language Preferences for the Help Language on the right. I think, having a non-functional button is confusing.</li><li>If No, what I personally prefer, then I guess something is not working in the Office 2016 Preferences Dialogue.</li></ul>
<p>I am using Excel 2016 Build 16.0.7070.2019 on Windows 10. Office was orginally installed in English and then I added two Language Packs (German and French). Windows 10 (not Insider) was also originally installed in English and I added the LP's for German
 and French too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Mourad Louha</p>

<h2>            Message delay in IM from Facebook Chat.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having a problem, with my Lumia 920. I've experienced this problem last week. It seems that there is a delay showing up Facebook chats on messaging. When opening FB app there is already a message however it isn't showing in IM or Messaging. Its really
 annoying because you still need to open FB app just to see if there are any messages. I think the problem is only with the receiving end because I can send my reply using messaging and it shows in the FB app.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What seems to be the problem and what's the solution for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This might be hard to agree with, but the IM system on windows phone is, half-baked. Sometimes messages will come and sometimes they don't come at all. Sometimes there is a delay and sometimes conversations simply get lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only reliable way to have FB chat - like something important - is via the official app or through IM clients like IM+</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Text Alerts &#34;from&#34; is different every time.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company doesn't allow non-company provided smartphones to connect to Exchange directly, so I've set up my outlook 365 to send me text alerts to my personal cellphone.&nbsp; It's fairly useful, but every time I get a text it appears to be from a different phone
 number, the "phone number" is incremented by 1 every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to get these text to appear to come from the same phone number, so that they'll be grouped in a single text message thread in my Windows 8.1 phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
