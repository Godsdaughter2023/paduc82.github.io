<h2>            Conditional Formatting for Meetings where there is No Response from Attendees</h2>
                    I'm the organizer and attendee of many many meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've set conditional formatting to color-code the meetings that I schedule different from those scheduled by others.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I would now like to do is color code those meetings that I've scheduled
 where one or more of the attendees has not responded to the invite.&nbsp; Is this possible?

<br />
From your description, I understand that you want to know if Outlook can color code the meetings in which one or more attendees has not responded to the invite.<br />
<br />
Meetings can be color coded based on the criteria Accepted/Not Accepted. But, it is not possible within Outlook to color code an event where one or more attendees has not responded to the meeting. However, this may be done programmatically using macros.
<br />

<h2>            Office 365 - Excel 2016 does not appear in Open With window</h2>
                    We are now utilizing Office 365 and so now when I select and left&nbsp;click on a file with a .cfm extension and the Open With window opens I do not see the Excel 2016 application to open the .cfm file.&nbsp; I see the Word 2016 application but not the Excel application.&nbsp;
 How do I get the Excel application to appear in the Open With window?&nbsp; I have browsed for the Excel application but do not find it anywhere.

            Thank you kindly Palcouk.&nbsp; Prior to my migration to Office 365 I routinely opened .cfm files with Excel.&nbsp; The .cfm files I open are reports with columns of numbers and are best suited for Excel.&nbsp; And I have performed 2 file searches to no avail.&nbsp; I will
 try a 3rd time.

                    <p class="contentStandard">I installed <a href="http://avast.eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Avast</a> today and it's telling me I have some nasty rootkits in my System32. "Fixing" it only broke my windows, so I did a system restore and excluded C:\Windows from the scanner.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I also downloaded some other scanning tool today called "aswMBR" and it also gave me a mouth full of infected files</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've tried&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</p>
<p class="contentStandard">which says the operation completed succesfully. And I've tried</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">sfc /scannow</p>
<p class="contentStandard">multiple times, but it tells me every time that it found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">looking through the sfc scan log it seems that it has issues with other files than the ones that pop up in the virus scan.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">My question is as follows:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Are these all false positives (or purposely put their by MS) or is my system severely contaminated? If it is contaminated, any idea how to fix it without breaking windows or losing my installed programs/settings, or am I on my own
 on thisone?</p>

<h2>            Email Stuck in Outbox - Special Case - Can&#39;t Find Previous Solution</h2>
                    <p>Under Office 2016 I had a multiple month long problem with emails stuck in my Outbox, unless I closed and reopened Outlook.&nbsp; Outlook would often hang while trying to retrieve data from the Exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be more exact- there were multiple email accounts but only the one to my office email would hang.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked for a solution for months, and finally came across it.&nbsp; There was a post that discussed public folders, shared folders, and trying to sync other (archive? - not sure) folders.&nbsp; It had suggestions of unclicking the public folders link and also had
 a registry edit to stop the sync with (archive?) folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the registry change and everything worked great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently install Office 2019 - and the problem is back - but I can't recall exactly the solution or the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this enough information that perhaps someone can point me in the right direction?</p>

Was this referring to the option to not cache public folder favorites? (In Account settings, More Settings, Advanced tab.)
<br />
<br />

This doesn't ring a bell, but I'll check my notes to see if there is anything that fits this description.

<p>Thanks for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That should be the same as the More Settings &gt; Advanced settings for caching shared and pf, but is forced for all accounts.
<br />
<br />
Also, if you made any customizations in the S/R dialog, delete the SRS file to revert to the default settings.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Well, unlike before, this didn't seem to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, further research uncovered&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3046189/you-cannot-start-outlook-in-cached-mode-or-create-a-new-cached-mode-pr , and so far this seems to have solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This involves using the&nbsp;<span>MFCMAPI to clear&nbsp;<span>he PR_OST_OSTID binary property.&nbsp; Not only has email been sending, but it has also done so much more rapidly than it did when previously closing and re-opening Outlook.</span></span><br />

<h3> tinaclaflin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reply emails using alias</h2>
                    <p>I select my alias email address when replying to an email that came from that alias email address. When the email sends it comes from my default email address and not the alias even though I selected the alias from the list of email address in my Outlook
 account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Microsoft Outlook for MAC 15.24</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an issue with anyone else and if so how can I fix it without changing the default on Outlook online every time I reply to an email that comes from one of my alias accounts. The purpose of my aliases is to keep my emails in order but if people are
 getting the replies from my default account this will be confusing for them on which email is the right one to use.</p>

<p>i have a site collection in sharepoint online.&nbsp; i have a term set in the term store used for managed navigation.&nbsp; the sharepoint server publishing feature is enabled at the site collection level, the root site level, and enabled on all sub sites.&nbsp; managed
 navigation is enabled at the root site for the global navigation.&nbsp; all sub sites inherit this setting.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e3b2b7ba-2abc-4bc4-bae6-63aa2248dc20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de3b2b7ba-2abc-4bc4-bae6-63aa2248dc20" /></a></p>
<p><strong>issue description</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>all sites (root site &amp; sub sites, existing sites, new sites i created today) randomly flip from managed navigation to structured navigation (which is blank) when they are viewed making the entire site collection completely useless.
</li><li>when the homepage loads on any given site it's a tossup between whether or not the navigation will render correctly or will fail and show the blank structured navigation despite the fact that managed navigation is enabled for the global navigation.
</li><li>this appears to be a bug in sharepoint online.&nbsp; please advise. </li></ul>
<p><strong>screen shots</strong></p>
<p>you'll load a page and it will look correct, like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e108b0e0-f3ef-41d3-a9f6-8ce49aca730f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de108b0e0-f3ef-41d3-a9f6-8ce49aca730f" /></a></p>
<p>then you'll come back to it 2 minutes later and it will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=640a582d-b1d4-4d46-a4ee-7f6a4d3f54c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d640a582d-b1d4-4d46-a4ee-7f6a4d3f54c4" /></a></p>
<p>the entire site collection is completely unusable.&nbsp; please advise.</p>

<p>hi christian,</p>
<p>in some same cases, we may sort the situation out by re-triggering the relatead features. therefore please, as you may have checked, try disabling and re-enabling the following toand see the outcome.</p>
<p>go to the top-level site &gt; site settings &gt; under site collection administration &gt; site collection feature &gt; sharepoint server publishing infrastructure &gt; activate.</p>
<p>go to the top-level site &gt; site settings,<br />
&nbsp;&gt; under site actions, manage site features &gt; sharepoint server publishing &gt; activate.<br />
&nbsp;&gt; under look and feel, navigation &gt; global navigation, select managed navigation &gt; choose the term set &gt;ok.</p>
<p>go to the subsite &gt; site settings,<br />
&nbsp;&gt; under site actions, manage site features &gt; sharepoint server publishing &gt; activate.<br />
&nbsp;&gt; under look and feel, navigation &gt; at global navigation, select display the same navigation items as the parent site.</p>
<p>meanwhile, could you try manually creating a new term set for site navigation and check the situation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. go to the top-level site &gt;&nbsp; site settings &gt; under site administration, term store management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. create a new term set &gt; intended use tab, tick use this term set for site navigation &gt; save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=39bf3eff-e02f-4f1a-941c-8bac08e44fe0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d39bf3eff-e02f-4f1a-941c-8bac08e44fe0" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;3. create a few term for the new navigation term set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. go back to site settings &gt; under look and feel, navigation &gt; managed navigation: term set section &gt; select the new navigation term set &gt; ok.</p>
<p>and, please further check whether the same would happen on a new subsite.</p>
<p>we would appreciate your efforts.</p>

<h2>            Yammer</h2>
                    <p>1. I installed Yammer Android Apps :Apparently, it doesn't show the same things compare to via browser. E.g. I created a group call Telecom Vertical Asia on the apps , but this is not visible on the Yammer (via Internet browser on my laptop).&nbsp; Vice Versa,
 I created a group called "Telecom Asia" in the Yammer on Internet Browser, but this group didn't appear on the apps. I tried to reinstall the apps and it is still the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. I created a group "Telecom Asia" on Yammer via internet browser, however, I accidently quit the group. Now I cant access the group and since I was the only one and admin created this (but I left the group accidentally), I cant rejoin the group and also
 I cant delete the group. Kindly help</p>

<p>For problem #1&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to check - are you looking at the same Yammer Network in the app, vs what you see in the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each Yammer subscription allows one internal network and multiple external networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that you are looking at your home network in the browser, but you may be on an external network on your app (or vice versa).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For problem #2</p>
<p>Are you on Yammer basic or Yammer Enterprise. If on Yammer Enterprise the network admin can access the group and add you back as a member.</p>

<p>Thanks. I am not the admin. More problem on Yammer as I found it to be one of the most confusing platform. Now I have another new problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My login email is 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (e.g). In the past, the company was XYZ and after separated, all&nbsp; of us migrated to abcd.com (instead of xyz.com).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I login, immediately it will bring my back to the <a href="http://www.yammer.com/xyx.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.yammer.com/xyx.com</a> . I suddenly logged into a site with many ex-colleagues (still under xyz.com). I tried to clear everything (cache, cookies, etc) and then login again . The same thing happened. Then when I change the domain of login to
<a href="http://www.yammer.com/abcd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.yammer.com/abcd.com/</a> to ensure I am logging in from the right site, it will automatically goes back to the
<a href="http://www.yammer.com/xyz.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.yammer.com/xyz.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to delete the account but it doesn't help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very very disappointed because, the login and interface are too complicated. Coupled with what I mentioned earlier, it is a nightmare using yammer which is a good tool in my opinion. It has to be simple. be it logging in via apps on mobile, windows
 app, browser, single sign-on, etc, all should point to the same instant. Now I cant go back to the page in which all my colleagues are connected to (abcd.com) despite I am using the email of
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. This is the biggest mistake, and if you ever wonder why the take up rate in low, this could be one of the reasons. Try LinkedIn , facebook, and wherever you login in
 and as long as with the same email address, you still see the same pages or instants.

<p>Thanks for your feedback. This is the challenge, Yammer is too complicated to be used. To be exact, to login and go to the desired network seem so difficult and complicated. I input more problems in the earlier reply.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't only happen to me but also to many colleagues. Now most are frustrated because it seem to be too complicated like a maze.

<p>Actually, the convenience that Yammer was trying to give you is causing you problems now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you simply type Yammer.com it automatically redirects you to your home network, previously company1</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you moved from company1 to company2, unfortunately, Yammer still tries to direct you to company1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few questions for you -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is company1 using Yammer Basic (Free) or Yammer Enterprise?</p>
<p>2. Is company2 using Yammer Basic (Free) or Yammer Enterprise?</p>
<p>3. How are you logging into Yammer? Meaning what did you type in as userid? company1 or company2 credentials? Did you try logging out of the Company1 Yammer network and logging back in using company2 userid? What was the outcome?</p>
<p>4. Did company1 remove you from their network once you moved to company2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yammer is actually an enterprise app. Companies of sizes 100k users and up use Yammer as a corporate social network. As such, at the back end it necessitates some complexity in terms of settings and security to meet the requirements of more demanding users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many companies try to do Yammer on their own, some without even the admin reading the administration guide. A proper Yammer setup that achieves corporate objectives often necessitates some consultation from a experienced Yammer implementation vendor, proper
 setup, trained administrators and trained users. If users are expecting it to be as simple as personal Facebook or personal whatsapp where zero training (whether self taught, or instructor led, admin or user) is required then the expectation is incorrect.</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For question 1 and 2, I am not sure. I will check with IT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I logged in using company2 ID as I don't use company1 email for about 1 year. In other words, I always login with one ID (which is the company2 ID or email).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, as mentioned, once login, &nbsp;it will be redirected to the company1 page. Very strange. FYI, I did logon successfully over the past 2-3 weeks on company2 page and even created group and posted several articles. This is a surprise for me that now I suddenly
 go to company1 page which non of these are there. Of course, it is a different page. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other point is that, apparently, there are 2 instants (pages) and now I have no clue how to go the company2 page as it kept directing me to company1&nbsp; page&nbsp;(automatically). I am rather surprise because based on login ID
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, it shouldn't have send or direct me to company1 page or shouldn't allow me to enter there.

<p>Can I give a few suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ask company1 to remove you from their Yammer and also to remove your email account. This is good governance if you are no longer part of them you should not have access to their computing environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If Yammer directs you to Yammer1 page, try logging out of Yammer and login with your company2 credentials. This is not "closing" your browser and opening it again. This is once inside company1 yammer, click your photo (or the figure) on the top right
 of the screen, and click sign out. Then sign in with your company2 credentials. See what happens.</p>

<h2>            Changing heading styles in different sections</h2>
                    <p>I want to use Word Styles for headings in word, however I want to use different numbering styles for the pre-TOC and post-TOC sections (I,II, III, then 1, 2,3).&nbsp; I have inserted a section break but can't find how to "break the link" as I would with headers
 and footers...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heading styles 1-4 in the first section, currently numbered 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heading styles 1-4 in the second section, currently numbered 2, 2.1, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to change so first section is numbered I, i, etc</p>
<p>I want to change the second section to start at 1, 1.1, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the section break, can't break the link?</p>

            You can set up a different list for the front matter, but you can't link the same styles to different lists. Another approach is to use otherwise unused styles/levels in the same list. See

<h2>            Windows 10 Mapping to sharepoint team site document library</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to map a office365 sharepoint team site to a new install of Windows 10 Pro with Office 2016 installed. I have added to the trusted sites and tried to map using 'Map Network Drive' however continue to get an error message saying that the site
 needs to be added to the trusted sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have also tried using the OneDrive for Business app, however get an error message saying that the server you are trying to access is not using an authentication protocol supported by this version of Office. How can this be with a new install of Windows 10,
 the latest downloads of Office via the 365 website and up to date subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggests or other methods to try. Both of the above has worked previously on Windows 7 without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            &#91;Solved&#58; Expected behavior&#93; Outlook Web Access&#58; Don&#39;t open when single-clicking message</h2>
                    <p>So, using Outlook on the web, and I'm wondering: How do I stop emails from opening the moment I click on them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually like to click once to select a message, then Ctrl-Click to select another, and so on and so forth until I have a selection that I will then move to an appropriate folder. It seems I have to use these little checkboxes on the left of the list (which
 I wouldn't have noticed had someone not pointed it out to me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an option to disable the Open-on-click thing? This is especially annoying when I double-click an email to open it in a separate window and it ends up loading twice because of this (once in the main window, and again in the popup).</p>

pop-up window will be opened by single clicking the email. It is an expected behavior.

    <title>I deleted a rule, but it is still moving mail as if the rule is still - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giannazk  say:</h3>
<h2>            I deleted a rule, but it is still moving mail as if the rule is still in effect.</h2>
                    I created a Rule to apply to One Person is particular.<br />
It moves mail from Inbox to Folder V.<br />
Then I edited the rule to move the mail back into Inbox.<br />
Then I deleted the Rule, because I was still finding some mail from Person in Folder A and in Inbox.<br />
<br />
The deleted Rule is still sweeping mail from that One Person into Folder A,<br />
It is not even moving the mail based on the condition with which I created the Rule that I then deleted.<br />
I need for this to stop.<br />
I give up on trying to troubleshoot because there is nothing on the internet that addresses my issue and I do not see how it is possible for a DELETED Rule to function.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>I just had to sort through the same (or at least a similar)&nbsp;issue myself. I set up a rule to move messages to the INBOX, then deleted the rule and found that it was still being processed after I had deleted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I have multiple e-mail accounts set up in Microsoft Outlook. I originally created the rule to move all messages to the INBOX in one of my Exchange accounts, but then I noticed that all of my messages (from my other Exchange and IMAP accounts
 as well) were also being sent to the INBOX. This was not at all what I wanted, so I deleted the rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much to my surprise (and horror?), the messages from one account were still being moved into the INBOX for another account. I ended up deleting all of my Outlook rules for my Exchange account from my local Outlook profile, logging in to the Outlook Web App
 online and making sure that all of my rules were deleted. No luck...messages were still being moved from one account to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the other accounts from my Outlook profile, and the messages were no longer moved between accounts. But I wanted to use Outlook for all of my accounts, so I re-added the additional e-mail accounts to my Outlook profile, and right away, the messages
 started moving from my other accounts into my main account's INBOX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new Outlook mail profile and started from scratch. But as soon as I added the other accounts into my new profile, the mail started all getting sent to my main account's INBOX again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FRUSTRATING...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I discovered that the rule I created in my main Exchange account had been
<strong><em>copied to my other mail accounts. </em></strong>So even though I deleted the rule from one Exchange account, my other mailbox had a copy of the same rule applied, so it was still in effect. After deleting the "Move to INBOX" rule on ALL of my Outlook
 e-mail accounts, the problem was resolved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this would apply in your case, but it might be worth taking a look if you have multiple e-mail accounts configured in your Outlook profile. Maybe you have a duplicate rule set up in a different account.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. &nbsp; In my case the rule and mail only applies to one account and none are exchange accounts. &nbsp;They are all IMAP accounts. &nbsp;I deleted ALL of my rules but this one still executes somehow. &nbsp;I've even created new rules to redirect the
 mail to another place, but the deleted rule kicks in first. &nbsp; I've tried everything short of buying and installing a new version of Outlook, which I will probably try soon since older versions of MS software &nbsp;conveniently/inconveniently become less and less
 stable over time. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had this same problem where I deleted the rule, but Outlook 2016 (office 365) kept processing it anyways. &nbsp;After some frustration.... I noticed the rule appeared in "Quick Steps". &nbsp;I deleted the rule in Quick Steps and the rule stopped executing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            seems yahoo mail has some problems coz i also faced similar problem when i tried to set a manual mailbox in messaging folder. Now i'm using nokia messaging email which can attach upto 10 accounts and i didn't face any such problem. Till yahoo sorts its
 problem you can use the same and by that time you'll fall in love with it and wont part with it!so give it a try.

            Can you elaborate it? As i've said above, setting up a yahoo mailbox in messaging folder manually i.e. without using nokia messaging email you'll get errors. You can install nokia messaging by clicking on settings wizard icon in your menu. If you want
 manual delivery click on manual delivery after adding the desired mail account. A mailbox will be setup in messaging folder instead of adding to nokia messaging email account by doing this.

<b>Shift</b> key. When done selecting release the <b>Shift</b> key and drag one attachment. All selected attachments should come along.

<p>I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; I'm running Windows 10, Version 10.0.17134.&nbsp; I cannot select more than one photo at a time for transfer from my SD card to my hard drive.&nbsp; Neither the shift key (to select contiguous photos) nor the control key (to select non-contiguous
 photos) works with the left click on the mouse.&nbsp; My mouse is a Gearhead wireless optical mouse Model No. MPT3200Red.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The shift/click and control/keys functions work with File Explorer on the usual menus but NOT on photos in a file folder.</p>

<p><span>Activities are pulled up by a search query. Sometimes the corruption in a PST file could prematurely stop the search process because of which you may not find any data. Repair the PST file and verify
 the issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The steps below will help you in getting the PST file repaired.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Exit Outlook if it is running.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click Scanpst.exe, located at drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE14.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Enter the name of the file you want to scan box, enter the name of the .pst file that you want to check, or click Browse to search for the file.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To specify the scan log options, click Options, and then click the option that you want.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start. </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If errors are found after the scan is complete, you will be prompted to start the repair process to fix the errors.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A backup file is created during the repair process. To change the default name or location of this backup file, in the Enter name of backup file box, enter a new name, or click Browse to look
 for the file that you want to use. </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Repair. </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>8.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Start Outlook by using the profile that contains the .pst file that you tried to repair.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>9.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the Go menu, click Folder List.</span></p>

<p>I seemed to have solved the problem that everyone is struggling with on this thread.</p>
<p>In the bottom left corner of the Outlook 2010 Home screen you should see icons for Mail, Calendar, Contacts, etc.</p>
<p>Right click your mouse while it is in that area and select "Navigation Pane Options..."</p>
<p>The "Journal" box was unchecked on my system.&nbsp; Check it and click on OK.</p>
<p>Now the Journal Icon (Green square) will appear in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>Right click the icon and at least in my case all my Outlook 2003 Journals appear and I am able to navigate, search, add and do whatever I was used to doing in Outlook 2003.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<div><strong>These are 7 things you should already know about a hacked account (or if your machine was accessed remotely by an unknown person)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1-Recover your account (if you can)</strong><br />
<strong>Important:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>If
 you cannot recover access to your account, then it is now someone else's account. It is now the hacker's account.</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Unless you've backed up, everything in it is gone forever and you can skip the next two items. You'll need to set up
 a new account from scratch.<br />
<br />
<strong>2-Change your password NOW</strong><br />
One you regain access to your account, or if you never lost it, you should immediately change your password.<br />
<strong><br />
3-Change your security information</strong><br />
While the hacker had access to your account, they may elect to leave your password alone. That way, chances are you won't notice that the account has been hacked for a while longer.<br />
<br />
<em>But whether they changed your password or not, they may very well have gone in and changed the recovery information.</em><br />
<br />
<em>The reason is simple: when you finally do get around to changing your password, the hacker can follow the "I forgot my password" steps and reset
 the password out from underneath you using the recovery information that he collected or set.</em></div>
<div><strong>3a-remove any unknown PC's from trusted or they will simply change it back<br />
<br />
4-Check related accounts<br />
5-Let your contacts know</strong><br />
<strong><br />
6-Start backing up</strong><br />
 of the common reactions to my recommending you let your contacts know is: "But my contacts are gone! The hacker erased them all and all of my email as well!"<br />
</strong></span><br />
<strong>Yes. That happens sometimes. It's often part of a hacker not wanting to leave a trail – they delete everything in the account: everything they've
 done along with everything you've done.</strong><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If
 you're like most people, you've not been backing up your online email.</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span>All I can suggest at this point is to see if your email service will restore it for you. In general, they will not. Because the deletion was not their doing, but
 rather the doing of someone logged into the account, they may simply claim it's your responsibility.<br />
<br />
<strong>Hard as it is to hear, they're right.</strong><br />
<strong><br />
Start backing up your email now. Start backing up your contacts now.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><br />
7-Learn from your experience.</strong><br />
Aside from "I should have been backing up," one of the most important lessons to learn from the experience is to consider all of the ways that your account could have been hacked, and then take appropriate steps to protect yourself from a repeat occurrence
 in the future.<br />

<p>Hi Charlie,<br />
<br />
Corrupted Internet Explorer components are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. We suggest resetting the Internet Options to see if it helps. Follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <strong>Internet Options </strong>in the search bar, then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Go to the <strong>Advanced </strong>tab.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>, then click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />

<p>Don't do the reset yet.</p>

</p><p>The Reset IE Settings button will do a number of things. The most inconvenient for most users is the deletion of passwords. After clicking Reset you will see a screen telling you what will be done before clicking again to do the actual reset.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 and Microsoft Office 2010 Professional</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a new Dell laptop&nbsp;with Student &amp; Home Office 2010 pre-&nbsp;installed.&nbsp; I cannot survive without Outlook.&nbsp; I have another new laptop that needs Office.&nbsp; It did not come preloaded with Office 2010.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; Can the 2010 Office Professional
 be loaded on a Windows 8 w/o major problems?&nbsp; Should I purchase Outlook 2010 for this computer and Student &amp; Home 2010 for my 13 year olds or just upgrade them both to the Office 2010 professional?&nbsp; Trying not break the bank and make a poor decision because
 of Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            If you have a Product Key for Office Home and Student that came with your computer, take a close look at it. If it came in the big yellow plastic box with the CD, that is almost certainly the "retail" license. The box may say "3 Home PC licenses" on it.&nbsp;
 That is good for you.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If they more likely gave you a Product Key Card or a fully activated at the factory, OEM license copy of&nbsp; Home and Student then it is NOT transferable after activation on a computer.&nbsp; You could keep the Product Key Card without using it and give it to your
 daughter for her machine.<br />
<br />
To use your copy of Office for work (aka "Business") Home and Student is not licensed for that type of use so you would have to buy Home and Business, which includes Outlook.<br />
<br />
If your copy of Office is already activated, the best approach is probably to use the anytime upgrade process to get Home and Business.<br />
<b>I have Office Home and Student. I Need Outlook. Now What? – Anytime Upgrade</b>
<p>You will have to buy Office 2010 Home and Business to get Outlook.</p>
<p>If you start with Office Home and Student and realize that you need Outlook, you have 3 options:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Buy standalone Outlook to add to Home and student</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Buy Home and Business full bundle</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Use Office Anytime Upgrade offer</p>
<p>Pros and Cons:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The standalone Outlook does not integrate with Word in Home and Student, and it is the most expensive combination.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Buying Home and Business is better price wise, especially since you can resell the Home and Student to someone else.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Apparently MS provides a discounted price to using Anytime Upgrade to a full Home and Student bundle</p>
<p>Here is the new and improved solution (much better than our previous advice) to your problem, direct from MS Customer Service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Anytime Upgrade offers you a discounted upgrade between Office 2010 bundles.
</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I contacted Microsoft directly and was able to get an upgrade to Home and Business for $79.95.&nbsp; I was told that there is no way to buy it from the Microsoft store website but that you can get it through the Office website.&nbsp; (The rep said
 that the easiest way was to contact Microsoft.)&nbsp; Microsoft will e-mail you an authorization code so you can upgrade.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Dear Charlie,</p>
<p>Warm greetings from Microsoft Customer Service Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Based on our recent phone conversation, here's the step by step instruction of upgrading the Office Home and Business 2010 to Office Professional 2010.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the start button</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click all programs</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the Microsoft Office folder</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the Microsoft Office 2010 tools folder</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on office anytime upgrade</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You'd be routed to a new window so click the "buy Microsoft Professional 2010 link</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You'd be routed to another window, just click on the "upgrade now" link for $220.
</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Just follow the prompts and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>I hope I was able to address your inquiry to your satisfaction, should you have further questions, relating to this inquiry, please don't hesitate to contact us back.</p>

<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>Here is another similar story:</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I went to Office Anytime Upgrade under Start Menu </p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Made payment for Office Home &amp; Student &gt;&gt; Home &amp; Business upgrade ($120)</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>After payment, a box with an "Install" button came up. I wasn't given the opportunity to save the download. I was given a new Product key.</p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I clicked Install &amp; it installed (or upgraded?) to Office 2010 Home &amp; Business</p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I ran Excel &amp; Word, and the "non-commercial use" was no longer there</p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>However, under my Control Panel / Uninstall Programs, there is only 1 office installation - Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2010; there isn't any Home &amp; Business.</p>
<p><span>My main intention in upgrading was to get rid of the "non-commercial use", so it turned out ok. But is there anything wrong that I did? Why does Control Panel show Home &amp; Student? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>Here is the “old” advice as an alternative.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Consider it based on the upgrade price they present you.</p>
<p>You have to buy a product key that is valid for Outlook. </p>
<p>The simplest apparent solution is to buy Outlook standalone for roughly USD$140. However, I have been told that this may not be the best overall approach for a couple of reasons. The obvious reason is that you'll have to manage 2 separate
 Office installations: separate install files/CD's and separate product keys. The other reason I've been told about is that when you install a standalone Outlook it does NOT fully integrate with the existing H&amp;S. Apparently spell checking dictionaries are maintained
 separately and a few other things.</p>
<p>If you do the math, retail H&amp;S has list price USD$150. Standalone Outlook has list price USD$140. Home and Business is USD$280. So, if you have the option, buying H&amp;B makes best sense all around.</p>
<p>If you bought the Retail/"FPP" license for H&amp;S, you have the option of uninstalling it and reselling it to someone else. If you have an OEM or Product Key Card license transferring the license to someone else is NOT an option.</p>
<p>PS: prices assume Retail/"FPP" license (my only recommendation). The product key card name "equivalents" are slightly cheaper on the surface. But if you understand the implication of license terms, you instantly realize that for most
 people the PKC is effectively a s*c*a*m IMO (because most people are not aware of the downsides of the the PKC when they buy it)</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>This discussion has an interesting point. One user was apparently able to make standalone Outlook “play nice” with Home and Student. Simply by copying WinWord.exe into the same directory as standalone Outlook.exe was installed.<span>&nbsp;

2013 upgrade.&nbsp; That is called the "Pre-Launch" offer. The copy of office that came with your computer probably won't qualify, but anything that you buy (I don't know about Anytime upgrade, but I suspect it won't qualify) will most likely qualify for the Offer.<br />

    <title>Windows Update uninstalled Office Pro 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peternham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update uninstalled Office Pro 2016</h2>
                    After I downloaded the last set of Windows Updates, I found that Office Pro 2016 had been uninstalled. I tried reinstalling it online &amp; was asked for my product key. I entered it &amp; the reinstallation went ahead, although I now get a message asking for
 the product key every time I open an app. This can be dismissed by pressing Cancel &amp; then app works. However, I received a message from Microsoft saying that I had now used the key the maximum number of times (2) &amp; could no longer use it. I was planning to
 transfer this copy of Office to a new laptop but now am unable to. Any idea how I can get Microsoft to reauthorise the key for another installation? Thanks

            Thats not right, a win update, even a major update will not uninstall Office Pro 2016, and in any case it cannot be reinstalled with the Key, as the key is only used in the initial install/activation process when the MS Account is used/created<br />
