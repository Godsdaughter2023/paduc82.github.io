            <p>Besides Defender, the following recommendations will assist in protecting the PC from infection:</p>
<p>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</p>
<p>-Make sure Internet Explorer is updated with all patches.</p>
<p>-In Internet Explorer use the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</p>
<p>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</p>
<p>-On Vista and later make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>and not running with elevated privileges.</p>
<p>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible
 after being notified of available updates.</p>
<p>-<span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline"><font>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many

<p>
</p><p>That's the error I always get when I click on "Get Started"on the Windows Insider Program section. I really need a quick fix since I'm not able to download the latest Insider build. Everything you see on other posts with solutions have been tried by me,
 with no success, so please, if you can, do not answer those solutions here. Thanks in advance!</p>

                    I am getting tired of waiting for Microsoft to release the newest preview. I thought we were supposed to be the ones that would help them find bugs. Not to mention the more important people are way ahead of us in builds which isn't fair.It makes me feel
 like we don't matter. C'mon release the dam thing already lol

            I personally think Microsoft realized they f'd up with windows 8, and how un user friendly it was. Thus we hav windows 10, which is just a reboot of windows 8.1, sort of windows 8.11. They are offering it for free, to cover up the fact that they pushed
 out a crappy operating system

            <p>Thanks for your reply... &nbsp;To get into the Store I need to log in with my account which I can not do because to add another account it requires typing on a settings screen that appears to use Edge...which is the heart of my problem. &nbsp;Typing alpha letters
 results in numbers. &nbsp;Therefore I can't add my windows account so I can get into the Store....?? &nbsp;Catch 22.</p>

            <p>For IE users that would be a symptom of using a third-party security product called ConstantGuard.&nbsp; Apparently some ISP's install that with their install package.&nbsp; If you have such a thing installed see if there is an uninstall procedure for it.</p>

            <p>Don't have ConstantGuard. &nbsp;This is a Lenova laptop originally with 7. &nbsp;It had McAfee WebAdvisor which I tried to remove, via Control, Programs, Uninstall before the upgrade to 10. &nbsp;Also tried to get rid of it after and still can't get rid of it... &nbsp;It did
 originally have "stuff" originally as well as malware. &nbsp;Several passes with Malwarebytes helped to get it so it was working....before upgrading to win10. &nbsp;Only problem now is with Edge.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive sync tool stops syncing a location - say&#39;s it has been deleted</h2>
                    <p>In the past week, I and a number of my users have experienced OneDrive dropping the sync on various cloud locations with the message "&lt;Location&gt;" has been deleted. "&lt;Location&gt;" will stop being synced. A copy of these files will be left on this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users have experienced this for OD4B and SharePoint locations. So far, only one location has dropped, even when the user has multiple. There is no reports of anyone deleting folders in the audit log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this before? Could any external factors affect the OneDrive sync tools ability to see a location and therefore believe it is still connected - e.g. Azure VPN or our network Firewall?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>We had made some recent firewall changes but this appears to not be related because the issue has settled down now. We have not had another instance of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it was as support suggested - a result of a OneDrive sync client update. But I doubt it.</p>

<h2>            SOLVED&#58; Copying Email to Folder Changes Received Time &#38; Date</h2>
                    
<p>SOLVED: Turning off the preview pane allowed the message to be copied <br />
without changing the received time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Howdy, <br />
Here's what going on and if anyone has any ideas/solutions I would <br />
greatly appreciate it: <br />
(Outlook 2003 SP3 on Win XP SP3) <br />
Some of the secretaries have their attorney's email open in the left <br />
pane so they can copy email from the Inbox to a "To be filed" folder <br />
so the messages can be imported into our document management <br />
software. &nbsp;If the secretary copies one message from the Inbox to the <br />
"To be filed" folder the received time listed in the "Received" column<br />
does not change. &nbsp;If they copy more than one message, the received <br />
time listed changes to the current time for ONLY the first message. <br />
The others do not change. &nbsp;The header info for the changed message <br />
doesn't change, however. <br />
The received time does not change if the secretary copies one or more <br />
than one message from her own Inbox to a folder in her mailbox. &nbsp;This <br />
only happens when copies of more than one message occur for mailboxes <br />
other than the user. <br />
Thanks! <br />
Pete</p>

<h2>            How do i get rid of Purple Flag links&#63;</h2>
                    How do I get rid of the very annoying "Purple flag Link" On any website I visit there are a number of words highlighted and double underlined. rolling the mouse over them, a purple flag pops up with links to anything even remotely connected to that word.
 I can go to "purple flag.net and "opt out". Refresh the&nbsp;website and then they are gone, but only temporarily. I havbe never clicked on any of these flags. They even change the font and size of whatever word that is highlighted.

<p>I can't think why anyone would want this feature on their computer. Interesting that there is no way to trace it back to the originator.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 920 Fast battery drain - but all is not what it seems....</h2>
                    
<p>I've been going nuts with my battery today, watching it drain around 10-15% per hour doing absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Woke up checked phone (on wireless charger all night) - 82% - **bleep** ??!!??</p>
<p>Put onto AC Charger</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8:00 - 100% Battery - Take off charger</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9:30 - 86%</p>
<p>I turned on Battery Saver - No Difference</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10:20 - 77%</p>
<p>Power cycle phone - No Difference</p>
<p>Changed email polling settings - No Difference</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10:50 - 70%</p>
<p>Flight Mode on - No Difference</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11:28 - 62%</p>
<p>Block ALL background apps - No Difference</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11:51 - 57%</p>
<p>Uninstalled two apps - No Difference</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12:57 - 42%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is ridiculous! It's losing battery doing absolutely nothing. Phone is cool to the touch so processor isn't doing much either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform forced soft reset (power + vol down 10 seconds)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone boots up. Battery is 91%.</p>
<p>Hmm........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All is not what it seems.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so it continues......</p>
<p>Battery draining at a rapid rate - supposedly. Force a reset and battery comes back to what it should be.</p>
<p>I have screenshots showing battery draining around 10-15% per hour.</p>
<p>Even Windows believes the battery is that low - including shutting down the phone!</p>
<p>Reset and back up she comes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Left it last night on charger....</p>
<p>According to Windows - my phone has 0% charge - YES ZERO PERCENT (even though I'm currently using it!!!)</p>
<p>According to one of the battery apps (using two at the moment so I can check one against the other) - I have 1,065,353,216% battery. (That number changes every time it goes in.) It normally reads "normal" numbers and reports te same as Battery in settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Called Nokia support (what a joke that is). Eventually spoke with a human, offered to work with them to diagnose the issue as I'm in IT, and&nbsp;I have a phone reliably producing a problem that I think many others are having - an intermittent issue that can
 be hard to replicate. (How many people with bad battery life have rebooted the phone to verify the true battery state?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently the only choice is to pack it up and send it interstate for at least 2 weeks....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it was an iPhone, I could make a booking and take it to the Apple Centre and they would check it on the spot, and fix or replace as required - then and there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can Nokia expect to break into Business clients if that's the standard of service they offer? At least 2.5 weeks without a phone? Are you serious?!?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've requested the issue be escalated and am currently awaiting a call back......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting to reconsider the wisdom of my phone choice....</p>

            ok ok calm down mate. you may have a hardware problem here so please don't panic.<br />
<br />
have you got the Portico update installed and checked that you have the latest Nokia system apps from the Store installed? if so , try performing a soft reset (pressing the volume down and power buttons together untilk the phone vibrates). failing that, you
 can try a hard reset (Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone). make a backup of all personal data first as this reset wipes everything.<br />
<br />
failing the above, you will need to contact Nokia Care: <a href="http://nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://nokia.com/support</a><br />
<br />
by your reference to interstate, i assume that you live in Australia? you just hand in your handset to Australia Post and they will send it to Nokia for repair in Rydlemere, NSW.

            Well, I don't know (and nor would anyone else I'd suggest) that it's a hardware problem or a software one - and I work in IT. All I do know is the battery is not at the level the phone is telling me. That could be a sensor issue (hardware), or driver /
 software / OS issue.<br />
<br />
I don't believe it's got Portico - the OS is 8.0.10211.204, Firmware 1232.5951.1249.1007<br />
All the latest upgrades available to me are installed.<br />
<br />
Performing a "soft reset" is what I was doing originally - which immediately after the reboot will tell me the truth about the battery, before it goes silly again.<br />
<br />
I could do a hard reset - but my offer to Nokia was that here's a phone doing something pretty stupid - do you want a change to find out why. There's nothing overly special in terms of software or config, so if it can affect my phone, it could affect anyones.<br />
<br />
The joke is when it's in "confused" mode, the phone REALLY thinks the battery is that low, including shutting itself down to save itself.<br />
When it thought it had drained down to ZERO battery and was off the charger the first time - I had to very quickly soft reset while it was booting up in order to make it usable again. Then battery went back to like 55%....<br />
<br />
I contacted Nokia Care, but I didn't find it very caring.<br />
<br />
Yes I live in Australia, but my point is as a business tool, who can honestly pack their phone up and send it off for 3 weeks odd? In this day and age, that's very sub par support.<br />
<br />
I offered them to install whatever they wanted on the phone to diagnose / log / figure it out.<br />
<br />
There's lots of comments I've read about people having battery life of 4 hours odd - which sounds exactly like what mine is doing - except it's lying. They (Nokia) have a perfect chance to diagnose this with a live phone and an understanding user - but the
 "Nokia Care" people weren't interested.....<br />

            i understand you're upset about this and understandably so. i'm also sure that Nokia are aware of any battery issues and are doing their best to investigate and integrate fixes into updates (one is coming soon with further stability fixes, so that shouldn't
 be more than a month or two away).<br />
<br />
there used to be Nokia Care centres in every state, but they closed down a year and a bit ago, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
unfortunately, there is nothing that we can do for you here except what i have suggested above. i am deeply sorry that your phone has inconvenienced you, and hope that the issue can be resolved to your satisfaction.

<p>I'm starring at 5 day battery life after a day of normal / light use. The two items that has seemed to impact me the most is having wifi and NFC. Turning off wifi when it goes to the lock screen has seemed to have cured a lot of my battery drain issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is NOT what gets me to a 5-7 day charge life. Yes, I use it lightly&nbsp; the device when the battery to last this long. Normal is 25%-50% drain a day with heavy browsing, talking, and streaming blue-tooth. The maximum "normal" drain I've seen is 9% an hour.
 What gets me up to this superb battery life is the fact that I turn off the phone after every app update. I turn it off when it gets warm too (usually only during wireless charging).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I don't power-cycle after an update I see up to a 25% drain an hour!</p>

<p>Update....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, after going to great lengths to make sure Nokia Care knew the exact details of the issue, and that a level 3 tech should investigate it and find the root cause, not just reformat it and lose the working example of a fault, I received my phone back
 after nearly two weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The repair sheet - Replace some screws and silicone (ie they opened the case), clean some contacts. Reset phone to factory settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time taken to replicate issue once returned - 1 hour. <strong>Yes, in under 1 hour the issue was apparent again</strong>. Great work guys....NOT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spoke to care centre again and what a joke. Oh, send it back in again and we'll check it out. This time we may replace the main board. I went to great lengths to ensure they fully understood the issue so someone can diagnose it, not wipe the phone and let
 it pass a five minute test. Nokia wasted an opportunity to learn about something affecting their product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, I'm supposed to also have faith that this time it will be fixed - no really because at Nokia we do all these tests to ensure it's ok. So how did my phone come back with me able to fault it in under an hour then??!!?? And I'm supposed to go without
 my phone for ANOTHER 2 weeks odd while they try again....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I sit here again, my phone showing 0% battery after being on charge all night..... I know if I reboot it it'll reset the battery counter and for&nbsp;two minutes it'll be correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The joke is they are turning someone who REALLY wants Nokia / Windows Phone to succeed, so someone who is about to demand a refund....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screenshots showing ZERO % battery, Battery monitor showing drain rat, battery monitor showing drain rate and afgter a reboot batteryu jumps up to true reading before downward spiral again (whilst in Flight mode and battery saver on!!!)......</p>
<p>Next reply is Reinstalled battery monitor showing interesting battery % remaining....</p>

<p>Thanks, but it's not draining the battery really. The battery status (both the Battery App and the Phone OS Battery level) are incorrect. If I force-reboot the phone the correct battery life will come back (for a very short time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even uninstalled the battery app, had flight mode on and battery saver on - and still watched battery supposedly draining at around 20% per hour......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out the screenshot that shows the battery graph with the jump up. That was the reboot, not charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Simon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps. I'll check the app out anyway.</p>

<h2>            Accounts not linking properly</h2>
                    Probably the most asked question on here, judging by how frustrating this is.<br />
<br />
My phone is logged into my correct Skype account which shows my credit.<br />
<br />
I just downloaded Skype on my laptop and it would not log in with my original details, so I had to reset the password.<br />
I can now log in and both accounts are linked to the same email address, yet the laptop account doesn't show my balance or contacts.<br />
<br />
As a third 'entertainment', my iPad won't log into my Skype account at all now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can see why everyone uses Whats App these days.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help offered on this.<br />

 given a phone number to call, 1-888-732-0076, I called and the person who answered did not give any information so I asked if I had reached Microsoft support. &nbsp;I was told yes, I was then connected with Steve who informed me that he was the tech who would help
 me. To make a long story short. &nbsp;He showed me how many errors and also that I had a virus, sorry can't remember the name. &nbsp;I agreed to pay them $99.99 in two payments. on the 10th and next month on the &nbsp;9th (SS). &nbsp;This morning I received an email telling me
 that I need to sign a statement saying that they can take money out of my bank account.....I did not do anything with that email and I am calling my bank to stop any transactions from them or to cancel my debit card (yes I gave them my number). &nbsp;Did I mention
 that of the 3 people I talked to they all spoke with an accent. &nbsp;they gave me this information &nbsp;KLS SOFTECH LLC (new Jersey) &nbsp;Toll Free:-1-888-732-0076 &nbsp;Email:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp;Was I scammed? If so who should I report it too?</span>

            <p>Yes, you got scammed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not knowing exactly what they did when they had access, you must consider the possibility that any personal information has been compromised. Any financial items on your PC? Credit card payments/billing? If yes, cancel those cards NOW!. Bank online? Have
 a debit card? Call your bank ASAP.</p>

    <title>Row number in cell reference based on variable cell value - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boring.dave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Row number in cell reference based on variable cell value</h2>
                    <p>Hello. As a relatively new Excel user (Excel for Mac v. 15.3), I am struggling with what I thought would be a simple problem.</p>
<p>I have a table with multiple columns, each of which contains a list of selected integers between 1 and 340. These represent case numbers in an audit, with each column containing only those numbers which are positive with respect to the particular criteria
 defined by that column - so the values are never repeated within the same column.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to copy the value in each cell of the column to a new column, but with the row number defined by the value in that column. (Only alternate columns A, C, E are filled, leaving B, D, F etc. for the returned results). So, for example, if the first three
 cells A1, A2, A3 in column A contain the values 83, 41, 279, I want the formula to return the values 83, 41, 279 into cells B83, B41 and B279 respectively. It doesn't matte that the intervening cells will be blank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I then want to repeat the exercise for column C into column D, E into F etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a way to do it for the whole spreadsheet at once that would be great, but even if i have to do one column at a time that would be acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas appreciated.</p>

<p>Vlookup will look for the number of the row in the first column, and if it finds it, will put it in the current cell exactly as it is in the original cell.</p>
<p>Ifna will replace the "N/A" with a "" (a blank cell) if there is no match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, if your excel is old enough that you don't have ifna, you can use =if(isna(vlookup(row(),A:A,1,false),"", vlookup(row()A:A,1,false) but it is clunkier.</p>

<h2>            &#34;How to remove invisible footer in word&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a template, from a friend to set-up my CV/Resume, unfortunately when I remove or amend the footer in the word document and email it to prospective hiring managers, my friends footer with his email address and telephone number appears although, I have
 removed the footer and therefore I can't see it. Even if I change the footer to reflect my details, it still shows my friends details when hiring managers receive the CV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have opened a new word document and pasted the text of my CV/Resume and it still shows my friends contact details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I permanently remove the footer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to hear from you soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right on Stefan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue was caused by the presence of a Continuous Section Break several lines before the end of the last page of the document and the unwanted footer was in that Section and as a result, it was not visible until a page was added to the end of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It perhaps is a bit illogical that Word does not display the footer that is in the last Section on a page when the Section Start is continuous.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
there is an official Nokia web site at<br />
http://www.nokiaaccessibility.com<br />
<br />
that addresses disability issues.<br />
<br />
Although it mainly focuses on products that are available in the USA only, much of the general information is relevant also in Europe.<br />

<h3> nl810  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook won&#39;t sync with my Lumia 950 XL</h2>
                    <p>It has been 9 days now since my Outlook account email has synced with my Windows 10 Mobile phone. My gmail accounts and my work Exchange account sync just fine. It is just my Live email that won't sync. It will sync just fine on my computer. It just doesn't
 sync with my phone. I have tried removing the account and adding it again, but I get the same problem. I do not get any error messages or anything. When I hit the sync button it just says "Syncing..." then after about 30-45 seconds says "It's been X days since
 your account has been synced". Super frustrating. I miss emails on the go because they aren't getting pushed to my phone. Has anyone else had this problem or does anyone know a fix?</p>
<p>

    <title>Cannot See Worksheet Content Unless I Expand or Collapse the Ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot See Worksheet Content Unless I Expand or Collapse the Ribbon</h2>

 Excel files that all worked just fine using Excel 2013.&nbsp; Even if I save the file after it becoming visible, the content is still invisible the next time I open it, again until I either expand or collapse the ribbon.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I have solved the problem, and your reply was helpful in pointing me in the right direction. I will describe what I have done in an effort to provide some information that could be useful to others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the issue does not happen with any other Office 2016 applications; only Excel.&nbsp; It happened to every worksheet I opened, regardless of whether it had any active content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not aware of the "Safe Mode" for Excel, so thanks for letting me know about that.&nbsp; When I used "Safe Mode" the files would open and were visible.&nbsp; I was able to isolate the problem as being caused by "Excel Add-Ins" (Not "COM Add-Ins", as had been
 suggested in your reply).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is a bit of a long narrative of the problem and what I did to resolve it.&nbsp; I want to provide as much information as possible so hopefully someone can come up with a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first tried using the new version of Excel, I opened some fairly complex worksheets and I got "Compile Errors" when I tried to run certain VBA routines that were an integral part of the worksheets.&nbsp; These worksheets use the Solver Add-In to converge
 on a solution, so I checked to see that the Solver was properly installed.&nbsp; I noted that when I installed Office 2016, Excel had deactivated my Excel Add-Ins (including Solver).&nbsp; So, I re-activated the Excel Add-Ins, and re-ran the VBA routines and they worked
 fine.&nbsp; It was after this that I noticed that opening any worksheet resulted in invisible content.&nbsp; Thinking that the Add-ins may have caused the problem, I systematically de-activated the Add-Ins (one at a time, while keeping the others activated).&nbsp; I had
 a total of four Excel Add-ins that I reactivated.&nbsp; There was no effect from de-activating each Add-In individually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran Excel in "Safe Mode" as you suggested, everything opened fine, and the worksheet was visible.&nbsp; So I deactivated
 which Add-In might be causing the problem.&nbsp; When I reactivated the Solver Add-In, the "Compile Errors" went away, but the worksheet content was invisible until I would either expand or collapse the ribbon.&nbsp; It turns out that when I had
<p>
</p><p>So here is how the problem was resolved:&nbsp; It seems that at least the Solver no longer needs to be activated as an Add-In in Excel 2016, but older worksheets that use the Solver will not work immediately in Excel 2016 when a VBA routine that calls the Solver
 is executed.&nbsp; So what did work, was that I opened each worksheet that used a VBA Solver call while I had the Solver Add-In activated.&nbsp; I expanded or collapsed the ribbon so I could see the content of the worksheet and then ran any one of the VBA Solver routines
 in my worksheet.&nbsp; Then I saved the worksheets and disabled the Solver.&nbsp; Now whenever I open the newly saved worksheets, they open properly with all content visible and the VBA Solver routines run correctly even though the Solver Add-In is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just had to do this to every worksheet that I had that used the Solver Add-In.&nbsp; I suppose it recompiled the VBA routines and integrated the Solver into the worksheet so afterwards the Solver Add-In no longer needed to be activated.&nbsp; I noticed for those
 worksheets after they were fixed, that when I open the Developer menu and look at my VBA routines, there is a new object named "SOLVER (Solver.xlam)" that is now a part of the VBA Project structure, that was not present in the previous version from Office
 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I did not have too many worksheets that I had to fix, but it would appear that there is something fundamentally different about how Excel 2016 handles the Solver (and maybe other Add-Ins) that required me to go through this process to get them
 to work properly in Excel 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help with&nbsp; the "Safe Mode" suggestion, as this at least pointed me in the right direction to isolating the problem.&nbsp; I hope that if this is something that others are experiencing (and not just some quirk of how I program in VBA, and used
 the Solver within some of my VBA routines) that a general fix can be developed and distributed.</p>

            Hi Philip, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you won't need a Product Key  and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>
