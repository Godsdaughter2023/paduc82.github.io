            If the watermark is part of the image, you cannot remove it in Word.&nbsp; With some Graphics Applications, such as Irfanview, you can probably change the colour of the watermark to white so that it no longer appears on the image itself.

            Does the watermark appear only on the image shown or on all pages of the document? If just on the image, then Doug's answer is correct. If on the entire document, then you should be able to delete it by accessing the document header, selecting the watermark
 image, and pressing <strong>Delete</strong>. Some printers also allow addition of a watermark as part of the print process, but it won't be seen in Print Layout view.

<h3> kensidney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013&#47;Outlook&#47;LinkedIn&#47;Windows 10.</h2>
                    I spent some time trying to get Office 2013/Win 10 to work with linkedIn.&nbsp; Long story short LinkedIn is not displayed in the accounts or people area at all.

<p>I only see facebook, SharePoint, Windows Live Messenger and more.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>when I tried to use More, linkedin was not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then found the items below.</p>
<p>Use LinkedIn for Outlook app to connect to your social network</p>
<p>LinkedIn for Outlook app is now available on the Office Store. Use the app to get insights about people who you meet with, or send an email message to on LinkedIn. The app is supported in Outlook 2013 if you have an Office 365 mailbox, or if you're in an
 on-premises Exchange Server 2013 environment. </p>
Install and enable LinkedIn for Outlook app
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Apps for Outlook">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Apps for Outlook</span></a>, and choose the <strong>LinkedIn for Outlook</strong> app.</p>

</li><li>
<p>Choose <strong>Add</strong> to install the app, and follow the instructions to finish the installation.</p>

</li><li>
<p>When the app is installed, open Outlook and go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>
Manage Apps</strong>. Then select <strong>LinkedIn</strong> &gt; <strong>Enable</strong> if it's not enabled already.
</p>
<p>You can also enable the app from <strong>Outlook Web App</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Manage apps</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fosiprodeusodcspstoa01.blob.core.windows.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2fac24aec7-ab02-4ff2-b247-fe78b7b0163c.png" /></p>
</li><li>
<p>Confirm after you enable the app that you see it listed below the <strong>To</strong> line in the email message header. If you don't see the app in Outlook Web App or in Outlook after a few minutes, disable the app, and then re-enable it.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The first time you select the app, you'll be asked for your LinkedIn credentials. Enter your LinkedIn email address and password to sign in.</p>

<p><strong>Note </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also install other communications apps for Outlook. Visit the

    <title>Issues with Store Apps and Charms bar in 10 TP &#40; touchpad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shyam senthil nathan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Store Apps and Charms bar in 10 TP &#40; touchpad hardships &#41;</h2>
                    <p>Most annoying changes so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1 </strong>Clicking on the networks icon in the tray used to open the corresponding place in the
<strong>Charms</strong> bar, but now it opens <strong>Connections</strong> of <strong>
PC Settings</strong>, which is stupid to navigate to, change settings, and close, especially with a touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2</strong> Swiping between apps was a boon, bu now? Swiping from left or right in the touchpad is almost useless. Swiping from the left should switch between apps, or atleast, between&nbsp;<strong>Task View</strong> desktops.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3 </strong>Charms bar!! One good feature spoiled to rot. Swiping from right in touchpad or
<strong>Win + C</strong> opens a small popup in the top-left corner of an app ( <strong>
...</strong>&nbsp;), choosing an item from that opens <strong>Chrams</strong>, on the right corner.. most arduous navigation necessary.. very stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope these hardships get addressed.</p>

<h3> ranopano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dynamically hyperlink chart labels&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
As seen in the image below I have a pivot chart 10 categories in it. This pivot chart is controlled by slicers so the data and category labels are dynamic will change depending on what slicer is selected.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c374a03-a340-442e-bdb7-96cde7dd8bce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c374a03-a340-442e-bdb7-96cde7dd8bce" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do is have the data labels (category 1, category 2, etc) be hyperlinks. When the hyperlink is clicked, this will take the user to another page in the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure where to begin with this. I think this is something that would need to be done in VBA, but I'm not sure where to start with this. Can anyone assist or give me a pointers on where to begin?</p>

            <p>Re:&nbsp; hyperlinks to data labels<br />
<br />
You can hyperlink to a chart, but not to the data labels. (untll proven differently)</p>
<p><br />
You could place clear rectangles over the data labels and hyperlink from them.</p>
<p>Another way, if the chart is embedded, is to create a hyperlinked cell list adjoining the chart.<br />
<br />
I can conceive of a VBA approach that would read the chart name or chart properties (when it is clicked) and change the cell hyperlinks accordingly. - I will not be attemping that.<br />
(maybe, if you can get me a date with Brie Larson). &lt;grin&gt;<br />

            <p>Here's what I've worked up so far, it's a little hacky but seems to be workin:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7e6cf88-c027-46da-b6f5-ce37de151731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7e6cf88-c027-46da-b6f5-ce37de151731" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my pivot table. I create a NEW TABLE linking to the pivot table cells. then i create a regular part based off that that newly made table and cut off the axis and extra formatting and line it up to cell size. then for the data labels I just use a reference
 to the cells names in either the pivot table or newly made table, doesn't really matter. And it works!&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b2a88fd-4a42-4db3-8430-784755ea0115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b2a88fd-4a42-4db3-8430-784755ea0115" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Slicers work and everything!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now do i hyperlink the new chart label name? Because these chart labes are referencing the pivot table, they will move around on the filter, so how can i establish the hyperlink to reference "category 1" and not just the cell name of f22. do you know
 what i mean?</p>
<p>Each category name has its own separate hyperlinks, so the actual link won't know which category name you are referring to when you click it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Next question, probably more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the life expectancy of VBA, given the stated preference for other languages?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many of my clients still use VBA extensively and are always asking that question as they have read many of the on-line pronouncements of 'The Death of VBA'.
</span></p>
<p><span>It's a bit embarrassing to respond with 'I don't know'.</span></p>

<p>I don't think anyone outside Microsoft really knows. But I'd say that Microsoft cannot afford to drop VBA since there are so many businesses and organizations that rely on VBA code in their documents, workbooks, databases etc.</p>
<p>So even if the emphasis would shift to other ways of writing code for MS Office, such as JavaScript, they will probably keep on supporting VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For comparison: Microsoft Word switched from WordBasic to VBA when Word 97 was released in 1996, over 21 years ago. Yet, WordBasic still works in Word 2016, and it is even being kept up-to-date to support new features introduced long after its official demise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, Excel 4.0 macros still work in Excel 2016, although Excel 4.0 was released more than 25 years ago and VBA for Excel was introduced in 1993...</p>

<p><span><span>This is what I believe and it’s good to hear that someone else has similar thoughts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I started programming professionally with WordBasic and am surprised to know that it still works!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The World is run via VBA powered Excel spread sheets and it would be an insane idea for Microsoft to pull VBA completely, but I’m still not entirely convinced they won’t do so.
 There have been some questionable decisions recently and the refusal to issue a formal statement regarding VBA is concerning.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My guess would be that they are hedging their bets, but I think a fairly aggressive Windows 10 policy after the disasters of Vista and 8 is an indication of their thinking.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>BTW, (most) Excel 4.0 macros may still work, but their effects can be subtly different from the original intention ;0)</span></span></p>

<h2>            Focus on todays date.</h2>
                    <p>I have a holiday planner in Excel 2010 which uses columns A to D for names etc and these columns are frozen. Then on row 3 has the dates for the current year in each cell. I would like it to default to the current days date when opening the spreadsheet.
 So for instance today it should highlight GO:3, tomorrow it would be GP:3. I would like the column containing todays date to appear to the right of column D.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of an easy way to do this?</p>

            Hi ConceptSoftware
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h2>            Microsoft office 2013 product key - Cannot retrieve for reinstallation after reimaging windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to get my product keys for MSO 2013. The product was originally installed by the vendor while configuring Windows 8 for the 1st time in on August 5th 2013. At that time a user name was created without using a MS account.</p>
<p>After retrieving the last five digit code , I'm stuck at the point where I'm supposed to recover the rest. But, as the software was not&nbsp;installed using my MS account, cannot proceed.
</p>

            <p>Hi Sagnik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for taking the time to reply my post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion is valid but not helpful as the vendor is in Kuala Lumpur and I'm in Labuan. The only thing I have to trace the vendor is an invoice with a phone nr that is no longer valid. Searching the web did not bring any result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to recover the complete product key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all the problem that is forcing me to reimage my laptop was the proposed upgrade to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; Regards</p>
<p>

</p><p>For office 2013 MS "<em>improved</em>" the way it stores product keys on our local machine. We can only extract the last 5 digits. MS expects you to keep track of your own keys. They are more than happy to sell you a new copy of Office...

<h2>            Mysterious &#34;White&#34; box pop up on Powerpoint Mac 2016, have to Force Quit app</h2>
                    <p>Hi - Have anybody seen this "white" box all of a sudden pop up while editing Powerpoint slides since upgrading to 15.20? (See attached screenshot)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f04d037d-50e5-4b17-b390-24cef1b2d663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f04d037d-50e5-4b17-b390-24cef1b2d663" /></a></p>
<p>It seems to mostly occur at Slide Sort View, and it also came with some slides "whiten out" losing the content. (Also see my screenshot annotation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get out of it is to Force Quit the app as it has no close or OK button at all. It has constantly pop up at least 5-6 times since I upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Cheers</p>
<p />

            I've been seeing similar reports of display issues. The next time this occurs, please leave the screen as is and click on the small smiley-face icon in the upper-right corner of the program window. Choose<strong> Tell Us What Can Be Better</strong>, describe
 the problem and include a screen shot. It also might be helpful to include the model information from
<strong>About This Mac</strong> on your Apple menu, since these display problems are often specific to certain machines and not others.

            <p>That's the first thing I tried is to give feedback / take screenshot with smiley icon. Unfortunately there is no way to use the smiley face and leave feedback when the program like Powerpoint is "non-responsive".
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Security Code for Nokia 6500 Classic</h2>
                    Hi, I try to use the code - 12345 - as the security code as listed in my manual, but it just comes up with "code error".<br />
<br />
can anyone help?

            If the code isnt 12345 then it has been changed from its default at some stage.<br />
<br />
You will need to visit a Nokia Care Point to get this removed as it is a security feature.<br />
You can find the nearest NCP to you at the <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4228006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Store Locator</a><br />
<br />
They will charge you for the job and you will need a proof of purchase too.

            A small number of new models, and I know that the 6500 is one, come with no preset security code - you have to enter one the first time you use any feature that requires it.<br />
<br />
If you go to the Settings&gt;Security&gt;Access Codes menu and see the option "Create security code", then you still have none; but if you see "Change security code" instead, then somebody has already done the business and unfortunately, it is still a issue that
 your care point has to solve for you.

            Thank you, both. Annoyingly, the phone is new - and came from Kuwait (has arabic characters on the keys!) (guess what I do for a living!) I spoke to a Nokia service centre who told me there is often a difficulty with phones from abroad - and it is not
 covered by warranty either. I think I will have to take the phone to them to completely remove the software and re-install. Very annoying.

            Yes that is correct, if you have purchased from the United Arab Emirates, and are now using the phone in europe for example, then the phone is not covered by any warranty as there are different procedures and rules for different parts of the world.<br />
<br />
That does mean you will need to take it back to kuwait.<br />
<br />
Although saying that, this isnt a warranty fault anyway, so you should be able to take it anywhere in the world.<br />
What you need is a simple process of re-formatting the phone.<br />
<br />
Nice and easy for the NCP and wont cost you too much either.

            Hi  magoscuro,
<br />
<br />Try resetting the OneDrive sync app:
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R
<br />Copy and paste this text into the Run window and press Enter:
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />That will reset OneDrive
<br />After a couple of minutes, the OneDrive cloud icon should show in the system tray.
<br />
<br />If it doesn’t start, click on Windows Start, then find OneDrive and start it       
        </p>

    <title>Received Notice My Add-free Outlook Subscription is Cancelled tomorrow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teacher g  say:</h3>
<h2>            Received Notice My Add-free Outlook Subscription is Cancelled tomorrow Friday--I need help to stop cancellation</h2>
                    1. My Outlook use has been filled with pop-up adds for several months although they should not be there--every time I try to go for help, adds fill the window and tell me things like (1) "your browser is old--download..." or (2) "Download a new video player"
 or(2) "Java is not detected--download it--it is necessary" when every time I turn on my computer I have the "Upgrade Jave" and say yes to it or (3) right now "Your PC Performance is Poor--Click Here to speed it up" or whatever else gets in the way.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. I tried to go and update my subscription payment but could not reach the site because adds kept overtaking my computer and I couldn't get there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. My credit card would expire Dec. 31, 2013 and I was afraid that my giving that expiration date would not do me any good so but did not receive a new credit card with an new expiration date so called credit card company and they said they had mailed
 it to me in October and that they would have to give me a new account number and that I would receive it in 2 to 3 business days but I haven't received it yet and can't renew anything with no account number and no expiration date and I tried to write you but
 received no answer so I called the credit card company and tried to get the new account number over the phone but of course was told absolutely not.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4. I have another credit card that I would like to add and prevent this subscription cancellation which is precious to me but can't get through to you--I have to receive a code and cannot text and wrote my last 4 telephone digits and was told to give code
 but received no code and have tried this over and over--if you do not have my correct phone number, then why not, and what can I possibly do since I have only the correct phone number?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>5. Please help me--I have been trying to fix this since my first notice that I should update my credit card but have no way to do it--I finally have permission to use my husband's credit card that he gave me a copy of to use in an emergency with my name
 on it and if this is not an emergency, then I do not know what is--I need my Outlook Hotmail and it is 11:38 p.m. on Thursday, January 9, and I was told this evening that my subscription will expire Friday, January 10--in about 20 minutes and I have been trying
 for hours, days, and 3 months to get my credit card fixed and why is my computer screen overrun with ads constantly in the way of what I am trying to do"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>6. Please stop the cancellation and make a way for me to add my now available other credit card.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sincerely yours, &nbsp;Carolee Green</div>

<h2>            Excel - Conditional Coding - Problem with Icon colors working properly</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a funny issue with my conditional coding on one of my projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two columns, one is for input (with set validation of Red, Green or Yellow as choices) - see below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I type Green, "state" is updated with a green circle, yellow with the triangle, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following formula in state column:&nbsp; <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">=VLOOKUP(K5,{"red",1;"yellow",2;"green",3},2,0)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look illustration #1 below, all looks good, but if I change the 3rd item "Red" to "green" then the yellow icons become red...see illustration #2 below.&nbsp; Any idea why?&nbsp; Does it have to do with how i set up the conditional coding?&nbsp; Maybe i have the
 wrong set up in my conditional coding?&nbsp; See illustration #3 showing that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>That specific conditional formatting relies on population statistics - the 1, 2, and 3 values in the column L.&nbsp; But if you don't have a Red in K, then the lowest value becomes 2, which means all the 2 values are in the lowest third of values.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Thanks for contacting us. My name is Victor.
<br />
<br />You said your issue is related to: "why does outlook ask for my password every time i log in?" 
<br />
<br />Use the Outlook keeps asking for my password diagnostic to troubleshoot issues in which Outlook continually prompts for a password.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/SaRA-OutlookPwdPrompt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/SaRA-OutlookPwdPrompt</a>
<br />
<br />This diagnostic does automated checks and returns possible solutions for you to use to try to fix any detected issues.
<br />
<br />If you are connecting to an Exchange On-Premises mailbox, see the following articles for additional troubleshooting:
<br />
<br />Outlook prompts for password when Modern Authentication is enabled:

<br />
<br />Outlook continues to prompt for credentials after your domain password changes:

<br />Why does Outlook keep prompting for password:

<br />
<br />If you have an older version of Outlook, change the Logon network security setting to Anonymous Authentication to fix this issue. To do this, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Exit Outlook.
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel, and then do one of the following:
<br />  
<br />In Windows 10, Windows 8.1, or Windows 7, click Start, type control panel in the search box, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />In Windows 8, swipe in from the right side to open the charms, tap or click Search, and then type control panel in the search box. Or, type control panel at the Start screen, and then tap or click Control Panel in the search results.
<br />
<br />In Control Panel, locate and double-click Mail.
<br />
<br />Click Show Profiles, select your Outlook profile, and then click Properties.
<br />
<br />Click E-mail Accounts.
<br />
<br />Select your email account, and then click Change.
<br />
<br />In the Change Account dialog box, click More Settings.
<br />
<br />In the Microsoft Exchange dialog box, select the Security tab.
<br />
<br />On the Login network security list, select Anonymous Authentication, and then click OK.
<br />
<br />Click Next, click Finish, and then click Close on the Account Settings dialog box.
<br />
<br />Click Close on the Mail Setup dialog box, and then click OK to close the Mail control panel.
<br />
<br />For the rest of the options check the following reference:

            Hello, 
<br />I am Rob Independent Advisor, I am here to help you to solve your issue.
<br />Thank you for contacting the community It is a pleasure for us to help you out.
<br />-
<br />-Are you using Outlook Client?
<br />-Have OS and Outlook Up to date
<br />
<br />- Navigate to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Credential Manager:
<br />-Alternatively navigate to Start &gt; Run and type in "control keymgr.dll" without the quotes and hit Enter. Select Windows credentials.
<br />-Look for Outlook entry: Eg:”MicrosoftOffice16_DataSSPI:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***”:To get rid of the credential, click the credential to expand it, and then click Remove.
<br />We go on to delete your account credential and then we are done!
<br />The next time you open Outlook, you should not be prompted to reenter your email credentials and be able to connect to the server with no issue.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists:
<br />-Try to create a new Outlook profile

Then it asked me to sign in using an eMail I have had for 2 years -&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is dead. My eMail is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** .
 Anyway it allows me to log in. Right now I will see how it works tonight and tomorrow. I'll get back to you if there is still aproblem.</p>

            does network support the 3g and whats the coverage like in area,does the 3g symbol come up on the phone,look at network settings and see if its set to dual mode or gsm.

            my network is the 1st one to support 3G in India(launched yesterday only).But the problem is that,i still can't access it.Signal level when it catches 3G are abt 5-6 bars on an average.But it is overshadowed by the 2G network,it jumps to 2G in few secs.And
 there is no option to set the network mode to 'umts only'!Nokia this one is really annoying!!

            does the 'dual mode' scans preferentially the 2G network or the 3G network?

            I understand what you are talking about, it is possible the network is&nbsp;instructing your phone to switch to 2G&nbsp;mode because you describe a strong 3G signal yet the phone switched to 2G anyway and the network being in the very early stages of operation this
 may be the case. The phone found 3G then the network said go&nbsp;to 2G.&nbsp;Network instruction will prioritize that is my guess. I don't know anyway to force UMTS on that model

<p>I googled out this matter and found that most of the N70 users are facing this problem.I'll waiting and see if further development in the network solves my problem.<strong>But NOKIA if you are listening then pls solve this problem through firmware upgrade

            As far as I know, there is no way to use only UTMS on the N70 because it was the first phone to come out on the N series range. Usually your network will determine the speed, so if they are not as yet ready to go 3G, they will make the phone select 2G.
 Try calling your network provider and see what happens, erhaps they can shed some light on your problem.

            No progress as of yet in my case.I've done calling my operator too but they don't knw anything as always...(don't knw why they hire them when they arn't of any use).googling in detail shows that some of 6680 users have been successful in doing this by
 use of some field test software.(it also has the same problem,dual and gsm only modes).But the compatibility of the sofware doesn't extend till N70.I think they have discontinued with the further development of the sofware.What do i do nw??:(

I put xxx password where this person actually knew one of my old passwords!&nbsp; How did they get that???&nbsp; I am not sending money but the other weird thing
 is when I went to copy over this it had a bunch of names in light blue between every line below but that didn't copy.&nbsp; I will change my MSN password (the one they have is not my current password) and Facebook and whatever else I can think of that they could
 have got a old password from.&nbsp;&nbsp; How could they get that old password?&nbsp; I did think I signed up for something and may have used that old password the other day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can they be figuring out my keystrokes?&nbsp;help!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do know&nbsp;xxxx password is&nbsp;one of your password. Lets get right to purpose. Neither anyone has compensated me to investigate about you. You don't know me and you are most likely thinking why you are getting this e mail?
<br />
<br />
Let me tell you, I setup a software on the adult streaming (porn) site and do you know what, you visited this website to experience fun (you know what I mean). When you were viewing videos, your browser began functioning as a Remote control Desktop that has
 a keylogger which gave me access to your display screen as well as webcam. Immediately after that, my software collected all of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as emailaccount. And then I made a double video. 1st part displays the video you
 were watching (you have a good taste lol), and next part displays the recording of your cam, and it is u.
<br />
<br />
You have two different choices. Shall we analyze each of these choices in particulars:
<br />
<br />
1st alternative is to dismiss this message. In this instance, I am going to send your very own video clip to all of your contacts and imagine about the humiliation you will see. And consequently in case you are in a loving relationship, how it will certainly
 affect? <br />
<br />
2nd option is to give me $$3000. I will think of it as a donation. In such a case, I most certainly will immediately erase your video. You will continue on your way of life like this never happened and you will not hear back again from me.
<br />
<br />
You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search for "how to buy bitcoin" in Google).
<br />
<br />
BTC Address to send to: 1NUrHh5sC4c8eHxWDXrJex6jef6wq6kmDN <br />
<br />
[CASE sensitive, copy and paste it] <br />
<br />
If you are thinking about going to the law enforcement officials, okay, this e-mail can not be traced back to me. I have dealt with my moves. I am just not looking to demand very much, I wish to be compensated. You have one day in order to pay. I have a specific
 pixel within this email message, and at this moment I know that you have read this email message. If I do not receive the BitCoins, I will definately send your video to all of your contacts including members of your family, coworkers, etc. Nonetheless, if
 I do get paid, I'll erase the recording right away. If you want evidence, reply Yes and I will certainly send your video recording to your 6 contacts. It is a non:negotiable offer, thus please do not waste my personal time and yours by replying to this email.</p>

            In terms of the message itself - it definitely is fake given the number of reports on the same kind of message. Primary difference is the amount asked for but like all the other reports I've seen about this, it included an outdated password for which I have no idea how it was retrieved. In any case, I summarily dismissed it (after doing a completely doing an anti-virus rootkit scan on my system which came up empty).

            From a database hacked a long time ago - its hard to say for sure when they got it, especially if you used the password on other sites with the same email address. (I did and haven't used the password in quite a few years.)

<p><strong>I received a very similar email, received from&nbsp;</strong>Vaughn Leufkens &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I will directly come to the point. I know that ZZZZZZZZ is your password. More importantly, I know about your secret and I've proof of your secret. You don't know me and nobody employed me to look into you.
<br />
<br />
It is just your bad luck that I came across your misadventures. Actually, I installed a malware on the adult vids (porn) and you visited this website to experience fun (you know what I mean). When you were busy watching videos, your browser initiated functioning
 as a Rdp (Remote desktop) with a keylogger which gave me accessibility to your screen and also web camera. After that, my software obtained all your contacts from your facebook, as well as mailbox.
<br />
<br />
Next, I put in much more time than I probably should have investigating into your life and created a two screen video. First part displays the video you were watching and 2nd part shows the video of your webcam (its you doing nasty things).
<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm ready to forget details about you and allow you to move on with your daily life. And I will present you two options that may make it happen. The above option is with the idea to ignore this letter, or perhaps pay me $2200. Let’s explore these two
 options in more details. <br />
<br />
Option 1 is to ignore this e-mail. Let's see what is going to happen if you pick this option. I will definately send out your video to your contacts including close relatives, co-workers, and so forth. It does not help you avoid the humiliation your self will
 ought to face when friends and family find out your sordid videos from me. <br />
<br />
Option 2 is to make the payment of $2200. We will name this my “confidentiality fee”. Here is what will happen if you choose this option. Your secret remains your secret. I will erase the video immediately. You keep your routine life as if none of this ever
 happened. <br />
<br />
At this point you may be thinking, “Let me call cops”. Let me tell you, I've taken steps to make sure that this message can't be tracked time for me and yes it won't stop the evidence from destroying your lifetime. I am not planning to break your bank. I just
 want to get paid for time I put into investigating you. Let's hope you decide to make pretty much everything go away and pay me the confidentiality fee. You will make the payment by Bitcoins (if you do not know this, type "how to buy bitcoins" in search engine)
<br />
<br />
Amount to be sent: $2200 <br />
Send To This Bitcoin Address: 1N1c9TaYcQb2Xnn5iAfGdRiZoMD925F3JQ <br />
(It's cASe sensitive, so you should copy and paste it) <br />
<br />
Share with nobody what you should be transferring the bitcoin for or they possibly will not give it to you. The process to obtain bitcoins usually takes a short time so do not procrastinate.<br />
I've a specific pixel within this e-mail, and at this moment I know that you have read through this message. You have 1 day to make the payment. If I don't receive the Bitcoin, I definitely will send your video to all your contacts including family members,
 colleagues, and many others. You better come up with an excuse for friends and family before they find out. Nevertheless, if I do get paid, I'll erase the video immediately. It is a non negotiable one time offer, so don't waste my time &amp; yours. Time is running
 out. </span></span></p>

            Try<br />
View&gt; cascade<br />
Adjust the window size and you should be able to minimise individual windows.<br />
<br />
You can also use switch windows to see the window you need and arrange All to show side by side.<br />

<p>Are you using AVG security software by any chance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just helped a customer with the same problem and came accross this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.avg.com/answers?id=906b0000000DrZ0AAK (see bottom)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing Excel from the 'Ransomware Protection' screen and then clicking the 'Allow' prompt when next opening a file in Excel solved the problem in my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
