<h2>            print layout is different from what prints</h2>
                    I am viewing a Word 2007 document with images in print layout to position the images.&nbsp; However when I generate a PDF or even just print the images are in different places and are not as they appear on Print Layout.&nbsp; Pages print as they appear in full screen
 reading but then I can not edit image position.&nbsp; Can anyone help?

            <p>If you download the free PrimoPDF converter and use it to "print" the document to a pdf file, is the layout correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, I suspect that the problem is caused by the driver for the printer that you are using.&nbsp; Check the printer manufacturer's website for an updated driver for the printer.</p>

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I must not have been clear.&nbsp; The issue is that the "Print Layout" is not what prints, it is the "Reading Layout" is what prints.&nbsp; This is the case for PDF and actually printing.&nbsp; I have found that I can edit in Reading Layout so
 I have a work around. However I would have thought that Print Layout is what would print.

            Print view was only ever intended as an approximation of the layout as an aid to document assembly. The WYSIWYG view is Print Preview and this is determined by the active printer driver. Usually the differences between the two views are not vast, which
 is why this document is a particular curiosity.<br />

            Yes. All of the settings in Cortana are right. Cortana will respond correctly to anything that doesn't involve the net. Like asking how much free disk space do I have. It will answer correctly. But any question involving the internet gets a number of different
 error answers. If I ask what's the temperature, I'll get a response that there's not enough bandwidth or the internet is not working.

            <p>What Anti-Virus and Firewall are you using?</p>
<p>Windows already build with Windows Firewall and you could just use that and it is free.</p>
<p>For Anti-Virus software, you could use Microsoft Security Essentials which is free:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials</a></p>
<p>However, you must uninstall all other Anti-Virus software before install it.</p>
<p>You could see Action Center or Windows Security Center in control panel and see what firewall and Anti-Virus are you using and then go to Add/Remove Programs or Programs and Features and then search for it and uninstall it.</p>

 and get&nbsp; informations about places and buildings just by scanning through camera.I think that&nbsp; it's a great idea, and please let me know if you liked it too.

    <title>Word Documents and Mac Finder preview - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word Documents and Mac Finder preview</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is... Some word documents are shown in Mac Finder with thumbnails and others don't, only with doc predefined icon.... also, in those last I can't even see the preview...</p>
<p>I've been investigating, and some of them are based on Normal template... and others to a personal created template... the thing is... those are the most important to be shown in finder because they have a cover that helps identifying the contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your suggestions.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsoft OneDrive For Business 2013 Sync &#38; Credential Issue</h2>
                    
<p>hello,</p>

<p>i just recently got set up on my company's vpn and am trying to get onedrive set up properly. i have researched my issue on here and tried the various troubleshooting procedures that were provided to no avail.</p>
<p>here are my symptoms:</p>
<p>1) i am able to sync folders to the cloud just fine. when viewing the onedrive directory on my computer, i can see that any folder i create syncs properly, as indicated by the green check mark in the screenshot below:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=80c0a2c4-f042-4d94-9884-2961bf7956ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d40d3bc4c-a909-4e82-9365-7d580f7e43a4" /></a></p>
<p>however, any file that i try to drop in the cloud gets rejected, as indicated by the red x in the picture above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) when i read the syncing error, the message i get is that i need to enter my credentials. one difference i am noticing on my screen vs others i've seen on here is that i do not have a button to "enter credentials", as seen below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c6338794-b268-4a53-9cd4-de0658e6df5c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5fe5247a-3a0a-4ce4-9fad-4021fb8a0209" /></a></p>

<p>3) i have tried removing my credentials from the credential manager in the control panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) i have tried removing and connecting my 365 services to microsoft outlook,</p>
<p>5) i have stopped the syncing action on onedrive and restarted it in different combinations of #3 and #4.&nbsp;</p>

<p>please advise.</p>

                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I appear to be logged out from my skype desktop account (I didn't do so myself and no one has access to that computer) and can't log back in.
</p>
<p>I did a password reset, but even after it persists that '<span>You've tried to sign in too many times with an incorrect email address or password.' Tried entering the&nbsp; characters, but the same message keeps on appearing.
</span></p>
<p><span>I was able to log in to Skype from my phone, but my profile is gone, my contacts list is empty and my friends are telling me that they can write me and see me in their friends list appearing online, but I do
 not receive any messages, nor any notifications when they are writing something to my skype.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I did tried logging in with through my microsoft account on the skype for web, but I get the same error.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>I would appreciate your help in retrieving my account back.
</span></p>

<p>This is to do with the way that Word connects to the data source.</p>
<p>In Word 2000, by default Word connected using DDE, which communicated with Access and could "see" all the queries that Access could see.</p>
<p>In Word 2002 (XP) and later, by default Word connects using OLE DB, which works directly with the underlying database engine, Je (or ACE, in Access 2007 or later). There are a number of types of query that OLE DB does not "see", or does not present to you,
 including</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. parameter queries</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. queries that use certain kinds of finiancial functions</p>
<p>On balance it is better to use OLE DB where you can because DDE is "deprecated", but in Word 2007, you can still try DDE by going to Word Office button-&gt;Word options-&gt;Advanced-General and checking "Confirm file format conversion on open". Then go through
 the process of connecting to your data source again. After the step where you select your database, you should see an additional dialog box. If your database has a .mdb extension, select the option "MS Access databases via DDE". If your database has a .accdb
 extension, you will need to check "Show all" to reveal that option.</p>
<p>NB, OLE DB may "see" the query but return no results when the query has "wildcards", e.g. as in LIKE 'A*', because Access usually expects the wildcards * and ? whereas OLE DB expecs to use % and _. In that case, if possible, the best approach is usually
 to duplicate the query in Access but using the OLE DB wildcards.</p>

<p><span>If you have a Microsoft Office Access database, or another type of data file, click<span>Use Existing List</span>, and then locate the file in the
<span>Select Data Source</span> dialog box. </span></p>
<p><span>For Excel, you can select data from any worksheet or named range within a workbook. For Access, you can select data from any table or query<span> (query: A means of finding all the records

 file in the <span>Select Data Source</span> dialog box. If the file is not listed, select the appropriate file type or select<span>All Files</span> in the
<span>Files of type</span> list. In a mail merge, you can use the following types of data files:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Files from single-tier, file-based database programs for which you have installed an OLE DB<span> (OLE DB: A component database architecture that implements efficient network and internet
 access to many types of data sources, including relational data, mail files, flat files, and spreadsheets.)</span> provider or ODBC<span> (Open Database Connectivity (ODBC): A standard method of sharing data between databases and programs. ODBC drivers
 use the standard Structured Query Language (SQL) to gain access to external data.)</span> driver (a number of which are included with Microsoft Office).</span></li><li><span>An HTML file that has a single table. The first row of the table must contain column names and the other rows must contain data.</span></li><li><span>Electronic address books:</span></li></ul>

<p><span>or Access, you can select data from any table or query<span>&nbsp;(query:
 A means of finding all the records stored in a data source that fit a set of criteria you name. Queries can contain operators, quotation marks, wildcard characters, and parentheses to help focus your search.)</span>&nbsp;that is defined in the database.</span></p>
<p><span>&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>No, you can't. Several types of query do not appear when the connection type is OLE DB or ODBC, as I have indicated. There are (probably) several reasons:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. with parameter queries, Word used to rely on Access to prompt for the parameter values, which it could do because it was communicating with Access. From Word XP onwards, Word uses OLE DB by default and since neither Word
 nor OLE DB has a built-in mechanism for prompting for parameter values, you can't use this connection method with a parameter query, at least not without using VBA. It's the same with ODBC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;b. Access queries can use Jet VBA functions, but some of these (such as the replace() function ) are missing from an internal table (that's the best description I can give because I don't know exactly what is going on internally)
 and queries using those functions cannot be used by Word</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;c. Word probably won't "see" Union queries (although it may, if you wrap the Union query up in a further query and use that). This may be because there can actually be two types of "query" in a Jet database - "queries" and
 "procedures", Word/OLE DB can see some but not others.</span></p>
<p><span>As for the other data source types,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;d. AFAIK, Word never actually uses MAPI to access any type of data source. for example, when it accesses Outlook Contacts, it actually does so by using the Jet/ACE Outlook IISAM to look at the Outlook Address Book. There
 are a couple of legacy address book formats that Word can read (cf. the Schedule+ list you mention) but I doubt if you would be able to read any other address book unless it know how to expose itself to the Outlook Address Book</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;e. You should be able to use any OLE DB/ODBC data source that implements the necessary interfaces, not merely "file-based" ones. i.e. you can use SQL Server (which I wouldn't normally describe as "File-Based", Oracle,and
 so on. However, not all OLE DB source will do - for example, I don't think you can get anything based on the "OLE Db simple Provider" to work, probably because it doesn't impleent a Command interface.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;f. with some limitations, you can use any "tabular" data source for which Word has an internal or old-style external &nbsp;converter. I'm not so sure about files that are read by the new COM-based converter in Word 2007 SP2.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just was researching the problem of not having queries listed in my data source and came upon your reply.&nbsp; I tried following your instructions but after selecting "MS Access databases via DDE", I rcvd two errors - the first saying Word could not locate
 or start C:/Prog......Office12/MSACESS, then the second being Word could not re-establish a DDE connection to Access to complete the task.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I made in error following your instructions, but tried it a couple of times and don't see any options
 to have strayed from your well written instructions.&nbsp; Thanks for that by-the-way!&nbsp; Your post on this problem is old, so I was wondering if you know any updated information on this that may help me.&nbsp; I have spent approximately 90 hours since this past Friday
 re-writing our old Databases (from Q&amp;A&nbsp;bought in 1994!)and the mail merge from parameter queries is the most important part of it for our company.&nbsp; As you suggested, I am going to try to duplicate the query in Access using the OLE DB wildcards (have to find
 out what they are first), but thought I'd ask you also if you thought anything has changed since your post to help address this issue.&nbsp; I'm definitely just a beginner and can only handle the basics with&nbsp;database work but next, I will learn what the OLD DB
 wildcards are!</p>

<h2>            I want to sync Outlook 2010 contacts to my Windows Phone - pissed that it isn&#39;t easy&#33;</h2>
                    So I needed to upgrade my phone and everyone told me that if my main priority was to sync with Outlook (Contacts &amp; Calendar most importantly) that I should get the HTC HD7 Windows Phone.<br />
<br />
Now my son has an iPod. I'm not an Apple person, so I was willing to install iTunes just for that one piece of equipment. I was impressed with iTunes, however, because it made loading&nbsp; stuff onto his player really simple -- AND It asked me if I wanted my Outlook
 contacts and Calendar to sync with his player every time it was plugged in. I tried it -- one click and it was all there. Sweet! Easy!<br />
<br />
So I figured that -- OF COURSE -- if I got a MICROSOFT WINDOWS PHONE, it would be even easier to sync it with my MICROSOFT OUTLOOK SOFTWARE.<br />
<br />
As you know, it doesn't. Zune doesn't even touch that.<br />
<br />
I find this RI-FRICKIN'-DICULOUS! (That is a great phrase to say out loud, by the way).<br />
<br />
I mean I guess that I can join this whole "cloud" bandwagon -- but the idea of having to upload all of my VERY PERSONAL INFO (my calendar? Where I will actually BE at any given moment??) To some server over which I have NO control -- that can be hacked or just
 plain read by the people running it -- is beyond stupid. Why would anyone trust this?? I want the info on my Computer and on my phone. And no place else.<br />
<br />
There has to be a way. Either that, or my loyalty to PCs and Microsoft is going to change REALLY quickly.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />

<h2>            Since upgrade video playback is problematic</h2>
                    Let me say first that before the upgrade my laptop played video perfectly. I have a little Acer with AMD C60 1.33Ghz, 4GB RAM, and a Radeon HD 6290 GPU. Since upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I cannot play video properly. I used to use VLC but was
 having other issues so i switched to WMP and it worked wonderfully. Now the only way to play MP4 or MKV files i have to right click on said file. open with Movies and TV player. (now a 1/3 of the time it will say that the format is not compatible. So i close
 out and try again.) When it does play its usually sound only to a black screen. So i immediately right click the file and open with WMP. If it doesn't say that its and unsupported format, then i close out the Movies and TV player. I can watch. IF it says its
 unsupported format the i start the process all over again. Obviously they are not unsupported formats and i have the correct codec and drives or it would never work. So i would just love to be able to make a video playlist and w

<h2>            Compatibility issues with Excel 2013 coverted from 2003-2007 files</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am converting excels files from 2003 to 2013, however when I finish converting the files to 2013 version and changing all the links to 2013 version files and save the files verifying that no compatibility issues. When I open the same file again it come
 up stating that where are compatibility issue even when all files linked are on version 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed when I open all the linked files is comes up that there are no compatibility issues. Is there a way that the compatibility setting can be set so that I don't have to open all the files to eliminate the compatibility situation when the file
 is being opened without going through the process of opening all the linked files any time the file is opened?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the compatibility checker in the info section, saving the files as .xlsx and not .xls. However before I save using "Save As" I make sure that there are no compatibility issues outstanding and ALL the linked files are converted to the 2013 version
 (.xlsx).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the files have the pic above they don't have the arrow pointing upwards. I have tried renaming before I save but it still prompts that I have compatibility issues when I close and reopen the file but haven't opened the linked files which are saved
 as 2013 Excel versions. when I open the linked files then on checking it says no compatibility issues.</p>

            <p>That's the issue, I'm pretty sure.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Using File| Save As and choosing the .xlsx file type DOES NOT CONVERT THE FILE.&nbsp; You have to click the Convert button to well and truly convert .xls files to the current format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, Excel views your files as still being in the older format, just with the new file extension.</p>

            <p>Didn't you say the File tab showed the Convert picture?&nbsp; That's the "command" for converting it to the new format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that Excel 2013 is much better&nbsp;about converting an xls file to an xlsx file when you do a Save As, compared to how Excel 2007 or 2010 behaved.&nbsp; 2013 actually does convert the file where 2007 and 2010 merely renamed it.&nbsp; In 2013, once you do a Save
 As the convert button seems to disappear.&nbsp; I'd be concerned, though, about how thorough a conversion the Save As did versus using the Convert option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the original xls files, try copying them in to a temporary folder, then opening and Converting each one.&nbsp; When done this way you'll see that Excel actually *replaces* the original xls file with the converted file [that's why you're going to want
 to&nbsp;use copies or the original].&nbsp; See if that solves your problem</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have inserted the process and tabs that I have been using. I have reconverted a new file from 2007 to 2013 and updated the links to 2013 files (from .xls to .xlsx) as can be seen on the msg below. However the same&nbsp;problem still seems to occur&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this explains my situation a bit clearly.</p>
<p>

<p>So you can see that files are .xlsx, however when I press find on the compatibility checker it directs me to a 2013 converted file and not 2007 (.xls)</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Word&#58; crashes when I delete a Comment</h2>
                    <p>After months of Word started verrrrry slowly and also erratically crashing, Microsoft Support has not found an issue with my setup (Win 10 and Office 365).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now I have zeroed in on a specific issue that happens several times an hour:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Deleting a Comment very frequently causes Word to stop working. </strong>
</li><li><strong>Right-clicking to delete a Comment is especially prone to this error.</strong></li></ul>
<p>Most often, a saved recovery copy of my file is offered and it is current. However, this is having an impact on my efficiency, work ... and patience!<br />
<br />
Other notes:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>I am using Office 365, so Word should be the latest and greatest. Also, Windows 10.</li><li>I am working on documents created by others, so they may originate in earlier or Mac versions of Word -- but I don't know for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>I often am running other programs at the same time -- Excel, Outlook, internet browser...</li></ul>
<p>Of course, none of these activities should cause any Microsoft app to malfunction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions? Is this a known Microsoft issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>Having done a test on the OneDrive app of Android phone with the federated organization’s email address, everything works fine. To troubleshoot this issue first, could you let us know if you have referred to Chee Loon’s suggestion to check the outcome?</p>
<p>If this issue persists, to further investigate the issue you have met, I’d like to confirm the following points:<br />
1. Do any other colleagues encounter the same issue on the Android phones?<br />
2. Please confirm whether users are able to log-in with their personal OneDrive account such as outlook.com or Live.com and add the OneDrive for Business account after logging in to their personal OneDrive account.<br />
3. Have you tried another Android phone to login to OneDrive app with your account? This will helps us clarify if this issue is related to account itself.<br />
4. If it’s convenient, could you try a newly created account(Non-federated organization’s email address) such as contoso.onmicrosoft.com and let us know the result?<br />
5. Also please send us the screenshots of the error message. To upload screenshots, you can click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click the icon of<strong> Insert/Edit Media.</strong><br />
6. To narrow down if this issue is caused by the ADFS environment, could you provide us with the following information?<br />
&nbsp; Your login account.<br />
&nbsp; Your personal OneDrive for Business site URL.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the information above. Below are the steps to access it:
<br />
•&nbsp; Go to the <strong>Your details</strong> section on the right side of the community site.<br />
•&nbsp; Click <strong>Private messages.</strong><br />
•&nbsp; Click the subject title of the response to read the message.<br />
•&nbsp; You can reply by using the form on this display.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Kerwin</p>

                    I am currently using Business Contact Manager 2010 and am desperate to leave it. &nbsp;The problem comes when I need to get the notes, tasks, and history exported as well. &nbsp;You can export BCM data to a .csv format which does NOT include the notes, tasks, and
 history and you can also export to a .bcm file which does have this data, but seems unusable by any other software on the planet. &nbsp;I've researched this problem for over a year and have found no solutions, just others having the same issue. &nbsp;

    <title>Modern Document Sets - not so modern - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drogon rockville  say:</h3>
<h2>            Modern Document Sets - not so modern</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I've been anxiously awaiting the debut of modern document sets, and though Microsoft says they're out, I am not able to experience them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create a document set on a modern site, in a modern library, everything is modern until I click into the document set to see the files, and I'm stuck back in the classic experience, where it's not easy to update metadata or apply retention labels.
 And yes, my library settings dictate a modern experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are these just not pushed out to all users yet? Or is this just the way it is - you can stick a document set into a modern library, only there is nothing modern about the experience?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
                </div>

<p>Hi Drogon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test on a modern SharePoint Online site, the Document Set is in the modern experience after I click to open it. Here are my steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activate the Document Sets feature </p>
<p>1. Site Settings &gt; Site Collection Features,&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Go back to Site Settings &gt; Site content types &gt; Create;</p>
<p>3. Enter a new name &gt; select Document Set Content Types &gt; Document Type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enable Document Sets for the document library:</p>
<p>1. Go to the document library &gt; Settings &gt; Library settings &gt; Advanced Settings;</p>
<p>2. Click Yes in the Content Type section;</p>
<p>3. Go back to Library Settings, now a new Content Types section appeared.</p>
<p>4. Click Add from existing site content types &gt; Select Document Set &gt; Add &gt; OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add a Document Set in the Document Library</p>
<p>Go to the Document Library &gt; +New &gt; Document Set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if this also your process, if not, please share your steps with us and let us investigate it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

<p>The interface within the document sets is definitely still classic experience. This seemed like it had changed to the modern experience a few weeks ago but now seems like its rolled back to the old classic view. Please advise</p>

<p>Hi Michele,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your feedback. Based on my test, the interface of a document set is still the modern experience on my side after I clicked to open it. If it would go back to the classic experience on your side, I'd appreciate it if you could share the detailed
 steps of creating and opening the document set so that we may test it for you.</p>

<br />
you can re-install your current firmware thru Nokia suite by clicking on the update button, and then it will tell you what your current firmware version is, and there will be an option highlighted in blue text to Re-Install your firmware.

<h2>            Using the same drop down box in multiple documents&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I am using word 2003 SP3. Let's say I have 20 documents with each document having a drop down box with surnames. Every drop down box contains exactly the same list of surnames. The only problem is everytime I want to add or remove a surname I have to
 open each document and change the dropdown, which takes a long time.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can start again from scratch and make my life easier by having a "global drop down" which each document has an link to, so if I need to add or remove a surname I only need to change the "global drop down"?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You could do this easily enough with a macro. The following will reset the contents of a selected dropdown form field to insert the list of names in the macro<br />
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm</a></p>
<p>Sub ResetDD()<br />
Dim oDD As DropDown<br />
Set oDD = Selection.FormFields(1).DropDown<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; .Clear<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Add "Fred"<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; .Add "Eric"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Add "Will"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Add "Tom"<br />
End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>If all the dropdown fields in all the documents have the same bookmark name you could use a batch process to update them all as follows. In this example, the list of names is stored in a Word document its name and path defined at the line<br />
strNameDoc = "D:\My Documents\Test\Versions\Odd\NameList.docx"<br />
Change the name and path as required.<br />
In this example, the macro opens every document in a selected folder and changes the dropdown1 named form field to hold the list of names in your name document. Maintain the name document as the list of names to be used in the dropdown and run the macro on
 the folder containing all the documents to make the changes.</p>

<p>If you had the items that you want to appear in the dropdown stored one to a paragraph in a document, you could use the following code in a macro in your form to populate the dropdown with the items in the document.</p>
<p>Dim Source As Document <br />
Dim Target As Document <br />
Dim item as Range <br />
Set Target = ActiveDocument <br />
Set Source = Documents.Open("C:\Users\Doug\Documents\ListEntries.doc") 'modify to reflect the name and path of the file containing the items<br />
For i = 1 To Source.Paragraphs.Count <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set item = Source.Paragraphs(i).Range <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; item.End = item.End - 1 <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Target.FormFields("DropDown1").DropDown.ListEntries.Add Item.Text<br />
Next i <br />
Source.Close wdDoNotSaveChanges</p>
<p>If you form is a template, then you could name the macro autonew and it would then load the dropdown formfield with the list items when a new document is created from the template.</p>
<p>-- Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Certificate error&#58; &#34;Content is blocked because it is not signed by a valid security certificate&#34; with IE11 and Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Certificate errors with IE11 and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting a "Content is blocked because it is not signed by a valid security certificate" message when I try and go to website that I know is safe and have no problem getting to with Firefox. I tried everything I can think of to fix this, adding to trusted
 sites, unblocked the certificate check etc etc. Has anyone figured out why this is happening??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Thanks but I got it fixed. I made a new user account on the pc and it worked there so I don't know what was wrong with it.

<h2>            INDEX&#47;MATCH formula with multiple criteria - problem with search matrix referencing to another cell</h2>
                    <p>Dear community,</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>OutputSet1!$A$15:$TE$464</td>
<td>OutputSet1!$A$15:$A:$464</td>
<td>OutputSet1!$A$2:$TE$2&amp;OutputSet1!$A$3:$TE$3</td>
<td>INDEX(R2;VERGLEICH(MnA_Export!A2-21;S2);VERGLEICH(MnA_Export!E2&amp;"MV";T2;0))</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Column 1-3 shown above provide cell ranges on a different sheet within the same file. There are in total 15 "OutputSet" sheets, in order to use the right one i have these helping columns (1-3) to provide me with the right adresses for the following index/match
 formula (Column 4).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This index/match matrix formula should use the cell references as provided in column 1-3 (R2 = column1, S2 = column2, T2 = column 3). However for this special case i only get #NV. The formating of the cells in column 1-3 is 'standard'. The content of these
 cells comes from a "vlookup". </p>
<p>
</p><p>When i hardcode the results shown in column 1-3 directly into the index/match formula it works. Why does it not work referencing to the other cells like shown above and how can i make it work?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: the index formula is only shown this way, but of course used with a = before and with the keyboard combination to work as matrix formula - VERGLEICH is MATCH [in german])</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. Feel free to request more info, i am new to this and not sure if all necessary information has been provided.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Max</p>

            I am an independent advisor and I am quite familiar with reference formulas but your example is absolutely not clear to me. Instead of posting formulas, why not just explain what values you have and where and what result. F.e. shoet 1 to .. contain tables with values in column a... and I need on sheet xy the result zz

<p>Hello Heinz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my basic problem is just that i have the "adress" of where the index/match formula combination should look for the data in another cell (e.g.: B2 has Sheet2!_A2:A6 as content) and I want the index/match formula to use the 'result' of these other cells, by
 referencing to cell B2. But this does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i use the 'result' of these other address cells and hardcode it into the match/index formula it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--&gt; Is there a way to use the 'result' of one cell as adress in a match/index formula in another cell?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OutputSetX sheets have two identifiying rows at the top: Name of the firm, Variable (7 different ones)</p>
<p>The OutputSetX sheets have one column with time in days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using these three 'inputs' i want to excerp data into another sheet, which is a list of all M&amp;A transactions, matching the firm name, variable and a single point in time. In order to complete this list of M&amp;A transactions the index/match formula should 'automatically'
 switch between the different OutputSetX sheets depending on the year of the transaction. Currently i use a vlookup to return the correct OutOutSetX sheet and area to 'plug into' the index/match formula. But this does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions based on thos information? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Max</p>

            Hi Max, first I am actually Expert for German language questions, but this not such important. I have still problems understanding the issue, maybe I am just too stupid :)
<br />- you write that in cell B2 is the linked content of Sheet2!_A2:A6, but this is not possible it could be sum(Sheet2!_A2:A6) or another similar formula, but not a reference on multiple cells into one cell
<br />- without understanding the rest of what you write, let me just say a general remark, that instead of lookup formulas I prefer offset-match combinations, often in multiple levels. 
<br />I am sorry, the forum does not allow to post excel files, I am sure I would find a solution with the spreadsheet in real. I will be back not until Friday &gt; business trip

<h2>            outlook 2016, an exchange account and an imap account, this computer only calendar and contacts</h2>
                    <p>I set up my new computer with Outlook 2016:</p>
<p>For my personal email I have an imap email account.</p>

<p>For business I have a Microsoft Exchange email account that has calendar and contacts.<br />
When I set up the Exchange account, it notified me that it was changing the file location.</p>
<p><br />
In my imap account, I have calendar and contacts that show "this computer only."</p>
<p>At my old computer, I exported the calendar and contacts to spreadsheets, and imported them into the imap account on the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few days I got a "folder could not be opened" error, and so had to reset the profile.</p>
<p>I had a made a copy of the outlook data file, but it did not include any contacts or calendar.&nbsp; I had to re-import them from the spreadsheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions:</p>
<p>Are the "this computer only" calendar and contacts being stored anywhere?&nbsp; When I imported 5 years of calendar events and 4,000 contacts, the outlook data file did not increase in size. But as they were imported, shouldn't there be a file somewhere with
 that data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I use my personal calendar and contacts in a separate Outlook data file instead of in the imap account.&nbsp; I would then have 3 accounts in my folder list, the exchange account, the imap account and the calendar/contacts data file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is working today, but I'm nervous about getting another "folder" error message, and not knowing where my most recent contacts and calendar data is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

<br />Are the "this computer only" calendar and contacts being stored anywhere?  
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />They are only in this imap data file. If anything happens to the data file, those folders are lost. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Should I use my personal calendar and contacts in a separate Outlook data file instead of in the imap account.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Honestly, I would, unless you are going to keep them in the exchange account. It's much safer with little risk that you will lose them. The alternative is to export the calendar, contacts, and tasks regularly.
