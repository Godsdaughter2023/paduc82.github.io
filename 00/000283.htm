    <title>Document Recovery - Version created last time the user saved the file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Document Recovery - Version created last time the user saved the file - what does this mean&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Many times when I open up MS Word, the Document Recovery panel appears showing me a recent file I saved with the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;document name&gt; [Original]</p>
<p>Version created last time the user saved the file</p>
<p>&lt;date&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Document Recovery panel is a lifesaver when I haven't saved my work and the computer freezes, but I am completely baffled as to why this message appears if I already saved the file. Why do I need to "recover" a document that was successfully saved? Do
 other people experience this? I usually ignore the message and have never lost any work. There's no real harm but this is annoying and I feel like I'm missing something...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Microsoft Word 2013 32-bit, part of Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus on a Windows 10 desktop.</p>

            <p>That version will appear if an auto-recover version of the document was not created (because the interval between the last user save and the crash was less than the auto-recover interval, which is set under File&gt;Options&gt;Save "Save AutoRecover information

            Thanks for the reply. That does makes sense... not to pick on MS programmers, but if that's what's going on it seems like a bit of lazy programming, in my opinion. Would be nice if it said something a bit clearer, like "MS Word crashed when the following
 document was open. No auto-recover files were saved".

<p>Well, OK, I'll be the one to pick on MS programmers. &nbsp;If the file shown in the "Document Recovery" pane is identical to the one on the hard drive, then what's the point of showing it to the user? &nbsp;This is just confusing - it seems to imply that there is
 something special I should do to make sure I don't lose any changes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, several times I've gone through the process of saving a copy of the file shown here and then trying to figure out if it's any different from the one I already have on disk - and there are no differences. &nbsp;So why would I want to "save" the version
 shown here if it's the same as the one already saved on disk? &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with the Mr. Melon, the message he suggested makes much more sense: "MS Word crashed when the following document was open. &nbsp;No auto-recover files were saved."</p>

<p>No, that doesn't help. &nbsp;Why show the version last saved by the user? &nbsp;If they want that version, they can open it from the "File" menu or from Windows Explorer. &nbsp;If you are going to show it here, at least make it clear this isn't providing any kind of "recovery".</p>

<p>Think of the Document Recovery pane as a confirmation that Word has tried to recover files after a crash. Whether the recovery works or not depends on the AutoRecover interval (as Doug wrote).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, it would of course help if the message was more clear. You can post a suggestion for Microsoft in the Uservoice forum at

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>after a reboot</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>it came really suddenly </li></ul>
<p>- I did not make any changes, installs or similar actions before. It was a simple restart after this I was unable to login with my standard (domain) account.
</p>
<p>Luckywise I have a second account with admin priviledges. </p>
<p>My data are all safe however to reinstall the programs will be a challenge. Especially as i have some which shall be deactivated before reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Yes and its well working on my company PC as well as on my Laptop</li></ul>

<p>Sorry - this might not be a good answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you can turn back to an earlier build (this was not possible for me) and to change for the slow ring for a while - this might help you</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Log in with a local account (with administrator priviledges - even if I dont know if this is important)</li><li>Connect via VPN to the domain server</li><li>Press Win+L</li><li>Log in with the domain account</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>as the local account remains in the background it's not a perfect solution - however, it works fst and easy as a workaround. Hoping for the next build to be better.</p>

    <title>My Outlook is not working on my home wifi. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tenidolaawoyemi  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Outlook is not working on my home wifi.</h2>
                    My outlook was working perfectly well until Tuesday 8th November. It has now stopped working on my home wifi. It works on all other networks i.e at work. The only way I can get it to work at home on my laptop is to hotspot my phone to my laptop. Outlook
 will work on my phone only as long as my phone is not connected to the home wifi. I can connect to google and every other website via my home wifi on my computer except outlook. I'm not technically savvy at all so would appreciate any help or fool' guide I
 can get please. Thanks.

    <title>Lost email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laylaroberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost email</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had an really important email saved in drafts (it was essentially a what's on guide for the next year, which I have been compiling for months).</p>
<p>I am pretty sure I did not delete it, but it is not there anymore. Even if I did delete it, I thought it would be in my deleted items, but it is not (other emails are). I was even editing it yesterday and made sure I saved the recent version.</p>
<p>I have done a search as I know the subject title had '2012' in it, in case I had somehow moved it to another folder, but to no avail :-(</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas what happened, and more importantly, how to get it back? Please note, I have recovered deleted&nbsp;messages and it is still not there...</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Layla.</p>

<p>You can try to recover your missing emails by referring to this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages</a>&nbsp;and it did not work.</p>

<br />
Deleted draft mails will also be recovered when you try recovering lost/deleted emails. As what previous moderator had mention you may try to check all your folders. If your having issues with your search index please post back for us to isolate the causes
 of the issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation issue can be caused by the server and corrupted download files. We're currently aware of the activation issue that is going on, not just with Windows activation but also on Microsoft Office 365. Our developers and support engineers are already
 looking into this matter to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">rollback</a></strong> to your previous Windows version as a temporary workaround while we are fixing the issue

    <title>An Open Letter To Microsoft Regarding Word &#40;Not Responding&#41;... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akmc 117  say:</h3>
<h2>            An Open Letter To Microsoft Regarding Word &#40;Not Responding&#41;... I mean, 2016.</h2>
                    <p>I know that this is a peer to per forum and that Microsoft's usual contribution, if any, is to have a sub-minimum wage offshore tech support person say "Let me see if I understand your question correctly. You are saying that Word 2016 is a slow, unstable,
 barely usable piece of garbage which will sometimes lose your work, is that correct? To start the application in Safe Mode, please do the following". However I'll frame this as an open letter to Microsoft anyway. At least in the peer to peer role it may warn
 someone off "upgrading" from something stable like Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Microsoft; I have a question regarding that new application that was launched with Office 2016; the one named “Word (Not Responding)”. (Or that’s the name on the title bar a lot of the time, anyway. Including during the 5 minutes that it took just to
 open a document (surely the most basic functionality of any program) <span>&nbsp;</span>a few minutes before me posting this.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask rhetorically, is there any prospect that something will be done to fix what is in my view (for the reasons that I shall describe) a user-hostile, unstable, data losing piece of digital garbage? Like, rebadging Word 2003 as Word 2016? I’m sure that
 Word (Not Responding) was outstandingly successful when it was beta tested on high speed local networks at Redmond and places as far and wide as the Starbucks in Seattle where there is 4 bars of 4G Wi Fi, but I’m talking about fixing it for the real world
 where not everything is stored in the root folder of One Drive and not everyone is connected to the bleeping internet 24/7.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, there’s the fact that you have removed offline help to provide "a better user experience". Which, when you’re 20 minutes into an internet dead zone, means "try to guess the right answer". At least be honest and say "We want to cut costs and can’t
 be bothered documenting our products any more so we’ll just point you to a series of blogs as long as you’re on line".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, and similarly, there's the fact that you point blank refuse to reintroduce the recent folders list in the File Open dialog because you think that all files should be on either One Drive (in the root directory, of course) or SharePoint. Which, for
 most people, they aren’t. This brilliant (not to mention blithely arrogant) piece of customer proactivity costs said customers (you know, Microsoft, the ones who keep you in business) minutes which add to hours over the course of a working week, month, year.
 That one has been discussed quite extensively. Nobody but the MS Development team likes that change, many hate it with a passion, but hey, Microsoft you know that you know best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at other ways that Word (Not Responding) "helps" your productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I spent over 10 minutes trying to open one document in Word (Not Responding). It kept bouncing between that document and a couple of others that I had open, never letting me actually select anything. When I checked in PowerShell there was, as there
 so often is, not one but two sessions of Word (Not Responding) running. One that can be killed, the other which, courtesy of the ineptitude of the Windows 10 team, cannot be killed by anything short of a reboot or a tactical nuclear weapon fired at your notebook,
 and don't think that the thought hasn't crossed my mind on a few occasions since Windows 8 came out. (Hint: If you write an operating system which does not allow ALL application threads to be killed, you’ve done it wrong.) It probably came from a prior crash
 of Word (Not Responding) but since Word (Not Responding) makes crashing a near-daily habit it's hard to keep track. As long as that zombie instance is there, you can guarantee that Word (Not Responding) will be about as functional as a melted brick of lead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But hey, you don’t even need the zombie application to be there for that to happen. Why this very morning exactly the same thing happened with only one session shown as running. I wasn’t even opening a file, just trying to select one of the three files that
 I had open. It was, however, the first time I was connected to the Internet after having worked on the three documents that I had open off line earlier that morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My best guess is that a lot of the problems like these are down to the "need" to exchange vast oceans of information with the Internet even when a user just wants to open and work on a file on which is on their own hard disk drive, and as far as I’m concerned
 that includes files that I have available OFF LINE in One Drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I can get to Backstage view – that is, when it is not in "SlamShut" mode where 30 to 60 seconds after clicking on the File tab, the backstage view pops open for a second and immediately slams shut, as it often does – I note that there is the option
 to "Save to computer by default". I HAD hoped that this would make Word act more like the Word of old where documents would be saved to your local drive and syncing would be done behind the scenes. Silly me. Instead it does sod all, and even with it checked
 Word saves directly to the server where possible and cries its little heart out for Daddy Internet when it's not around, telling you that there is no connection to the server (hint: I. Don't. Care.) and that tragedy of tragedies, it will try its little heart
 out to upload when the server becomes available. (Hint: That's. Your. Job. Just do it, and don't tell me about it. Or if you do, just put something in the STATUS bar instead of putting stupid, pointless dialogs in front of me.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But forget opening files, Office Devs, it seems to me that you can't even get the code to create a new document right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my first attempt to create a file in one session (actually, make that a number of sessions since I wrote that), Word (Not Responding) found the challenge of creating a blank document all too much (again), possibly because Daddy Internet wasn’t there to
 check in with. So it crashed (of course) and Microsoft spent the next ten minutes or so “gathering information”. “This may take a few minutes”. Yeah, no kidding. In the time it takes, a half way decent program could have mapped the gene sequences of half the
 population of Boston. This of course is all done to “find a solution” that never actually exists. Still, at least on that occasion it didn’t leave the zombie process behind and Word restarted more or less normally.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second attempt at creating a new document didn’t cause a crash, but rather a dialog that says “Your document will be upgraded to the newest format”. First, it is a NEW document. It is by definition not being “upgraded” to or from ANYTHING. Second, how
 many times do I need to check the box that says DO NOT SHOW ME THIS AGAIN before it DOES NOT SHOW ME THIS AGAIN? Microsoft, you lead the world, you have no peer, when it comes to shoving stupid, pointless, time wasting, work obstructing, zero or negative value
 dialogs in users' faces, and this is just one of at least a dozen I can think of across both Windows and Office without even raising a sweat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, because I was not connected to the holy Internet at the time (as I am often not) Word told me that it had, without my consent or permission, set the document to read only mode because the server was unavailable. Yeah, because that’s why I create NEW
 documents, Microsoft, to admire the pretty, empty whiteness of the page. Therefore I MUST have wanted this new document to be read only.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did ANYBODY put ANY thought into that design? Any at all? Was common sense even ONCE called upon?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So after a moment of typing I look up and see the button that graciously allows me to edit the document that I have created to work on. And I click on it. And then I retype the paragraph that I hadn’t noticed was not being recorded because instead of doing
 what I told it to, Word (Not Responding) was too busy shoving pointless dialogs and buttons in my face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about just switching document windows? (By the way, in any sane system there would be an easily accessible drop down somewhere to the top right to facilitate the quick picking of another window. You know, like we used to have with Office 2003’s View
 menu. Naturally the mighty Ribbon got rid of that though you can, at least, put the Switch Windows icon in the Quick Access Toolbar. At the top left. Meaning that a lot of right handers need to drag their mouse across the screen. And no, swapping from the
 taskbar is NOT an improvement especially when you have a lot of icons there, and doubly so when the application group includes not just workbooks or documents (as the case may be) but things like the VBE. Ah, progress.) In a well written program, this is easy.
 But in Word (Not Responding) you sometimes have about 30 to 50 seconds of staring at a ghosted out window and an hourglass cursor. I haven’t quite figured out what causes this to happen but again, I suspect that Word (Not Responding) is too busy chatting to
 Daddy Internet to do the job that we pay for it to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And don't you just love the constant pauses that it sometimes gets, where it just doesn’t react to the keyboard or the mouse for a moment or two; just enough to throw you off your game and be productivity-destroying. Want to bet that what it’s doing is checking
 with the Internet to make sure that all of the collaborative changes (that the 98% of us who work on documents by ourselves don’t have) are correctly processed?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But about that. On the rare occasions that I’ve accidentally left a document open on two of my computers at the one time, I’ve noted that Word (Not Responding) and the All! Live! All! The! Time! OneDrive don’t sync the things properly anyway. Best case I
 end up with two files (one with the name of the computer), just as I used to with the old Windows 7 incarnation of OneDrive that actually worked (relatively) well. Worst case I end up losing the changes in one of the copies. I have learnt from bitter experience
 to never accept a suggestion to “keep” one version or another. If I ever get that I save the current copy under a different name, open the other copy, and manually combine the changes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there's the way that I open up a document from my local OneDive folder and fail to see changes that I know I made, and made on the same machine, but which are just not there. Lost them? Well, yes, it looked that way but somehow they had been saved up
 to the cloud instance of OneDrive. So basically, because OneDrive has been transformed from something really useful to something that hardly works with Office 2016, I cannot trust that the version on my computer is in fact the current version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's if the file gets that far. On another occasion while offline I created a new, blank document, hit Save As and… the dialog went to One Drive / Documents and just sat there. "Working on it", it said. Burning about 15% of the CPU. For 5 minutes, then
 10 minutes. Still "working on it". It was probably looking for the online folders of OneDrive because the thing is probably so appallingly sloppily coded that it just could not figure out that Daddy Internet was not home, or refused to believe it. So instead
 of just going to my local OneDrive folders it crippled my machine instead with a CPU-sucking hung dialog. But hey, at least on that occasion the arduous task of saving a blank document didn't crash Word (Not Responding) which, as I noted above, it often does
 while offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which leads us to document recovery, a very important piece of code considering how often Word (Not Responding) crashes. On one occasion, after yet another crash, Word (Not Responding)’s recovery panel showed not one, not two but three different copies of
 my document. (I can’t recall if on that occasion any of the three were timestamped 1 January 1601, but apparently I did a lot of work that day as I frequently see that date on documents.) This was a document which was, at that time, not open on any other computer.
 The one that opened in the main window had the change that I just made so that was presumably the right one. I tell it to save and overwrite the copy in OneDrive. It tells me it can't because it's a stupid piece of... no, actually it says that the file is
 locked "by another user". Of which, there is none. I finally have to save a copy under a slightly different name and delete all instances of the old name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look out Google, Microsoft’s team of crack coders really have figured out how this network syncing stuff works! And then decided to code in the diametric opposite direction, it seems to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least I have yet to encounter one of Excel 2016’s cuter pieces of behaviour in Word. Yet. I close all of my workbooks, then go to close the last one which needs to be saved. It asks me whether I want to save it. I say Yes. And instead of saving it it
 brings up the Save As dialog box, pointing to whatever the current directory is, and with an empty filename box. Unbelievable, they can’t even get that right. The only way around it is to cancel the closure and manually save the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only, and I mean ONLY reason that I use Word 2016 at all instead of just uninstalling it completely and staying with Office 2010, is that the spelling and grammar checker is done quite well for when you're working in a foreign language. It is the ONLY
 thing (aside from a vague hope that maybe, perhaps one day, you'll fix the thing and the even vaguer hope that maybe, perhaps, possibly, one day you will actually listen to what users need) that keeps me using something that I otherwise regard as having devolved
 into one of the worst productivity programs ever written.</p>

    <title>Prevent windows defender from scanning during games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zsigma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Prevent windows defender from scanning during games</h2>
                    <p>I have decided to give windows defender a try, and I am happy with it except for the fact that it runs scans at unpredictable times. While not a problem when I am working, if I am playing a video game, it makes the game lag considerably, and with no way
 to pause the scan that I know of, this is an annoying issue.</p>
<p>I write to ask:</p>
<p>Can you prevent windows defender from scanning while certain applications are running (that way I could prevent it from scanning during my games)?</p>
<p>If that isn't possible, can you control what time windows defender scans?</p>

<p>You could use either Option 5 or Option 6 in this guide:</p>

<p>Those options <em>will let you disable Windows Defender Real-time Protection without being prompted it is turned off, and without it getting automatically turned back on later by Windows</em>.</p>
<p>Meaning you can disable Windows Defender Real-time Protection as long as you wish, and then easily re-enable it when you're finished with your games.</p>

<p>Since Windows Defender is now very aggressive about the way it protects a system, it's difficult to either disable the scanning or control it dependably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since your intent is to avoid the potential that an automated quick&nbsp;scan might occur during your game play, there's a relatively simple option that should work.&nbsp; Just run a manual quick scan before you begin playing your game, since if&nbsp;an equivalent
 quick scan has already been run within the last 24 hours,&nbsp;a second should be automatically aborted when Windows Maintenance attempts to run another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I'm making this assumption based on past&nbsp;rules of operation for Defender and haven't tested it myself, so you'll need to try it to confirm it still operates the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also possible to configure your own automated run of a quick scan using Task Scheduler, but this would still depend upon the automatic quick scan run by Windows Maintenance aborting, so I don't especially see this as valuable if your gaming times are
 variable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option I just realized might be to change the start&nbsp;time for automatic maintenance itself to a time when you would typically have the computer on, but not be gaming.&nbsp; I believe this still&nbsp;defaults to something like 3 am, but can be configured to
 a different hourly start time&nbsp;or even&nbsp;to wake from sleep if the system isn't typically turned completely off or disconnected from the&nbsp;electrical power grid.</p>

<p><span>It’s very unlikely that an Automatic Maintenance scan is interfering with your gaming experience, since this scan runs with an only-on-system-idle priority, and has also been very dysfunctional since the Anniversary update. But you can turn this automatic
 scan off just by right-clicking on the "Windows Defender Scheduled Scan" entry in Task Scheduler and choosing “disable”.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To resolve the issue, though, you’ll most likely need to turn off Defender’s real-time protection as
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c49799c5-22c7-46ef-8cff-777559e640a3" title="Jsssssssss">
 line that will make switching the Group Policy setting for Defender's real-time protection quick and easy. We never actually need to use the Group Policy Editor, or merge a downloaded REG file with the registry, in order to make these Group Policy changes.</span></p>

<p><span>The Antimalware Engine runs from startup to shutdown providing real-time (on-access) protection. It consumes CPU as it continuously scans all files involved in file system read/write operations, with the CPU utilization of the Antimalware Engine being
 proportional to the level of file system read/write activity. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Automatic Maintenance triggers the Windows Defender Scheduled Scan task on a “daily” baseline frequency, but this task normally fails to start. When it does start, it runs with an only-on-system-idle priority. Because this scan is terminated by any
 user activity, it’s very difficult to monitor, and the simplest way to make sure that it’s not running is to disable the Windows Defender Scheduled Scan task in Task Scheduler.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should try just turning off real-time protection in the Windows Defender Security Center app before you resort to a “permanent” solution. If you feel compelled to use Group Policy in order to turn off Defender’s real-time protection (and turn it
 back on again later), then you can do that very quickly with these commands:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Right-click on the Start button and select Windows Powershell (Admin) and then copy, paste, and enter the command:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn off Windows Defender’s real-time protection</span>:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)"><span>REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection" /v DisableRealtimeMonitoring /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn on Windows Defender’s real-time protection</span>:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)"><span>REG DELETE "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection" /v DisableRealtimeMonitoring
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>But the only indication that you’ve just turned off all Antivirus/Antimalware protection will be this:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">T</span></span></span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">his setting is managed by your administrator</span>:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2189f4cc-7859-4653-8c56-3efa4753cd45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2189f4cc-7859-4653-8c56-3efa4753cd45" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In case it isn't clear, you can't just leave real-time protection turned off; and you really shouldn't disable Defender's real-time protection unless you're offline. So, depending on the circumstances, you might be better off looking for a free AV solution
 that comes with a built-in gaming mode.</p>

Re:&nbsp; sorting across<br />
<br />
Sorting across can get ugly as you have discovered.<br />
If you want to sort <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">each</span> of the three rows ascending then you have to sort each row separately...<br />
<br />
Range("B19:Z19").Sort Key1:=Range("B19"), Order1:=xlAscending, Header:=xlNo, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OrderCustom:=1, MatchCase:=False, Orientation:=xlLeftToRight, DataOption1:=xlSortNormal<br />
<br />
Then repeat above using the other two rows.<br />
<br />
If you want to sort the three rows together as a group using the header row sort order then it gets a little more complicated.
<br />
I can provide the details if needed.<br />

<p>However, I still cannot verify on my Office 365 dashboard. I use Network Solutions for the domain registration and their MX records interface doesn't allow for the MX records verification entry.</p>
<p>Please help anyone who has solved this problem. It seems to be widespread.</p>

<h2>            Text Box Editing in Excel 2010</h2>
                    I am a recent convert from Excel 2003 to Excel 2010.&nbsp; In 2003, when I inserted a text box into my spreadsheet, entered text information into the box, and then hit the return key, the cursor would drop to the next line in the text box, just as if I was
 entering text in Word.&nbsp; However, when I enter text in the 2010 version and hit the return key, the cursor does not move.&nbsp; How do I get a text box in 2010 to act like a text entry program?<br />

    <title>Issue forwarding mail to an external account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue forwarding mail to an external account</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to forward email from my Outlook.com address to an external account but it is giving me the following error message when I try to set it up:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(200, 83, 5, 1)">You can't forward mail to
 your original address or any of your aliases.</span></p>
<p>I removed the address
 in question from my aliases, but that did not solve the problem. I am not sure what my "original address" is, but I am trying to forward to a gmail account, so I don't see how that could be the problem. I have attempted to solve this issue through various
 Microsoft support channels and the results have been disastrous. Their "Answer Techs" seem to only be able to help people sign in to an account that they've been locked out of. Anyway, if anyone can shed some light on this, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you wish to forward your Outlook.com emails to your Gmail account. Let us see how I can help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you add your Gmail account to Outlook.com you can continue to send and receive new email from your Gmail address. It will then become an EASI (<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Email As Sign In)
</span>account. A<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">n EASI account's sole purpose is for you to be able to use or gain access to Microsoft's products &amp; services and, at the same time, keep your current account (with other email service provider).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although you can't receive emails from an EASI account, you will be able to send messages from it. However, by connecting your existing service and importing your existing email using POP, you can begin sending and receiving mail
 from an EASI account with your existing address. To set up a POP3 account,</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> please refer to the article below.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If you've successfully added your Gmail account to Outlook.com, the system will recognize it as a newly created account and&nbsp;some of the features might be turned off to help thwart spammers. To learn more about this, refer to

            <p>It's 2016 now, and this is still broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added my gmail address as an alias so I could (a) sign in to Xbox and other Microsoft services using my GMail address while retaining my purchase history and other Microsoft account data and (b) so I could request that Microsoft email me at my GMail address
 and not my outlook.com address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When setting up forwarding so that anyone still using my outlook.com address will have their mail reach me at GMal I hit this several-year old issue : "You can't forward mail to your original address or any of your aliases."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes no sense, the GMail address is not an address that Microsoft controls or manages mail for and I should be allowed to forward email to it. The error specifically calls out that I can't forward to it because it is an alias, yet after I remove the
 alias I continue to get the exact same error - even though it's no longer an alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, bugs happen - but this is 2+ years old and still broken.</p>

            <p>For what it's worth, it is broken in other ways too. For many years I've had my msn.com email (through outlook.com) forwarded to my GMail account, and it has worked fine. When the new and improved (?) Outlook.com came on line, the forwarding still worked,
 but suddenly all my mail in my Outlook.com inbox was being marked as read before I had even looked at it. After getting very frustrated, I finally disabled the automatic forward, and suddenly my email was no longer marked as read until I actually read it.
 &nbsp;So apparently, the new Outlook.com considers a message "read" if it has been forwarded. Duh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had started forwarding my email to my Gmail because I thought I might someday have to give up on my MSN / Outlook.com email. Maybe that time has come.</p>

    <title>Transferring music from 360 HD to USB - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Transferring music from 360 HD to USB</h2>
                    Hey all, my issue is with transferring music from my Xbox 360 Hard Drive to a USB Drive. When I attempt to transfer music, the option is "greyed out" even though there is plenty of music on the hard drive that I can access via the Xbox Music Application.
 The USB drive is compatible, as I successfully configured it to be a Xbox 360 storage device with enough unused space. Also, the options for transferring game data, profiles, etc., are functional, all except music. Has anybody else ever experienced this problem?

            <p>Hi Mat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you try putting this formula into your "On Target %" text field:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Round(Switch([Start]&gt;[Status Date],0,[Finish]&lt;[Status Date],100,ProjDateDiff([Start],[Status Date])/[Duration]*100&lt;100,ProjDateDiff([Start],[Status Date])/[Duration]*100),1) &amp; "%"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the value that Project would insert in %Complete if you were to "Mark on Track" as Trevor indicated. &nbsp;There is no dividing by 3600 needed because both the numerator and the denominator are durations in minutes. &nbsp; Obviously this formula presumes that
 you use Status Date. &nbsp;If not, then you need to replace "Status Date" with "Current Date" in the formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I would never advise the workflow you describe. &nbsp;Allowing (duration) %Complete as a progress updating input is bad for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Cannot access Office 365 programs on tablet or android phone</h2>
                    I am able to open Office 365 on my PC and can use Outlook, Word, etc with no problem. However, I recently loaded the Outlook for Android app on my Samsung 5 smartphone but I can't get past the first screen as MS tells me that my user ID (my email) does
 not exist. This is the very same email that I use to open Office 365. &nbsp;In the past 2 days I have spent just over 5 hours on MS support chat lines trying to get this resolved but I keep getting transferred to a different section. My very basic question is why
 doesn't MS recognise my user ID when I am trying to set up Officed 365 on a portable device?

            Thanks for the suggestion but I have already done this at least 5-6 times with no luck. I tried it again this morning on an ipad and I can't get past the first page which asks for my user ID. No portable devices seem to recognise my user ID email - the
 same email that I have used to log in to MS Community Page.

            I have tried every troubleshooting step advised my Microsoft Support on the chat lines, and have googled for solutions as well. I am now wondering whether my Microsoft Account login and my Office 365 login are one in the same, as I can use the same username
 and P/W on my PC to access both, but not on any of my portable devices?

            I have uninstalled the apps so I can't take a screenshot but the message essentially said that my username was not recognised, even though it is the same username that I used to sign up to Office 365 and to this community chat. I have no further contact
 from Microsoft so I am ready to give up.&nbsp;

<p>I want to create different categories under my page parts apart from what already exists...is there a way to do that? Instead of headings, pull quotes, etc. I want to name them differently to fit our needs of what we are saving.</p>
<p>

<p>The page parts are stored within the specific instance of Publisher. If she is using a different computer with a different Publisher installation then she is not going to be able to see your page parts. If you find where the page parts are stored on your
 computer you might be able to share that folder/directory with her and she could likely sub it in for her page part folder. I am not sure where it is stored...</p>

            I didn't have any problems getting my phone to connect to my XP computer.&nbsp; All I did was plug it up to my computer with the USB cable that came with it and waited. A driver was automatically installed on the computer and everything has worked just great.&nbsp;
 I've done this with 2 different XP computers and never had a problem.<br />
<br />
Some requirements for this connection to work are:<br />
<ul>
<li>Your computer should be updated to SP3 </li><li>Your computer needs to be running Windows Media Player 11</li></ul>
<br />
I have read other threads in this forum where users report the same kind of camera connection that you report..&nbsp; I think you might find some additional recommended steps you could take in those threads.&nbsp; Have you reviewed any of those threads and tried the
 recommendations provided?<br />

<h3> karenmccarthy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop Auto-tagging</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Outlook recently started "auto-tagging" my emails by classifying them with a hashtag as "promotions" or "newsletters," etc. at the top of the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find this to be intrusive, and it is not helpful at all to my use of email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The auto-tags are often incorrect, but I do not want my feedback to "improve the accuracy of this service." It is not a service. It is an invasion of my privacy. It feels like Outlook is reading my emails and telling me how to categorize them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I turn it off?</p>

No, it's Outlook, on my hotmail account. The message even says "Outlook tagged this message as #Promotions."

<h3> thomasspero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word Documents on Android operating system products</h2>
                    <p>I would like to purchase a small device to take on trips to Europe that would be able to access wi-fi. I would like to put my whole MY DOCUMENTS folder on the devise so that I have a mini computer with me. I own an 11 inch Acer laptop (netbook) but I would
 like to go smaller, like a tablet or smart phone. </p>
<p>My question is, do I understand right that Microsoft Word Documents are not compatible with android devises? So with any android devices you can not open Word Documents? You would not be able to put your whole MY DOCUMENTS FOLDER on a small device? You can
 put your whole MY DOCUMENTS FOLDER on the cloud and use it with an app on your tablet or phone and WORD Documents will open? Is the reason you can not use Microsoft Word Documents on small devices because you need the Microsoft Office Software on the small
 device and the software is just too big for the small device? So if you can open a WORD DOCUMENT stored on the cloud, by using an app, you are opening the document using Microsoft Office software on the cloud? I do not understand? Can someone advise me?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            The <u>root</u> of the Storage card? I don't understand what you mean. The music I have for my phone is on a minisd storage card, and the ringtones folder is on the device. So do I save them in the Sounds folder of the device or the ringtone folder to
 set one as an alarm? Sorry I am slow when it comes ot tech stuff. Thanks for your help.

 I find out that I have to go through all this just to remove a threat and then I find out it doesn't even detect all viruses.&nbsp; I think I'll just uninstall MSE and go with Norton or Mcfee, they are so much easier to use.

<p>The Windows Defender Offline is essentially the same as MSE. The point is that its launched outwith the Windows OS so can scan for things uninfluenced by Malware/Viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Norton and McAfee will likely slow down your computer even more than MSE. Malwarebytes' Antimalware is a good security product.</p>

<br />Is there a way to sync calendar and contacts from outlook 2013 to outlook.com
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello Pete
<br />
<br />All that is required is to configure the Outlook.com account in Outlook 2013 by just entering your email address/password and the account will be automatically configured as an Exchange account where all folders (email, contact, calendar) will be sync'd with the server.
<br />
<br />If you already have the Outlook.com account configured as either an IMAP or POP3 account, there are some additional steps you're going to have to take first which I'll provide if this is applicable. Just advise.
<br />
<br />Just in case you already have the Outlook.com account configured and not sure of how it was configured (POP3 or IMAP), go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Email tab (from within Outlook desktop)
<br />
<br />Lastly, in case this is also applicable, if you have other email accounts configured, it would be useful to know which data file is configured as the "default data file" since that's where the default contact/calendar folders are stored. To check that, go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab (also from within Outlook desktop_

            That means you have a connected GMail account.
<br />
<br />What you require is the Outlook.com account to be configured as an Exchange account where the contact/calendar data will be stored. As a FYI, contact/calendar data does not sync between the server and Outlook desktop.
<br />
<br />If you're asking, "How do I sync Google contact/calendar data" with Outlook desktop, you can't regardless of whether it's configured via Outlook.com or directly in Outlook desktop.

            As Karl said, you can sync between desktop Outlook and Outlook.com by using Exchange. What I gather from what you say is that you log into Outlook.com using a gmail address. If that's the case, add an @outlook.com alias to the account. Log into <a href="https://account.live.com/names/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/names/Manage</a> and click the "Add email" link. Add an address ending in @outlook.com and then use that address and your existing password when you create the account in desktop Outlook.
