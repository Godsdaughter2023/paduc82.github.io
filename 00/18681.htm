<h2>            bluetooth audio streaming and track info in car display working sporadically</h2>
                    I have been having a sporadic problem with Bluetooth audio streaming. I have an Audi and never had this problem on my Samsung Focus, Focus S, or Lumia 900.<br />
What happens is that the song plays fine, but sometimes the track information does not display in my cars display. Sometimes it can work fine for an hr, and sometimes just skipping to the next song and there is no track info anymore. its annoying and something
 is definitely wrong. Turning the phones Bluetooth off and on will fix the problem, but sometimes it happens a song or two later. Sometimes when I get in my car, there is no track info right away. Its very inconsistent and I can't pinpoint why it happens. It
 used to work great in Wp7xx.<br />
Anyone else notice it too? The phone always shows the track info, but it doesn't always get transmitted to my car.

I have a similar problem with a 2013 subaru impreza..&nbsp; Streaming music locks up in between songs every now and then, I&nbsp;cant figure out what sequence of actions corrects it, but it usually involves turning the car on and off...&nbsp;&nbsp;kind of funny that I have to
 reboot the car to fix a windows problem.

            <p>Okay. &nbsp;Lets assume you have columns B1, C1, D1, labeled "game 1, game 2, game 3. and column E1 labeled "Total"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column A1 is labeled week. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each week you make entries into B, C and D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column E has the formula =sum(B1:D1). &nbsp;This formula is copied down in column E for the number of weeks you enter data. &nbsp;For this example lets say 35.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets assume the data inputted ranges from 150 to 225 in any one cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to use countifs(E2:E36,"&gt;=525,"E2:E36,"&lt;=599")</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should return a value for the number of scores that were between this range in column "E"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It returns the error #value! code...My best guess is: &nbsp;Column "E" has a formula. &nbsp;I tried copying the value in cell E to another column using the copy "value" changed the range in countifs to this new location. &nbsp;Same result. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel has to have a function like countifs that will count the value in a cell derived from a formula.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I corrected your formula and put a formula that generates random numbers in E2:E36.&nbsp; (The formula in your post appears to have a typo introduced in your post which Excel does not permit in a cell - the typo doesn't by itself produce a #Value! error. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I could not make it produce a #Value error even putting Text, Logical, and Error Values in the range.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using Excel 2013 to test since I don't have Office 365 available. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But CountifS&nbsp; should not behave differently with numeric values produced by a formula vice numeric values hard coded.&nbsp;

            What if you are pulling the data from a different book. &nbsp;One worksheet has all the input data and sums. &nbsp;A different worksheet has the "countifs" for showing results.

<p>
</p><p>then countifs (and other functions in the countif/sumif family) does not work if the data workbook is closed - the workbook referred to in the countifs' arguments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [however, your example did not indicate this to be the case.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, that restriction is largely independent of whether the data in the other workbook is produced by formulas or hard coded.&nbsp;

    <title>OneDrive as part of Office 365 Home vs. Business &#40;and maybe vs. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> granitestatecolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive as part of Office 365 Home vs. Business &#40;and maybe vs. ProPlus&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I currently use Office 365 Home and just learned with some horror that a folder I had believed I had shared securely from OneDrive by using the Share with e-mail and NOT creating a link, actually still just creates a link that anyone can use. In effect,
 I inadvertently made my private folders public by sharing with specific individual e-mail addresses. This is inconceivable to me that Microsoft thinks this is acceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If I upgrade from Office 365 Home to Office 365 Business (the $8.25/mo plan), will that fix this? That is, will I be able to share OneDrive folders with specific outside users based on their e-mail address and Microsoft will not grant access unless that
 user is logged in with the specific account to which I shared, and that user won't be able to re-share or forward a link to grant access to others?</li><li>Office 365 Home allows me 5 users and multiple computers per user, so I can install on two desktops and my laptop and also share with my wife and kids, each with multiple computers, where each user gets their own dedicate 1TB of OneDrive storage. This is
 more than 5 total PC installs, more like 5 PC installs per user for up to 5 users. Does Office 365 Business also support multiple users? I think I lose this by going to Office 365 Business, but can't find this stated clearly anywhere.</li><li>Other than the 300 user limit, is there any difference between Office 365 Business and Office 365 ProPlus? Do both support Exchange Online Archiving?</li><li>Would I lose use of Skype for talking, texting, and video calls with other Skype users, or are those features free to everyone anyway? I don't care about the 60 minutes free international calling I know I also get with Office 365 Home.</li><li>I have a client for whom I have an Office 365 Enterprise account. That works fine with a OneDrive Business account alongside my personal Office 365 Home and OneDrive Personal account. Would the same be true if I moved that to an Office 365 Business account
 (or would the two business accounts' OneDrives fight with each other on my computer)?</li><li>If I do make the change, is there any automated way to migrate my OneDrive from Office 365 Home to the new Office 365 Business, or would I need re-upload everything to the cloud (which would take a long time and effectively saturate our Internet pipe for
 a week due to our very limited upload bandwidth in this part of the country)?</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I run my own Exchange Server, so I don't need or care about having Microsoft providing e-mail hosting, but I do need the Office apps, including Outlook. I might like to use Teams and Planner, which I believe
 are only in ProPlus (or higher), but not sure I care enough about those to pay extra for them.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Your Question -</p>
<p><span>"I asked if there were any advantages to OneDrive for Business over Office 365 Business Essentials, because it looks like Office 365 Business Essentials includes OneDrive for Business plus adds other features at the same price as OneDrive for Business.
 If that's right, why would anyone only buy OneDrive for Business when Office 365 Business Essentials is that plus more at no additional charge? Please tell me if I'm missing something."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Office365 Business Essentials is a product bundle designed for small businesses of up to 300 users. A company cannot purchase more than 300 licenses of Office365 Business Essentials. As such the bundled is offered at a discount.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One Drive for Business (OD4B) is a standalone product. It is bundled in "Office365 Business" family of plans, and it is also bundled in "Office365 Enterprise" family of plans. The OD4B standalone product does not have the 300 user restriction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For small businesses want one OD4B, it is more cost effective to subscribe to O365 Biz Essentials than the standalone version.</span></p>
<p><span>However, for businesses with more than 300 users, they need to subscribe to E1 (USD8) plan to get equivalent features as Biz Essentials.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that clarifies why OD4B standalone is perceived to be more expensive than O365 Biz Essentials.</p>

<p>Hi Colin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.” <em>So for my #2, I believe you are confirming -- my wife and kids would lose their accounts if I move from Office 365 Home, which allows me to share with up to 4 additional users, each of whom gets their own 1TB OneDrive space, to Office 365 Business
 or One Drive for Business, which just allow 5 computers, but do not provide family members with their own OneDrive space, right? Can you give me a 'yes' or 'no' answer on that?</em>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. There is no advantage to OneDrive for Business over Office 365 Business Essentials. As the following screenshot mentioned, there are two ways to subscribe Office 365 Business Essentials. The original price for it is $6.00 user/month. Since there is a
 one-year contract, it provides a discount.</p>

<h2>            Scroll Bar movement in Word</h2>
                    I am working with Word 2016 (Office 2016).&nbsp; How do I make the up and down scroll bar move simultaneously through the document as opposed to jumping.&nbsp; When I scroll, I want the pages to move at the same time.&nbsp; I don't like this scroll then the page jumps
 to the new position when I release the mouse button.&nbsp; This is not "efficient" as I try to proof a document.&nbsp; I have no control over where the document is going to "land" which may not be in line with the section I am proofing.&nbsp; Is this feature no longer available?

            The scroll bar works as it does on a web page in a browser.
<br />There are arrows at the top and bottom. Clicking on those will give a gradual scroll.
<br />
<br />Clicking in the elevator shaft part of the scroll bar (the gray part between the arrows) moves the screen display the amount represented by the elevator car (the white part). This is generally a bit less than one screen full at a time.
<br />
<br />If you click and hold in the gray area, you move that car quickly.

    <title>Bluetooth not connecting to car - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> northside chicago girl forever  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth not connecting to car</h2>
                    <p>My lumia 710 (win 7.5) started not seeing or connecting to our acura's Bluetooth hands free&nbsp;device.&nbsp; Sometimes the phone would not see the car or vis versa.</p>
<p>Now, the car doesn't see the phone, but the phone "says" connected to Bluetooth device, but the car doesn't show the phone icon on the dashboard screen, I tried to make a car, assuming possibly the screen wasn't working, it was.&nbsp; No phones found.&nbsp; So now
 I can't make any hands free calls from the car at all unless I stop.&nbsp; I did try calling and using the speakerphone option instead a couple times, you could see on the call screen the Bluetooth tile was greyed out as if unavailable.</p>
<p>Interesting, right. Well, I've changed network apps and will see if this helps, I do hope the 7.8 update to the lumia phones will give us some options in this area, but who knows.&nbsp; My hubby is having similar problems with getting cut off from the car for
 a period of time, but hasn't yet been completely cut off from the Bluetooth.&nbsp; We have noticed the same problem that you had, where a txt, or email or notification will come in and the phone reacts by doing things it shouldn't:)&nbsp; like disconnecting the phone
 from the car all of a sudden, and possibly later reconnecting.&nbsp; He is in the car, connecting to Bluetooth device there almost everyday, I connect to the car or had tried to between 2-3 times a week.&nbsp; He has a win 7.5 phone, but its a htc radar.</p>
<p>Any suggestions are very appreciated.</p>

            <p>Did the Radar <em>ever</em> connect/pair wit the Acura?</p>
<p>If not, it could be because the Acura is expecting to connect with the phone beyond simple audio/hands free pairing.&nbsp; (i.e. wants to share contacts, etc.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the WP7.5 BT profile support is somewhat limited and many vehicles and other devices expect a more extensive partnership.&nbsp; In some cases, we've seen situations where, if the desired pairing profile is not supported, the device simply won't
 show the phone at all as available.</p>
<p>Now, if it WAS working and has now stopped, that's a different issue.</p>

            <p>Yes, they both did connect to the acura. mine stopped about 3 months ago.&nbsp; We've had the phones since Feb of this year.&nbsp; The acura does not support audio or any other kind Bluetooth connection, other than hands free.&nbsp; It is a 2004 acura tl, one of first
 to take advantage of Bluetooth tech.&nbsp; We used our blkberry's with no problem for years before changing over to win phones, because my hubby is a developer in that area, (not mobile, software) so wanted a comparable phone.
</p>
<p>So yes, both my lumia 710 and his htc radar which both run win 7.8, were pairing with the acura, but now mine thinks its paired, but is not connected to the car. While the htc radar does connect but at times will disconnect and he said 10-15 min's later
 will reconnect on its own.&nbsp; He says he will try to use the voice commands with the htc radar while the phone is paired, then the phone doesn't hear the command, or doesn't receive voice commands while paired.&nbsp;

<p><br />
Hmmmm, OK... do you have any other BT devices you can attempt to pair to the phones?&nbsp; (I'm just thinking to test the BT on the phone and make sure it's still working).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW -- are you sure you're not running 7.5?&nbsp; If you have 7.8, you are WAY ahead of the rest of us...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried a power cycle of the phone (hold the power/sleep button till the 'slide down' message appears, sllide down, wait 10 secs, then hold the power/sleep button until it vibrates)?</p>

            <p>I took the battery out to reset instead of a power cycle, need to be cleaned anyway, figured this was easier.&nbsp; I will go out to the car as soon as the hubby gets home, which he isn't yet and see if anything has changed with regards to my bt connection to
 the car, that is if it connects and if the cars knows its there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, maybe I can hope? for a change with the upgrade yet to come in 7.8. </p>
<p>And no neither of us are running 7.8 upgrade yet, we both bought the phones in Feb at the same time, place etc and they already had 7.5, though his had a couple updates to the software on the phone (older model than mine).&nbsp; I so do wish we all new when the
 older 7.5 phones will be allowed to get the 7.8 upgrade-be nice if they had any kind of idea or rather would like the share the date with the rest of us.&nbsp; I can't see that it would do any harm except to know we can and when we can upgrade...........</p>
<p>Thanks, will let you know what happens.</p>

            <p>Hi NorthSide Chicago Girl Forever, </p>
<p>Were you ever able to retest the phone. I'm also curious to see if you have any different bluetooth devices or perhaps know someone that has a different phone platform that could be tested with the bluetooth on the car.
</p>
<p>It will be necessary to verify if the phone's bluetooth is able to pair with other devices or each other to see if perhaps it is the phone. Since both sound to be running different updates I wouldn't leap to think of this as an issue within the OS.
</p>
<p>Verifying if other devices can pair with the car would either indicate an issue with the bluetooth in the car or rule it out all together. The more info we have as to what devices can pair with others will really help to narrow this down.
</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Nate W.H.</p>

<h2>            VBA question.  Custom Footers in an Active Sheet using values from another sheet.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Workbook that uses the Procedure below to enter data in the Active Spreadsheet's footer(s) from values in the mentioned ranges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Private Sub Workbook_BeforePrint(Cancel As Boolean)</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">ActiveSheet.PageSetup.LeftFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; "Aisle<span>&nbsp;
</span>" &amp; Range("A2").Value</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>ActiveSheet.PageSetup.CenterFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; "Floor " &amp; Range("B2")</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>ActiveSheet.PageSetup.RightFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; Range("C2").Value</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>End Sub</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>This works great, but would it be possible to get the values to put in the footer from another spreadsheet &amp; depending on which active sheet it is.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This naturally doesn't work below,&nbsp; but I thought someone could maybe understand what I'm trying to do by my rough example:</font></p>
<p><i><font><font>IF Active Sheet = Sheet2</font></font></i></p>
<p><font><font>ActiveSheet.PageSetup.LeftFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; "Aisle<span>&nbsp;
</span>" &amp; Sheets(“Sheet1”).Range("A9").Value</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>ActiveSheet.PageSetup.CenterFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; "Floor " &amp; Sheets(“Sheet1”).Range("B9").Value</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>ActiveSheet.PageSetup.RightFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; Range("C9").Value</font></font></p>
<p><i><font><font>ElseIf Active Sheet=Sheet3</font></font></i></p>
<p><font><font>ActiveSheet.PageSetup.LeftFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; "Aisle<span>&nbsp;
</span>" &amp; Sheets(“Sheet1”).Range("A10").Value</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>ActiveSheet.PageSetup.CenterFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; "Floor " &amp; Sheets(“Sheet1”).Range("B10").Value</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>ActiveSheet.PageSetup.RightFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; Range("C10").Value</font></font></p>
<p><i><font><font>ElseIf ActiveSheet=Sheet4</font></font></i></p>
<p><font><font>ActiveSheet.PageSetup.LeftFooter = "&amp;""Arial,Regular""&amp;6" &amp; "Aisle<span>&nbsp;
</span>" &amp; Sheets(“Sheet1”).Range("A11").Value</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>Etc.</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>Etc.</font></font></p>
<p><font>End If</font></p>
<p><font>End Sub</font></p>
<p><font>Hope I explained what I'm trying to do, and if it is even possible.&nbsp; Just learning VBA.</font></p>
<p><font>Thank-you in advance,</font></p>

    <title>IMAP Server error messages.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisacrowley13  say:</h3>
<h2>            IMAP Server error messages....</h2>
                    <p><strong>I</strong> saw where this question had been posted before, but didn't see a fix.&nbsp; I've been using Outlook for many years at work and for the last 4 years, Outlook 13 with GoDaddy as our host.&nbsp; I've never experienced any problems until I had to get
 a new laptop about 5 months ago.&nbsp; Immediately after setting Outlook up, I began receiving an error message that read "Your IMAP server wants to alert you to the following: folder exists".&nbsp; There are many folders that exist in my Outlook, so I have no idea
 what this message means.&nbsp; Then about a month ago, I began receiving a message that says "Your IMAP server wants to alert you to the following:&nbsp; email is too large, limit size to less than 30MB".&nbsp; I have not sent, nor received any emails that are at or larger
 than 30MBs.&nbsp; And yes, I have actually gone through to check.&nbsp; Now today, I began receiving an error message that reads " Your IMAP server wants to alert you to the following:&nbsp; cannot rename system folders".&nbsp; I have not attempted to rename any folders.&nbsp; It
 has reached the point that these messages are seriously interfering with my work because they're popping up every couple of minutes.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?&nbsp; This is obviously a wide spread problem because I've seen numerous posts complaining about it, but
 no fixes.&nbsp; HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lisa</p>

<p>If a widespread issue its not impacted on me, in the last several years.</p>
<p>When you started using this new PC did you simply add the IMAP mail account when prompted, using only the mail address &amp; password and allowed to sync, or did you do anything alse with regards old data, or settings?</p>

            Just because it isn't impacting you now doesn't mean that it isn't wide spread.&nbsp; &nbsp; Apparently it has impacted you in the past.&nbsp; And I don't understand why there is no fix when it is impacting so many people and has been for quite some time. And no, I didn't
 nothing other than allow it to sync.&nbsp; And that wouldn't explain the other error messages.&nbsp; I have three that now regularly (every 1 to 2 minutes) pop up.&nbsp; I just closed out about 40.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Access 2016, Data type Number Field Size Drop Down missing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So I've been learning and starting to use Access I was filling out the table while learning to create the fields and choose data type. I got to one point where I was writing something with decimal and was told to choose Number Field for the data type. Then
 I was instructed to change the field size from Long Integer to Double. Well I clicked the drop down menu and there was nothing. The drop down for that is completely empty. In the instructional video there is a whole bunch of choices. What is wrong with Access
 2016 or is there something else I'm supposed to be doing? I have the full version and this isn't a trial. What gives?</p>
<p>

<h3> raysheldon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Is Frozen</h2>
                    I have a new laptop and, in setting it up, I updated Windows to 8.1 and downloaded Windows 365 which is now frozen and which I cannot delete or reinstall . Have tried going out to the 365 site for either a fix or a reinstall and it won't do it. Have deleted
 the programs (start8 and windows silverlight) which I had installed since it last worked and no help there. All I can think of is that I've changed the settings on power consumption since it last worked but that shouldn't be the issue I don't think. Could
 use some help getting it going again.Thanks!<br />

</span>installation by running the fixit from the following article:<br />

<font><br />
and then reinstall Office of download and install it by logging into </font><a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">www.office.com/myaccount</font></a><font> with your registered email address

                    <p>I have the developer preview for WP 8.1 and the HTC app for my 8X doesn't display the time and weather&nbsp;as it used to in WP 8.0. In the reviews of the app, lots of people are experiencing this issue. Now I cant really contact HTC and say "there is a bug in
 this app" because they won't listen to me, so what should I do? I wrote a poor review of the app but that might not do anything... Any help would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>That's the point, it's not an official release yet, it's a developer preview.&nbsp; Your understanding of what that means is incorrect, the developer preview is not a full public release.&nbsp; Microsoft released a public beta of Windows 8, that doesn't mean that
 on release day of the beta you can expect every program to work perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most developers were probably waiting for the preview release to finalize their builds.&nbsp; Why release early when you can finish it up and make it perfect?</p>

                    Using regedit I exported an odbc connection to a reg file . &nbsp;Using notepad I changed the "name" of the connection. &nbsp;Then I double-clicked the reg file and the new named connection was then visible in regedit. &nbsp;But when I went into MS Access and tried to
 find the new connection to use it, it did not appear. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Btw, what I really need to do is get the existing connection available on a second pc. &nbsp;But I did the stuff above as a test of getting things out of regedit and back into it.

<h2>            Making a copy of a running Windows 8.1 for use in Virtualbox</h2>
                    I have a desktop running Windows 8.1 and Virtualbox installed. I have successfully done a clean install of Win10 in VB but what I really want to do is an upgrade install using a copy of my existing 8.1 system. I have used disk2vhd and disk manager to make
 virtual drives of all system and data volumes for use in VB. When I attempt to boot I get a message that no bootable devices found. I've searched and tried everything I could find to make this work but have been unable to get around it. Is it possible to do
 this? If yes can anybody provide any specific information on what I need to do to make it work? I really don't want to test the upgrade path for the first time my active system. I do need to be sure that the apps I use daily will work after upgrade or document
 any issues.

<h2>            Windows 10 TP doesn&#39;t detect webcameras on a ASUS T200TA</h2>
                    I've upgrade to Windows 10 but it can't detect the front and back camera. I went to the ASUS website and downloaded the drivers and installed them. They show up in the device manager but under System devices (Camera Sensor AR0543 &amp; HM2056) instead of in
 the tree view under imaging/camera devices as I would expect. They show them as working under system devices&nbsp;but they don't. I tried to install using legacy with the inf file but it doesn't work as is has an exclamation point next to the driver. I deleted
 these and then ran the troubleshooter but this doesn't fix the issue. Not sure what else to do.

            Hello mtrot,<br />
<br />
Are you using a 32 bit or 64 bit version of Vista?&nbsp; Most animated weather radars use Flash.&nbsp; If your version of Vista is 64 bit and you are using the 64bit version of IE8 Adobe has not yet developed a 64 bit version of the Flash add-on.&nbsp; Like I said, if you
 are running 64 bit Vista you would need to make sure you are using the 32 bit IE.<br />
<br />
If your Vista is indeed the 32 bit version then we need to make sure that our IE settings have been changed to a configuration that doesn't allow Flas to run.&nbsp; The easiest way to check this is to simply reset the default settings in IE.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Click on Tools<br />
2.&nbsp; Click on Internet Options<br />
3.&nbsp; Click on the Advnced tab<br />
4.&nbsp; Locate the Reset Internet Exlorer Settings heading and click the reset button.<br />

<br />
If resetting IE doesn't resolve this let us know.&nbsp; Also let us know if your Vista is 32 bit or 64bit<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Which version of Windows are you running?</p>
<p>You specified IE8 when asking this question. Could IE9 have been installed by Windows Update?</p>
<p>If IE9 was installed, the small white star on the right side of the IE toolbar will open the Favorites Center.</p>

    <title>Unable to open shortcuts maximized - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to open shortcuts maximized</h2>
                    Since updating to Windows 10, whenever I open a favorite or a website shortcut from my desktop, it does not open maximized. I've tried all the things that worked in previous versions, to no avail. I find this annoying enough that if I can't find a solution
 I will change my default browser. I do not want to use Edge because some of the sites I use most say they do not yet support Edge.

            <p>Hi,<br />
Try this procedure...<br />
Open a webpage. Stretch it out to fullsize. Don't use maximize.<br />
Choose any link on that webpage and right-click&gt; open in a new window.<br />
Stretch that second window out to the desired size- don't use maximize.<br />
Close the first IE window. Then close that second resized window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should do this with every program shortcut you use to open Internet Explorer and if you close a smaller window you will have to redo it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don</p>
