I have tried to apply the hotfix from other posts and it says that it does not apply to this system.&nbsp; I have more x64 systems to set up and if I can't get this resolved, I will have to resort back to the x86 version of Vista and not be able to take advantage
 of the x64.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated!</span>

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
If this is a 64bit version of Vista, then your problem may be related to trying to print from a 32bit program on a 64bit operating system.&nbsp; There is a hotfix available for that issue here:<br />
You experience problems when you try to print a document in a 32-bit program on a computer that is running a 64-bit version of Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941962/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941962/en-us</span></a><br />
<br />
If that does not fix it, try uninstalling and reinstalling the printer driver.&nbsp; It is possible that the driver has gotten corrupted.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Also try running a system file checker:<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
At the command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER:<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved.<br />
<br />
Also, try making a new PDF document from a different file.&nbsp; I have actually seen this error turn up and then be fixed with a different document, like some embedded code or macro is throwing it off.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this does not resolve the issue.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>I have already tried running that hotfix and it tells me that it does NOT apply to my system.&nbsp; This issue is happening on a brand new machine with brand new drivers installed.&nbsp; How could they have gotten corrupted so soon?&nbsp; I can't even open Microsoft office
 without the Thunking spooler throwing an error.&nbsp; The adobe issue happens on all pdfs.... ones that I know work in the 32 bit environment.&nbsp; I will try the system file checker but I have my doubts.</p>

<h2>            After Win 10 64 bit install, most video files &#40;.mpeg 2. some .avi and .vob&#41; are seen and played like music files</h2>
                    <p>I only get the audio from mpeg2 files and .vob files don't play at all. They used to play just fine in Win7 32 bit.</p>
<p>****, they even played well in XP. Why is it that the supposedly "new and improved" OS can't even do these simple tasks?<br />
Is there a fix for this besides buying and installing 3rd party software? Is there a "new and improved" version of WMPlayer?</p>
<p>It won't even play a DVD from the drive, which all previous versions of windows were able to do.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e059348-a30e-4bf8-9937-a9197bc8f425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e059348-a30e-4bf8-9937-a9197bc8f425" /></a></p>

            <p>They will play in Wondershare, but with dvd's that have menus, the buttons don't work like they do in WMP.</p>
<p>I can play .vob files in Nero Media Home, but have the same menu problem and mpeg2's still are audio only.</p>
<p>Wondershare at least plays the mpeg 2's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Win 10 Home and it doesn't come with your DVD player. I can add it on for $15.00 but I have not heard anything good about it. I have read dozens of reviews and only one was positive. Everybody seems to hate this product and I am unsure about spending
 the fifteen bucks and end up buying more problems.</p>
<p>My GPU is an EVGA GTX 960 and the driver is version 364.51 released on March 8th.</p>
<p><strong>My biggest question though is why do the video files show as music files in file explorer?</strong> Did you see the screenshot that I attached to the OP?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a big fan of Widows Media Player and it is sad to see that apparently you're fazing it out. I can no longer find it as a standalone app. nor can I find any upgrades. I really don't want the hassle of using a 3rd party app. I want WMP to work like it
 has since the beginning of time. (I started with Win 2000, then XP, then Win 7 and now Win 10)</p>
<p>WMP was (and still is on older machines) a great product. Why doesn't it work now?</p>

            <p>Well I guess nobody cares. It's been a month since my OP and all I've gotten so far is "update my video drivers." My video drivers are always up to date. I am a gamer and have a pretty decent rig. &nbsp;My issue is with Windows Media Player and it always worked
 with older OS and smaller video cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I've read elsewhere you broke WMP in v8.1 WHY? Windows media player is the best player on the market and you screwed it up. Please tell me that you have a fix for this, or at least plan to? Please tell me that I don't have to BUY a useless media
 player from you (see above post) or one of the free ones that are full of adware. Why can't you upgrade WMP to work with Win 10 like it always has since Win 2000? I still have Win 7 Pro on my laptop and WMP works perfectly, I just want to be able to use WMP
 on my main machine which is running Win 10 home 64. Is that so hard???</p>

            <p>Looks like the required video codec is missing in the system, and as a result WMP does only the audio part of the mpeg/vob. To know which codec is required to play those video files, check out:</p>

            <p>No luck. I tried a couple of these and they don't even agree on which codecs are installed. Each tool shows different codecs installed. According to these apps, I have all the codecs installed, even though they don't show the same ones.</p>
<p>All the rest of these options are for Mp4 support which I don't need. Mp4 is the
<strong>ONLY</strong> format that WMP will play.</p>
<p>Why should I have to do all this tech stuff anyway?</p>
<p>Every previous OS from MS contains WMP with all codecs. Win 10 does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WMP is broken. It won't even play a DVD which I have always been able to do. </p>
<p>Even when I right click and select "open with" it doesn't even offer WMP as an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't your devs create a version of WMP which contains all the necessary codecs to work with Win 10?</p>
<p>You can offer it on your download page as a standalone or include it as an update. &nbsp;This is very frustrating that I can't even do the simple stuff that I have been doing for years. BTW, all the 3rd party players &nbsp;that I have checked out either don't work
 well, or are riddled with adware.<br />

<p>If you can upload a small video clip (which WMP doesn't play the video part) to your OneDrive and provide the link, I and test it out myself. BTW,&nbsp;I'm not a Microsoft staff, just a volunteer trying to help.</p>

            <p>Okay.....apparently my problem with mpeg2 files has gone away. They play just fine now, however my .avi files still play as audio only. I tried to upload one to one drive, but it is such a large file that even 15 seconds is 580 mgs and was taking too long
 to upload. I can convert them to mp4 and they will be okay, so I'm not concerned about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue that really bugs me is the inability to play DVD discs or Video_TS files on my computer.</p>
<p>Why was that function taken away? As I said before, I really don't want to add a 3rd party player when WMP used to work just fine. It makes no sense to me that MS would mess up a perfectly good app like that.</p>

<p>I updated the Intel HD Graphics driver for my 64bit HP Notebook running windows 10 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player still does not play either mpg2 or mpg4 format video. These are videos processed using Cyberlink Power Director 14, as supplied with the HP Notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Power Director 14 offers mpg formats for producing video, the related Power Media Player will not play this format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only player that currently works is the<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>free</strong></span> VLC media player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft I'm running your windows 10 dos as supplied with the HP laptop. Surely you can provide drivers that work!! I shouldn't have to look for info on a forum WHAT ARE WINDOWS UPDATES FOR??? It's no wonder you've lost market share.

<br />Try updating to 1809 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

            Hello gthomasmo,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please run Windows Update troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it works. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, try this:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>
</p><p>There is a specific problem that has been identified&nbsp;for older computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is going to sound weird but if you have a Wi-Fi card plugged into your motherboard, it can cause the problem of black screen at 75% lockup. When powered back up the computer continues to the 81% or 82% point then the screen freezes at
 that point.&nbsp; When manually powered down the computer attempts to recover update, fails, and then reverts to the previous version.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What it amounts to is an Anatel Wi-Fi card causes major problems with the Win10 updates since 1607. The easiest workaround is to physically remove the Anatel Wi-Fi card from the computer and then allow the update to run.&nbsp; Just disabling&nbsp;the Wi-Fi
 card in device&nbsp;manager generally does not allow the update to complete. Nor does disabling or removing the driver. A lot of people have solved their&nbsp;update problem by removing the Wi-Fi card physically from the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of people have reported this problem with Acer / Gateway&nbsp;computers but it has been reported on HPs, Asus, and many others. People have reported the device manager identifies the wi-fi as everything from Ralink, Realtec, Asus,
 and others. In my case, the&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Manager identified it as Realtec. After I pulled it out, I saw an Anatel manufacturer&nbsp;sticker on it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if this will help you. I'm just another very frustrated Win10 customer with a Gateway computer. I am currently on Win10 1803 (originally a Win 7). Removing the Anatel Wi-Fi card allowed me to update to this
 point.<br />
</p>
<p>Please read through those threads to see if it might apply to your circumstance.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is odd and it seems like none of the normal answers that are constantly given say that a Wi-Fi card will cause&nbsp;this problem. But lots of people have solved there update issues by removing their Wi-Fi card and then letting the update
 run.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

            <p>Yeah, you're definitely not alone - I've also been having the same issues.&nbsp;I've now&nbsp;had it with
<strong>three</strong> different Windows 8 laptops.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My first two were both HP laptops&nbsp;using AMD graphics cards. But I have since got rid of those two laptops and I am now using an Acer with an NVidia 750M.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On each of these laptops my games ran perfectly with the dedicated cards in Windows 8,&nbsp;but every time I've updated to 8.1 something goes wrong and the games no longer recognise the dedicated card being there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The drivers are all up to date. Windows recognises the graphics cards and says they are running fine - but Windows 8.1 doesn't seem to communicate with the card properly - so the cards haven't been working as they should do.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's a pain, because Windows 8.1 does offer some pretty cool features - but I think I'm now just going to have to go to recovery manager and revert my new laptop back to plain&nbsp;Windows 8. At least then all my programs&nbsp;will run&nbsp;ok.</p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I really apologize for the delay in responding to this thread. Since, you have already updated the graphics card drivers on the computer to their latest
 version and still you face this issue while playing the games, this could be because of the Windows 8.1 introduced changes to mouse input processing for low latency interaction scenarios.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>It has been found that due to this change to mouse input processing in Windows 8.1, the games respond to mouse inputs differently in Windows 8.1 than
 in previous versions of Windows and thus, they hangs and freezes. I would suggest you to refer to the article given below and follow the instructions given in it.</font></font></font></p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried updating from the Hardware manager properties.</p>
<p>And then by the Nvidia website - but both times it said my drivers were up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes it does happen with all games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up rolling back my Windows to the standard Windows 8, because then the graphics cards work fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its got nothing to do with the drivers though it seems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's an issue with Windows 8.1 which seems to prevent switchable graphics from working properly.</p>
<p>Effectively the graphics are working fine and everything, but it just can't communicate with the games, because the Nvidia and/or AMD switchable graphics programs no longer run correctly. (And yes, they are also up to date - Win 8.1 seems to disable them
 for some reason).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is only a problem on Laptops with dedicated cards, because you can't just plug a monitor directly into the graphics card, like on a desktop PC..</p>
<p>Instead the graphics always run via the chipset on the motherboards and software is need to tell the laptop which graphics card (integrated or dedicated) is required.</p>
<p>Win 8.1 stops that communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So desktops or laptops that only have integrated cards won't have this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thing is I cant afford to upgrade to 8.1 now, because I work on a gaming site and need my graphics card to be working.</p>
<p>So I'm not going to update again, until I hear that MS or Nvidia has found a way to solve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers anyway.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you have an I386 folder in your computer (c:\I386)</p>
<p>Just try replace the source path in registry, click on start -&gt; Run &amp; Type -&gt; regedit -&gt; ok</p>
<p>Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; CurrentVersion -&gt; Setup On the right side check for "SourcePath" and put the drive location (For example your I386 folder is in drive c:\i386 then source path will be c:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> jessicacombs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update ruined my computer&#33;</h2>
                    My computer updated from 8.1 to 10 about a month and a half ago and everything was fine. After an automatic update, my HP laptop is no longer able to connect to the internet via wifi. I have "limited connectivity". My husband has tried everything he knows
 to fix the issue and I still cannot connect. We have watched videos on how to fix the issue, we've tried changing the IP and dns, etc. We cannot revert because it has been over 30 days and we do not have a hard copy of the Windows 8 disc that was loaded onto
 the computer at the time of purchase.&nbsp;

<h2>            Fable 3 glitch</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got to aurora in Fable 3 after close to 25 hours of game play. i am on the explore aurora quest and i did just that. i went down to the dock went on the ship and then when getting off the ship i fell of the gangplank, vaulted back up onto the
 land/dock and am now frozen half into the rock. i'm frozen in place in the vaulting pose. i can not do anything except save and quit, which i already tried, which is also the only thing i shouldn't have done apparently as i have been reading through various
 forums. Is there any fix for this? Please help or at least respond for that i can just give up trying. thanks!</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 wireless controller sensitivity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kharrisma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 wireless controller sensitivity</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I picked up an XBox 360 at a yard sale for $25... not a bad find!&nbsp; Works perfectly, but came with only a power cable (and a bunch of games.)&nbsp; I had to get a controller for it; bought it brand new from eBay.&nbsp; It appears to be a genuine Microsoft controller,
 as best I can tell.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the sensitivity of the right stick is just ridiculous!&nbsp; Aiming is a matter of too far one way, then too far the other way; it's almost impossible to achieve any kind of accuracy at all when trying to do things quickly, as in a combat situation.&nbsp;
 I <em>can</em> get it to move very slowly and accurately, but only if I move the stick extremely slowly within a very small amount of stick throw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's this huge dead zone, maybe about a full third of the stick throw (in any one direction), then onscreen movement starts, and within a very small amount of throw it ramps up to full speed (whatever speed I set it for within the game.)&nbsp; The 'speed'
 or 'sensitivity' is functional, and does control the 'full-throw- speed of the stick, but no matter where I set that speed, from minimum to maximum, the overall behavior of the stick is the same: lots of nothing, then an abrupt ramp-up from barely moving to
 full-tilt in a very small amount of stick movement (maybe 10% of the throw, again in one direction, not total one side-to-other side), then the remaining throw is at full speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pulling numbers out of thin air (no real way to measure this,) from neutral, pushing the stick to the left, say: about 40% of stick travel gets nothing, the next 15-20% ramps from very slow to full speed, and the remainder is just at whatever full-speed
 is set for.&nbsp; Hope all this describes it accurately; it's easy to feel/see, not so easy to describe verbally!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after all that, my questions are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.)&nbsp; Is this 'normal' behavior for one of these controllers, and it's just a matter of having to suck it up and get used to it?</p>
<p>2.)&nbsp; Is there any way to expand the 'range of response,' spread it out across more of the throw, so it'd be more like 25% nothing, 50% slow-to-full, and then 25% full speed?&nbsp; Within 'software' or 'settings,' that is.&nbsp; If that makes any sense?&nbsp; That's how
 the sticks on my PS4 controller behave... I just assumed the Xbox controller would be the same (or at least close).</p>
<p>3.)&nbsp; Can this be changed by physically modding the controller?&nbsp; Like, do I have analog sticks, and would changing them to digital sticks improve the situation (or, more likely, make it not work altogether....), or something along those lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just this moment occurred to me that maybe I should be trying to adjust this setting within the Xbox's 'home screen,' somewhere in that menu, rather than trying to do it from within the game?&nbsp; That
<em>would</em> explain the 'faster-but-same-abrupt-ramping' behavior I have now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've long wanted to play some of the games that are 'xbox-only,' and this was such a good chance to do so, and on very short $$... and now this 'unusable-for-all-practical-purposes' controller issue... so any comments/suggestions would be very much appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Gee, thanks for all the feedback.&nbsp; Must be a dead forum by now, with the release of Xbox One.&nbsp; I found my own answer... turns out that there's a 'global' sensitivity adjustment in the 'home screen' of the Xbox, as I suspected might be the case.&nbsp; This controller
 is still weirdly over-sensitive in that most of the usable control is confined to a pretty small percentage of the total throw, but setting the sensitivity to "Low" does seem to increase this percentage to the point that with practice, I can get used to it.&nbsp;
 In time.&nbsp; I thought of a way to visually represent how this stick behaves:&nbsp; &nbsp;0000000000000000123456789101010101010101010101010, with all the leading "0's" being the 'dead zone' off of neutral, the "1-10" being the 'range of control, and the remaining "10's"
 being the rest of the throw which does nothing after reaching full (onscreen) speed.&nbsp; As you can see, in order to use this thing smoothly, you have to 'pre-load' the stick to almost half-tra

            <p>Have you tried looking at the options in-game&nbsp;and turning the sensitivity&nbsp;way down? I haven't had issues with a very sensitive controller before so am not too sure. Also, look for a "deadzone" option in the game settings. The deadzone is what you are describing with the having to move it a certain percent before it activates. This is different between games so maybe try picking up a different game and see if it feels better.&nbsp;</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hey DD666</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for the reply!&nbsp; Yes, at least in the few games I've played on it so far, changing the in-game sensitivity affects only the top speed of the stick, from waaay fast to just fast-ish; it does nothing to expand the useable range of control, which is still confined to that small percentage of total stick throw.&nbsp; Changing the sensitivity @ Xbox home screen seems to expand that range, but there's still a large dead lead-in area and an equally large trailing area of top speed, with the actual control being only a narrow band right between the two.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've seen examples of this in various coding forums, discussing dead-spot implementation to compensate for stick wear, and not returning exactly to dead-center after lots of use... you don't want that slow drift with no stick input, so the dead-zone is an answer to that.&nbsp; There are multiple ways to implement that, though, each with it's own behavioral characteristics... this looks like one of t

<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>In my case I have with cabled controller of the Xbox 360 (borrowed from a friend of mine) and I just happen to buy a wireless one, and I'm having the same problem: the two analogs are impossible to aim (for example, Call of Duty Modern Warfare). And this
 is the second time it happened: I had one that worked well and, since my friend fixed an issue involving the console turning on and off by itself, this began to happen.</p>
<p>Would be this related??</p>

<h2>            DVD drive access denied even though it is not blocked by GPO</h2>
                    In my company, everyone has no access to read/write to removeable storage drives. This is managed by a GPO. There are a few people who are excempt from this and they have another GPO that runs last so that they do have access to it. For some reason, I
 have a user who is excempt but still gets an access denied when trying to access a dvd drive. He has an external usb drive that he can access just fine so I know that the correct policy is being applied. I also checked with rsop.msc to see which policy is
 being applied and the correct one showed up on the list. I have added and removed the user from the policy and still have the error. I am lost as to what else I can do.

<h2>            LOTR Return of the king</h2>
                    
<p>I know that this game plays on the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>I recently bought a classic version of the game, I just need clarifying, can you play "classic" versions of the games on the 360, or is that not possible, because I keep getting 'open tray' whenever I put the disc in. It is fairly scratched, and in doing
 so managed to get my money back, but, all I want to know, is it the disc not being read or because its a "classic".</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>well you should start a new thread instead of bumping one from last summer. &nbsp;and second the info is still the same you need a hard drive made by MS on or in (depending on the 360 you have) to play the old games and it has to be one of the supported games.</p>

<h2>            New user account not visible in C&#58;&#92;Users</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm hoping someone can help me, my OS is Win 7 and after running some updates my wife's user account returned the following message upon start up, just after entering her password: The Group Policy Client service failed the logon. Access is denied. I have
 done some research online and tried to overcome this by using system restore but these attempts failed, both the restore and resolving the issue, I ended up reverting back to a time before the restore. Another suggestion was to create another user and migrate
 all the files across, this seemed to be a solution, until the point where I needed to find the new user I had created, it just didn't appear in c:\Users, there was a reference to the fact that I would need at least 3 users on the system to accomplish this
 transfer which I have, but just to be sure I created yet another user but this didn't appear either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have show hidden files and folders checked (although why these new users should be hidden I don't know).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only users that should be in the file I think are: Administrator, Default, Jim, Public and Verena, yet I have numerous other files some of which I think Xbox created which I cannot delete, this is maybe a permission issue but knowing that doesn't help
 me as I don't know how to get the necessary permission.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am now at a loss as to what I should do, any help would be very gratefully received.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind regards,</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            <p>The folder that you see in the C:\Users folder for a user is that user's "profile".&nbsp; Simply creating a user does not create a profile.&nbsp; After you create that user, you must logon to the computer as that user in order for the folder to be created in the C;\Users
 folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The duplicate "PC-Jim.00x" variant folders would indicate that you have had corrupted profiles in the past and these are "temporary" profiles that yet remain.&nbsp; Corrupted profiles are almost always caused by File System Corruption, so you should perform a
 "Disk Check" operation at your earliest convenience, specifying the "Repair" option,&nbsp;to make sure that your file system is in good shape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Check your Hard Disk for Errors in Windows 7"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2641432/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#68217a">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2641432/en-us</font></a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few things you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual disk check will be performed at your next reboot and executes before Windows fully loads and can't be interrupted
</li><li>The disk check can take upwards of a couple of hours depending on size of disk and amount and type of corruption -- sometimes best performed overnight.&nbsp;
</li><li>Occasionally, with certain types of damage, it can delete files or cause your system to become unbootable -- so make sure your "important" files are backed up before performing this operation. (By definition, though, "Important" files are always backed
 up)</li></ul>
<p>HTH,</p>

            Thank you JW, it has helped enormously I just wish that this had been explained and not taken for granted by the person who posted the reply to the original question, some people are numpties like me and need to have every step explained, however tiresome
 that sometimes seems. Thanks again for your assistance, if I had a gold star you would get it :-)

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern. I will do my best to fix the issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may occur due the printer driver is being out dated. Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run Printer troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>on the search bar and click on
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on&nbsp;<strong>Advanced&nbsp;</strong>on the&nbsp;<strong>Printer troubleshooter</strong>&nbsp;dialog box and click on&nbsp;<strong>Run as administrator</strong>&nbsp;(Enter the credentials if required).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;and follow onscreen instruction complete the&nbsp;<strong>Printer troubleshooter</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persist try the below provided information.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the printer driver and check if this helps in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> and click on <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Locate for the <strong>Print Queues</strong> and expand it.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the <strong>printer</strong> and click on
<strong>uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic printer driver.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the above steps does not help to fix the issue. I suggest you to go to the printer manufacturer website download the latest printer driver and install the same.

            Hi Bill.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you run all Windows Updates until no more are offered?  Did it provide a sound driver?  What is the presently installed Sound Driver's make/model, version and date?  
<br />
<br />Next let's confirm the hardware ID.  From the Sound controller device's Details tab use the drop down menu to choose Hardware ID, right click the long string ID to paste it back here in reply box.  You can also enter it in Google to start your search, carefully avoiding Driver Finder sites unless they provide an actual driver and not trick to install their product.  
<br />
<br />More than 90% of the time there will be a driver.  If not try the Windows 8.1, 8 or 7 drivers in that order, installed in Compatiblity Mode if necessary:  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/80cae5ee-dc98-4a2f-8284-a1ab826059b7/how-to-install-a-hardware-device-driver-using-compatibility-mode?forum=w7itprohardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/win...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I'm not sure why there's no Windows 7 driver listed on the HP webpage for your model here, and the only Windows 8 driver is for IDT instead of Realtek:  <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/HP-Pavilion-p7-Desktop-PC-series/5187022/model/5192622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>.  Try refining the results using your Serial Number off sticker.  
<br />
<br />Of the results I find for long and short string, the most promising is the DriverMax here:  <a href="https://www.drivermax.com/Realtek-High-Definition-Audio-Realtek-HDAUDIO-FUNC-01-VEN-10EC-DEV-0662-SUBSYS-103C2AC2-6_0_1_7304-2014-07-29-397399-driver.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.drivermax.com/Realtek-High-Definiti...</a>
<br />If you cannot get it to download a freestanding installer, then it's OK to install and run DriverMax for it's one free driver a day, then uninstall it after you test it.  That is one of two driver finders that I will allow to be installed for the purpose of finding evasive drivers.

<p>Hi Ghanshyam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update errors can occur if there is a corruption in the update file. We'd like to know the specific error that you're receiving when you tried to update Windows. In the meantime, follow the steps provided in this article to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fix Windows update errors</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also update it offline by downloading the update directly from Microsoft Update Catalog and save it on a flash drive as a .exe file. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/323166/how-to-download-updates-that-include-drivers-and-hotfixes-from-the-win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how you can download the update from the catalog. Once done, you
 can plug your flash drive to your PC, and once the PC runs, the flash drive will do the same as the PC will detect that there is an update.
</p>

<h2>            wifi stuck on verifying and connecting</h2>
                    <p>Hi All!</p>
<p>I'm running windows 10 on a dell pavilion laptop with an intel ac 3160 wifi, probably from 2016.&nbsp; acpi&nbsp; x 64.&nbsp; intel i 5200 at 2.2 GHZ.&nbsp; Not sure what other info you might need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to connect to my home wifi when i have to type in the password. it gets stuck "verifying and connecting".&nbsp; Before I updated the windows 10, i was unable to type in the network key field, but I am able to do so since updating.&nbsp; Not it just gets
 stuck as above.&nbsp; All my other devices (4 computers and several phones/ipads ) all work no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following</p>
<p>updating windows 10...it took a while and was troublesome, but I believe it is up to date.&nbsp; I had to use the media install tool to get the 1803 update installed.</p>
<p>updating the wifi driver</p>
<p>resetting the network</p>
<p>using the network troubleshooting tool on windows 10</p>
<p>unplugging the modem/router (xfinity xb6-t)</p>
<p>restarting the computer several times</p>
<p>
</p><p>the ethernet port works and i can connect by pushing the WPS button on my modem.&nbsp; However, this doesn't help if I need to use a wifi outside my house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My IT friend is suggesting a clean install of windows 10, but I really would rather not have to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your help!!</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Go to those steps, from the Start menu or by pressing the key combination Win + I open the Configuration and click on the option Networks and Internet. Once there, we select the option Status of the left side menu and within the settings and options that are loaded in the right panel we have to look for network restoration.
<br />Clicking on this option will show us a new window from where we will be able to perform the network reset in Windows 10. In this way, all the network adapters will be removed and reinstalled and the original configuration of other components of the network will be re-established. net. This implies that if we were using some software such as a VPN client or virtual switches, we will have to reinstall them.
<br />A process that is carried out automatically by the system by clicking on the Reset button now shown in Network Reset in the Windows 10 configuration. It is normal that the process does not take too long, although we must wait until the end completely and restart the computer again to proceed with the network configuration in Windows 10 as we had until now.

<p>Hi Maritza!</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt reply.&nbsp; I tried this and unfortunately it did not work.&nbsp; I have done this once before as well, also without success.</p>
<p>In addition, I should mention that I tried "forgetting" the network and attempting to rejoin.&nbsp; this also had no impact.&nbsp; I would appreciate any further thoughts...</p>

            Try going back to a previous Windows point to repair.
<br />Follow the steps below to restore your computer to a previous date using a restore point:
<br />
<br />1- Type recovery in the search box of the taskbar and choose Recovery (Control Panel).
<br />2.- Click on Open System Restore.
<br />3.- Click on Next.
<br />4.- Select your restore point, and click Next.
<br />5.- Click on Finish.
<br />
<br />The computer will reboot and present a message on the desktop confirming that the restoration was successful.

    <title>Can&#39;t change gamertag due to billing region - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change gamertag due to billing region</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue with changing my gamertag. Firstly I don't believe I have ever changed it before, but xbox.com is looking to charge me for the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can navigate my way through the change process, but fall down when I put my credit card details in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The form will not allow me to change the region from United States to Australia even though my profile is set to Australia. I tried a shame US address, but even that wouldn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to migrate my account region to Australia to see if that works and am told that I have already migrated my account in the last 12 months - which I have not!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish I could say that this was an isolated incident, but this sums up my experience every time I rub up against a Microsoft web page - 5 minute job becomes hours of frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>On the very bottom left hand corner of the screen, make sure it's set for Australia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the charge, the free change is only available if you were given a randomly generated gamertag when you created your account and are changing that tag for the first time. If you chose your gamertag when you signed up, then you've technically already
 used your free change.&nbsp;</p>
