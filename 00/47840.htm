<h2>            Acer Laptop - Windows 10 not activating</h2>
                    <p>Hi Could someone please answer a question for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario:</p>
<p>&nbsp;My Acer laptop had Win7 Home Premium x64&nbsp;installed with the recovery files stored on the recovery partition, this was upgraded to Win 10 and activated no problems. Now the hard drive has failed and I've replaced it but no longer have the win 7 installation
 media on the new hard drive. I've used the Microsoft Media Creation tool to download the Win10 Home x64 iso and installed windows 10 as a fresh install but&nbsp;it refuses to activate with error code&nbsp;0XC004C003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've rang Microsoft help centre several times to get told the same story, that I have to reinstall Win7 to then upgrade to Win10, which is contrary to what I've been led to believe online. My problem being that I have no way of installing Win7 as I can't
 create the iso media online so now I'm left with a laptop with no operating system at all unless I pay another Â£99 to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Can I do a fresh install of Win10 in this scenario? are the call centre staff correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. What can I do to sort this out?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, I understand your concern and we will try to assist you the best way we can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. What&nbsp;happens when&nbsp;you try to connect the TV tuner?</p>
<p>2. Do you receive any error code/message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you download the&nbsp;latest device driver from the manufacturers website and run it in compatibility mode and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Compatibility Mode:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Right click/tap twice&nbsp;the driver setup file and select
<strong>Properties</strong> then tap or click the <strong>Compatibility tab</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Place a check in the
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>: box. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Try installing the driver/software and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

 isn't working.&nbsp; Want to know why it isn't working??&nbsp; Because of the Windows 10 update that I finally installed, which caused it to stop working.&nbsp; Let's check again: Marvell AVASTAR (slow, but) working prior to Windows 10 upate?&nbsp; Check.&nbsp; Marvell AVASTAR working
 post-Windows 10 update?&nbsp; Nope - not at all...</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSFT needs to do a recall on the Surface Pro 3's affected by these issues.&nbsp; There are way too many people who have fallen into this camp.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When you log in to Skype but don't see the contacts you're expecting to see, it's probably because you're logged in with a different account. Having said that, I strongly suggest you to sign out of Skype, then sign back in using your correct Skype Name,

<p><span>This might be an issue with the USB modem itself or it can also be a network issue. Weâd like to know if there are any other devices connected to your modem.
 If there is another device that can connect to it, then it might only be an issue of the PC and modem's compatibility. However, if all your devices canât connect to your modem, thereâs a possibility that the issue is on the modem itself. If thatâs the case,
 we recommend contacting your modem manufacturer directly as this issue is best handled by them. You might also try contacting your Internet Service Provider if you still donât have data connection after doing all the troubleshooting steps that youâve done.

<h2>            __Icons, start menu, and task bar are missing&#33; </h2>
                    When I turned on my computer &amp; monitor this morning, all of the icons, the start menu, and task bar were missing. Also, when I right click on the mouse, there is nothing. The only way I was able to access the Internet and my Word files was by going through
 Task Manager. HELP! I know I need to get to System Restore, but how can I do that if I can't see anything?

<p>Why do you know you need to get to System Restore?</p>
<p>If you are compelled to try to use System Restore instead of actually fixing your problem, you can launch System Restore using Task Manager (assuming that System Restore is also not afflicted) by entering this into the Task Manager New Task box:</p>
<p>%SystemRoot%\system32\restore\rstrui.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise...</p>
<p>What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<p>Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
Fill in the blank:&nbsp; My system was working fine until: ____________________________________________.</p>
<p>If you only see your background wallpaper image and do not see any desktop icons and no Start button or Taskbar, this usually means that the program explorer.exe is not running (and it needs to be running) or the explorer.exe program is afflicted.&nbsp; A good
 way to think about it is that explorer.exe process "is" your desktop.<br />
<br />
If this is the case there is generally malicious software afoot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes your anti malware program will quarantine (and in effect delete) your explorer.exe file (or other critical XP system files) if it thinks that the file is infected.&nbsp; The file may really be infected, but you can find out for sure and then reconsider
 your anti malware options.<br />
<br />
First, you need to get your desktop working, then you can resolve your potential malware issue.<br />
<br />
From your background image, press CTRL-ALT-DEL and open Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Look at the Processes tab and if the explorer.exe Process is not running, launch it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Click File, New Task and in the Open box enter:<br />
<br />
%windir%\explorer.exe<br />
<br />
Click OK and see if you get your desktop back.<br />
<br />
If explorer.exe is already running in the Processes tab, it is likely the object of the affliction and the file may need to be replaced (which is not difficult).<br />
<br />
If you see that the explorer.exe process is already running in Task Manager, highlight the explorer.exe process then click the End Process button to terminate it, and launch a new explorer.exe process as indicated above.<br />
<br />
If things look okay now, your system is still not fixed, but it should be useable enough so now you can fix it.</p>
<p>Please report back with your findings.</p>

            I've seen a number of reports like this.&nbsp; I assume that you CAN print from other programs, such as your Internet browser.<br />
<br />
What is the make &amp; model of the printer?<br />
<br />
Does "will not print" mean that you are getting blank pages or no pages when you print from WordPad or Notepad?<br />
<br />
If you can't print from ANY program, that's one thing, but if the only programs that aren't printing are WordPad and Notepad (and they print blank pages), the usual cause is that your printer (always a color inkjet of some type) will not print documents that
 are all black &amp; white, but as long as there is some color in the page, the page prints.<br />
<br />
The reason for that is something wrong with the black ink cartridge.&nbsp; Have you recently put in a new black cartridge, and if so, is it not the ink recommended by the printer mfr?<br />
<br />
Or has the printer been sitting unused for a long time?<br />
<br />
Print a test page using the printer's front panel controls.&nbsp; What happens?<br />
<br />
Depending on the make and model of the printer, you might need to (a) run the printer's print head cleaning routine, (b) print a test page, perhaps several times, (c) manually clean the printer's printing head or related parts, (d) insert a new black ink cartridge
 of the recommended type.<br />
<br />

<p>If you get charged $6 a month, you are probably paying for a Skype Number.&nbsp; A Skype Number is an incoming subscription that would be located in the
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/main-page?page=onlineNumber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/main-page?page=onlineNumber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype Number section of your account</a>, if you are signed into the correct account. It includes no outgoing minutes to any country. The number simply
 allows you to receive phone calls from people. Without the number you could only receive inbound Skype calls. If you need to place phone calls you would either need to purchase Skype credit or an outgoing calling subscription that covers a specific area you
 call frequently. Only then would calls be covered, if you dialed a number covered by the subscription.</p>

<h3> willeggleston  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS Smart Gesture not working after update to Win10 - disables touchpad and creates intermittent keyboard , UX303LN Notebook</h2>
                    <p>Seriously?!, &nbsp;Is it not possible for ASUS to get it right. &nbsp;The Smart Gesture was a great feature in Win8.1 but after updating to Win10 not only does the new, most current touchpad drivers (ATK 038 and SmartGesture 406) disable the touchpad completely it
 also disables my keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been on chat sessions an multiple very long calls with ASUS tech support. &nbsp;No solution, no help. &nbsp;I even went back to 8.1 at the recommendation of ASUS tech. &nbsp;Guess what...the old Smart Gesture did not work then either. &nbsp;I am back to Win10. &nbsp;Smart
 Gesture has been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I much prefer the mouse for cursur position and text seletion, &nbsp;the touchpad screen maneuvering is very convenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have any solutions. &nbsp; Otherwise I can think of a gesture for ASUS. &nbsp;I'd like for it to be the "thumbs up" gesture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, i performed both methods from your suggestions. System file check, everything is good. &nbsp;As far as the drivers, yes I did this as well. &nbsp;In fact have been on the phone several time and chat sessions with Asus tech support. &nbsp;They know there is a problem
 but with no resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will probably do a Win10 system reset (keeping my data) but will reinstall my Office apps and outlook.</p>

            <p>Will, from my post I can tell that version V2.2.8 of Smart Gesture (<a href="http://ivanrf.com/en/asus-smart-gesture-and-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the link is in the Notes</a>) worked in an ASUS UX32VD. However, a user with a UX303LB
 say it didn't work for him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try that version, it was released for Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this works for you too, in order to help other users.</p>

            <p>I have an ASUS UX303LB running Windows 10. Everything had worked well until 12/10/2015 when ASUS Smart Gesture stopped working after an automatic Windows 10 update. I was using ASUS touchpad driver v.4.0.5 which I believe was an automatic ASUS driver update.
 They now have v.4.0.9. I uninstalled the previous version and downloaded/installed this version which fixed the problem. Below is the link to the driver download. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>After the Windows 10 anniversary update I found my customized touch-pad driver features disabled. All the features have been disabled automatically and even if I turn them back on they get disabled automatically. Solve this issue with this solution:

<h2>            Family Tree software does not run on Windows 7, Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I use an XP PC for my family tree research and would like to&nbsp;buy a laptop to aid this but the software I use - Family Tree Maker 2006 - does not have a windows 7 patch and Family Tree Maker say they have no intention of creating one, too much work for them
 apparently. &nbsp;I have purchased and tried the newer versions of FTM which do work on Windows 7 but do not like them.&nbsp; Can I buy a Windows 7 laptop and "swap" Windows&nbsp;7 for XP? Do I have any other options?&nbsp; Do I have to buy a second hand XP laptop?&nbsp; I also use
 a canon LIDE60 scanner which also does not seem to have a Windows 7 upgrade. Any advice would be great.</p>

            <p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface pro 3 boot up in a red Screen - switching to the new installed Windows 10 Pro. System running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the problem is the bios, where you can`t switch any more to the boot device:</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS Setup:</p>
<p>If I try to select Windows key to install, the System told me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"secure variable update is looked down"</p>
<p>try it with next boot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>so you can`t write/reconfigure the bios to come up in USB boot mode - even it is selected USB - &gt; SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>A boot from USB device is actual not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I can*t make a clone of my System, because USB boot is not possible any more since the new Installation of WINDOWS 10 PRO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>do you know a way, to start with bios Standard Default Settings??</p>
<p>

                    I am currently using Windows 10 and have been using my PC with an Ethernet cord to access the internet connection for my student housing, then turning it into a hotspot so I can use my iPhone since my building doesn't receive WiFi. However, I went away
 for the weekend and when I returned, my mobile hotspot has failed to work. The internet on my computer works just fine when plugged into the Ethernet cable, and I am able to turn on my hotspot as I have before, but when I try to connect my phone it says that
 the network has no internet connection. I have tried everything from updating drivers to changing my firewall settings (which I am unable to do since my firewall is controlled by McAfee). It is also not just my phone, I have tried multiple devices and nothing
 will connect to the hotspot. I am very confused as to why this would happen suddenly after my laptop had been powered down for the whole weekend. I have restarted my phone and laptop multiple times but nothing seems to help. My m

<p>
</p><p><span>If your user account in the old Windows 8.1 device is a Microsoft user account and if you sign in to Surface 2 with the same Microsoft account (the same Microsoft email address), then the restriction s will be still applicable. If you
 use a different Microsoft account address to sign in to the Surface 2 device, or if you use a local account (not connected to Microsoft account) then the restrictions applied in the other device wonât be applicable in Surface 2 device.</span></p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them&#34; error message on running SFC scan on Windows 10 PCs.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: System File Checker reports recent corruption</p>
<p>
</p><p>I administer 3 different Windows 10 Pro 64-bit PCs and a&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit PC in different locations around the UK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run the following on these PCs every couple of weeks:</p>
<p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just run Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth and it reports:</p>
<p>No Component Store Corruption detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on all 3 Windows 10 Pro 64-bit PC, sfc /scannow is now reporting:</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some<br />
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For<br />
example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not<br />
supported in offline servicing scenarios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and I cannot resolve this issue. On 1 PC, I performed an In-Place Upgrade and&nbsp;sfc /scannow is still reporting the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know why this is suddenly occuring on ALL my Windows 10 Pro 64-bit PCs, all at the same time and if there is anyway of fixing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit PC does not exhibit any problem when running the System File Checker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone able to shed some light on what is going on with Windows 10 Pro here and know how I can proceed?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Avant,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur due to the third party application installed or some of the unused/unwanted files present on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Along with <strong>
Sumit Dhiman2</strong>âs suggestion, follow the methods below and check if either helps in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Boot the computer in
<strong>Clean boot</strong> and check if the issue is caused due to any of the third party applications installed in the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting the system in
<strong>Clean boot</strong> will enable the PC to start using minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows
 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the section
<strong>How to perform a clean boot </strong>for <strong>Windows 10</strong> from the link below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></strong></a></p>

<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</span></strong>from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, run
<strong>check disk</strong> commands by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows Key + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select <strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong> option.
</span></li><li><span>Type in the command prompt,
<strong><span>CHKDSK /Z </span></strong>and press
<strong>ENTER </strong>to scan the disk <strong><span>(</span></strong><strong><span>Z is the drive which you want to perform check disk command on</span></strong><strong><span>)</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>After the scan is complete, check for the status of the scan. Perform the same on all the drives installed in the PC.</span></li><li><span>If the scan is success close the window and check if the changes are effective.<br />
<br />
</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong><span> The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does,
 then press Y to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform <strong>chkdsk</strong>.<br />
Once <strong>chkdsk</strong> completes, boot to the desktop and then check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> While performing
<strong>chkdsk</strong> on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>

            <p>Often SFC will report a false positive.&nbsp; One such false positive is nvidia's opendll.dll which sfc reports but is in fact not corrupt.&nbsp; DISM compares the actual drivers with what is in the windows store (Winsxs folder) and 3rd party driver developers often
 store them elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both SFC &amp; DISM should not be run <em>prophylactically</em> as there is a slight chance of damaging a critical system file in their use.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have now interrogated the CBS.log file and there were references to Avast (free antivirus) C runtime files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After contact with Avast Forum/Support, I have been advised to remove the software and all references to Avast files, folders registry keys etc. especially from the C:\Windows\WinSXS folder. This is now done, however, when I run sfc, I still get:</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some<br />
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For<br />
example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not<br />
supported in offline servicing scenarios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and the CBS.log still references Avast runtime files. See the CBS.log&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=92FBEE98F62A7D95!206743&amp;authkey=!AK9QmukRP92I0HQ&amp;ithint=file%2clog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on removing the references to Avast would be much appreciated. TIA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, DISM and SFC were run initially as advised by Microsoft support due to the&nbsp;PCs having&nbsp;performance issues, which&nbsp;were&nbsp;related to&nbsp;Avast antivirus. Now that Avast has been removed the performance issues have gone away.</p>

<p>I do not see how this article helps me. DISM has been run several times and always reports:</p>

<p>
</p><p>A good idea in theory, one which I have already tried. Unfortunately though,&nbsp;the Avast utility you refer to (avastclear.exe), does not completely remove Avast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted on the <a href="https://forum.avast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Avast Free/Pro/IS/Premier">
Avast WEBforums</a>&nbsp;and some progress has been made on this issue. I am now waiting on a beta release from Avast,&nbsp;which hopefully resolves the sfc corruption.</p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>4 . From my new Windows 8 books, I learned that I could safely create more hard disk space on the 60 GB hard disk. I had done the following:</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>4a In computer properties of drive C: , I switched on the compression of files and I switched off the "index content" which collects info's for the internal computer search engine.</font></font></font></span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span>formed automatically. I could restore the program, but only in safe mode.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>7 A secret for using system restore points is to use the safe mode when there are more than a few programs, I had done it this way in safe mode also for very
<span>&nbsp;</span>many years with Windows Vista.</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span>9 My situation now is: I do have 11 GB free hard disk space on my 60 GB hard disk for the operating system Windows 8. The free hard disk space fluctuates only between

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Defragmentation, use of Windows Word, Adobe Flash player for videos.
</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>14 I have also tested several times with Norton antivirus and anti hacker Norton Internet Security 2013 always updated. Norton Internet Security could not find anything.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>I<span>&nbsp; </span>had also used a registry cleaner. It had no effect.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>15 There are many people who do write on Internet forums<span>&nbsp;
</span>on the losing of SRPs (System Restore Points) <span>&nbsp;</span>on Windows 8. Some users even write that they do have very much space on the operating system Windows 8 hard disk (e.g.<span>&nbsp;
</span>40 GB free hard disk space) and nevertheless the SRPs are disappearing after some days. These people are watching when the SRPs disappear and then think that they have found the reason. I think that they have not found the reason and that it is by chance
 and that there must be another reason.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>16 There must be something which does use very much hard disk space or there is something else which does delete all the SRP all at the same time

 yet be stable enough.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>17 I also thought about why not save the SRPs on another hard disk where there is much more space. But I think this is not possible, because one cannot copy and recopy the points. Why does Microsoft not give the possibility
 to save the SRPs (system restore points) on another hard disk?</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>18 For very many years<span>&nbsp; </span>(at last with Windows Vista) the system restore points were really very useful and quick and easy to use for me. It was important to have not only one system restore point, but
 many SRPs (system restore points), to find the time when the defect was not on the computer.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Backup and Restore <span>&nbsp;</span>are <span>&nbsp;</span>more complicated and less reliable.</font></font></font></span><br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Several &nbsp;times in the past with my old computer Windows Vista, hackers had switched off or destroyed the Internet Security on my computer. The Norton Internet Security finds almost all hackers, but in some cases also not or only

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>19 I also thought that perhaps Microsoft has to leave a backdoor open for the NSA (National Security Agency ) -people. With a system restore point one could easily get the NSA people out again. Perhaps therefore the
 SRPs do no longer work because Microsoft is not allowed to make SRPs (system restore points)
<span>&nbsp;</span>function correctly. Then however also one cannot get the other hackers and defects<span>&nbsp;

<p>I had the same problem&nbsp; - System Restore points were being deleted after a reboot, and Volsnap errors were logged in the System event log. Here's how I fixed it:</p>
<p>1: Open a command prompt</p>
<p>2: Type Vssadmin list shadowstorage</p>
<p>3: Take note of what the shadow storage allocation is on the drive you're having issues with, in my case it was C: and the allocation was 18GB.</p>
<p>4: Change the allocation by using the Vssadmin command, syntax:&nbsp;<em>vssadmin resize shadowstorage /On=C: /For=C: /Maxsize=1G (where Maxsize=the amount of disk space you've allocated to System Restore points. In my case it was 20 GB<br />
</em></p>
<p>5: In the case of the C: drive, the syntax would be VSSAdmin resize shadowstorage /On=C: /For=C: /Maxsize =20G</p>
<p>This worked for me, after increasing the size and rebooting my restore points were still intact and no longer being deleted.</p>

<p>4: Change the allocation by using the Vssadmin command, syntax:&nbsp;<em>vssadmin resize shadowstorage /On=C: /For=C: /Maxsize=1G (where Maxsize=the amount of disk space you've allocated to System Restore points. In my case it was 20 GB<br />
</em></p>
<p>5: In the case of the C: drive, the syntax would be VSSAdmin resize shadowstorage /On=C: /For=C: /Maxsize =20G</p>
<p>This worked for me, after increasing the size and rebooting my restore points were still intact and no longer being deleted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Hi Dave,</span></p>
<p><span>thank you for your information!</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried it out. For Windows 8, first I had to find in my books how to access as a super administrator the Vssadmin list shadowstorage. With it, I could change the size of the maximum allowed disk space of C: to double the size compared to before.</span></p>
<p><span>I now have changed the size of the allowed disk space to 2%(double of before), as you suggested. I see how long the system restore points do last.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In general, my system restore points do <span>&nbsp;</span>last for about 3 days. At the beginning of the 3rd day, they are still there, but at the end of the 3rd day, they had been deleted automatically. In general,<span>&nbsp;
</span>the system restore points of my computer are<span>&nbsp; </span>deleted though there is much more allowed disk space than is needed for them.</span></p>
<p><span>Many people on the Internet forums do write that it is something new, that the system restore points of Windows are on the computer for some days and then disappear automatically. These people do say that at former times, the system restore points
 had not disappeared automatically after some days after they were on the computer for some days. This is also my experience.</span></p>
<p><span>Today the system restore points on my computer had lasted for 4 days without being deleted.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>An alternative on Windows 8 for setting the maximum allowed disk space for system restore points: Clicking on 'Configure'.</span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Windows 8, 64, PC: All system restore points disappear all at the same time<span>&nbsp;
</span>after about 3 days.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>1 <span>&nbsp;</span>I had bought <span>&nbsp;</span>my new computer PC Windows 8. It has two hard disks: C: 60 GB (57.9GB) solid state flash for the operating system and<span>&nbsp;
</span>D: 2 TB for data, main memory is <span>&nbsp;</span>16 GB. <span>&nbsp;</span>I have tried to use my new computer since<span>&nbsp;
</span>July 2013. </font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>On my new computer, I do only use one operating system Windows 8.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span>I<span>&nbsp; </span>could not use my new computer, though I am using Windows computers for 20 years and I have done all the software things myself.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>2 Therefore I bought 4 very big Windows 8 books (about
<span>&nbsp;</span>1000 pages each) and two smaller normal Windows 8 books (about 320 pages).</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>3 The problem was that the hard disk 60 GB was always filling up itself completely
<span>&nbsp;</span>without me adding anything.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>After half an hour of watching TV on my new computer there was
<span>&nbsp;</span>4 GB less free space on my 60 GB hard disk. Otherwise <span>&nbsp;</span>the computer also was filling up completely the 60 GB. I did defragment
<span>&nbsp;</span>then and deleted temporary files, etc. But after 1 to 2 days, the 60 GB were filled up again. It was as if Windows 8 could not delete files. This has changed
<span>&nbsp;</span>I think because of a Microsoft update. The 60 GB hard disk no longer fills itself up, i.e. now the free space on the hard disk remains the same.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>4 . From my new Windows 8 books, I learned that I could safely create more hard disk space on the 60 GB hard disk. I had done the following:</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>4a In computer properties of drive C: , I switched on the compression of files and I switched off the "index content" which collects info's for the internal computer search engine.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>4b I uninstalled all the Windows applications except
<span>&nbsp;</span>Desktop, Internet Explorer and Shop.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>5<span>&nbsp; </span>I used only as few programs as absolutely necessary, which are current versions of my old Windows Vista computer programs.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>6 One program which could not be uninstalled, I uninstalled but good luck a system restore point had just
<span>&nbsp;</span>formed automatically. I could restore the program, but only in safe mode.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>7 A secret for using system restore points is to use the safe mode when there are more than a few programs, I had done it this way in safe mode also for very
<span>&nbsp;</span>many years with Windows Vista.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>8 Because of my books on Windows 8, I could also find<span>&nbsp;
</span>the safe mode of <span>&nbsp;</span>Windows 8.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span>9 My situation now is: I do have 11 GB free hard disk space on my 60 GB hard disk for the operating system Windows 8. The free hard disk space fluctuates only between
<span>&nbsp;</span>10.9 GB and 11.8 GB.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>10 I do use the system restore points only on my 60 GB operating system hard disk, but not on the other 2TB hard disk.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>11 My problem now is that all the system restore points disappear all at the same time after about 3 days.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>12 I can manually install 13 system restore points and all the 13 system restore points remain on my computer
<span>&nbsp;</span>for about 3 days and then all of a sudden all the system restore points (SRP)
<span>&nbsp;</span>have <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>all at the same time disappeared. The 13 SRPs take 520,38MB of 593,04MB the 1%.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>13 I have tried to find out why the SRPs
<span>&nbsp;</span>do disappear all of a sudden and all at the same time. I have found several possibilities but when I have checked these possibilities they all could not delete
<span>&nbsp;</span>the SRPs. I could NOT delete the SRPs by using the following:</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Defragmentation, use of Windows Word, Adobe Flash player for videos.
</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>14 I have also tested several times with Norton antivirus and anti hacker Norton Internet Security 2013 always updated. Norton Internet Security could not find anything.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Several <span>&nbsp;</span>times in the past with my old computer Windows Vista, hackers had switched off or destroyed the Norton Internet Security on my computer.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>I<span>&nbsp; </span>had also used a registry cleaner. It had no effect.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>15 There are many people who do write on Internet forums<span>&nbsp;
</span>on the losing of SRPs (System Restore Points) <span>&nbsp;</span>on Windows 8. Some users even write that they do have very much space on the operating system Windows 8 hard disk (e.g.<span>&nbsp;
</span>40 GB free hard disk space) and nevertheless the SRPs are disappearing after some days. These people are watching when the SRPs disappear and then think that they have found the reason. I think that they have not found the reason and that it is by chance
 and that there must be another reason.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>16 There must be something which does use very much hard disk space or there is something else which does delete all the SRP all at the same time
<span>&nbsp;</span>after about 3 days. I remember that in the beginning after watching TV for 30 minutes on my Windows 8 computer, there was 4 GB less space on my hard disk, but Microsoft update no longer makes this shown. The solid state flash hard disk may not
 yet be stable enough.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>17 I also thought about why not save the SRPs on another hard disk where there is much more space. But I think this is not possible, because one cannot copy and recopy the points. Why does Microsoft not give the possibility
 to save the SRPs (system restore points) on another hard disk?</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>18 For very many years<span>&nbsp; </span>(at last with Windows Vista) the system restore points were really very useful and quick and easy to use for me. It was important to have not only one system restore point, but
 many SRPs (system restore points), to find the time when the defect was not on the computer.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Backup and Restore <span>&nbsp;</span>are <span>&nbsp;</span>more complicated and less reliable.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>19 I also thought that perhaps Microsoft has to leave a backdoor open for the NSA (National Security Agency ) -people. With a system restore point one could easily get the NSA people out again. Perhaps therefore the
 SRPs do no longer work because Microsoft is not allowed to make SRPs (system restore points)
<span>&nbsp;</span>function correctly. Then however also one cannot get the other hackers and defects<span>&nbsp;
</span>out of Windows 8.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>20 I have written all this letter and<span>&nbsp;
</span>my 13 SRP( system restore points) are still on my hard disk. I still want to test whether the system restore points disappear when my computer is online on the Internet or when my computer<span>&nbsp;
</span>is offline not on the Internet.</font></font></font></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I think I have solved the problem of <span>&nbsp;</span>the disappearing system restore points (SRPs).</span></p>
<p><span>Before the time of Windows 8, the settings for the system restore points(SRP) were done by Windows automatically (5%), except when there was
<span>&nbsp;</span>an expert knowledge of the user.</span></p>
<p><span>Now with Windows 8, users<span>&nbsp; </span>have to do the settings of the SRPs themselves. This is done when on Windows 8, you click on 'Configure'.</span></p>
<p><span>Before the time of Windows 8, Windows (as e. Windows Vista),set an SRP to 5% of the hard disk space.</span></p>
<p><span>A system restore point(SRP) does not save all the system files at the making of the SRP.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>A SRP does only save the changes of the system files<span>&nbsp;
</span>since the making of the SRP. Therefore an <span>&nbsp;</span>SRP gets bigger (more MBs and more GBs) the longer it stays on the computer and the more programs are installed and uninstalled, including Microsoft updates, also the more desktop symbols are added.
 When you<span>&nbsp; </span>use an SRP for restoring to a former state of the system files,<span>&nbsp;
</span>the changes of the system files are deleted and the state at the making of an SRP is restored.</span></p>
<p><span>Also on Windows 8, you can also see which programs are saved on one SRP.</span></p>
<p><span>It is important that SRPs do have enough hard disk space. Else all SRPs may disappear often. When the SRPs do not have enough hard disk space, the oldest SRPs disappeared at first.
<br />
When there is only one SRP which gets bigger and bigger and when it does not have enough space, it simply disappears and there is no SRP left.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>On Windows 8, you can easily choose the disk space for an SRP by clicking on 'Configure'.</span></p>
<p><span>In my case, on one SRP, I do have two programs installed and two programs uninstalled and one Microsoft update. The SRP uses
<span>&nbsp;</span>2.32GB after 8 days (constantly increasing from 1.01GB to 2.32GB). An SRP does need more space than the 2.32GB, i.e. for the making and lasting. Therefore I have configured my<span>&nbsp;
</span>SRPs <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to 5% (2.90GB), the classic 5% of before the time of Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>The big problem is the new solid-state drive (SSD) or I call it the solid-state-flash hard disk.</span></p>
<p><span>SSD = former hard disk<span>&nbsp; </span>( in function)</span></p>
<p><span>The SSD is a successor to the former hard disk. There are no moving parts in an SSD, but in a hard disk there are moving parts. 'Solid state' devices<span>&nbsp;
</span>are also known for decades by radio amateurs.</span></p>
<p><span>An SSD is used instead of the classical hard disk because it is quicker, but an SSD<span>&nbsp;
</span>also does have big disadvantages.</span></p>
<p><span>My <span>&nbsp;</span>2.90GB(5%) is very much for the now only 9.0GB free space on my SSD, where the operating system Windows 8 is. But else the SRPs do not work. The disadvantage is that I cannot install many programs on the only little space left on my
 SSD 60GB (57.9GB). Perhaps Microsoft in the course of time, makes Windows 8 use less SSD<span>&nbsp;
</span>space, so that I can install more programs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>I had read about<span>&nbsp; </span>installing programs also on my DATA 2 TB hard disc, but there are risks involved when installing programs (when possible at all) on the data
<span>&nbsp;</span>hard disk of 2 TB, especially when installing Windows 8 anew. Perhaps use a virtual machine.</span></p>
<p><span>For saving for a longer time, a good configuration of an operating system on an SSD , you do need a backup and restore program and an external hard disk. I have started to<span>&nbsp;
</span>use the <span>&nbsp;</span>Paragon Hard Disk Manager 12 Professional ( for it <span>
&nbsp;</span>for Windows 8 you need registering and then downloading after buying the box version). I do not use 'differential' and I do not use 'incremental' because of another program from another company I had before.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>For longer time securing, I do use copying the DATA hard disk files (Tera Copy) to external hard disks, DVDs, etc. I may also try using SuperCopier and Ultracopier.</span></p>
<p><span>I do not use only backups for DATA,because</span></p>
<p><span>first when I need to use a new computer because the old computer is too defective, I would lose the files,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>second I have found that at least some backup programs are not reliable at all with restoring,.</span></p>
<p><span>third <span>&nbsp;</span>because the data may be easily accidentally deleted (mirror image),
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>P.S.: I had found in an journal article from January 2013, that the author does not recommend SRPs, because<span>&nbsp;
</span>SRPs do write much on an SSD, and writing much on an SSD is not good for an SSD. Also that<span>&nbsp;
</span>you should not make too many backups of SSDs because the backups are also not good for an SSD.</span></p>
<p><span>The SSDs are quicker than the traditional hard disks, especially when only using a few programs.</span></p>
<p><span>I<span>&nbsp; </span>prefer the old type of hard disk for an operating system, though it took more than 4 minutes for starting Windows Vista. However
<span>&nbsp;</span>I could have used very many more programs and <span>&nbsp;</span>SRPs were no problem. But nowadays computers are only sold with an SSD for the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>On Windows 8, there are still the many<span>&nbsp; </span>folders for<span>&nbsp; </span>
DATA on the operating system SSD, but I have put all data as much<span>&nbsp; </span>as possible away from the SSD and onto<span>&nbsp;
</span>the DATA hard disk.</span></p>
<p><span>It is said that it not easily possible to put<span>&nbsp; </span>an SSD out of a new computer and put instead<span>&nbsp;
</span>an old hard disk into a new bought computer.</span></p>

<br />
Thank you very much for the info. I have looked how it does function.&nbsp; System File Check (SFC) seems to be similar to the sytem cleaning of Windows 8. Useful to know the 'clean boot' method when I do have a problem in the future.<br />

<p><span>Hi Kurtis,</span></p>
<p><span>I do not know your computer and how much hard disk space your computer does have.</span></p>
<p><span>It looks to me, that you do not have enough hard disk space on you drive C: . With C: , I mean the hard disk on which you operating system Windows 8 is installed.</span></p>
<p><span>In this case, I would do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>On the right side of your desktop where you switch off you computer, there is the word 'set'. When you click on it, above there is the word 'system steering'. When you click on it, there are the words: 'System
 and Security'. When you click on it, below there<span>&nbsp; </span>is the word 'Administration'. Part of this is 'Release Space'. Then 'Cleaning' 'Boot (C:)', click on OK. Files to be deleted. I do click on all except 'Downloaded programs'. Then I do
 click on OK. Result: There is more free disk space on your hard disk C: (in GB or MB).</span></p>
<p><span>I repeat:<span>&nbsp; </span>
set, system steering, system and security, administration, release space, cleaning boot C:, OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You do not need to click on systems cleaning, it does not matter much but your system restore points are also deleted by this.</span></p>
<p><span>The words I use<span>&nbsp;
</span>to be clicked on are translated from my German language computer, so the words may be a little bit different on your English language computer.</span></p>
<p><span>The second step, is to create as much as possible free disk space on your hard disk Boot C:.
</span></p>
<p><span>On the (Windows) Explorer <span>
&nbsp;</span>choose Drive C: <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>. <span>&nbsp;</span>Click on C: while using the right key of your mouse. Then click on 'properties'. Then you see a blue and red graphics. It also shows how much hard disk space on your computer is used.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>There then make a cross x in front of 'compress drive'. Below: Delete the cross x before indicate properties of files. Then you do hear the computer running for some time. The consequence:
 There is more space on the hard disk C:.</span></p>
<p><span>Then put as many data files from
<span>&nbsp;</span>C: to your data file hard disk. These data may be downloaded programs, videos, or self written texts.</span></p>
<p><span>Then uninstall all programs except the most important ones. This also creates space. On my other texts here,
<span>&nbsp;</span>I have written which programs to choose for it.</span></p>
<p><span>On another forum on the Internet I have read that Windows 8.1 does take about 10 GB less space than Windows 8. So there would be not such a problem with too little hard disk space on C: . For my computer, I
 do wait still until I use Windows 8.1, because, I think there will be improvements just at the beginning of a new operating system. I also read from the same source of the other Internet forum, that Windows 8.1 only needs 8GB free hard disk space.</span></p>
<p><span>By creating space on your hard disk C: , you do have space for Windows Updates and space for the system restore points. On my other texts here, I have written more about the system restore points on Windows
 8.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>You may also first start Windows 8 anew with the recovery disk of Windows 8 or similar, but your data have to be saved first because they would be deleted with a new installation of Windows 8 and you have to write down the names of your programs.<br />
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I have also read many years ago that when you start using Windows, you have to activate Windows on the Internet once at the beginning, also when you do not use Windows on the Internet. Without activating Windows, Windows would&nbsp; stop working after some

<h3> jg1j  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Store crashes when I try to open it. WSReset and sfc &#47;scannow don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>So I installed a new 1TB HDD on my PC and was organizing some files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my other 500GB HDD I wanted to delete some files but it said I needed the permission of SYSTEM to delete, so I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPs-1IgztbU</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't work so I dived into the file and found out it had Forza Motorsport 6: Apex (Beta) files there, which I previously had uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then decided I wanted to re-install Forza 6 but my store crashed when the blue back ground and loading symbol ( white dotted circles ) appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WSReset via run, sfc /scannow via the command line with administrator previleges, reverifying my account via settings and installing Windows' Updates proved ineffective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this problem earlier but was fixed with sfc /scannow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using this command didn't work via Powershell with administrator previleges: </p>
<p><span>Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsStore_11609.1001.29.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml"
 -DisableDevelopmentMode</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Nor did this one : &amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I wasn't able to delete this file C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache and found out that one of the files I was trying to delete had the exact same appearence like so:</p>

    <title>CPU throttling due to intelppm - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oliver253  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU throttling due to intelppm</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded an existing 64-bit Windows 7 installation to Windows 10 on a Thinkpad X200s a few weeks ago, and so far it has been working great, except for an anomaly I encountered. I usually put the laptop to sleep in the evening and wake it up in the morning,
 but today everything was literally crawling after resuming from sleep, switching between applications or opening the start menu took ages, there were no signs of overheating, the mouse cursor was moving along smoothly and finally getting the task manager to
 open showed the CPU running at around 0,2 GHz. A restart didn't help, booting up and getting to a usable desktop took several minutes, worse than having a slow mechanical HDD, though it worked fine in safe mode, so it's not a hardware problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some experimenting I found&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/intel-power-management-driver-slows-computer-to-a/fe4db7ad-169d-48ec-b8ce-70a076d6afda">this thread</a>,
 and although it was referring to Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 TP, disabling the intelppm service on startup helped, as the CPU clock is back to normal, 1.86 on a Core 2 Duo SL9400.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Lenovo system update and Intel driver update utility after the upgrade, but I haven't changed or updated anything for at least several days, other than Windows updates, so it's a mystery how the problem appeared after resuming from sleep.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be possible causing this behavior? I'm going to try re-enabling the Intel power management driver, when I'm feeling adventurous enough, is there anything else I should consider?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the reply, I tried both suggestions, no change, and I think it's a hardware error after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the intelppm driver disabled, the laptop shuts down every now and then, mostly under load, the event log simply states that the previous system shutdown was unexpected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, open Hardware Monitor is showing one CPU core running at around 100 degrees Celsius, with very little relation to load, while the other core is between 40 to 70 degrees depending on the load. The laptop itself is cool to touch, the BIOS-controlled
 fan is running quietly most of the time and I've cleaned the heatsink, changed the thermal paste some time ago, so I assume it's a sensor malfunction.</p>

</p><p>I assume the shutdowns are caused by the incorrect temperature reading, does this happen on a hardware level, or is there any way of disabling it in Windows? I have the latest BIOS, and there are no such options.</p>

<h2>            Solitaire has disappeared on Win 7 laptop and I only have solitaire.lnk file now.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have Win 7 on my laptop and had used the "Turn Windows Features On" in order to get Solitaire to work after I couldn't find it post-install.&nbsp; Started up and played a few games fine.&nbsp; However, now I come back a few days later and all I have is a Solitaire.lnk
 file, and also several versions / locations of Solitaire.exe.mui all over my hard disk.&nbsp; What can I do to get it back and clean things up?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

            <p>Hi RJ Fleener,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the methods listed below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>Letâs first try opening the game(s) from the source folder (Program Files) and check what happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Navigate to the following location on your hard disk:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try and open the game(s) and check what happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>Disable and enable the games using the âTurn Windows features on or offâ feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Turn Windows features on or off</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Uncheck Games and restart the computer to disable the games. Re-check the same and restart to enable the games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:
</b>Perform System File Checker (SFC) scan on your computer. SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following article for more information on using SFC tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files:</p>

<p>
</p><p>New Data</p>
<p>My Hotmail account came up with error number 0x86000112</p>
<p>This number could not be found but Microsoft did leave a clue (Too Many Folders)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only had 113 folders in my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>This I reduced by 44</p>

<p>Then</p>
<p>I have two machines running windows 10 </p>
<p>on 1 My mail &nbsp;app opens for about 5 seconds and then crashes</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried sfc/scannow from an administrative command prompt and running the Windows store App troubleshooter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>to no avail.</p>
<p>Then from System Protection under system in Control Panel</p>
<p>and System Restore I selected the 29.08.2015 restore point (Note on one machine I had to disable Internet security and my Firewall to carry out any changes first)</p>
<p>After the reboot&nbsp;the mail App worked again.</p>

<p>Mail still seems to be working.</p>

</p><p>Through all this trauma with Windows 10 Mail App Windows Live Mail continued to perform wonderfully as usual.</p>
<p>Why did Microsoft reinvent the wheel!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last problem on one machine with the Mail App was the Folder Structure which still had my original 113 Folders and some of their content and this structure did not update to reflect the fact that I had removed 48 folders.</p>

            excuse what's probably a stupid question from a novice. Once uninstalled, do i have to reinstall calendar if I don't use it i.e. are there any other programmes dependent upon on it? thanks

            I have been trying to find the cause of my 100% disk usage for 2 months now. so after I uninstalled mail (separate problem) i checked my usage again and it's finally reduced. Thank you

            <p>Hi - I got the same message as above, perhaps I am not typing the command correctly? Are there spaces required&nbsp;between each part of the command?</p>
<p>
