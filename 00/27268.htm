<h2>            Build 11082. WIN10 Update is looping wioth one particular fix</h2>
                    <p>WIN10 is looping. Went to check for updates manually, and each time it checks for updates, it is looping with the one fix. See attached screen shot. It appears to find and install the same fix. Have stopped/started the system. No change.</p>
<p>Any ideas??</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay in replying. On 1/13, installed Insider Build 11099 (I was on Build 11082). Problem still exists. The C++ update installs itself 4-6 times and then stops. However, almost immediately, it starts all over again, the C++ fix appears as an
 update waiting to be installed...it then loops all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an earlier suggestion to manually install the C++ fix.&nbsp; I will give this a try, although it's been so long since I've have had to manually install a fix that I've forgotten how to do it...could you please send some instructions!!!</p>

            Hello philipjones7,
<br />
<br />I understand that you are feeling very anxious because you have received a threatening email demanding you to update or your account would be disabled.
<br />
<br />Without any context, I cannot definitively conclude anything. Can you check if the sender address is from @accountprotection.microsoft.com or other official domains? (See: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10636/microsoft-account-trust-email-from-account-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10636/...</a>)
<br />
<br />Do not interact with the email but just hover your mouse over to any links in the email. Do the links contain suspicious URLs like m1cr0s0ft.com?

<h2>            HyperX 7.1 Audio Devices and Windows 10 Pro &#40;64 bit&#41; versions 1703 and 1709</h2>
                    <p>A recent Google Search of HyperX 7.1 Audio and Windows 10 revealed that Gamers using USB Audio Headphones with Boom Microphones are having great difficulty getting their Hardware to communicate properly with a PC in a Windows 10 environment.&nbsp; I have, by
 persistent experimentation, discovered a plan-of-action to get HyperX 7.1 Audio Hardware to install properly on a PC running Windows 10 Pro versions 1703 and 1709.&nbsp; The technique is very simple:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Unplug the USB Headphones from the USB Port.</li><li>Use the Device Manager to assess devices and drivers in two categories:</li><li>"Audio inputs and outputs"</li><li>"Sound, video and game controllers"</li><li>Uninstall all devices and drivers that are superfluous to what actually needs to be used in those two categories<br />
</li><li>Perform a System Restart</li><li>Use the Device Manager to ascertain which devices and drivers that were previously uninstalled the System has restored</li><li>Disable all of the System restored devices and drivers</li><li>Perform another System Restart</li><li>Login to the PC</li><li>Allow the Startup Manager time to completely activate the PC to fully awake</li><li>Then Plug the USB Headphones into a USB slot</li><li>In around 10 or 15 seconds the OS will notify the user that HyperX 7.1 Audio is installed</li><li>Use the Sound app available by Rt+Clicking the Volume Icon on the right side of the Task Bar to configure (Playback Devices &amp; Recording Devices) to the user's needs</li></ol>

            I want to describe in more detail, the circumstances under which this technique has worked, and the circumstances under which it will not work.&nbsp; I discovered this behavior on my own PC while volunteering my time for the Windows Insider Project, in which
 I receive frequent unpublished Builds of Windows 10 Pro, and see what they do to my System.&nbsp; My PC was working Fine with the Creators Edition of Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I have a HyperX 7.1 Audio USB Headset with an attached Boom Microphone.&nbsp; It had been installed
 when the PC had Windows 7 Pro on it, and it continued to work fine with the Update to the first version of Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; After I installed my first Preview Build, the HyperX 7.1 Audio stopped working properly.&nbsp; My first Feedback with the details can be
 read using the following Link:&nbsp; https://aka.ms/Cav9il .&nbsp; You can select the text for this URL, copy it, and paste it into an open Tab in your Browser to read it, and the Reply I subsequently wrote for it.&nbsp; The Feedback gives the details of which Build's Drivers
 are being Talked about.&nbsp; That Link covers two Builds.&nbsp; Last night I received a third Build, and for that Build I found my Technique doesn't work. The Link for the Feedback &amp; Reply I Posted today for the latest Build can be accessed using the following Link:
 https://aka.ms/Y9une5 .&nbsp; This Feedback is more specific because I have learned more about the Device Manager in Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; It details that with the newest Microsoft Drivers for HyperX 7.1 Audio, the Playback Device, the "Headset Earphone" works just
 fine in the newest Build.&nbsp; The problem is with the "Headset Microphone" which is defined as a "Recording Device".&nbsp; When the Headset is plugged in to the USB port, the Playback Device is configured as the Default in the Sound App which is accessed by Right
 Clicking the Speaker Icon on the right side of the Taskbar, and choosing Playback Devices.&nbsp; On the other hand, when you try to access the "Headset Microphone" in the Recording Devices portion of the Sound app, you find that it is "locked up" and you can't
 access the "Headset Microphone" or any other active Recording Device which is still working, and the "Headset Microphone" is non-functional.&nbsp; In order to Configure any other Recording Devices that are installed on your PC, you have to first unplug the USB
 Headset from its Port.&nbsp; Then Recording Devices becomes active again, and you can make any Configuration changes that you want.&nbsp; They will still function after you plug the Headset back into the USB Port.&nbsp; The only thing that won't work is the "Headset Microphone".&nbsp;
 I won't take the time to describe the Techniques I used to figure this out.&nbsp; The result is that the "Headset Microphone" is non-functional in the latest Build of Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; This information has been relayed to the Insider Program through the "Feedback
 Hub".&nbsp; Microsoft decides which Feedback is acted upon, and which Feedback isn't.&nbsp; I just wanted you to know that my "Technique" hasn't proved to be an all-inclusive fix to the HyperX 7.1 Audio Problem in Windows 10 Pro.<br />

            I made two Posts to the "Feedback Hub" today.&nbsp; To summarize briefly, the first Post dealt with the following issue:
<ol>
<li><span>Feedback Upvoted 10 hours ago Provides the Suggestion that Microsoft Drivers for HyperX 7.1 Audio provided with Build 16296 are the best candidate to be included in the soon-to-be-released Windows
 10 Pro Creator’s Edition Fall Update.<span>&nbsp; </span>RE: Link: </span><a href="https://aka.ms/B2gkx7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://aka.ms/B2gkx7</span></a><span>
 .</span></li></ol>
The second Post also dealt with Drivers, but for a different Recording Device:
<ol>
<li><span>Feedback Upvoted at 5:00 pm CDT on 9/28/17 Provides the Suggestion that Microsoft Drivers for a Creative SB X-Fi Pro PCI Sound Card provided with Build 16299 are the best candidate to be included
 in the Windows 10 Pro Creator’s Edition Fall Update.<span>&nbsp; </span>RE: Link: </span>
<a href="https://aka.ms/F5j7ep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://aka.ms/F5j7ep</span></a><span> .</span></li></ol>
The precipitating event that inspired these two Posts was the need to establish a Work-Around for a Recording Device viable for my Desktop Skype App while the HyperX 7.1 Headset Microphone was non-functional.&nbsp; My solution includes accessing my voice with an
 Electret Condenser Microphone, plugging it into a multi-channel Mixer, and taking the Line Level output of the Mixer and feeding it into the Line-In jack of the Creative Sound Card.&nbsp; I have been using this configuration from the time my first Preview Build
 incapacitated my Headset Microphone.&nbsp; I found that for each of the three Builds I have installed since September 12th, the Sound Quality derived from each set of Microsoft Drivers from the three Builds is different.&nbsp; The best result for the Sound Card comes
 from the Drivers in Build 16299.&nbsp; I decided it was my duty to the Team to report the results of these experiments.&nbsp; For now, my Work-Around performs Superbly for Skype, and for Digital Recording of Music, since I have the Audio set up on my PC for the Headset
 Earphones on the working part of the HyperX 7.1 Audio to "listen" to what is being fed to the Line-In jack of the Creative SB X-Fi Pro sound card from my Mixer.&nbsp; In the meantime I await the next Preview Build of Version 2709 to experience the behavior of the
 two devices in question based on the functionality of the new Microsoft Drivers that will be included with that Build.

<li><span>The Purpose of this third Reply to the Thread is to relate the Results of an experiment I conducted on my PC this morning concerning the Behavior of my HyperX 7.1 USB Headset and Creative
 SB X-Fi PCI Sound Card in a Version 1709 Build 16299 Environment.<span>&nbsp; </span>
This Experiment is defined Briefly in a Link to the original Post to the “Feedback Hub”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Link is: <span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aka.ms/Jiu5pa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/Jiu5pa</a> and the Post hits the high points of the Experiment.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can access it by Right Clicking the Link and choosing “Open Link in a new Tab”</span></li><li><span>The Fundamental Principle about this new Technique is that it’s not the Drivers themselves that define whether-or-not the Device will be Operational in the OS Environment, but rather the Order
 in which the Plug &amp; Play Subsystem in the OS Configures each Device according to the Bus it operates on.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I will now try to describe in more Detail exactly what I did.</span></li><li><span>I first Isolated the Line-Out (Playback Device) and Line-In (Recording Device) for the Sound Card which operates on the PCI Bus by Disabling all other Devices in the “Audio inputs and outputs”
 section of the Device Manager.<span>&nbsp; </span>I then Uninstalled both, and Restarted the PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Result was that after the OS Re-configured the PC, I was left with an Operational Sound System in the PC on the PCI Bus in that OS.</span></li><li><span>I then Uninstalled the Headset Earphone (Playback Device) and Headset Microphone (Recording Device) which operate on the USB Bus and use the HyperX 7.1 Audio, leaving the Line-In and Line-Out
 Devices Operational, and all the other devices in that section Disabled.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Finally, as I clicked the Restart Button I Unplugged the USB Headset from its Port, and let the PC cycle through the Restart.</span></li><li><span>After the Startup Manager was finished configuring the PC, I then plugged in the USB Headset.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After 30 seconds I opened the Sound App, and I could access both the Playback section and Recording section without any hang-ups.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I could Configure the Headset Earphone as the Default Playback Device, and the Headset Microphone as the Default Recording Device.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Line-In Jack on the Sound Card indicated Ready, and still picked up Sound from the External Microphone I had been using.</span></li><li><span>The Conclusion I could infer from this successful Experiment on PCI Devices and USB Devices in Version 1709 Build 16299 is that the Order and Environment in which the Devices are configured
 is critical to them Operating Together without Conflict in this OS.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It also demonstrates that my Hypothesis about the Drivers in each Build being the Problem in my Two Earlier Replies to this Thread were wrong.

<ol>
<li><span>Around 3:00 a.m. Tuesday morning, with no advanced notice, Version 1709, Build 16299.15 of Windows 10 Pro was Downloaded and installed on my PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The first thing I checked was the Sound App for Playback &amp; Recording Devices.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In Playback Devices the HyperX 7.1 Audio Headset Earphone was discovered to be configured as the Default Device and was Operational.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Creative SB X-Fi Speaker was there and was displaying Ready.<span>&nbsp; </span>
There were other Playback Devices present from other Sound Controllers installed on my PC like the Native Motherboard HDMI Controller and the Nvidia Graphics Card Sound Controller and I Disabled all Devices derived from these Controllers that I don’t use or
 need.</span></li><li><span>In Recording Devices, I found that the App was Locked and I couldn’t access it, so I Unplugged the USB Headset and it Unlocked so that I could Configure the Devices in this Section.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I Disabled all the extraneous Recording Devices that I don’t use or need, leaving the Creative SB X-Fi Line-In Device Configured as the Default and Plugged the USB Headset back in.</span></li><li><span>I then turned my attention to the Device Manager, opened it and inspected “Sound, video and game controllers”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I Disabled all extraneous Controllers and Uninstalled “HyperX 7.1 X-Fi Audio”, leaving the other Controllers like the Creative SB X-Fi Sound I needed Active.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I inspected “Audio inputs and outputs”, finding that the only Devices after all the Disabling &amp; Uninstalling that had occurred still present were the Creative SB X-Fi Speaker &amp; Line-In Devices.</span></li><li><span>Finally, I restarted the PC while Unplugging the USB Headset from its port.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After the Restart was complete, I Plugged the USB Headset back in, waited 30 seconds, then returned to the Sound App.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Opening Playback Devices I Configured the HyperX 7.1 Audio Headset Earphone as the Default while the Creative SB X-Fi Speaker was displaying Ready.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then opened Recording Devices, and Configured the HyperX 7.1 Audio Headset Microphone as the Default leaving the Creative SB X-Fi Line-In Device displaying Ready. Both the PCI Devices and the USB Devices were found to be fully operational.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>The Conclusion a User can infer from this result is that for Windows 10 Pro, version 1709: Builds 16296, 16299 &amp; now Build 16299.15 my Technique has been demonstrated to be Viable for getting
 HyperX 7.1 Audio to Install and Operate Correctly in the upcoming Windows 10 Pro Creator’s Edition Fall Update when HyperX 7.1 Audio is forced to be configured LAST by the OS Plug &amp; Play Sub-System and using subtle coercion with the Device Manager and Sound
 App.<span>&nbsp; </span>Following is a Link to my Post this morning in the “Feedback Hub” which describes my findings from yesterday morning in a more concise manner (limited to 1000 characters) which gives the interested reader some meaningful background on my
 “Quest” for Gamers everywhere to learn how to get their HyperX 7.1 Audio Hardware to work with Windows 10.

            This is a similar problem with encoding with the rubbish nokia vid man. Better you try another encoder to convert em. Try super. Easy to use, but hard to download. It is a freeware.<br />

            Yes video converting is a pain.<br />
<br />
If you're serious about converting you should BUY a decent encoder.<br />
<br />
Or try some freeware things that work sometimes with some formats.<br />

            On my phone it is after 35 minutes, but I seem to have the same problem. I have a strong feeling that this is because I used Nokia Video Manager to convert the files, and after a certain period (about 35 minutes) it conks out and only converts audio. I
 also have problems if I stop and re-start a video: It is gray, and the background (alpha?) channel that should be black is instead gray. When I try to play the file in Quicktime, to see if there is actually any video after 35 minutes, the player hangs. When
 I play it in Windows Media Player, it says the clip is only 35 minutes long (Nokia Video Manager pegs it at 52 minutes, which is what it should be).<br />
I am trying Clone Mobile. It seems to do a decent job of converting, and is really fast, and has a setting for the N95, all good things...I have now uploaded it, and it works fantastically! None of the issues mentioned above. It looks like the piece of sh*t
 Nokia software is what cost me far too much time. I have downloaded Super, Handbrake, WinFF, AutoGK, Nidesoft, and probably a few others I am missing. None gave me usable files to play on my N95 8GB until Clone DVD Mobile, on the first try. I am a Slysoft
 fan, having used AnyDVD for awhile, and this product makes me even more of one. Listen up, Nokia!!!: This is what software is supposed to do: Work out of the box.

            Well Nokia Video Manager seems to work only for small files.<br />
<br />
Like mentioned above use Super or other sofware encoders for full lenght movies or longer files.

<h2>            Shapes too small for text</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, I have a question. I created a Flowchart with Visio 2016 and printed it on a single page. After printing, I realized that the text inside the shapes is a little bit too small to read comfortably. There's enough blank space left to make
 things bigger, but when I make the text bigger in Visio, it is busting out of the shapes (all rectangles). Do I have to make each shape bigger by hand, or is there some option which does that automatically for me ? Another issue is that when I make the shapes
 bigger, the connectors are getting too short and everything is way too cramped. Please help. Thank you, Daniel</span></p>

            Hi bashinake,
<br />I'm not a Visio expert but I do have access to MSDN, this document may help you understand how to do it.

<br />Hope this helps if not let me know and I'll keep digging. I think it explains it pretty well. As someone mentioned in the reply's it should be intuitive but it's not. 
<br />Regards,

<h2>            Outlook 2016 POP3 TLS</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i would like to knwo if is there any update to use TLS for pop3 on outlook 2016. My version is outlook 2016 MSO (16.0.7726.1049) 64 bits</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the advanced tab once inside the internet email settings i just see an option to use SSL but i can not see the combo bos to select TLS as it happens with SMTP.<br />
</p>
<p>on the web, meanwhile a lot of people said that outlook doesn't support POP3 TLS, i saw a config tutotial on this web site&nbsp;http://www.activeservers.com/Outlook-POP3-TLS.aspx and there as you can see they have the more options icuding six tabs instead of
 3, and talking abut POP3 they can change the type of encriptyon to TLS; So how do i activate those extra settings?<br />
</p>

    <title>Outlook Lite Version broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a_martin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Lite Version broken</h2>
                    I set my Outlook to the Lite version to see if it would run better than it does with the regular version, but it does not work at all. None of the buttons work, as whenever I press a button along the top, it just links me back to my inbox. When I click
 any other buttons, I get an unrecognized error message. The only button that works is sign out. How do I change it back and get it to work? I need this account!

            You must be using the new version - my )old) version doesn't have the "Lite" option so I'm afraid I know as much as you do....

<h2>            Windows 10 and my opinion</h2>
                    <p>The more I use Windows' 10 the less I like it. As each build&nbsp; I manage to get installed Win 10 takes over more things and does them the way&nbsp;&nbsp;someone&nbsp; or group at Microsoft thinks it should be done it seems they don't want me to think for myself and I must
 do it their way.&nbsp;Example is&nbsp;after I'm done checking my mail&nbsp;in Outlook I sign off&nbsp; -- I think but when I go to outlook.com it opens up already signed in -- I completely dislike that big time.</p>
<p>Take Cortana, at first I liked the concept but the results just aren't there.</p>
<p>The games Microsoft had in Windows&nbsp; 7 were great. I don't play a lot of games but I found the chess and freecell games perfect for&nbsp;filling &nbsp;some waiting time on while the computer was doing something for me. The games I found in the Microsoft store just
 completely stink. That's enough right there to make me change my decision&nbsp; to upgrade to Win 10, I'm not going top do it. I think I'm registered for automatic upgrade. I'd like to know how to kill my OK for Automatic upgrade. I intend to stay with Win 7.</p>
<p>Over all the look of Win 10 on the screen is a down grade compared to Win 7.</p>
<p>As a back up I'm now looking at getting familiar with Linux and using that as a backup system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a disappointed Insider.</p>

            <p>Agreed. I do not need a big smartphone that can't make calls. I need a machine to do serious actual work on. And I don't mean health and fitness, sport, money, alarm clock or any of that other "app" stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What they should have done is update 8 for the tablet market and do a real and proper update to 7 for the serious computer market. 8 works for tablet. I don't do tablet so I don't need 8. They had a good thing with Windows 7 and if they did a real update
 to it - not a downgrade to appville/farmville/metroland - then people would still want to pay for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand why they think people will not pay for 10. I would not pay for 10 as it is. The catch is Microsoft, people don't want to pay for silly little apps either. Yes, the desktop looks nice. The start menu is messed up but at bare minimum. But
 you took out the actual programs and the configurable settings (settings app is not and never will be control panel) and stuffed it full of OEM style bloatware apps that nobody will really use. I have a food app on my phone too that came with it. Haven't wanted
 to use it once i the years I've owned it. In truth if I wanted something like that I'd use a browser and Google (not Bing dagnamit). And eveything looks so plain and flat like it fell out of a 286 that couldn't handle a pretty GUI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too little too later tho. The ship is half way out to sea and the steering wheel isn't onboard and the hull is only half completed. I hope this doesn't kill Windows, but on the other hand part of me hopes Windows doesn't survive like this.</p>

            Normal view and Slide Show view. Before I tries chaging the Resolution under the Slide Show tab but no avaible resolution worked. Today I opened the PowerPoint again and the problem is no more - fonts and graphics&nbsp;are displaying just fine. I don't know
 how Windows&nbsp;or PowerPoint corrected it. Anyway, thanks for the support.&nbsp;

<p>Does Windows Update work?</p>
<p>What operating system and service pack?</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

    <title>Freezing&#47;crashing on Nokia Lumia 920 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hahahi20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing&#47;crashing on Nokia Lumia 920</h2>
                    So after spending 600 euros on a device, I had to send it back to Nokia Care because the sim-slot was broken (manufacturing defect)<br />
After waiting for 3 weeks, and a lot of angry phone and mail contact with Nokia they decided to give me a new one. (They accused me of breaking the sim-slot myself, while there are at least 3 people from the same batch of devices who have the same problem.)<br />
<br />
So now I got a new device, and just as I was expecting, box was opened, and this seems some refurbished piece of sh*t. It freezes every 5 minutes, I have soft-resetted it for more than 20 times, and I just have it for 3 hours...<br />
<br />
Is there any solution to this? Is anybody else experiencing the same problems?<br />
<br />
Really, I am a Nokia fan, and I love the phones they make, but when they treat me like this, it becomes really hard to love this company...<br />
<br />
I am probably going to send it back. Is there any way to get my 600 euro back from Nokia? Because the seller where I bought it will never accept it back like this.<br />
<br />
I will just wait for a Motorola X or something, because the Lumia 920 rushed to the market. I am very dissapointed...

<p>It depends really. Mine has only even frozen once ever in 3 months and that was my fault for installing an app I knew was bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, have you tried a proper hard reset? If not then you should. Don;t know where you are or what network you arte with but another thing to try is to set the max connection speed to 3G for the moment.&nbsp;</p>

            I have set my netwerk on 2g because I have no mobile data and the battery drain seemed useless, but I will put it on 3g again. What is the code for hard reset? Camera+power+volume down?

<p>No, leave it on 2G. I thought you might have been on 4G.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can reset using Settings&gt;About&gt;Reset your phone, of have you already done this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have and the problem persists then perhaps you should contact Nokia Care again.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Powerpoint - font error</h2>
                    When trying to save a Powerpoint (2016 for Mac) presentation, I see an error that a font (Noto Sans) can not be saved. After selecting "OK" the presentation fails to save, because "Noto Sans is not True Type".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't want to replace the font, but do need to find a solution, as this is happening very frequently.

            I’m not sure what version you have, but there have many problems with Office 16.xx for Mac. That may be the cause of your trouble. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft has instructions at this link for rolling back to version 15.xx builds.

<p>This is a known issue that was fixed in an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please go to the PowerPoint menu and choose About PowerPoint. If you have anything other than 16.12, please install updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Ensure your Mac and Office have the latest updates</span></strong><span>. Here’s how to install updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install the updates.</span></li><li><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Antidote, Webex, Silverlight, EndNote, Zotero or other add-ins there is a potential for crashes unless you also update your add-ins to the latest update. Install updates for these programs if you have them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If installing 16.12 does not fix the problem, then I know it is fixed in 16.13, which you can get early by joining Insider Fast</p>

            1. This is an issue with latest Skype which is v8. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

    <title>Does Windows Defender Offine require Bitlocker to be turned off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flashq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Windows Defender Offine require Bitlocker to be turned off&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 ultimate and have a Windows securities essentials(WSE) installed. Additionally, I use Bitlocker&nbsp;to encrypt my C Drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;A few days ago I ran&nbsp;WSE and discovered that I had a Trojan and another virus.&nbsp;WSE removed them, but WSE said that I should use Windows Defender Offline (WDO)&nbsp;to further eliminate the security threat.
</p>
<p>I then downloaded WDO to a CD. I then tried to boot from that CD.&nbsp;WDO gave me an error message. The error message was 0x8004cc01. The error message said that:
</p>
<p>WDO cannot be started. Unable to detect a Windows system drive. This could be due to missing drivers, unencrypted drive, or corrupted Windows installation.
</p>
<p>Since I used Bitlocker, do I need to turn it off before trying again? Thanks for any help.</p>

    <title>Power Point auto-presentation quits on its own using a Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john o&#39;brien &#40;john.m.obrien&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Point auto-presentation quits on its own using a Mac</h2>
                    <p>I have created a Power Point presentation and want to create a video that automatically runs when it is clicked. I was able to do this successfully once in the last month. However, I am now finding that the presentation quits automatically in the middle
 on one particular slide. I have tried everything that I know of and have consulted with tech experts. I did reorder the slides and discovered that the problem is likely with one slide. It has a 9 minute audio file attached (which worked in another presentation
 that I did) that quits halfway through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest any ways to keep this from happening? I am particularly stymied as I was able to successfully build a video using this exact process once before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for any/all ideas.&nbsp;</p>

 it is not always predictable. </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, there may be corruption in this particular presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various strategies for dealing with a problem presentation. A quick, easy suggestion to try is to use File &gt; Save As and save to a different file type. If it is in current format (.pptx) choose an older format (.ppt). Then Quit PowerPoint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-open PowerPoint and check the file now. Is it OK? If so, you can use File &gt; Save as and return it to the current file format (.pptx)</p>

<h3> colin franco  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I unlink my email or number from a Skype account&#63; &#40;more info in details&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have the same email connected to three accounts, and the same number connected to two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I created my third and current account, I had to make an Outlook email to do so as a result of my first being made with my primary email and my second with my number. I wish to shut down the first two as I do not need them anymore. I'd also like to
 make both my primary email and number default to the my current account rather than my Outlook email.</p>
<p>I believe that deleting the accounts would do that, but that would result in deleting my Xbox account as well. Is there anyway to solve this or do I have to deal with my Microsoft account being connected to the wrong things forever? I'd really like to login
 to my normal account with either my email or my number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Sorry for using the wrong category, there just isn't an appropriate one. Also, I know this is likely a commonly asked question, I just want more clarification and want to know if anything might happen in the future.</p>

Thanks - but I'm a MAC user, and onetastic is only for Windows.

<h2>            IE8 page save shortcut &#34;ctrl s&#34; not working</h2>
                    
<p>IE 8 on Vista SP2</p>
<p>The save page shortcut "CTRL +S"&nbsp; is not working. I ahve to use the save option from "page" button in the menu bar.</p>
<p>This is an old problem, I do not recall when it originated. So I can't relate it to any&nbsp; chages done to my computers softwares.</p>
<p>Since I save a lot of pages, I occasionally use alternative browsers. However I prefer saving pages in Mhtm, which give me one file and is easier to rename. Fixing this will make it more convenient for me.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
