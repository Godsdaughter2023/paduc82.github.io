<p>Hi dai_71, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the Bitlocker keeps prompting for the recovery key, check if you putting in the correct keys. Here are the places where to look for it:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>On a printout you saved</strong>. Look in places you keep important papers.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<strong>Saved on a USB flash drive</strong>. Plug the USB flash drive in to your locked device and follow the instructions. If you saved the key as a text file on the flash drive, use a different computer to read the text file.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<strong>In your Microsoft account</strong>. To get your recovery key, go to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=237614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>BitLocker
 Recovery Keys</strong></a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<strong>In your Azure Active Directory account</strong>. For work devices where you sign in with an Azure Active Directory account, to get your recovery key, see the device info for your<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=857635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Azure account</a>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
If your Surface is connected to a domain (usually a work or school computer), ask a system administrator for your recovery key.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you still can't get in, you'll need to reset your device. Please refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on
</span>how to reset your Surface to factory conditions using a downloaded recovery image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have any other concerns. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>Yes, have linked the game&nbsp; to my Square Enix account and confirmed it was the correct e-mail. Still, on the Square Enix website the game doesn't appear registered, as if I owned it or linked it. Both&nbsp; the xbox live account and Square Enix account have the

<h2>            Device harddiskvolume non existent</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem with ntoskrnl using high amounts of cpu and it's using disk speeds that are impossoble to achieve, like over 3GB/s.</p>
<p>Then, after reading some tips, I decided to trace the program and I see this weird error appearing in the log file of the disk.</p>
<p>The system is searching for a \Device\HarddiskVolume2\pagefile.sys which doesn't exist, all my drives start with the symbolic link from HarddiskVolume8 and up.</p>
<p>Is there a way to create this symbolic link or otherwise solve this problem?</p>

 and i tried doing a scan and it said i cant connect to xbox live i tried what it told me and it still didnt work so i tried taking my hard drive out and turned my xbox back on and it was working fine nothing was wrong and then i tried putting my hard drive
 back in and it disconnected from the wireless connection and crashed again it took half an hour to just get off the first xbox logo when i turn my xbox on and another half hour to get to the dashboard and go to the wireless connection and test it again. &nbsp;please
 help because i want to really use my hard drive but i don't want to buy another hard drive&nbsp;</p>
<p>here's what it says when i go on the error status report:</p>

<p>Hey mate, sounds like you'll want to format the drive. I suggest backing up your files on a USB thumb drive configured for Xbox 360 first, though. Once you've backed up those files, go to 'Memory,' highlight your device, and then press (Y). You should see
 the option to format the drive. </p>

<p>In that case, I'm afraid the HDD will need to be replaced. Before purchasing, though, it wouldn't hurt to try a friend's HDD on your console, just to see if the issue comes back (which it shouldn't).<br />
<br />
@EDG, yes, that would certainly be a sound troubleshooting step in this situation. For some reason I thought the OP said they had tried that--good catch.&nbsp;

<p>When was it purchased, and was it purchased new? All accessories purchased new come with a 90-day warranty (unless they're purchased with a new console, in which case they have a one-year warranty).

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Yes, there is a problem with the latest Windows Updates. 
<br />
<br />Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - double-click the adapter - Driver's tab - use Roll back driver. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work or is unavailable do the below.
<br />
<br />Updating to the latest video driver or possibly reverting back to an older version usually corrects the issue. 
<br />
<br />Download the latest and any other older driver you wish to try from the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and also check the actual video device maker (such as Intel, Nvidia or AMD/ATI). Do not install yet. 
<br />
<br />Make a Restore Point : 
<br />
<br />Start - type in --&gt; Restore ......... find at top and click on - then use Create 
<br />
<br />Use this method to remove the present video drivers. 
<br />
<br />Display Driver Uninstaller 
<br /><a href="https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr</a>...

<br />Then install the desired driver you previously downloaded. 
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

Now I did the clone with Macrium reflect (that supports win10) and it worked!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
More on the BlueScreen below.<br />
<br />
You are trying to re-install Windows and that happens? The minidumps show Windows is running<br />
so you are not doing the installation correctly.<br />
<br />
You mean reinstall the OS completely? If you have the Windows 7 DVD's you can do this however<br />
be sure to totally backup your data off the drive and you will need to reinstall your programs. If you<br />
do not have Windows 7 Disks you can buy them from your system maker cheap. If you do not care<br />
about existing programs&nbsp;then you can do a complete fresh install - just select the format options<br />
which wipes the entire disk (this erases all data as well).
<p>Some System makers use Recovery Partitions as well as other methods to allow you to revert<br />
back to a completely fresh installation. So check with your System maker to see what options<br />
you have to do that - and it certainly can be done - just a matter of knowing the processes the<br />
System maker put in place for you.</p>

<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
</strong><br />
The Bug_Check were all 50 CAUSE 1. ntkrpamp.exe which is a Windows component which means something<br />
else drove it into Fault. 2. and 3. aswSP.SYS and aswSnx.SYS which are both par of Avast which is not known<br />
for causing these issues. I suspect the root cause is either memory, hard drive, or other hardware issues. You<br />
may need to uninstall Avast and run its Uninstalll Utility (to prevent remnants) as a test.<br />
<br />

<strong>1.</strong> Check the memory very thoroughly using the methods in the troubleshooters below. Faster memory always has<br />
to be in front of slower and there can be tiny speed differences between even identical modules. You may need to<br />
swap memory in and out in different patterns and combinations.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check the hard drive - run SFC /scannow and checkdisk (chkdsk /f /r ) see methods in the troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Use the other methods in the troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> If needed uninstall Avast as a test - then run the Uninstall Utility. Use MSE while testing. NOTE : As you can see<br />
below, I usually recommend Avast or MSE with Prevx.<br />
<br />
Avast - Uninstall Utility<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility</a><br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave File System, Web,
<br />
and Network running (Script and Behavior are also recommended in Ver 6+).<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall<br />
<br />
Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)<br />
<br />
IE - Protected Mode<br />
<br />
IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)<br />
<br />
I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 6.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 6.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y</a> &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor's Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />

<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started)<br />
Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security<br />
products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when you get to<br />
those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure<br />
of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or
<br />
video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently,
<br />
remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace
<br />
the faulty&nbsp;component. You should run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer.
<br />
For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this
<br />
resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible
<br />
update. If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at
<br />
the character-mode menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting
<br />
Windows Advanced Options menu, choose theLast Known Good Configuration option. <br />
This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem: </em>Disable the program and confirm that this resolves
<br />
the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em>&nbsp; Run Chkdsk /f /r to detect and repair disk
<br />
errors. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If
<br />
the hard disk is SCSI, check for problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.<br />
</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help
<br />
pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS
<br />
might also resolve it.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

RUN AS ADMIN follow the instructions<br />

<h3> calrains  say:</h3>
<h2>            skype problem</h2>
                    <p>I am old and not very techno, but let me try to explain my problem with Skype.</p>
<p>I am able to do messaging with Skype, but I cannot connect any voice calls.</p>
<p>For example, I cannot connect with the echo/sound check or any of my contacts.</p>
<p>I receive the response "no answer" and there is no ringing sound.</p>
<p>This is with my laptop, tablet, or cell phone.</p>
<p>I took my laptop to a nearby restaurant and I could connect, however, and this was also true</p>
<p>with my tablet and cellphone.</p>
<p>A friend brought his laptop over and it had the same problems.</p>
<p>I used Skype easily until about two months ago.</p>
<p>My Internet provider said that my wi-fi is working fine and that Skype problems on this network</p>
<p>are extremely rare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I submitted this problem to this community previously and received various suggestions.</p>
<p>I tried each of them with no success.</p>
<p>I even contacted Skype and a very nice tech there entered my computer with no success.</p>
<p>I think she was having problems staying connected.&nbsp; I then called-back and talked with</p>
<p>a nice man who said that he could not enter my computer because the page was jumping</p>
<p>around too much.&nbsp; My laptop has Windows 10.&nbsp; I used for several years with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to use Skype at a friend's house.&nbsp; He has the exact same Internet provider and</p>
<p>has no Skype problems.&nbsp; I was able to use my devices at his house with no problems.</p>
<p>I am able to use Skype on my cell phone if it is not connected to wi-fi but that is quite expensive.</p>
<p>I am hoping that one of you very kind Skype experts will come to my rescue.&nbsp; This is very strange!</p>
<p>

<p>Dear Joseph,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your assistance.&nbsp; I contacted Skype again and talked with a very kind tech - Karen A.&nbsp; She tried all sorts of things but was unsuccessful - or at least that was the case when the Internet connection was lost.&nbsp; I called back and
 talked with Janet Subteniente.&nbsp; She also tried all sorts of things but concluded that there was a device problem and that I should contact the manufacturer.&nbsp; I reminded her that my laptop, tablet and cellphones all connect to Skype with no problems at the
 wifi of a nearby restaurant and at the home of a friend.&nbsp; He brought his laptop to my home and was unable to connect and had he same problem that I have.&nbsp; She then suggested that I return to the restaurant and contact them again and they can check about things
 from there.&nbsp; She got the impression that I thought she was being very uncooperative.&nbsp; I assured her that it is not the case and that I will contact them from the restaurant soon.&nbsp; I am very, very thankful for their efforts.&nbsp; I am extremely discouraged because
 this problem is very recent and I had several years of success with Skype with no problems.&nbsp; I took language classes with Skype and my hope is that I can resume, but that seems unlikely at this point.&nbsp; This is all extremely strange to me, but I am old and
 non a techno in the least.&nbsp; It is so strange that I have messaging via skype but no voice.&nbsp; When I contact the echo sound lady I receive no answer and call failed.&nbsp; This is also true of all contacts and eve;n if I try to make a call from my skype to a business
 by paying.&nbsp; Nobody is also able to contact me with voice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I hope that I have not rambled too much and that I have been clear about my situation.&nbsp; Several kind members of the Micro Community have given me many things to try and all have been totally unsuccessful.&nbsp; As I previously mentioned, I contacted
 my ISP and was told that my wi-fi is fine.&nbsp; He said that Skype problems are extremely rare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cal</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If possible, you can try to connect your laptop using wired connection directly to your router/modem.</span></span></p>

<p>Thanks so much for your quick and thoughtful reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously tried connecting directly to the router but the problem continued.</p>
<p>I hope to delete the anti-virus protections that are not needed.&nbsp; I think that you are giving good advice in that regard.</p>
<p>I am also attempting to get my ISP to exchange the modem.&nbsp; It is also the conclusion that I have reached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks so much for your excellent reply.&nbsp; I will let you know what happens.</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate your assistance, your kindness and your understanding of my strange situation.</p>
<p>You have given me renewed hope. Skype is wonderful, so I hope to be able to use it again soon..&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Google Chrome will not open, task manager will not launch</h2>
                    <p>I have this strange issue where, after I've used Chrome for a while and then I close the session, I try to reopen Chrome and nothing happens. It just won't launch. So I decided to take a look under the Task Manager processes and guess what... Task Manager
 wouldn't open either. I tried right clicking from the taskbar to open the Task Manager, tried with CTRL+ALT+DEL but it just won't respond. Then I decided to restart the computer and it just got stuck on the "Restarting" Windows screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens as a chain of events starting with Chrome and I have no idea what's causing it or how to fix it but it gets annoying. Also why would Task Manager not be able to open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running the latest version of Chrome, Windows 10, computer is clean of malware etc.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue, the problem is not that it gets permanently stuck restarting, the problem is windows itself. &nbsp;People have been having this issue since launch but everywhere I've looked Microsoft seems to want to act like it either doesn't exist/has
 been fixed already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assumption that they can't past the welcome screen is not said anywhere in the original post. Once the computer goes to the "restarting" screen, it's simple enough to just do a hard reset to get it "unstuck." &nbsp;After that, windows boots just fine, task
 manager and chrome both open normally again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So perhaps Microsoft could FINALLY release an update that fixes this? &nbsp;It's been happening since windows 10 launched for me.</p>

            <p>Exactly, when I get stuck on Restarting screen I just hit the hard reset button on my PC next to my power button. But all these things seem to be related. I just came back here because it happened again, just now, and it looks like there's still no real
 answer. What's funny is that when you search google it auto-suggests "chrome and task manager won't open" by itself, so I assume it's not just me having this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Oh and in response to Sayan_Ghosh, I don't have this problem restarting the computer any other instance. The only time it gets stuck on "Restarting" screen is when I can't launch Chrome and Task Manager. Any other time the computer restarts without
 a problem. I'm guessing the PC can't restart because it still sees Chrome as "running" or something like that, even though it's not.</p>

            <p>I have the exact same symptoms as everyone else in this thread and have been bothered with this since installing Windows 10 after successfully using Windows 8.1 for a couple of years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reinstalled Chrome and run Malwarebytes. &nbsp;I use Norton. &nbsp;I figured I would try but I don't know if it worked or not. &nbsp;Only time will tell. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I typed and what the response was in the Command Prompt window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typing "<strong>sfc/scannow</strong>" I got:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>With "<strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong>" I got:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>No Component store corruption detected.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>With "<strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong>" &nbsp;I got:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The operation completed successfully.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping that this "completed successfully" means that the problem is fixed but, I suspect, given the fact that the first two operations found no problems, I probably still have mine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h3> richard dgordon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Member of Administrators Group Can&#39;t Access Other Users&#39; Folders</h2>
                    I have an Asus desktop computer and an Asus notebook computer both running Windows 8.1 Pro (64-bit) and a Dell notebook computer running Windows XP Pro (32-bit) with disk drives and user accounts configured the same way on all machines.&nbsp; My account is
 a member of the Administrators Group.&nbsp; On each PC I created data folders for each user account on a large hard disk (D).&nbsp; For each folder I set Modify permissions for the user account and Full permissions for the Administrators Group using the process shown
 in your article " 'Access Denied' or other errors when accessing or working with files and folders in Windows" (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2623670#method11).&nbsp; This is the only user account with access permissions for that folder.<br />
For each data folder, the file system correctly allows access to the user account which has permission and blocks access to all other standard user accounts.&nbsp; Neither Asus PC allows my account to access any of the folders on it that belong to other users, whereas
 the Dell notebook has never had a problem allowing my account to access all shares on it or on the Dell Windows XP workstation I used to operate.<br />
The only way I could get access to any shared folders between Windows 8.1 PCs was to make the following settings in "Control Panel | Network and Sharing Center | Advanced sharing settings":<br />
-&nbsp; Private automatic network discovery:&nbsp; On.<br />
-&nbsp; Private File &amp; printer sharing:&nbsp; On.<br />
-&nbsp; Private HomeGroup connections:&nbsp; Use user accounts &amp; passwords...<br />
-&nbsp; Guest network discovery:&nbsp; Off.<br />
-&nbsp; Guest file &amp; printer sharing:&nbsp; On.<br />
-&nbsp; All networks public folder sharing:&nbsp; On.<br />
-&nbsp; All networks media streaming:&nbsp; All networks - all devices allowed;&nbsp;&nbsp; All libraries or folders except "Documents" - shared.<br />
-&nbsp; All networks file sharing connections:&nbsp; Use 128-bit encryption...<br />
-&nbsp; All networks password protected sharing:&nbsp; Off.<br />
Is there any way to allow a member of the Administrators Group on the Windows 8.1 Pro computers to access all shared folders on the network as was allowed by Windows XP Pro?

            Hi Ben.&nbsp; When I use either Windows 8.1 PC to log in to my account, which is a member of the Administrators Group, and try to access another account's shared folders on the data disk of either Windows 8.1 PC, the system displays "Network Error.&nbsp; Windows
 cannot access \\CG8270\Gordon-Michael_Documents.&nbsp; You do not have permission to access \\CG8270\Gordon-Michael_Documents.&nbsp; Contact your network administrator to request access.&nbsp; For more information about permissions, see Windows Help and Support."&nbsp; The Address
 field at the top of File Manager also starts scrolling horizontally green and does not stop until the message box is closed.<br />
I have not tried taking ownership of these folders because:&nbsp; (a) this was not required when sharing folders worked under Windows XP Pro;&nbsp; (b) there is more than one Administrator account on each PC;&nbsp; (c) my understanding (verified by a Microsoft Support tech
 yesterday) was that any account that was a member of the Administrators Group would have access to any share on any PC on the network if I set Full Control permissions for the Administrators Group for each share.<br />
My own account's name is included in the permission list only for my own shared data folders on each PC.&nbsp; The Administrators name is included in the permission list for all shared folders on each PC.&nbsp; All data folder shares were set up using the same approach.<br />
Re "is the hard disk shared through a home network", the shares are shared across my home network as per the "Network and Sharing Center" settings previously listed.&nbsp; All of the shares on all three systems are usually visible from any PC using File Manager.&nbsp;
 Sometimes a Window 8.1 PC will have problems accessing the Windows XP notebook and display the message "Network Error.&nbsp; Windows cannot access \\I6000.&nbsp; Check the spelling of the name.&nbsp; Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network.&nbsp; To try to identify
 and resolve network problems, click Diagnose.&nbsp; Error code: 0x80070035.&nbsp; The network path was not found."&nbsp; Nearly always after repeatedly selecting the I6000 in File Manager, it eventually manages to display the I6000 PC's shares.&nbsp; Thanks for helping out --
 I was about to give up on getting Microsoft networking to work smoothly.<br />

            <p>Hi Bennet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed "Ctl Panel | Network &amp; Sharing Ctr | Adv. sharing settings | All Networks | Password protected sharing" back to "On" from "Off" on the CG8270 (Win8.1) &amp; the G46VW (Win8.1).&nbsp; As before, the system now allows access to all shares on the I6000 (WinXP)
 from the CG8270, the G46VW &amp; the I6000.&nbsp; However, it still responds with the message "Network Error.&nbsp; Windows cannot access ... .&nbsp; You do not have permission to access ... ." when trying to access any other user's shares on the CG8270 &amp; the G46VW from any
 of the 3 PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to assisting with this particular problem, would you please tell me how I can access comprehensive documentation about folder and file sharing in Win8.1?&nbsp; The information scattered around in various help files and Control Panel forms does not
 provide a well organized presentation of the goals of the designers and how the software implemented their objectives.&nbsp; I have read "Windows 8.1 Inside Out" by Tony Northrup and it only discusses how to provide total access for everybody to shared folders
 using HomeGroup functionality.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Hi Ben,<br />
<br />
After much reading and testing, I have identified a source of the problem caused by using share settings that allowed access to&nbsp; folders across the network under Windows XP Pro but blocked access under Windows 8.1 Pro.<br />
<br />
When I initially created shares using Windows XP Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro, I selected and right-clicked folder "D:\Documents\Gordon-Caroline" in Windows Explorer, selected "Properties | Sharing | Advanced Sharing| Share this folder" and entered "Gordon-Caroline_Documents"
 in the "Share name" field (i.e. more detailed than just the folder name "Gordon-Caroline", because that name is duplicated in other sub-folders and this would cause confusion when they were both being shared).&nbsp; I selected "Permissions | Add" and assigned "Change"
 to user "Gordon-Caroline" and "Full Control" to group "Administrators" and removed group "Everyone".<br />
<br />
I then selected "Properties | Security | Edit | Add" and assigned "Modify" to user "Gordon-Caroline".&nbsp; I selected "Advanced" and assigned "Delete subfolders and files" to user "Gordon-Caroline" on the "Advanced permissions" form.&nbsp; All of this resulted in the
 share having&nbsp; only "Gordon-Caroline" with "Special" (ie. advanced "Modify") permission and "Administrator" with "Full Control" permission.<br />
With these settings this share **cannot** be accessed from either the Windows XP Pro or the Windows 8.1 Pro notebook PC by my account, which belongs to the Administrators group.<br />
<br />
When I later followed the instructions in the link that you provided ( http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/share-files-folders ) to create shares using Windows 8.1 Pro, a different procedure was described and the result was surprisingly different.&nbsp;
 I selected folder "D:\Documents\Gordon-Caroline"&nbsp; in Windows Explorer and selected "Share | Share with |Gordon-Caroline" (in the menu).<br />
<br />
Now the fun began.&nbsp; I selected the folder and selected "Share | Advanced security" (in the menu) and saw groups "Administrators" &amp; "SYSTEM" and user "Gordon-Rick(Admin)" with "Full Control" permission and user "Gordon-Caroline" with "Read &amp; execute" permission.&nbsp;
 When I right-clicked the folder and selected "Properties | Security", I saw group "Administrators"&nbsp; and user "Gordon-Rick(Admin)" with "Full Control" permission and user "Gordon-Caroline" with "Read &amp; execute" permission.&nbsp; In contrast to this expected outcome,
 when I selected "Properties | Sharing | Advanced Sharing| Permissions" the groups "Administrators" &amp; "Everyone" had "Full Control" permission.<br />
<br />
With these settings this share **can** be accessed from either the Windows XP Pro or the Windows 8.1 Pro notebook PC by my account and files can be created and deleted there.&nbsp; It seems obvious to me that "Everyone" having "Full Control" permission to this share
 makes it accessible to my administrative account.&nbsp; However, an unrelated standard account on the Windows 8.1 Pro notebook or the Windows 8.1 Pro desktop does **not** have access to this share.&nbsp; It appears that the share permissions have different values depending
 how they are displayed, which I would consider to be a bug, as a user would not know which value to believe.

            This query is getting lots of views but only Bennet Martin has been brave enough to take a stab at helping me to resolve this conundrum.&nbsp; Does anyone in the Microsoft world know how to get Windows 8.1 network shares working properly, or even what the company
 now considers "properly" to be?<br />

<h2>            Headset Mic not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't get my headset to work. The mic suddenly stopped working. I have tried the troubleshooting tips, i followed the guides but nothing helps. I can hear others from the headset, but the mic doesn't work. The audio bubble around my avatar in party doesn't
 move, meaning it doesn't register input sound. I have tried several controllers to connect to, i have tried different headsets. I checked all the xbox settings, i resetted the xbox itself by removing it from the power socket. Nothing helps. This seems to be
 an issue for several people. Is there any update on this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help needed please!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            KVM on USB drops won&#39;t work in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The long story: &nbsp;THIS IS NOT A FASTRING PROBLEM. &nbsp;IT IS A &nbsp;BUILD 10240 PROBLEM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About October 1, 2015 I noticed messages saying USB device not supported. &nbsp;This was on a USB 16gb thumb drive. &nbsp;The next morning my Windows 10 build 10240 and 1 32bit fastring and 1 64bit fastring &nbsp;systems could not be accessed via a Trendnet TK-407k KVM
 that uses 1 cable to transmit usb signals to 4 different computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read a number of comments in the community about&nbsp;KB3093266 and my update history reflected an installation date of 09-30-2015 for that download.</p>
<p>I uninstalled&nbsp;KB3093266 along with all of the updates for September.</p>
<p>This seemed to fix my problem along with&nbsp;UNINSTALL each of the USB drivers in DEVICES and do a restart. &nbsp;It worked. &nbsp;Not sure which solution solved the problem: &nbsp;Uninstall USB or Uninstall KB3093266.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I do know what caused the problem: &nbsp;KB309266.</p>
<p>Today, October 5th, my KVM could not be used again. &nbsp;Update history showed that&nbsp;</p>
<p>offending update, KB3093266 was reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A comment in the Microsoft Community Forum said that another solution would be to remove FAST STARTUP/FAST SHUTDOWN AND TURN OFF AND TURN ON THE SYSTEM. That process did not work for my systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling the KB3093266 and the USB drivers does not seem to be a solutions since Microsoft will send a new download of the update when it notices that the system does not have that update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spend several 8 hour days attempting to fix this problem without luck. &nbsp;ANY suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE FOLLOWING IS TRENDNET SUPPORT INFORMATION--HAVE NOT TRIED YET BUT WILL DO ONE ITEM AT A TIME:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The unit is BUS powered. Please ensure you have disconnected the USB cables from the unit simultaneously so that it loses power and then reconnect it. &nbsp; &nbsp;DONE</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The KVM switch is a non-configurable appliance. &nbsp; UNDERSTAND, THE IT MUST BE MICROSOFT'S PROBLEM.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Please make sure that everything is connected and seated securely to the switch. Do not place any third party hardware between the KVM and the computer. Including any type of interface converters, docking
 stations or extension cables. &nbsp; ALL CABLES ARE DIRECT FROM KVM TO COMPUTERS</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Also make sure you are using the KVM cables intended for use with this switch. It may not work with third party cables. &nbsp; ALL CABLES ARE TRENDNET KVM CABLES</span><br />

<p>This is exactly the complaint that various experts have levelled at Windows 10. &nbsp;No way to control/disable updates as in previous versions of Windows. &nbsp;There is a work-around tool to disable specific updates &amp; drivers, although I haven't tried this myself,
 as my problem was "fixed" by disabling fast startup (-although this only a work-around and isn't really a fix either). &nbsp;Here is the link &amp; instructions to the tool, which I hope works for you:</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi IndiaBlueSky,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Is the video quality affected with the green bar?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Does the same issue occur when the window is full screen?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may use the hardware and devices troubleshooter and check if it lists any issues-</span></span><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try downloading and installing the latest available drivers for the device according to the make and model and check if this resolves the
 issue. You may refer to the below link for assistance -<br />
</span><a href="http://www.avermedia.com/avertv/Support/Download.aspx?Type=Software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.avermedia.com/avertv/Support/Download.aspx?Type=S<span>oftware</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also for updating the drivers you may refer to the below mentioned link and use the steps provided accordingly -<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, you may also try installing and using Windows Vista or XP drivers in compatibility mode on Windows 7 and check if you
 are able to resolve the issue -</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If a program written for an earlier version of
</span><span><span>Windows</span></span></span><span><span> doesn't run correctly; use the Program Compatibility Wizard to change the
 compatibility settings for the program. To change settings for a program manually, use the individual program's Compatibility tab.<br />
You may refer to the below mentioned link for assistance on compatibility mode-<br />

    <title>Touch screen not working &#40;but pen input is&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wi7bit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch screen not working &#40;but pen input is&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The touch screen on my Surface Pro 3 has stopped working, although the pen works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any time I touch it with my finger it does nothing, but the pen will write. The Windows button works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Windows 10 version 1607 (14939.1198)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing a reset (re-flashing using a USB stick) but still nothing. I've tried following the troubleshooting tips
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-the-surface-touchscreen?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> but still no good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have thought that if the screen was broken, the pen wouldn't work. Am I wrong?</p>
