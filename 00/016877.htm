<h2>            When Windows 10 is released, what will happen to us running the Insider Preview&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I'm running Windows 10 on an Asus laptop I received a few months ago. The laptop came pre-installed with Windows 8 as an OEM copy. Fully activated, everything. Fully legitimate. I reserved my Windows 10 copy under Windows 8.1 a couple of months ago and now
 I'm running the Windows 10 Insider Preview as an upgrade over my Windows 8.1 copy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows 10 is fully released, will I have to nuke my Windows 10 preview and reinstall Windows 8.1 just to install Windows 10, or because I upgraded and my license key transferred (never had to put in a license key, so I'm assuming here) will I be able
 to stay on the Insider builds and just wait for the full release? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a bit of searching on this but nothing is quite clear. If I have to reinstall Windows 8.1, does Microsoft offer an ISO that I can put on a flash drive to reinstall? Isn't the Windows 8 product key embedded in the BIOS so I don't need to retrieve
 it manually? Thanks all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: One more thing I should add, my PC came to me with all the UEFI bios **** enabled but I disabled it after a few months to dual boot some Linux distributions.</p>

            <p>From my understanding If you are involved in the insider program, you are already eligible for the upgrade, now as if upgrade means from 7, 8, or 8.1 This I do not know, since Microsoft seems to change their story day by day.&nbsp; I hope it means you will be
 eligible for a Clean Install ISO, due to the fact any "Upgrade" always leaves residual **** that you have to jump thru hoops to delete IE. "Windows.old"&nbsp; Just cross your fingers that since you are participating now you will be able to do a Clean Install.&nbsp;
 As for Nuking your Drive "KillDisk" is the best way I have found and it is a Free program you can find anywhere on the net, depending on drive size takes 20min to 4hours...</p>

            The UEFI is where your Windows 8.1 key was so MS could know you had a legit copy even if you had installed Windows 10 Tech Preview. I suggest re-enabling that. Why didn't you dual boot Windows 10 and Windows 8.1?

<p>Windows 8 was never eligible for the upgrade. You have to upgrade to 8.1 first. It's Windows 7 with SP1 or Windows 8.1. Here's the thing if you choose to stay an insider you will continue to get preview builds. You will always be in some sort of beta test
 cycle. If you want a regular copy of Windows 10 you'll need to opt of the insider program.</p>

            <p>The definitive answer to this question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; If you're running a build of Windows 10 Insider Preview, and you upgraded to that Insider Preview from a Genuine version of Windows 7/8, then when Windows 10 is officially released on the 29th of this month, you receive a full license free of charge.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; If you're running a build of Windows 10 Insider Preview, and you did a clean install, then come the 29th of this month, you'll have to stay in the Windows Insider Program (and thus continue to receive pre-release builds of Windows 10, but at the cost
 of potentially encountering more bugs from said experimental builds) in order to continue using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the Insider Program <em>will</em> continue, we Windows Insiders will <strong>
not</strong> be given full licenses for the OS.&nbsp; If you choose to leave the Insider Program on or after the 29th, you'll be required to purchase a full license at full price in order to keep using it.</p>

            <p>As much as I've read, Windows 10 will be available for the "millions" of the Insiders, as well as for many more Windows 7,8, 8.1 and even Android users. Of course,
<em>for free.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to get Windows 10 on the 29th of July, all you need to do is have Windows Update on. You will get the Windows 10 icon in your taskbar, from which you will sign up for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Insiders only, we will all get Windows 10 as soon as it's out. Again, <em>
for free.</em></p>
<p>As an Insider, we will not stop at Windows 10. We will continue to participate in Windows Previews if we choose to.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that I have a Linux partition. I can't re-enable UEFI because it'll break compatibility with the distro I use. Also, I installed 10 over 8 because I figured I didn't use Windows much anyway so if something went wrong it wasn't a big deal.</p>

<p>Well you didn't state that part before. Worst case you'd have to reinstall 8 then upgrade to 8.1 then upgrade to 10. Hopefully it won't come to that. Well see. If you want to continue to be part of the insider program then you don't need to do anything.
 That much&nbsp;is for sure.</p>

<p>Per Microsoft:</p>
<p>"Microsoft announced that <a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-10-available-from-july-29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 would be released on July 29th</a> and as soon as that announcement was made, we started getting questions about what happens for those participating in the Insider program.
</p>
<p>For those who signed up and downloaded a pre-release build of Windows 10, on July 29th, you will receive the GA (General Availability) build of the OS, Microsoft has confirmed. This should not come as a big surprise but it clears up any bit of confusion
 for those who are using the pre-release bits and want to make the jump to the final release.</p>
<p>The Insider program has been a huge success for Microsoft with millions of users trying out the OS and providing feedback from everything about new features to the icons.</p>
<p>After the release of Windows 10, the Insider program will continue on, as Microsoft
<a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-insider-program-after-rtm-the-options-for-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
has previously confirmed</a>, and with new <a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-redstone-will-come-in-two-waves-june-and-october-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
features coming with Redstone</a>, it makes sense to continue to pilot the OS with those who have already signed up for the program.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been testing Windows 10, know that on July 29th you will get the GA build of the OS and at that time, you will need to decide if you want to stay on the early release path or stick to the stable release channel."</p>
<p>"If you decide to opt-out of the program and upgrade to the 7/29 build you will be subject to exactly the same terms and conditions that govern
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/about?ocid=WIN10_0_WOL_Hero_Home_Windows-10_Null_01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the offer* </a>that was extended to all Genuine Windows 7 and 8.1 customers. This is not a path to attain a license for Windows XP or Windows Vista systems. If your system upgraded from a Genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 license it will remain activated, but
 if not, you will be required to roll back to your previous OS version or acquire a new Windows 10 license. If you do not roll back or acquire a new license the build will eventually expire."</p>

            <p>Wait, what? You mean you purchased every Techical Preview build from Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, but seriously. Microsoft stated far too many times that Windows 10 is free. Nobody confirmed it will remain free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an Insider, you are running genuine Windows Technical Previews. And when the Windows 10 is released, you will still be running Windows Technical Previews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running Windows 7,8,8.1 on Dual Boot or another PC (Company PC) you will be able to upgrade to Windows 10. For free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't forget to upgrade your Android too. If you own one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps. Nothing is yet confirmed, besides upgrading to Windows 10 for free.</p>

<p>Hi ALLANBACUDO,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for the query and we are here to assist you on this.</span></p>
<p><span>I could understand your feeling. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Normally, it will not affect Office when you update Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you reinstall Office to use it:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2019-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download and install or reinstall Office 365 or Office 2019
 on a PC or Mac</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you can’t install Office, I want to collect the following information for further analysis:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Where did you install Office before? Please provide the link.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Which plan have you subscribed?</span></p>
<p><span>3. The screenshot of error message if you couldn’t reinstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h2>            Caller ID showing as 661-xxx-xxxx</h2>
                    <p>I have a real phone number for my Skype - 312-xxx-xxxx. When I contact companies who use automated systems to detect my phone number, it is coming up with random 661 area code numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>661-***********</p>
<p>661-***********</p>
<p>661-***********</p>
<p>661-***********</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last three were calls I placed to eBay within three minutes of each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the Skype app under "Call Settings" I see "When I call from Skype, identify me by unknown number or caller ID"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log into my account, under "Caller ID", I see "Display this number when I call or text mobiles and landlines from Skype" and it properly displays my 312-xxx-xxxx Skype number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the current version of Skype on Windows 10 - v 7.40.0.103</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing these information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The appearance of the Caller ID you set on your account to the phone of the person you're calling still depends on the local telecommunication provider for the country where the receiver is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to troubleshoot this, please consider disabling your Caller ID and enabling it. If the same thing happens, please change the number of your Caller ID, and make a test call if the same thing will happen. The steps on how you can disable, enable and change
 your Caller ID are listed on this support page: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA2561/how-do-i-change-my-caller-identification-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know what the result will be.</p>

    <title>Calculate Grade Weighted Average in Excel w&#47;o all Grades - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maiaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calculate Grade Weighted Average in Excel w&#47;o all Grades</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am creating an excel sheet to track my grades in my class, so that I can calculate my grade in the class as I go. My grades are weighted and I used sumproduct() to calculate the weighted average of my grades. However, I haven't received all of my grades
 and I want to calculate my weighted average while ignoring categories that don't have grades in for them yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if the final exam is worth 35 points and i have grades for quizzes and homework weighting 50 points but I don't know I'm also missing a special project weighted at 5 points...I want it to calculate my weighted average ignoring the categories
 that I don't yet have grades for. So it would weight it by the grades for quizzes and homework, but not by my final and special projects which I haven't yet received a grade for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time, once I add in a grade for my special project, I want it to automatically start counting in that additional weighted grade w/o having to change my formula. I'm sure I need an If() statement, but I'm just not sure how I need to put it all
 together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help me!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I'll try to answer your question.</p>
<p>You have omitted one crucial data.... do you use a 32-bit or&nbsp;a 64-bit operating system ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find your scanpst.exe in the following path:</p>
<p><font>For a 32-bit Windows</font></p>
<p><font>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12 </font></p>
<font>
<p><br />
For a 64-bit Windows </p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>do you know how to use the path ?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 Home and Student stopped working on my Asus T100</h2>
                    <p>I bought my Asus T100 with pre-installed Office 2013 - Home and Student edition and everything was working fine. However, suddenly office stopped working and when i click any icon nothing happens. At first i thought probably the shortcut is not working so
 i tried to open the excel/word/ppt etc from their respective folders but still no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i tried repairing the office through windows/control panel and it detected the problem as microsoft office click-to-run stopped working and then i get a message windows is trying to repair but then the computer hangs and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how can i get my office files working again.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Restarted Outlook several times and tried my new / correct password and no joy.</p>

            Use the Mail App or your browser for your http and imap mail. Office Outlook is for POP mail. If you have a pop mail acct from your provider you don't need the connector. Don't be confused by the new name for Hotmail--Outlook.com. That is not related to
 Office just a bad recycling of the name..

            <p>Outlook 2010 - as desktop app - can be POP mail, but uses own protocol to talk to O365 or exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think source of the problem was my FortinetVPN client that seems to somehow prevent some updates to download and do other funny things.</p>
<p>Since uninstalled, I've been able to install all needed updates and Outlook 2010 connects now fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it fails for you, try manual method, you can get server details on About page of OWA.</p>

            <p>That's true about Outlook not being Outlook but.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you try to set up a Hotmail account on Outlook it asks for you to download the Microsoft Connector, when that's done it works 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been running like that on several PC's and this one fine pre-Wind 10 without an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to enter my password and it just keeps rejecting it..... No message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted my Mail profile and deleted / reinstalled Microsoft Connector but no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The built in Mail app is fine, but stacks of limitations.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you search for older messages .... you can see them but not delete them... WTF?&nbsp; That's pathetic... same as on my WP8.1 you can find and see old message but cant delete them.</p>

            <p>Also, just tried adding a secondary Hotmail account to Outlook using the MS Connector.&nbsp; worked fine, 100% first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried adding my main email back in and got the same problem.&nbsp; The connector just wont accept it.&nbsp; Clicked on the "forgot your password" link which took me to the page
<a href="http://g.msn.com/XXXXX/X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://g.msn.com/XXXXX/X</a> which fails to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect its something to do with loading the same accounts twice maybe?&nbsp; Not an issue in the past.... as least I know OL and the Connector are working fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just created a local profile on the pc,&nbsp; tried setting up OL again.&nbsp; same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried setting up manually using imap settings, wouldn't accept the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had a brainwave, thought it may be 2 stage authentication and tried my authenticator app.. no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume its something to do with my Hotmail account at root level.&nbsp; I do get the error message on ALL my Win8 devices saying
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is unavailable at the top right on the mail apps... across 3 separate devices.&nbsp; Maybe this is a connected issue.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This could be a possible hardware or software issue. To isolate this, have you tried checking if the phone was up-to-date as well? Go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update</strong><strong> &amp; security</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>updates</strong>. Does this also happen if you use another Map application? Internet connection could also affect the performance of the app. You may also use

<p>Phone is up to date. Internet connection is fine both on cellular and wifi. I checked surrounding areas as well and noticed its happening for Japan too. No local streets. HK, China, Taiwan were fine. I do remember Maps not supporting these two countries
 initially. So I find it odd that its happening to both of these particular two countries. I know this because our company travels frequently to Asia for business. I checked a version of google maps and it works fine.</p>

            I can now confirm others are having this issue and still no word from Microsoft. This is ridiculous.

<h2>            Nokia 6085 - Mac user needs info on transferring music</h2>
                    As a Mac computer user, my phone (6085) is apparently not supported by Multimedia Transfer, so I cannot use the cable that came with my phone package to transfer data between my phone and my Mac.&nbsp; I've transferred a few photos using Bluetooth, but I can't
 seem to transfer music from iTunes onto the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anyone help me?&nbsp; Thanks.

            Since no one could offer any suggestions on solving this problem, I found a way to do it myself.&nbsp; I don't want to ruin my Mac by running any Windows apps on it, so I went to Costco and bought an Acer Netbook for $299 - which has Windows XP on it.&nbsp; I then
 was able to download to it PC Suites and was able to transfer easily the music and pictures I wanted on my phone.&nbsp; It's a rather expensive way to solve the problem, but, as I said, everyone who writes software programs seems to hate Mac users, so I've found
 the little Acer Netbook has actually come in handly a few times for other non-Mac issues.&nbsp; Hope this may help someone else.

<p>Hi Brens, as a Mac user I'm in the same boat. I've set up the bluetooth connectivity with my Mac but can't figure out how to transfer some photos from the phone to the computer. Can you explain how you did this? I went to Bluetooth data transfer, but was
 stumped as to where to go from there. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK I figured it out myself and will post this for other Mac users with the same dilemma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turns out it's as simple as can be. After you've set up your bluetooth on the phone to connect with the Mac, make sure the phone is on and the bluetooth is ON both on the phone and the Mac (should have a bluetooth icon in the upper right of your menu bar
 (on any Mac w BT). Just pull down from that icon and choose your device (my Nokia phone) and select your options. To pull the photos off your phone to your Mac, go to Browse device. Up pops a window with your media folders that are on your phone. Photos are
 in the images folder, videos in the video folder etc. Just highlight the ones you want to transfer to your Mac, &nbsp;hit Get, and in the Mac finder window that opens, navigate to the folder you want to drop these photos into. (I made a new folder in my Pictures
 folder called Phone Pix). When you've finished downloading the photos, you can then select any or all of them in the phone window and conveniently delete them from your phone memory, saving space for future pix.</p>
<p>Hope this helps other Mac users with this incompatible Nokia 6085 phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried downloading an MP3 file this way, through the Nokia&gt;browse device option. Navigated to the music folder on the phone, hit the SEND button, navigated to an MP3 file on my Mac. Looked like it was downloading....I had the progress bar up there
 humming along. But when it finished it said error, couldn't complete download. So I'm thinking that maybe the problem is that I don't have enough space on my phone chip for a 4MB music file. I don't have an extra SD chip in the phone. Maybe if I did, it'd
 have room for the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry brens, I thought I might have solved it for you.</p>

<p>Great advice so I thought I might add my bit regarding music files!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having tried to transfer MP3 files over to my 5230 (same difference as the 6085 I guess) using the USB cable realised it wasn't going to work so here's what I did and it worked albeit a bit slow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1/ &nbsp;Copy music files from your user/music library folder - not iTunes folder, to a new folder on the desktop which I called "To Nokia" as single mP3 files not as a folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2/ &nbsp;Open Bluetooth on the Mac (top right) and select&nbsp; "Nokia 5230/send file" and after authorising the phone to receive the transfer will begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3/ &nbsp;These music files are then deposited into the messages folder on the phone and will then require to be opened and options/save to the music folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4/ &nbsp;After these files have been saved each file will have to be deleted from your messages folder or you might exhaust your memory capacity thereby stopping the transfer.&nbsp; This obviously depends on how big your phone memory memory is. &nbsp;I could
 only transfer about 5 mp3 files at a time before my memory was nil and I had to delete some thing from my messages folder or otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transfers will come across ay about 44 kb/s average but will slow down drastically if you are charging your phone at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My perception is that Nokia don't make this easier because of potentially supporting a rival competitor with the iPhone which in my view will always be a more sophisticated device but costing a great deal more unfortunately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps and that I haven't forgotten anything in the process! &nbsp;Best of luck!</p>

<p>It is a hell of a work, to transfer each single file via bluetooth, but I managed thanks to your detailed description. Thanks a lot Mr. or Ms MiqsPix ;)). Soooo helpful!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to Nokia resp Apple .... hm, not userfriendly at all, what they do!</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>josh-1059</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suggestions about "create a new notebook, and copy the content from the affected notebook and paste the content in the new one, then sync the new notebook, check if it can sync normally" is applied
 to the situation when the sync error only happens in one specific notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the situation on your side, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.Does the error message 0xE0001464 happen in a specific notebook or all notebooks in OneNote?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Where do you save the notebooks? In OneDrive for business or personal OneDrive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Please go to the online location where you save the notebooks and check if you can find the affected notebook.</p>
<p>Please let us know the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.How do you move the notes to another notebook? Via
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.OneNote version and IOS version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.Regarding the "loading page", could you provide a related screenshot?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Thanks for your update and the detailed information.</p>

<p>Based on your description, you can find the affected notebooks in personal OneDrive in the browser, you cannot open the notebooks normally on iPad and Mac.</p>
<p>You may open the notebooks in the browser first, then click
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still cannot open the affected notebooks in OneNote client on Mac and iPad, since the affected notebooks are stored in personal OneDrive,<span>&nbsp;
</span>we kindly suggest you post the issue in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/onedrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Additionally, the second notebook which has now successfully "fully synched" is trying (without success) to load the documents , (as shown as above)</p>

<h2>            Mobile network connection issue &#40;Cell&#43;Wi-Fi&#41; in Lumia 630 after latest update</h2>
                    <p>Hi All<br />
<br />
After latest Lumia 630 phone update I have random issues with network connection. Network indicator shows good connection however 'cellular + SIM' screen shows no network connection. In addition Wi-Fi connection becomes unusable - no internet connection neither
 via Cell network nor Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround is phone restart, after that I can make and accept calls and have Internet connection and can use Wi-Fi. When the issue is detected the phone is switching off very-very long (more than a minute to turn off, just 'Good bye' screen. This issue
 is critical as there's no sign of yet another connection issue while I cannot receive incoming calls being 'unavailable', so need to restart phone again to be able to make calls. Soft reset doesn't help to avoid the issue in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI this is not a SIM issue. Re-inserting the SIM didn't help - connection is ok after phone restart but just suddenly disappears without any signs - I only know when someone tell me I was not able to call, my phone was dropping incoming messages being 'unavailable'.
 Another issue - phone is switching off very long when the connection lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a way to roll back the phone update or anything else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I am on the road 2,000 miles from home and unable to do work including access to calendar on MS Outlook.</p>

            <p>Michael,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt response with in an hour of my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and used the OffCAT.&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered the problem was that in the process of installing a third party tax program,&nbsp; some how the entire Office 2016 application had been moved to a new Program file&nbsp;location under the earlier file name of the tax
 program.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then&nbsp;able to correct this by copying &nbsp;and pasting the&nbsp;all the Office program files of the&nbsp;"root"&nbsp;into the proper location C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\MicrosoftOffice\Root\Office 16\...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then running the on-line repair process for office&nbsp;fixed all remaining problems with the MS Office 2016 EXCEPT, that the program revereted to a non-activated condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used the link for contacting MS which you had provided.</p>
<p>Although Microsoft had been able to activate the program two weeks ago without the activation key,</p>
<p>the technician I spoke with today said it was not possible because the program no longer showed as being associated with my MS account.&nbsp; So, I can see my spread sheets but I cannot manipulate them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you have any further suggestions on activation without having the activation key in hand, I am left waiting two weeks until return to the home office.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately I still have the old computer with me and will now move all the data files back to
 the old computer for use with office 2010.&nbsp; I do not know if the files created with Office 2016 are backward compatible, but I will soon find out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for your help and I now have a great new tool with the OffCAT program.</p>
<p>

    <title>How do I creat relationships between forms&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I creat relationships between forms&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I'm new to access and I'd really appriciate some help trying to get my forms and tables to work. I have access 2007.
<br />
<br />
Basically I'm making a database to keep records for my wedding. I've got two tables 'Family Group' and 'Guest'. I've created two split forms. The first is a Family Group form which displays the general details of the family group i.e. name, address, and other
 contact details. The bottom of the form then displays the table so that I can change the record to exsisting groups, so that I can see what I've got. I've then added a command button which opens the guest form in a pop out so that I can view or add guests
 to the family group. this is another split table. That all works fine, but I cant make the guest form work how I would like it to. I want it to do two main things;<br />
<br />
1/ I want the bottom half of the split table to display only the details of the people in the selected family group (so I somehow need to link it to the Family Group ID field in the Family group form - I've already made a one to many relationship link in the
 relationship area).<br />
<br />
2/ I would like the Guest form to automatically assign the Family group field from the family group form to each new guest I add.
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be great!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Helen Rachel<br />

            <p><span>Hello Helen,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have a&nbsp;couple options to populate your family group field for new records in your guest form.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first option is as William suggested in using a form/subform design. I don't believe you can use multiple split forms when using
 a form/subform design so you may need to change the form view to single form. To setup form/subform design, you would open the family group form in design view and then drad the guest form to into the family group form. It sounds like you have defined the
 relationship for these tables so the subform should automatically set what are called the linkmastfields/linkchildfields properties. When you open the family group form in form view you will only see the related records of the current family group in the guest
 form. When you add a new guest it will be added for the currently selected family group.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The second option would be to continue using the 2 separate forms. Since there's no formal relationship having two forms, you can specify
 the default value of the family group field in your guest form to pull the current value from the family group form when a new record is created.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the guest form in design view</span></p>
<p><span>2. Locate the family group field and select it</span></p>
<p><span>3. Open the properties window if it's not open</span></p>
<p><span>4. Under the data tab for this field you should see a default value property</span></p>
<p><span>5. Enter the form reference to your family group field from the family group form.
</span></p>
<p><span>It would look something like this Forms![family group]![family group id]</span></p>
<p><span>6. Save and close the guest form</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Set default values for fields or controls</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.For the first question, you need to create a table relationship between these two tables by using Relationships window, or by dragging a
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>field onto a datasheet from the Field List pane.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>#Create a table relationship</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/guide-to-table-relationships-HA010120534.aspx#_Toc269752118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/guide-to-table-relationships-HA010120534.aspx#_Toc269752118</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then you can refer to the following articel to create a form that contains a subform.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/create-a-form-that-contains-a-subform-a-one-to-many-form-HA010098674.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/create-a-form-that-contains-a-subform-a-one-to-many-form-HA010098674.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.You pass the key value from main form value to subform or pop-up.To open the popup form use this type of thing</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "[NameOfPopup]", , , "[PKey] = " &amp; Me.PKeyID, , acDialog</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the primary key is a text field use quotes like this</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "[NameOfPopup]", , , "[PKey] = """ &amp; Me.PKeyID &amp; """"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: replace [NameOfPopup] with your form's name</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Excel Power Query can no longer connect to Salesforce &#40;invalid - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Power Query can no longer connect to Salesforce &#40;invalid credentials error&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I was successfully able to use Power Query to connect to Salesforce objects until yesterday. Now I receive the error message "The credentials provided are invalid" when trying to establish a Salesforce connection or refresh existing queries. I then click
 the "Sign in as different user" button and re-enter my Salesforce credentials, which gives me a different error: "The service returned an invalid token." The same Salesforce connection in Power BI Desktop works without any problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excel version: Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013</p>

            I'd email Nokia using the contact form (link on menu at top of page).<br />

The more E70 users who raise the issue, and suggest pulling the update until this matter is resolved.

<p>Thanks for the reply. I don't have widows 10 on my phone yet. I take it that the windows maps only works with Windows 10 and my windows 8 may not working with it.</p>
