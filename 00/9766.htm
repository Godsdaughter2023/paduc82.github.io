<h2>            Outlook 2016 Hangs when Opening Recurring Appointments</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been at this issues for a couple of days and can't seem to find any solution. I'm hoping maybe the community can provide some insight - or maybe someone else has run into a similar issue.</p>
<p>A couple of our users are experiencing issues where Outlook seems to just hang/crash when they are opening up any recurring appointment. We are running Outlook 2016 (16.0.6001.1078) 64-bit&nbsp;on Exchange 2013 CU12.</p>
<p>From the event viewer on the client's system&nbsp;all I get is:</p>


<p><b>Description:</b></p>

<p>A problem caused this program to stop interacting with Windows.</p>


<p><b>Problem signature:</b></p>

<p>I've tried the suggestions mentioned <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Best-practices-when-using-the-Outlook-Calendar-d93f72d3-2361-4e0d-8d6a-5c4939c17f39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            We are experiencing exactly the same issue. The problem only occurs when mailboxes are in online mode. If they are changed to Cached mode, recurring appointments/events open every time without error.

<p>We understand you,&nbsp;<span>dheevha. Nokia assures that all phones undergo strict quality check before being sold. Let us further isolate the issue with your Nokia XL.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you already tried rebooting your phone by removing and re-placing the back cover and the battery? If this won't work, try resetting the phone by going to
<strong>Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Backup and reset &gt; Factory reset</strong>. This will delete all your files. If you already saved your contacts or files on the new Nokia XL, make a backup under<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Backup and reset &gt; Create a backup</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If these fixes won't work, the issue might be related with the hardware. Best to contact the store where you bought the phone and ask for your warranty options. Keep us posted on how it will go.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By the way, welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions!&nbsp;:cathappy:</span></p>

            I bought a Nokia xl 17 ,days ago. Today some vertical lines appeared on the display screen. I tried by opening and replacing the battery, did factory reset but got no improvement. What should I do? The Nokia care is very far from here? I bought Nokia thinking
 it to be a good product but my hard earned money has gone waste.

            Sadly these things happen to any device, so either return to point of purchase or a nokia care facility for inspection.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try to follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Connect your device to the computer with a cable (or via Bluetooth if you prefer)</p>
<p>- Go to Control panel -&gt;&nbsp;System -&gt; Device manager</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Look for "Nokia N96 Modem" or similar under Modems</p>
<p>-&nbsp;If you find one, right-click for properties</p>
<p>- In there, you should find a "Query Modem" diagnostic button, click on it</p>
<p>- search outputted text for "Success" (or failure)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are failures reported, remove the entire N96 Modem entry from under Modems in the Device Manager window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Finally, open Ovi Suite and go to Tools -&gt; Add new device</p>
<p>- Re-connect the cable and you should see your device</p>
<p>- Go thru the Add new device wizard, (this should re-install the modem drivers)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After these steps, try connecting to the internet again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I had the same experience of not being able to reach any kind of live human after attempting to do so three times. Even a call center far, far away would better than going through all the prompts and being deceived into thinking that at the
 end of all the hoops, you would finally score a live person to talk to.</p>

            Hi Eric, I am Rob, an independent and a 12 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers.
 If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved. <br />
<br />
Not exactly sure what you are saying however if you even think that you received malware it is better to be safe than sorry.
<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detectas
 the cause. <br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check withthese
 to an extreme overkill point. <br />
<br />
How do I find and remove a virus? <br />

TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or notdoes
 not mean you should not check with the other methods below. <br />

    <title>How to extract objects embedded in PPT 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yudi郑  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to extract objects embedded in PPT 2003</h2>
                    <p>I want to extract embedded objects from the PPT 2003 via Borland C++ Builder, but&nbsp;it is not OK to get the objects by the method of
<em><u>copying&nbsp; to clipboard&nbsp; </u></em>when I get the goal object.</p>
<p>Following is the code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PptApp.OlePropertyGet("ActiveWindow").OlePropertyGet("Selection").OleFunction("Copy");<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::OpenClipboard(NULL); // 打开剪贴板<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HANDLE hClip=::GetClipboardData(CF_ENHMETAFILE);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HENHMETAFILE hEnhMetaFile=(HENHMETAFILE)hClip;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HENHMETAFILE hMetaFile=CopyEnhMetaFile(hEnhMetaFile,ObjName.c_str() );//保存到文件<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DeleteEnhMetaFile(hMetaFile);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CloseClipboard(); </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an easier way to get the objects by using the similar function <em>SaveAs
</em>as in VBA?</p>
<p>What will you do with the Object <em>ijShape </em>searched already by the BCB?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank U!</p>

            <p>An object in PPT&nbsp;might be anything ... a chart from Excel or MSGraph, a table from Word, a picture that's been copy/pasted or inserted from some other program.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In some cases, you can call the object's .Activate method to activate it in the application that created the object (assuming it's installed on the computer) and, if the application permits, automate IT to save the object as an application-native file (e.g.
 an XLS file from an Excel object).</p>

            In 2003 "binary" format the objects are embedded in an unreadable mess. If you can't extract them using Steve's approach another way would be to SAVE AS to 2007/2010 format.&nbsp; This separate out the various components. With a little luck you will be able
 to find the embedded objects as separate files.<br />
<br />
All you have to do is append the .zip file extension to the 2007 PPTX file name for Windows Explorer to treat it as a ZIP file. You will be able to navigate into the file structure. I know for sure that embedded pictures are pulled out as separate picture files.
 I hope the same applies for other embedded objects.<br />

            While pictures, sounds and media files can generally be extracted by saving as a zip and opening the zip, OLE objects tend to end up as BIN files in the Embeddings subdirectory. &nbsp;These tend to be approximately the same size as the original embedded file
 (if there is one) but are slightly different. &nbsp;Perhaps there's a header or the like added ... you'd have to compare the embedded file with the original to work that out. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Extracting these, assuming there's any value in it, would be a matter of writing software or using a pre-written library to extract components of a ZIP file. &nbsp;WAY beyond the scope of this forum.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want to extract embedded objects from PPT 2003 and previous format files, you'll need to learn the file format and write code to do the job. &nbsp;The format's documented, that's about all I know.</div>

    <title>Database performs differently on laptop compared with PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aw_style_66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Database performs differently on laptop compared with PC</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 7 PC running Office 365 and is currently running Access 2013. Back in 2005 I created a database to record songs and various bits of information about them. I recently upgraded the database to accdb format and all was fine. The database works
 without error on my PC but encounters problems on my Windows 8.1 laptop whether I access the database from OneDrive, Dropbox or a USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems I have encountered so far are :</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Microsoft Office database or project contains a missing or broken reference to the MSCAL.OCX version 7.0 file</li><li>When I try to run one of my reports I get an error message saying that UCase is not a defined funtion.</li></ul>
<p>On investigation I have found that the missing or broken reference refers to Microsoft Calendar Control 11.0 but I cannot find any reference to it. All my forms with dates have 'for dates' shown in the 'Show Date Picker Property'</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for UCase being an undefined function I am at a complete loss as the function is clearly there in the list of functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand is why my laptop version of Office 365 performs differently to the PC version. Both machines are set to automatically update Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>New Outlook not indexing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m_hyde  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Outlook not indexing</h2>
                    <p>We were having issues with our 2016 outlook poping up as not an authorized copy, since we bought the PC's from a 3rd party preloaded and didn't have the actual key we decided to go ahead and subscribe to Office 2016 and install a new copy.&nbsp; &nbsp;I uninstalled
 the original office and installed the new one (We did this on a couple of PC's). Everything seemed fine, when we opened outlook for the first time all of our emails were showing and new emails were coming in, it looked as if everything transferred seamlessly.&nbsp;
 However we noticed when we searched for emails, only the old emails were showing up in the results, all of the new emails that were coming in after the new outlook was installed did not show up when searched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deselecting outlook from indexing, rebooting and then selecting again, this did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried rebuilding the index, this did not work and as of right now now emails are showing up in search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is welcome, The computer I am tried to get working is Windows 7 64 bit, we also have a windows 10 PC that I have not tried any thing on yet since I am afraid I will loose the ability to search all together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email is a pop/smtp system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<br />You can turn off desktop search functionality and use outlook's (slower) built in search.

            Did you restart Outlook? 
<br />
<br />Do you have 16.0.9001.2171  and are event id 3083 in the event viewer? It's possible the cause is something else, especially if you have a much older build. (If you have a subscription, you should have this version or newer, but retail/perpetual version will be much older.)

            &gt;&gt; The PC is 64 bit so not sure why the 32 version downloaded when I installed it form the Microsoft web site.
<br />32-bit is the default currently. If you want 64-bit, you can uninstall office, reboot (not required, but a good idea), then go to office.com - click the link to see additional install options. Your outlook profiles and office customizations will be picked up by the 64-bit version. 
<br />
<br />I don't think it will fix this problem, but Microsoft will be switching to 64-bit default in the future (expected with the release of 2019), so you'll be ready for it. The only reason not to switch is if you use addins or 3rd party utilities that need 32-bit office.

            Yeah, i didn't think it would help - the indexing issues are related to Outlook or the data file, not the bitness. 
<br />
<br />One thing that helped in previous search issues was changing the scope - search would fail in an all mailbox search but work if the scope was limited to the current mailbox or current folder.

<p>This is also happening in our organization. We have about 10+ users with Office 2016 Home and Business installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build number is: Version 1803 Build 9126.2152</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search is no longer working. It get's the error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went wrong and your search couldn't be completed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the error that we receive when searching. All emails tested were on our Exchange account. The only workaround so far is to downgrade Office 2016 to&nbsp; Build 9126.2116 will fix your search issues temporarily, however, downgrading is never a good idea
 when security is involved. We require all of our clients to be up to date with all software, so having an update break the search is not good for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some things that we have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating Windows 7/10.</p>
<p>Reinstalling Office.</p>
<p>Repairing Office.</p>
<p>Repairing PST file with SCANPST.</p>
<p>Turning Windows Search off.</p>
<p>Recreating the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be replicated every time regardless of the computer with Office 2016 Home and Business Build 9126.2152.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm currently speaking with Microsoft Support on the issue and will update if we find any information.</p>

<p>For anyone wondering what is the cause of our issues. Here is the fix that resolved the search issues for us. If you are on Exhcnage, Outlook uses this thing called Fast Search. Something in the new updates has screwed with it. Using this registry entry,
 it causes Windows to use Windows Search only instead of using the fast search.</p>

<h2>            Rule does not work if BCC to a recipient.</h2>
                    <p>When I send an email to&nbsp;multiple recipients and I do not want them all to see who else is copiedt I send via bcc. This works fine, but I have a rule that puts a copy of any email sent to a particular recipient into a folder. When sent through bcc a copy
 is not kept. </p>
<p>eg. The rule is: Apply this rule after I send the message sent to "Fred" and on this machine only move a copy to the "Fred" folder.</p>
<p>The rule works fine if Fred is in the To or cc.</p>
<p>Anyone able to help on this one please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Project 2010 - Unable to correctly set up recurring tasks on the 6th business day of the month</h2>
                    I'm trying to set up a recurring task on the 6th "working day" of the month.&nbsp; I've added non-working holidays to my standard calendar and selected the standard calendar on the recurring task dialog box.&nbsp; I select the 6th day of every one month, however
 instead of scheduling the task on the 6th business day of each month starting with Sept 2012 it schedules the task on Sept 6th, and the 6th calendar day of every month except October which is correctly scheduled on October 8th. This seems like a bug to me.
 Is there any other setting I've missed?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>It's not a bug since no documentation mentions it as a feature, so it's normal it doesn't work like that.</p>
<p>There is a (laborious, but still) way to solve it.</p>
<p>Make a new calendar whereby the first 5 business days of each month are nonworking.
</p>
<p>Make your recurring task to start the 1st of each month</p>
<p>Now assign the new calendar to the detail tasks of the recurring task</p>
<p>(Select all detail task, right-click, Task&nbsp;Information, advanced, Calendar)</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>

            m0si,
<div>Jan provided a clever approach but there is another way that doesn't require a custom calendar. Don't use a recurring task. Simply enter each task directly on the 6th working day of each month.</div>

<h2>            Microsoft phone support</h2>
                    <p>I desperately need help. I got a faulty Microsoft phone, which was bought from Microsoft store. I tried to contact their support, I was redirected to B2X site. I have requested a repair, B2X sent me a DHL label with the instructions.</p>
<p>Now the fun bit: DHL doesn't accept the parcel, because B2X didn't include DHL account number, that they could charge.</p>
<p>B2X say DHL should accept the parcel and because phone is under warranty everything should be free for me.</p>
<p>I spoke to 3 different DHL agents, I spoke to 1 B2X agent on the phone and had web chats with 3 of them. In total I have spent more than 4 hours of my time reading/listening "go there do that".</p>
<p>In case it matters this is happening in UK.</p>

            <p>I've been a Microsoft/Nokia Lumia supporter from the beginning, never had a problem with any device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week the display on my 950 stopped working, this was on Tues 27 Sep. I tried to use the Microsoft online repair system on https://devicesupport.microsoft.com/en-gb which never worked and kept failing at different steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to speak to support several time but never got through. Spoke to the main support where I actualy got through to a person who transferred me, then I got cut off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 days later I awoke to find 3 missed calls from the MS device support number at 0200-0230 in the morning!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I was away fro a couple of days, came back and tried to use the online support again and started to get diverted to B2X with no explanantion, after a quick google it became apparent that MS have outsourced their mobile device support to B2X. A momentary
 piece of optimism made me think that something might now get sorted. As this was the first time I had dealt with B2X I wanted to enter their online chat so make sure everything was covered. So I entered my phone IMEI and clicked search or whatever and got
 nothing, a constant query that did not complete. Tried this a couple of times then discovered the region field which was not obvious nor indicated as a required field, set this and run the same query and it returned almost instantly. &nbsp;Found my device and stated
 in warranty as I expected it to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I entered the online chat and was presented with an operator who spoke poor English or was using a poor translation program, all I wanted to clarify was that the phone would be repaired under warranty,they told me my phone was not under warranty which
 prompted a brief disagreement and some confusion with the poor English from the operator. &nbsp;What is the point in entering your personal and device info and it returning the warranty status if these details are not then parsed to the chat window?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got so frustrated in the chat I simply closed the window and just went to the 'Send in device for repair' option, my device was correctly identified again as being under warranty. I went through this process swiftly and was finally amazed at how simple
 it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received the email from B2X with my shipping label and instruction to go to my local drop off point or arrange collection. So, as nobody is in at home during the working day I went 10 miles to my local Staples which is listed as a drop off point, the Staples
 employee looked slightly confused when he couldn't accept the item without a customer account number, he spoke to DHL there and then on the phone who informed him I should arrange a collection or go to my local DHL depot (20miles away). So I thought I'd take
 an opportunity to arrange a collection when someone would be home, spoke to DHL today on the phone myself and was informed that I couldn't arrange collection without the account number of who produced the shipping label. The DHL operator was unable to determine
 this through the way bill number, tracking number, source or destination address and advised me to get back to them with the account number or they cannot do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another webchat with B2X (better English speaking operator this time) and I get told that they have escalated the issue, I gave them my opinion and also referenced this thread. Now I'm waiting on a resolution from them. 10 days in and I have not been able
 to send my phone for repair, luckily I still have my old Lumia and am using that however disappointing it is each time I take it from my pocket. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is horrendously poor customer service from both Microsoft and B2X, I have nothing against DHL as it isn't their fault.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having been a fan on WP for so long and choosing them above any other I now have lost all faith.. Unlike you Moreno I bought my phone outright and use a SIM only plan, also currently exploring other options, I still love my 950 but would I want to deal with
 this level of customer service again should something go wrong, absolutely not!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not what I expect from a company who's flagship device I bought and paid a premium for!!!</p>

            <p>Finally got to the bottom of this, for anyone with the same issue returning something to B2X with a DHL label, the account number to provide DHL with is '958791155'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is valid for returns from the UK, I'd like to think that they'll change their processes for this but based on my experience so far......... I doubt it!.</p>

            I had the same horrendous experience with them.&nbsp; B2X seems to give you the run around to try NOT&nbsp; to help customers whose phones are still under warranty.&nbsp; For some reason, they state that my phone is not under warranty even though i purchased the phone
 less than a year ago.&nbsp; Like you, I love the Windows Phone platforms, as it facilitates my ability to link the phone to my desktop/laptop.&nbsp; I was even contemplating purchasing one of their flagship phones, but not after the poor customer service provided by
 B2X.&nbsp; They lost a customer and I will be switching over to Apple, a company that actually addresses issues that customers are facing.&nbsp; It really pains me to do so because I love the Windows Phone, but I do not want to deal with the chaos that is B2X again
 if a phone that I paid hundreds of dollars for does not receive service when it is still under warranty.&nbsp;

            <p>I had the same when I wanted to sent my Lumia 930 for repair from the Netherlands. The local DHL shop could not accept the parcel. I called DHL and they told to make an appointment with DHL and they would&nbsp;pick up the parcel or to deliver the parcel to the
 DHL&nbsp;depot. As we live close to the depot we&nbsp;delivered it there. Tracking showed that the parcel has arrived at the service point within 1 day. Now I am waiting.... I hope they are able to fix my phone and that I get it back soon!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the whole I do not like the procedure and contact with B2X. It is difficult to get in contact with them. They did not call me back after several "call me back requests"&nbsp;and I had to wait for more than 1 hour to start a web chat.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expected better service&nbsp;from microsoft and hope they will improve! </p>

            <p>Having read the thread I was less than confident about sending my phone off for repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a Microsoft Lumia 950 XL for almost a year and think it is a great phone. It looks good and works like a dream. About 2 weeks a go, without warning, it started to freeze and eventually reboot a couple of times a day. This got progressively worse
 and I contacted B2X to try and resolve it. With their guidance I used the windows recovery tool to reinstall my software. This seemed to work but later that day it happened again. It got steadily worse whether or not I was charging my phone (thus eliminating
 the possibility of the battery being faulty). I arranged via the Microsoft website to have my phone sent for repair to the designated Microsoft repair centre in Hungary. I printed of the label and affixed it to my well wrapped phone and included a detailed
 description of the fault and the efforts thus far in trying to resolve it. I looked up my local DHL drop off point (a newsagent 4 miles away) and dropped of the parcel. The package was scanned and......that was it! no problem regarding account numbers and
 payment. It would appear that they have resolved this issue. The only issue was that I was not issued with a receipt for my precious (but wonky) phone. However, whilst still in the shop I accessed the DHL website and entered the tracking number and my parcel
 had been updated! Whoo Hoo! Ok, I still need to wait and see how it goes from here, but I thought I would put this update on for other folk to see.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Update 28/03/2017***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my phone back from Hungary less than two weeks after sending it away. They had marked on it that there was no fault found and they couldn't replicate the issue. Prior to sending it I had reset my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I got it back I restored my phone from the most recent backup. The phone worked absolutely fine all day with no restarts and I noted that it had the latest windows update scheduled to be installed (re-installed) at 0330hours the next morning. The next
 day after the update, you've guessed it, the phone was back to constant restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case the issue is 100% the latest update from Microsoft. </p>
<p>
Fellow sufferers, any suggestions?

<p>Fellow sufferers, any suggestions? </p>

<p>I've got exactly the same problem with my 950 XL - becoming constant freeze/reboot - only way to reboot, though is by powering on from an external source.</p>
<p>Here in Australia, we use Toll Ipec - not DHL.</p>
<p>Sent my phone off, and it was stuck in the Toll distribution Centre (it took 1 day to get there at destination - for 3 weeks!!!! - because there was insufficient information on the label. They couldn't even return to sender!</p>
<p>After hours of calls (probably "only" two!), the service centre finally got it - and promptly sent it back, marked "unable to replicate fault".</p>
<p>What a surprise - this unit being 9 months into 2 year warranty, by the way.</p>
<p>Aargh!</p>
<p>I've tried all of the resets, latest updates, with SSD, without SSD, new battery - nothing helps.</p>

    <title>O2 Atom Life auto shutdown problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darren cheng  say:</h3>
<h2>            O2 Atom Life auto shutdown problem</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I had recently purchased my new O2 Atom Life PDA phone. It has been upgraded to Windows Mobile 6. Ever since I got my phone on Aug 07, I kept noticing that my phone will automatically shutdown even when I was not using the phone. I had logged
 many cases to O2 helpdesk but they had done nothing but just refresh my OS (which I can do it myself).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; It even came to a state where this auto shutdown problem crash my phone and O2 needed to replace a new motherboard for the phone. I had argued my way to get a brand new phone for replacement. But even with the new phone, I am still experiencing
 the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I had tried various troubleshooting methods like: - (1) ensuring no 3rd party software installed, (2) constantly ensuring all running programs are stopped to release memory, (3) changing a new sim card (even though the existing sim card had
 no problem).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I am stuck at this moment as I am running out of ideas what to look out for. I had enabled the Error reporting feature in the Windows Mobile, hoping that Microsoft can help to provide advise. So far no feedback nor improvement observed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I will be greatful if anyone can give me some tips or share similiar experience on this case. I will like to gather more information on this so that I can make complains to the O2 helpdesk as they were not helpful in resolving my problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and regards</p>

            Hey guys, I am sorry to tell you this so late in the piece because you have probably already thrown your O2 over a cliff by now!&nbsp; I have been close several times!<br />
<br />
A friend of mine and I found out the solution to this problem only by accident really.&nbsp; I won't bore you with the how, but the fix is:<br />
<br />
1/ Cut the end of a business card off so that there is about a 2-3 mil slither<br />
2/ Fold the slither in half so you have a double thickness slither<br />
3/ Take the battery cover off and pop out the battery<br />
4/ Put the end of the battery back in, but place the double thickness slither of business card between the bottom end of the batter and the phone body, essentially pressing the battery harder onto the terminal connections<br />
5/ Place the battery cover back on<br />
<br />
Give this a try and see if it reboots spontaneously now!<br />
<br />
I think that this is a dud product overall, because I still don;t like the phone that much, but I need to upgrade mine to 6.1 if possible.&nbsp; Does anyone know where I can get 6.1 for the O2 Atom Life?<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

<p>hi,&nbsp;</p>

<p>we have been using exchange web services (ews) for almost a year to integrate our meeting room mailboxes, which as have the type set to "room", into our intranet using ews.&nbsp;</p>

<p>the connection to ews was made using autodiscover and worked perfectly until the 10th november when we started seeing "401 not authorised" errors. i have checked the basics and that the password is the correct password, all looks fine.</p>

<p>when i run the office 365 outlook autodiscover conectivity test on&nbsp;<a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</a>&nbsp;i receive the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7a9470f0-d423-4fb7-8e76-4dda784125b6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7a9470f0-d423-4fb7-8e76-4dda784125b6" /></a></p>
<p>is this something that microsoft has changed recently as we have not made any server side changes since it was first configured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have attached the failed output from this test.</p>
<p>also, if i convert the mailbox back to a user mailbox and assign a licence, the test passes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Josh,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update. According to your situation, I have done some tests.</p>
<p>About the Autodiscover test, I can reproduce it, and it is an expected behavior. I convert a user mailbox to room mailbox, and then the Autodiscover test shows the same error “<em>An HTTP 401 Unauthorized response was received from the remote Unknown server.
 This is usually the result of an incorrect username or password</em>”. After consulting, this should be an expected behavior. We cannot directly test Autodiscover against the room mailbox.</p>
<p>Upon researching, I find no official document has indicated detailed steps about connecting to a room mailbox via Autodiscover/EWS.</p>
<p>Back to the original question: the application cannot connect to the room mailbox. As I don’t know detailed mechanism of your application, further troubleshooting might affect your environment. Thanks for your understanding. For your scenario, is it feasible
 to use a user mailbox?</p>
<p>If you have any further concerns, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>Hi JohnsonKC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can link contacts to indicate that they're related, for example if you have several entries for the same person. Linked contacts appear as a single contact.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To link contacts manually:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>People</strong> page, select two or more contacts, and then select
<strong>Link contacts</strong> in the panel on the right. </p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To link contacts using the <em>Clean up contacts</em> option:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>People</strong> page, select <strong>Manage</strong> on the toolbar, and then select
<strong>Clean up contacts</strong>. You'll see any contacts that have the same name, email address, or phone number.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the contacts you want to link, and then select <strong>Clean up</strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you need clarifications, feel free to message us again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

                    Just wondering, I know that there isn't much information about it yet. I'm waiting to buy instead of buying it online right now for the warranty. So just want to know how long I should plan on waiting.. days, weeks, or months?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            It's available sim free in the US from reputable online retailers like mobile planet. They are a good company and it will be a US model that you receive.<br />
<br />
Handsets are nearly always available sim free and online first. It usually takes a month or two before they hit the stores.

<h2>            How do you turn OFF the shadow feature in MS Office 2013 Professional Visio&#63;</h2>
                    Recently my employer installed Windows 7 &amp; MS Office 2013 with Visio Professional. Unlike the Visio 2007 version, this version draws shadows automatically whenever I draw. Someone please tell me how to turn this feature OFF? It's very annoying to remove
 the shadow each time I draw something.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue caused by the&nbsp;new feature theme that is a collection of formatting characteristics which can include shadows. Thus, if we do not need the shadow automatically, just not apply the theme.</p>
<p>Please try the workaround:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select new document, instead of selecting a chart type you can select blank diagram and that will ensure you have no theme allocated to your drawing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
