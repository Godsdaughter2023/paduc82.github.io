<h2>            Deleted Hard Drive - Really&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've recently installed Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I misnamed my computer.&nbsp; It should be no big deal.&nbsp; I could have kept the name, but it isn't the name I wanted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should have looked up "How do you rename a computer?", but I went back to where the name was and said, "Oh, I'll just change the name."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I went to IE and wanted to add something to my favorites and it brought up the favorites that were in the folder which had the name that should have been the bogus name.&nbsp; So I really didn't rename my computer, did I?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I deleted the folder with the bogus name and hoped that the folder with the new name would be recognized as the main folder.&nbsp; When I deleted the folder which contained the original name - the one I didn't want - I also deleted my hard drive.&nbsp; My computer
 is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put the Windows 8 disc back into the disc drive, which I thought would be different from the hard drive - which I guess I deleted - and I can't get it to show up so that I can reload Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get my hard drive back?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I rename it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I really have to reload Windows 8.&nbsp; If I do, well, my bad I guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Are you saying you deleted your account folder?</p>
<p>Are you saying you can't boot into Windows 8 at all?</p>
<p>The thing is, even if you attempted, Windows 8 would not allow you delete any system files or personal folders.
</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 8 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 8 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

            <p>Reloading Windows 8 was the first thing I tried, but it wouldn't load.&nbsp; I assume that was because there was no hard drive on which it could load.&nbsp; Maybe
 I'm wrong.&nbsp; What do I know about computers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve lost and found my C drive, inadvertently since I wrote the original message, more times than Mitt Romney’s been pro choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time I found it, it was on that new fancy page with the apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I somehow copied it and put a short cut on my desk top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then got the bright idea of right clicking on it to find out where the real C drive lives.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It said it lived at Users/Michael/Apps/Roaming/Programs/Start Menu and there I found yet another short cut.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I right clicked on that short cut and it told me it lived where it was.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So the C drive is ultimately a short cut of nothing else?<span>&nbsp; </span>
I’m confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m now moving it from the Apps folder to the desk top so it looks like the good old fashioned C drive that this 62 year old man is used to looking at on
 his desk top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m going to have to reload all of my programs (these days called “apps” because Americans are finding it more and more difficult to say words
 that have more than one syllable), but that’s OK.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m retired and am not that busy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having a hard time convincing Norton that I’m not trying to load their precious 3 computer protection plan on a fourth computer because
 I didn’t delete it before my C drive ran away.<span>&nbsp; </span>I suspect I’ll have the same problem with Rosetta Stone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can work around those, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andre, you’ve been very kind to answer my question.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m definitely putting your answer down as a favorite – on another computer that works for sure.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I still think I may need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m sort of sorry that I got a little political with you, but I’m sick of what corporations like the one for which I worked for 25 years, Dow Chemical, and
 the one that uses you , Microsoft, are doing to my country and my brothers and sisters.&nbsp; They are trying to dumb us down while their CEOs and top officers become so wealthy that they'll have nothing to do with their money but make paper airplanes from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll let it go at that and thank you, again, for your kind help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do realize that this was ultimately a self inflicted wound based upon my OCD and insistence that the name of my computer looked different.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My bad, once again.</p>

            It does not look like the device supports the postscript language. There is a Windows 7 driver on the Epson website. If Adobe requires a postscript device, you will need to use a different printer for this appication. Here are the unidrv based drivers.

    <title>Lenovo PC no longer able to detect external monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tommyyipod  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo PC no longer able to detect external monitor</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Since June 2017, I have been using my Lenovo Miix 510 PC/tablet (Windows 10 – 64 bit) with an ASUS external monitor (VS-228H-P) and it worked as expected. However, as of a few days ago, my Miix 510 is no longer able to detect the external monitor I have
 been using for the past 20 months. The Miix 510 is connected to a USB-C docking station, then a HDMI cable is connected from the docking station to the ASUS monitor. No changes to hardware nor software was made that I'm aware of.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Here what I’ve done to troubleshoot but the problem still persists:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>1.<span> </span>Replaced the current HDMI cable another working HDMI cable</div>
<div>2.<span> </span>Replaced the current docking station with a new docking station</div>
<div>3.<span> </span>Connected the original HDMI cable I’ve been using to two other computers’ HDMI ports. Worked as expected. Both of the other 2 computers were able to detect the same ASUS monitor.&nbsp;</div>
<div>4.<span> </span>Connected the Miix 510 via HDMI and docking station to a TV.&nbsp;</div>
<div>5.<span> </span>Downloaded the display drivers updated the display and monitor drivers in Win10 Device Manager several times on the Miix 510.</div>
<div>6.<span> </span>Installed older display and monitor drivers.</div>
<div>7.<span> </span>Unplugged the power cord and HDMI cable from the monitor and reconnected them after 15 minutes.</div>
<div>8.<span> </span>Ran the SFC in the command prompt in Windows. No problems found.</div>
<div>9.<span> </span>Tried all the Project settings in Windows 10.</div>
<div>
<p>10.<span> </span>Checked Display settings in Windows 10. Unable to detect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; &nbsp; Installed the latest drivers. According Win10 updates, I have the "best drivers".</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Based upon the troubleshooting steps above I must conclude that the PC or its Windows 10 OS is the source of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Why did the Miix 510 PC or Windows 10 stop detecting the external monitor after 20 months of use? I'm at my wits end trying everything under the sun.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<p>Sorry to hear about your situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, as previously posted, Microsoft does not do code exchanges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you can try selling/trading it to a local friend for MS points or cash.&nbsp; Or maybe even sell it on E-Bay or some other site like Craigslist?</p>

<p>In addition to SargonParidius' comment, if you choose to sell it, do NOT make those offers on the console. It can lead to your profile and console being banned for using the platform for commercial purposes. It's really not good to do that.</p>

<p>Click the plus sign and it takes you to a list.</p>
<p>All &nbsp;the existing names you can use.</p>

</p><p>Sharing screen from skype for business to skype isn't yet available.</p>
<p>You can only share screen for Skype users&nbsp;if you are using as&nbsp;well skype.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can share screen to users of skype for business by using skype for business.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to install&nbsp;a skype for windows desktop&nbsp;or use the skype for windows 10 for this&nbsp;concern.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store Apps Problems</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8.1 on a recent fresh install. Not when I load my Apps, they do not appear on my Start Page automatically which I understand is a feature? I think a bad feature! Programs should show on Start page automatically so we can remove them if we
 do not want them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my other problems are;</p>
<p>1-When I go to "Apps installed on this computer" it shows several apps that ARE Not installed. And after installing some, it still sometime show as "Not Installed"<br />
</p>
<p>2-There are Apps that I do not use or want anymore, and some that say they are no longer available, but I can not find a way to get rid of them. If I uninstall them the App still shows up in my list. I need to get rid of those. Too many Apps!</p>
<p>3-Internet Explorer is installed on my computer and it is on my Task Bar, but it is NOT listed on my Start Page, or on my Start page list so I can pin it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p><br />
I see that you are having different problems while using Apps. Let's analyze one by one and identify the cause of the issues. I will try my level best to help you.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>To launch recently opened apps, you can <strong>Switch between open apps. </strong>
Refer the steps mentioned here. </p>
<p><br />
To switch to your most recently used app, point to the<strong> upper-left corner </strong>
(try moving the mouse pointer so far into the corner that it disappears). When the previous app appears, click the corner.</p>
<p><strong>To switch to a different app</strong>, point to the<strong> upper-left corner and then move down the edge.
</strong>When the other apps appear, click the one you want.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Windows logo key Windows logo key+Tab:</strong> Switches between apps and the desktop</p>
<p><strong>Alt+Tab: </strong>Switches between all apps, including desktop apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue normally occurs when the user profile is corrupted and it is no longer updating with the start screen. I would suggest you to make sure that you install the latest updates through Windows Updates and also perform the steps mentioned here.
<br />
</p>
<p><strong><br />
Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To repair the apps, let's try to run the modern app troubleshooter and check the results.
</p>
<p><strong>Download and run the app troubleshooter and check.</strong> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer: </p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, pe</span><span><span>rform SFC scan to check if there is any system corrupted files.</span></span><span>
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us<br />
<br />
</span></span></a></p>
<p>Now try to uninstall them and check. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3: <br />
<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>To fix this problem, simply<strong> set Internet Explorer as the default web browser</strong> again using following steps:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/make-ie-default-browser#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make Internet Explorer your default browser</a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><span><br />
Let us know the results. </span><span><br />

<p>It seems to be a "normal" behavior of the camera driver. The light briefly turns on for a fraction of second when being initialized or shut down.</p>

            <p>Hi Raj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could have occurred due to any third party conflict. I <span>suggest you to perform a
<strong>clean boot</strong> and check.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Note: </span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<span>“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”
</span>to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to <strong>disable the antivirus</strong> software in your computer if you have any and check.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer</span></strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

            <p>Dear Navneet,</p>
<p>&nbsp; My set up is an altogether new hardware and Windows 10 Home is a fresh purchase and not an upgrade, hence clean boot.&nbsp;I further did complete computer reset, erasing all files option, still the&nbsp;status remains the same. Earlier I thought may be this problem
 is due to AOE being 32-bit and Windows 10 installed is 64-Bit but Microsoft Technical support section informed me that 32-bit application has compatibility support option in Windows 10&nbsp;64-bit. I think perhaps some old driver's signature verification is hampered
 due to some digital signature verification missing hotfixes by Microsoft. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's hope that Microsoft eventually releases the required hotfix / Patch for AOE2 patrons.</p>

<p>
Hello all,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I'm running Windows 7 x64, and I hooked up my HP Deskjet 5740 via USB.</p>
<p>
THe printer installs fine but when I try to print from any program, I get an error.</p>
<p>
The printer stays motionless.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
There are 2 ink cartridges installed corectly: 344 for color and 339 for black.</p>
<p>
When I hold the paper-feed button(the one that blinks orange with an error), it prints a page containing an HP logo at the bottom and "HP Deskjet 5700" at the top.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Printing from applications immediately gives an error in the printing queue.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Where do I begin troubleshooting?</p>

            <p>Wouldn't matter if it was HP, Brother, Lexmark, Canon, etc... Sooner or later, they get left behind.</p>
<p>In this printer's case - no matter when *you* purchased it (and if it really was recent, you got a "we need to dump this old printer" sale most likely) - it was released (it seems) way back in 2004.&nbsp; I see reviews online for October 2004 - which is why I
 am basing my assumption (it is an assumption) that it has been around for ~7 years.</p>

    <title>Malware called Antivirus Pro has taken over my brother-in-law&#39;s PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> needhelpnotaguru  say:</h3>
<h2>             Malware called Antivirus Pro has taken over my brother-in-law&#39;s PC</h2>
                    I was not there to witness what initially happened before this malware took over my brother-in-law's PC.&nbsp; It seems to be a rogue malware program called Antivirus Pro (which apparently has gone by other names in the past).&nbsp; The current malware version has
 hijacked internet explorer; prevented the Windows XP (SP 2) OS from booting in safe mode, or any mode other than normal; prevented access to task manager; prevented access to McAfee software updates; and finally added pornographic short-cut icons to the desktop
 (yes the icon is an actual pronographic photo).&nbsp; It's behavior includes several fake warning pop-ups that a virus is on the PC which cannot be moved, closed or minimized; a fake Windows Security Center window; and misleading information when internet explorer
 is started (that an internet connection is not available with a button to "diagnose connection problems").&nbsp; Most of the fake windows look amazingly real, almost exactly like it is a real Windows Security Center window.<br />
<br />
After doing some searching on-line from my own macbook, I was able to discern that there would be two programs that once removed should allow more access to the affected computer.&nbsp; So, I ran a search for the keyword "sysguard" in all files and folders on the
 "My Computer" directory.&nbsp; Luckily this basic Windows XP feature still worked, as I came up with two results: a program called
<em>nlrhsysguard</em> was located in the path <em>C:\ProgramFiles\sryeif</em> and a program called
<em>NLRHSYSGUARD.EXE-0BB89106.pf </em>was located in the path <em>C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch.</em>&nbsp; When it became apparent that I did not have the resources available to get on-line and get a malware removal tool to do the job then and there (did not have a disc
 available to download and save any programs from another computer), I decided to take a chance and first renamed the two sysguard files, then moved them to another folder, then deleted them to the recycle bin.&nbsp; I then restarted the computer.<br />
<br />
I attempted to start in safe mode.&nbsp; This again did not work.&nbsp; So, I started Windows normally.&nbsp; Before all of the startup program icons appeared in the system tray, I pressed ctrl-alt-del in order to open the task manager.&nbsp; I was very thankful that the task
 manager opened this time.&nbsp; However, I was also very disappointed that I was now looking at processes which were not listed on any of the websites I had used to reasearch this problem thus far.&nbsp; I then began going through the process list and searching each
 one on-line from the macbook computer in order to identify which processes were causing the pop-up virus warnings.&nbsp; Eventually I found two processes that appear to have been the culprits: wscsvc.exe and win64.exe.&nbsp; Simply stopping wscsvc.exe did not stop the
 pop-ups as that process kept restarting itself until I stopped the win64.exe process.<br />
<br />
I was able to open regedit at the same time that I was able to start task manager.&nbsp; While in regedit I search for some of the registry keys that were supposed to exist if I had the same situation that was described on some of the websites I was researching
 the malware from.&nbsp; I was unable to locate any registry keys that I could be certain belonged to this malware.&nbsp; I left the registry alone and closed the window.<br />
<br />
Meantime, I wanted to try to determine what had happened so I ran a file search of all files that had been modified on the date the malware first appeared.&nbsp; It appeared that several files were located in a
<em>Documents and Settings </em>folder that was named after the normal user name for that computer with a suffix of about 8 letters and numbers (example not the actual folder name: Main.8DB921P0).&nbsp; What was very surprising to me when I navigated to this located
 on the computer is that the folder size was now growing at a dramatic pace (as I watched it went from a file size of approximately 1.18 GB to approximately 1.37GB, this was in the time span of 30 seconds).<br />
<br />
This was the point where I decided that the computer is virtually irreparably damaged by the malware.&nbsp; I advised my brother-in-law that he could take it in somewhere to have it looked at and likely pay that person more money to fix it than the old computer
 was actually worth, or he could reformat the hard-drive and start over.&nbsp; I think he is considering reformating the hard drive after he is able to print any documents that he would like to keep (he would try to save them to disc, but there is no telling if
 this malware infection can spread that way).&nbsp; I offered to give him my old computer for his use, and reformat his hard drive on his affected computer so his son can use it for schoolwork still.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any new information on this malware known currently as Antivirus Pro, please advise of any other solutions.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
I need help, I am not a guru, but I am a nerd who has had access to a computer at home since 1977.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Boulder good work however be aware that this rogue has also been known to load other malware<br />
which is harder to detect in its package. Possibly by someone else modifying the load delivered.<br />
Anyway to be prudent you should really check your machine thoroughly with the methods outlined<br />
above.<br />
<br />
Practice&nbsp;safe hex.<br />

<p>Here are&nbsp;some options that may illeviate hard drive reformatting...<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; If you can access the net on the infected computer, go to microsoft.com and download the malicious software removal tool for 32 or 64 bit system ( whichever you have) and run to clean up the system.&nbsp; Check to see if you have it on the computer already.&nbsp;
 If you can,t find it or you are not sure that it is loaded already, a new download should not affect&nbsp;the system and you get the current updates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Go to pcsecurity shield.com and purchase 2010 shield deluxe, download to system and run deep system scan for virus<br />
identification and cleanup action.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; If possible go to&nbsp;windows start and type in system restore and follow prompts to restore to a day just before virus infection.&nbsp; You should still perform steps 1 and two above.&nbsp; Any top five&nbsp;virus program can be substituted for number 2<br />
above and must be incorporated as a standard usage tool with your computer always.<br />
<br />
As a general rule to the user, if your security system is working properly, sudden, urgent, critical&nbsp;pre virus&nbsp;instruction should not occur such as the anti virus pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />Uninstall (If this is installed. Since you are reinstalling 1803 again, hence this may not be installed)
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />

            Hi Srikanth,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<h2>            Black ops 2 is now ruined on xbox one</h2>
                    <p>So since black ops 2 became backwards compatible, i thought finally i can get back to a game i used to love back in the day, only now the game is ruined, so 1st game i join there is a hacker and it has now unlocked a load of camo's for guns i hadn't even got, and this is just 1 of the main problems, so many lobbies are filled with hackers, what the bloody hell are Microsoft and Activision doing, its a bloody joke, i must of reported at least 10 hackers or modders. Then there's so much lag also now, way more then there used to be back when i played on the 360, and i have better internet speed now, u&nbsp;also frequently get kicked out of games somehow, another issue there is a glitch sometimes where u cant get past the download nuketown screen even tough everthing released in the whole game i have installed already, the game is an absolute joke now, seems Microsoft dont give a **** either as nothing gets done to sort this, it might be an older game now, but its more popular then a lot of

    <title>Game dvr capture folder moved to appdata - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jma group  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game dvr capture folder moved to appdata</h2>
                    Hello i am having a very annoying issue where for some odd reason windows decided to end its relationship with the game dvr capture folder and is saving to this path "C:\Users\monst\AppData\Local\Temp" which renders the normal method of changing the folder
 unavailable. is there a fix for this other than reinstalling windows? Furthermore why isnt there a way to manually select a folder or type in a desired path. FYI my old capture location was "D:\Captures" which is still there with all my old clips it just divorced
 the game dvr and now windows settings dont want nothin to do with it.

            Hi Really, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Are you using the Game Bar to record your videos? There is a way to change where Windows saves your recorded videos. You can follow the instructions in the below link:

            Oh and i forgot to mention the captures folder on my D: drive was the one previously being used but as you see from the properties it has lost all affinity to the magic win 10 game dvr settings. i have to wonder, does the captures folder contain a configuration
 file that somehow got deleted. I really just wish windows 10 was smart enough to create a new capture folder rather than permanently default to temp folder
