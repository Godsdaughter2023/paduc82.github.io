<h2>            Very important for European customers with banned xbox one&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Whether you bought the goods in a shop or online, under EU rules you always have the right to a minimum two-year guarantee period at no cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This 2-year guarantee is only your minimum right and national rules in your country may give you extra protection. Remember that any deviation from EU rules must always be to the consumer's benefit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If an item you bought anywhere in the EU turns out to be faulty or does not look or work as advertised, the seller must repair or replace it free of charge or give you a full refund or reduction in price. In some EU countries
 you will be offered the choice between all four remedies from the outset. Otherwise you will be able to ask for a full or partial refund only when it is not possible or convenient to repair or replace the item.</span></p>
<p>Very important to remember:&nbsp;&nbsp;any deviation from EU rules must always be to the consumer's benefit. &nbsp; And second :&nbsp;If an item you bought anywhere in the EU turns out to be faulty or does not look or work as advertised, the seller must repair or replace it
 free of charge or give you a full refund. &nbsp; Because I can't even use my xbox one elite offline im gone receive my money back.European Union does all the legal actions for you,remember your rights and read about the laws of your country,Doesn't matter who's
 license agreement do you accept your country laws are more important!</p>

 you breach an agreement you signed up to, you were not sold a faulty product. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Telling us someone opinion of the law isn't fact, tell us what happens as a result, eg if you got you xbox unbanned.</p>
<p>I highly doubt it, everything comes with terms and conditions, which are also legally binding.</p>
<p>Also posting a link to the law would be beneficial, at the moment its you saying its the law, which counts for nothing.</p>

<p>And I think the law is very clear if I never tampered or broke the xbox,it is not about xbox live because I have the account in perfect order,it is about an electronic gadget(xbox one elite)never touched. On other note what if this hybrid ssd or this elite
 console send some information to xbox server that it's been tampered or something like this because is different or new model.And don't tell me microsoft know what are they doing and they work hard because I can give just 2 examples :1 on the enforcement team
 you can only check xbox 360 serial for bans despite the xbox one has 3 years,and second the mail from the customers service show me instructions how to pack xbox 360 and write me instructions for 360.And third the ban occurred in 18 of February when xbox live
 had some serious problems for three days!</p>

<p>OP, if you are going to file suit etc then do it already. Perhaps you'll even be able to argue corporate waterboarding and force MS, Google, Apple etc to change how they opperate who knows.</p>
<p>But I wouldn't be feeding people service numbers etc on an open forum.</p>

<h2>            powercfg.exe closes instantly</h2>
                    I have an Intel Core I7 with hyperthreading enabled. Windows 7's new core parking feature keeps parking half of my cpu core. I understand this helps with efficiency and power consumption, but this computer is used for performance intensive tasks and gaming,
 and I would prefer to keep all cores running at all times. I read that the core parking feature could be disabled via the powercfg.exe program. However whenever I open the application it appears for less than a second on the screen than disappears. Is there
 a setting I need to change to be able to use the application. I have already tried running it as an administrator. Any help would be appreciated.

                    I had to change my system hard drive as it crashed. After getting a new hard drive, I am unable to access one folder and its contents in my external hard drive. I tried taking ownership, but it says you cannot change the owner, also the current owner field
 says " cannot display the current owner". This folder contains very important data, so I had earlier changed the permission to Administrator of my system. Now, the administrator name changed - from my name to Dell. Is there any way that I can get permissions
 back or is it lost for ever?

            Dear Sandeep
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the reply. Sadly, it did not help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had tried all this before I came here :( , but in vein. When I try to open any file in that folder it gives me a message " ensure that the file is not encrypted or not read only" (- something similar). I do not remember me encrypting it. I had (before
 my old system HDD crashed), changed the access level just to the owner of the system (at that time the owner name was reflecting my name itself) as I had to give the external drive to another person to copy some other data. After that I remember changing the
 rights to everyone, if i am not wrong. Now, the current system owner name is DELL.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best Regards</div>
<div>Pradeep</div>

<h2>            Lenovo G550 upgraded from Win7 to Win 10 and it is almost unusable it is so slow.</h2>
                    <p>Lenovo G550 upgraded from Win7 to Win 10 and it is almost unusable it is so slow.</p>
<p>I have followed the quick start and paging suggestions but these have made no difference.</p>
<p>Often apps run the disk at 100% during startup, and presumably during normal operation.</p>
<p>According to the info I have read, this is common and happens on SDD as well.</p>
<p>Again, I have followed suggestions for this but it doesn't seem to make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading(?) to Win10 from Win7 has made using this device a real pain to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any real solutions to this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Software incompatibility is the usual cause why a device is having a performance issue. Before upgrading a device to Windows 10, it will be best to check if the hardware of the device is compatible and meets the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">specifications and systems requirement of the operating system</a></strong>. For us to provide an effective solution, we would need to know
 which build and edition of Windows 10 is installed on your device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest following the steps in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. It will walk you through on how to improve your
 PC's performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the suggestions to the 'go slow'problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed them all and unfortunately they haven't noticeably improved the situation.</p>
<p>The only one I couldn't do was go back to a recent 'restore point' as I don't have one.</p>
<p>This problem has existed since I moved from Win7 to Win10 so unless there was something inherently wrong with the initial auto upgrade I doubt that this is the problem.</p>
<p>I have auto update set so there have been many upgrades since the initial load, and nothing has changed with regards to the slowness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that my disk runs at 100% when loading an application such as Outlook 2016, or any other.</p>
<p>This I picked up by opening Task Manager during the load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware I am using is within the requirements for Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version I am running is:</p>
<p>Fall Creators Update</p>
<p>Version: 10.0.16299.125</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions will be welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Keith, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you're experiencing can be due to compatibility or outdated drivers. We would suggest contacting your manufacturer for assistance in updating your hardware devices and drivers. This will help us isolate the root cause of the issue and verify
 if the appropriate driver is installed to make you computer response appropriately with the system.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have loaded the updated drivers for my system but they have made very little noticeable difference.</p>
<p>However, I have noted that when opening an app such as Outlook 2016 my disk no longer sits at 100% but at 99%. This I checked using task manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, there has been a very minor improvement as it has never run below 100% whilst opening this app.</p>
<p>I still think this is related to my issue.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Keith.</p>

<p>We would highly suggest performing an <em>In-Place upgrade</em>, It will patch or repair possible corruption which may be causing the slow performance of your computer. This will also help us identify if the issue is within the system
 or hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly click this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to download and create the Windows 10 installation media that you'll need for the
 process. In doing so, we recommend watching the video on this article for a step-by-steps guide on how to perform it:
<strong><a href="https://mix.office.com/watch/3qnnlpnv43zu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform an In-place Upgrade.
</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we would recommend contacting the manufacturer of your computer and have them perform extensive hardware diagnostics to further check the root cause on why you're experiencing this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update us with the outcome. </p>

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It would not be a problem if you don't have your Windows 10 license details, because it is already linked to your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you're done with the In-place Upgrade, let me know how it goes.</p>

            <span>Hi,</span>
<div>I have completed the in-laws upgrade as per the instructions and there is no improvement in the speed.</div>
<div>If anything it is now slower than before.</div>
<div>I notice that when opening any apps the disk utilisation sits at 100% firlong periods of time and to me, this is what is making my laptop slow.</div>
<div>When running Win 7 I didn't have this issue.</div>
<div>This has been going on for far too long now and it is extremely frustrating.</div>
<div>I have read many complaints from people with similar issues.</div>
<div>Much as I really appreciate the help that has been given it seems as though any fixes are all on a 'try it and see if it works' basis.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I did the in-situ W10 upgrade as per instructions but this didn't change the slowness of my laptop.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I notice the disk often runs at 100% utilisation when I load apps and I am sure this must be a contributing factor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my system did an automatic upgrade today and it now won't start up in normal mode.</p>
<p>After attempting to start up several times it goes through an auto repair routine which fails.</p>
<p>I can now only start my laptop in safe mode with networking.</p>
<p>I wanted to do another in-situ upgrade as I believe there must be a corrupted file, but the link you previously gave me no longer exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm:<br />
My laptop was supplied with Windows 7. I was offered a free upgrade which I did.<br />
From that time on my laptop became extremely slow. I posted the problem and asked for help. A number of suggestions were made but none changed the situation of it being very slow. The last was the in-situ upgrade which I did. this sadly didn't help. Some auto
 updates took place today and now my laptop won't start except in safe mode.<br />
Please help me urgently if you can by providing another means of doing an in-situ upgrade so that I can correct Win10.</p>
<p>Regards, Keith Upton.</p>

<p>Hello Keith,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when computers are infected with malware or crashing because of buggy drivers, safe mode may be the only way to start the computer. Safe Mode in Windows disables unnecessary drivers and programs during the startup process so you can isolate system
 errors and fix them. To better assist you, we'll just need to clarify these details:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Which Windows 10 version and build do you currently have?</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have you made any specific changes on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Have you installed the latest Windows updates?</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are you getting any error code/messages?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you may follow these steps to exit safe mode in Windows 10:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open the System Configuration tool by opening the Run command (keyboard shortcut: Windows key + R) and typing msconfig then hit Ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Tap or click the Boot tab, uncheck the Safe boot box, hit Apply, and then Ok. Restarting your machine will exit Safe mode.</p>

            The link you provided leads to a page that says support has ended for service pack 2.<br />
<br />
I have Windows XP with Service Pack 3 - can't install anything at all and it seems that my activeX has gone AWOL as well - even some programs on the computer won't run.<br />
<br />
Can I go through safe mode to activate a restore point and, if so, how do I do it.<br />
<br />
I have tried 'system restore' from the start menu, but I get the same message as I do with the rest - "Choose the program you wish to use to open the program"<br />

<p>Hi Hyung,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assigned access lets the administrator assign apps that the user can proceed with. These apps are usually the ones downloaded from the Microsoft Store with an uap extension windows.aboveLockScreen in order to have apps show up in the list. To know more about
 this, please refer to this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/configure-assigned-access-by-using-the-ui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Dead Rising 2 &#34;cannot download the update&#34; Error code&#58; 0X800700B7</h2>
                    <p>I popped onto Dead Rising 2 ready to play the game again, until I get a request for an update. I enthusiastically click Yes, and the update fails to download. I can no longer play the game.</p>
<p>I have tried reinstalling Games For Windows Live, restarting the computer to no avail. I refuse to uninstall Dead Rising 2 since I do not want to wait five and a half hours just for it to not work all over again.</p>
<p>Ive looked at the FAQ on how to fix this and it seems the one and only solution did nothing to help. Any ideas?</p>

            I've finally found out how to fix it. It seems that GFWL does actually download the update file, but doesnt install it because it thinks that it didnt install it. To combat this I manually went into my XLive folder and found the cab file for Dead Rising
 2, and ran the setup. It now works fine and I can play the game to my hearts content.

<h2>            Left 4 Dead 2 Local Coop &#40;split screen&#41; NOT WORKING</h2>
                    
<p>I've been playing Left4Dead 2 backwards compatibility on my Xbox One since it was released. At first my boyfriend and I would play local coop online - even though neither of us had gold we were still able to play. Recently - I'm assuming with the latest
 update we are no able to play online. We tried upgrading to GOLD but it will not allow the other to sign in as a guest. We called Microsoft and they told us to call EA and that was 2 hour waste of time. I just want to play online as a guest!&nbsp;</p>

            Almost exactly the same issue here except&nbsp;Server 2012r2, Office 2016, WSUS handling updates. Suspect Office is the problem here.

    <title>Windows Computer Makes Controls Hover if Pen is Active - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> striikingg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Computer Makes Controls Hover if Pen is Active</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem for a few days. If I click a control on my keyboard and any pen that I normally use for my computer is hovering/active on the computer (the Lenovo YOGA 730-13IKB), the control hovers in midair and follows the cursor on the screen. For
 example, if I was using my pen and it was hovering over the touchscreen, and I hit Ctrl, it would show Ctrl on the screen and then it disappears if I let go of the command. I use Wacom Intuos Pro and Lenovo Active Pen 2, which was DESIGNED for computers like
 it, and it's happened on both pen devices. It's very irritating as it messes with the way I draw.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked up how to fix it to no avail, and I can't find anything about it on Google or in support places. I've tried going to pen settings but there is no way to fix it. I have restarted multiple times, updated my computer and pens, shut down, etc. and
 it does not go away.</p>

    <title>Does Reinstalling Windows Affect Software RAID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derslo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Reinstalling Windows Affect Software RAID</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I have an SSD in my computer as well as a RAID 5 array that was set up in Windows. I booted from another SSD with Windows on it and somehow screwed up the boot files on the main SSD. I think the best thing to do would be reinstalling Windows on the corrupted
 bootable SSD. However, I am worried that after plugging the drives back into the freshly installed Windows that it will no longer detect the volume as the RAID 5 array that they were to begin with. Being that I can not boot into Windows I am unable to back
 up the data on the array. Will the RAID array be there after reinstalling Windows or will I need to find a way to back up the data first? Also, I have tried just about everything I could find on forums and YouTube to repair the MBR on this SSD and nothing
 has worked. If anyone knows of a way to repair the boot files without having to reinstall Windows that would be amazing!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your help!</p>

            Hi DS.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of Disk Management, which we read like a doctor reads X-rays.  Follow the steps here so we can see everything we need to advise you:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />I do not recommend RAID because in almost all cases seen in the past ten years where consumers had a HDD failure with RAID the data was lost even if it was set up to mirror the data.  With SSD's and huge drives there is no good reason unless it's managed by an IT department that requires it and then you should be asking at Technet since this is a consumer forums.
<br />
<br />I can try to help you restore the boot manager properly to avoid having to reinstall because unfortunately with RAID all bets are off.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you for attempting to help out my problem, Greg. I hope we can get this solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken the drive out of the PC and placed it into another PC which boots up. The drive in question is the D: drive I underlined the partitions to make it a little easier to navigate.&nbsp;</p>

            It doesn't show much.  
<br />
<br />Are these the drives that you added to the PC causing it to stop booting?  What exactly was done when adding or removing that drive?  Did it start up?  If you can put it back in and start it to get a screenshot on the actual system it may tell us more.  
<br />
<br />Is it possible the Windows Boot manager got moved out of the first place in Boot Priority order in the UEFI Setup?

<p>So, this may be a little long but could possibly help understand the situation better. I have a 512GB SSD that I was booting to regularly. I also have a 128GB SSD with windows installed on it from a previous system. I plugged the 128GB SSD into the computer
 and changed the boot priority to it in the BIOS. Everything loaded up just fine for a bit. I left the computer sit for a few minutes when I returned things froze up. The resolution was off and I was unable to view windows or my mouse but launching programs
 from the keyboard showed up on the taskbar but did not pop up. It was as if the system was in safe mode but was not behaving as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the best thing to do was to restart the system. I did that and received a BSOD error 0xc00000e I could navigate to the change the windows that are installed. It found a Windows 10 Pro (The 512GB SSD OS) and a Windows 10 (The 128GB SSD OS) installation.
 If I select the Windows 10 Pro it brings me to the same BSOD. If I boot to the Windows 10 installation it brings me to the 128GB Windows 10 OS and tells me that it can not find the system32 folder. I am able to ctrl+alt+del, shift-click&nbsp;restart, and boot into
 safe mode. After that, I can see both drives connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I turn off the system and change the boot priority to Windows Boot Manager or just the SSD of the 512GB SSD it tries to repair the drive and fails. It dumps me to the blue windows boot option where I can Reset Windows, change the startup settings, view
 the command prompt, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the boot priorities in the BIOS, disconnecting and reconnecting 512 and 128GB SSD, and trying to use the bootrec&nbsp;command in CMD but get an access denied error when I try to use the command bootrec /fixboot. I think that some of the
 Windows boot files got shuffled around between the drives and I am not sure how. Hopefully that provides enough information for you.&nbsp;</p>

            This is the first WIndows OS where you can change hardware and the install will start without adaptive software.  But it still has to swap out all drivers and there can be conflicts or problems - at which time you need to go into Safe Mode to Update them manually from the PC or device's Support Downloads web page.  It sounds like you let it get away from you without correcting drivers being swapped in en masse from the onboard Driverstore or Windows Update.   So you can try that now.

            Should I be booting from and attempting to go into safe mode from the Windows Boot Manager on the 512 GB SSD, the main one I am concerned about?

            Yes, you can.  But it should already have the native drivers.  '
<br />
<br />Run a Startup Repair.  Then everything else is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Repairs should be done with all other drives unplugged so there is a risk there with the RAID, another reason they are not worth it.

<p>When booting into safe mode step 6 is really the only one that applies to the situation as I can not get into windows. I have Windows Boot Manager set as the priority&nbsp;in the BIOS and when the boot fails&nbsp;I then navigate the options where I find startup settings.
 There I am able to restart and press 4 for safe mode. When I do this I get the BSOD D:\windows\system32\logfiles\srt\srttrail.txt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is weird as it seems to be looking for a D: drive and I&nbsp;only have the C: drive connected to the computer. I then checked the command prompt for the volumes and partitions listed on the drive and have a bunch of weird stuff that comes up. I am not sure
 if this is the problem or not but the picture&nbsp;below is what it shows.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1465d9b2-ef8c-40e4-ac10-331fead01d67?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1465d9b2-ef8c-40e4-ac10-331fead01d67?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: I think the bootrec&nbsp;commands are something that will help, however, I keep getting stuck at this one place. The bootrec /fixboot&nbsp;command tells me 'Acess is denied.' From what I can understand online is that this is a windows&nbsp;bug that started happening
 after build 1703. I have attached a picture below.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e379dd54-006c-4ec7-a620-8837ed693345?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e379dd54-006c-4ec7-a620-8837ed693345?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT2: When trying to rebuild the BCD using the steps from the lifewire.com link I get stuck at step #6. running the attrib c:\boobcd -h -r -s to remove the hidden, read-only, and system attributes I get an error that returns 'path not found - C:\boot'.
 According to the first picture in this reply, it shows that there is both a C: and D: drive. I tried this again for the D: drive and received the same results. I am really unsure of what to do next. Thank you for the help that you have given me. Some of the
 things that I tried were new to me but still didn't fix anything.</p>

            The commands have bad syntax so check accuracy if that's how you typed it, then C is not the EFI System partition holding the Boot files so you'd need to do Assign command to issue it's Volume a letter, then use that.

<p>I assigned volume 2 as a V drive because it says that it is the system partition (the first picture of the most recent reply). The command is still unable to find the V:\boot path. I tried again with the C: and D: drive which returned the same results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look back at that same photo it shows that Partition 3 is a 16MB reserved partition but is not listed under the possible volumes is that common or could it be causing the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid to do a clean install as I have that RAID 5 array that was set up in windows. I do not have any access to the data on those drives for them to back up except through windows which is not booting. If the RAID array would be fine then I would have
 done a clean install a while ago. I will be taking your&nbsp;advice in the future and not doing another software RAID. Would you recommend&nbsp;a hardware RAID card or that I get a NAS enclosure for all of these drives?</p>

    <title>Microphone isn&#39;t picking up my voice properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrvevic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone isn&#39;t picking up my voice properly</h2>
                    For some crazy unknown reason, my mic isn't properly picking up my voice.<br />
<br />
My headset is the Razer Carcharias http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-carcharias-for-xbox-pc<br />
(the link I provided is actually some newer version of what I have. Mine isn't for the XBox, just PC. The controller node thing in the middle of the chord is different, not that it makes much of a difference.)<br />
<br />
I feel like I've done every single possible troubleshoot that is possible, and I still can't find the problem.<br />
<br />
My mic is being picked up and recognized, but when I talk, it doesn't pick up sound unless I put my mouth right up against the microphone.<br />
<br />
Here is everything that I've tried, and I will also provide screenshots of what I can show you:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I checked to make sure it wasn't muted on the chord string thing (the little switch).<br />
<br />
I have gone to Control Panel&gt;Hardware and Sound&gt;Manage Audio Devices&gt;Recording&gt; and set my mic to defaults. http://i.imgur.com/teHJrpa.png<br />
<br />
I have gone to Control Panel&gt;Hardware and Sound&gt;Manage Audio Devices&gt;Recording&gt;Properties&gt;Levels&gt; and set it to 100, also checked to make sure it wasn't muted. http://i.imgur.com/oSe7q2u.png<br />
<br />
I have tested another mic on my computer, and it yielded the same results.<br />
<br />
I have tested my mic on another computer, and it sounded absolutely perfect, so the problem isn't my mic.<br />
<br />
I tried updating drivers (they were already up to date), still isn't working properly.<br />
<br />
I tried rolling back to a previous driver, and it still didn't work properly.<br />
<br />
I tried using the Microphone Boost, but it just creates a bunch of static, which makes it impossible to speak to people (although it does make it pick up my voice better).<br />
<br />
I tried using the Conference Mode feature in the RealTek HD Audio Manager, but that creates a bunch of static, as well (although it does pick up my voice better).<br />
<br />
I tried uninstalling audio programs like Skype/Ventrilo/TeamSpeak, still no change.<br />
<br />
I tried reformatting and rebooting windows, because I got desperate to just have it fixed...still no change.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- So then I tried contacting ASUS (my motherboard company), and asking them what could possibly be the problem, and I told them everything I have tried, and the person I was talking to said to either try an external audio card, or RMA the motherboard because
 I already went through all the troubleshooting he could think of, so....<br />
<br />
I bought a new external audio card, and it still didn't work properly, so I returned it.<br />
(I did use the proper driver for the external audio card).<br />
<br />
In my desperate attempt to finally just get the issue done with, I went back to MicroCenter, returned my motherboard and did a $53 upgrade to a brand new and improved Motherboard, expecting this all to finally be done and over with...nope.<br />
<br />
I put in the motherboard, loaded windows and drivers, did all the updates, installed blah blah blah, tested my mic, and.......still the same exact results as before. Not a single thing is different.<br />
<br />
I'm now furious and extremely desperate for a fix. I can't take this anymore. I don't know what to do, and I've spent nearly two weeks now, trying to fix this. It has put a huge dent in my work, and I have the biggest headache. I'm tired of it. I just want
 my mic to finally work properly.<br />
<br />
I'm also about to just resort to taking my computer to a tech support place, and just hand it to them and tell them to fix it, knowing they probably won't be able to.<br />
<br />

            I actually finally found out the issue after spending over $100 on troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
It turns out that when my computer was being put in by a friend of my father, the person didn't properly put together the motherboard.<br />
<br />
There was something plugged in that wasn't supposed to be plugged in. It was one of the single pin things at one of the corners. I forgot which one, exactly, that it was, but it was what was causing the issues with my microphone.<br />
<br />
Problem is all fixed now! I hope someone later down the line that's having problems will find this and be able to find the solution to their issues.<br />

    <title>No sound on the DVD after burning it using Windows DVD Maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyle nguyen  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound on the DVD after burning it using Windows DVD Maker</h2>
                    I have a video I would like to put on a DVD to play on DVD players. Recently I upgraded to Windows 7 to get this free software, Windows DVD Maker, to burn DVDs. My video was in .avi and after burning completed, I tried to play it. The menu was fine, as
 well as the background audio I also added to the menu. &nbsp;When I played it, there was video, but no sound at all. I tried not to put background audio on the menu and kept it original, but still no audio when I played my video on the DVD. I checked the preview,
 and there was sound when I played it on the preview, as well as the menu audio I added. This is really frustrating because I wasted a valuable amount of DVD-Rs just to burn them and receive no audio in the video. Please help as soon as possible.
<br />
<br />
I see why Microsoft doesn't try to help. It's their fault. They give people with Windows 7 a free DVD burning software, and it doesn't work properly. So instead, you take my money by taking away my DVDs like that. I should've went and gotten a Mac. At least
 they wouldn't let me down like what Microsoft always do.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            Hi, okay I first tried the built in troubleshooter, but there seems to be no problem at all. I tried disabling a video filter under the compatibility tab in options. It was an AVI decompressor, which when I disabled and burned another disc, there still
 wasn't any audio. My burning speed was put on medium, but I changed it to slow. The result was the same. Thanks for wasting 2 more of my DVD-Rs. I need better solutions

    <title>Can&#39;t Download on Windows 10 Store - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Download on Windows 10 Store</h2>
                    I own the Hewlett-Packard 15-f100dx model laptop, with Windows 8 or 8.1 - I can't remember - and upgraded to windows 10 early August this year. &nbsp;When I open the store to try to download Netflix, I couldn't find the download button on the Netflix page.
 &nbsp;I thought "Oh well, I still have my smart TV," because I thought Netflix was not compatible with my model. &nbsp;But I tried to download other apps with no luck. &nbsp;The download was nowhere to be seen. &nbsp;Hopefully, somebody out there can help me.&nbsp;
