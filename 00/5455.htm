<h2>            Word 2010 freezes after a few seconds when opened.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have just installed Office 2010 and everything seems to work fine except Word, which gets stuck a few seconds after it's opened. My OS is Win7 64-bit and I have installed the 32-bit edition of Office. Does anyone have any clues of why this is happening?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<h2>            power point slide show requires two clicks</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try to do a full screen slide show in PowerPoint I have to click the "From Start" button twice. &nbsp;Is this a known issue? &nbsp;Is there a fix?</div>

I was wondering if everything I downloaded using Media Downloader was also deleted?<br />

Is it hidden somewhere in the phone where the only way to clear it up is through factory reset?<br />

            Everything is deleted within the app! SO whatever you downloaded using the app will be deleted.

    <title>Without Desktop apps, Windows would be dead. Why does MS focus almost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kizzume fowler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Without Desktop apps, Windows would be dead.  Why does MS focus almost purely on UWP&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I don't understand Microsoft's priorities.&nbsp; One of the things that made Windows Phones such a failure are the very things Microsoft is putting the most focus on in Windows 10 now that they no longer make or market phones.&nbsp; They haven't put any focus on the
 Desktop experience since Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>For instance:&nbsp; It took Microsoft about a year to actually allow people to make the title bar for Desktop apps the color they chose in Personalization. There has been no focus on hardly anything related to Desktop, even though Desktop apps are what make Windows
 great.&nbsp; Again, without Desktop apps, Windows would be dead.&nbsp; It would be as dead as the sales of their phones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>There are no professional-grade UWP apps.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't even have a <strong>
real</strong> UWP office yet.&nbsp; There's Word, but all the preferences and important options (for usability, mouse selection options, text correction options, default template options, and tons of other options) have been completely removed.&nbsp; There's Excel, but
 again, the preferences have been removed entirely.&nbsp; They're like Office apps if they were locked down like a kiosk.&nbsp; You also can only run one instance of them at a time.&nbsp; Hardly something that could be used in a professional setting.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>There's no Photoshop (except for something that has almost no options--it's as useless of an app as the ones found on Android or IOS--choose from predesigned templates, have fun).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no <em>actual</em> video editors for UWP (except ones as limited as you find on phones, basically useless).&nbsp; And yet, Microsoft stopped supporting Windows Movie Maker and they tell people to go to the Windows Store to get one there... but there
 aren't actually any there in the Windows Store that even have 1/20 of the options you had in Windows Movie Maker.&nbsp; There are many FREE video editing Desktop apps that have at least 20 times the functionality and options as
<strong>any</strong> of the UWP apps, but many of them are shady, but they are literally people's *ONLY* options unless they start spending a *lot* of money.&nbsp; So... in turn, people are forced to try to find other desktop video editors and possibly download
 malware/spyware/adware in the process.&nbsp; Good job Microsoft, you care so much about people's security and computer safety, so much that you inadvertently encourage people to download malware/adware/spyware.&nbsp; Yes, I know Microsoft would say that's not what they're
 doing, but they won't be able to offer ANY alternatives because all they know how to focus on now or recommend now are UWP apps, which, if they don't start getting a clue as to why people use Windows in the first place (Desktop apps), it will lead them to
 failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no professional-grade DAWs for UWP.&nbsp; You have far fewer options for UWP apps than you do modern-up-to-date Linux applications.&nbsp; There are NO professional-grade UWP apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft&nbsp;<strong>want</strong> companies like Adobe, Steinberg, and Avid to start abandoning Windows?&nbsp; How about gaming companies?&nbsp; (I guess they could release a new version of DirectX and call it good, I suppose) If Microsoft isn't going to put any
 reasonable focus on making sure that Desktop apps will be more solid and efficient, why should these companies stick with Microsoft?&nbsp; I hope Microsoft realizes that they
<em>need</em> to focus on the Desktop more.&nbsp; I'm not saying they should drop UWP, that would be stupid, but they need to still focus on making the Desktop app experience better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, as I've said before, they purposely block some hardware from being used on UWP apps, like video capture devices being used as webcams.&nbsp; Cripple everything, and then people are supposed to jump up and say "This is wonderful!&nbsp; Thank you for limiting my
 options!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to top it off, they&nbsp;<strong>*still* </strong>haven't put everything from the Control Panel into the Settings app, so it's still two completely different control panels for a single operating system.&nbsp; It shouldn't be taking them this long, but you know,
 a new version of Edge.&nbsp; And Edge.&nbsp; Hey everyone, try the new Edge, with advertising on the home page and new tab pages.&nbsp; Don't you like webpages slowing down at weird times and instantly crashing when you click the wrong links as if links are actually a portal
 to the X button?&nbsp; Edge, come-on, try it, you've gotta love edge!&nbsp; Don't use that other browser, let's put an ad for Edge in the taskbar when you do.&nbsp; Come on, Edge everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then every time there's a new build of Insider Preview, almost all they can talk about in the announcements is..... EDGE.&nbsp; Edge.&nbsp; Edge.&nbsp; Hey, Edge.&nbsp; How about some Edge.&nbsp; Some Edge anyone?&nbsp; You've got a real Edge.&nbsp; Nothing about them making other important
 improvements, no... it's all about Edge, the browser nobody wants to use no matter how much it's crammed in people's faces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does this work?&nbsp; Where is Microsoft's focus?&nbsp; Do they just <strong>want</strong> to fail?&nbsp; I don't understand their priorities.&nbsp; Do they really think that almost abandoning any new positive changes for Desktop is going to bode well for them?&nbsp; Sure, people
 can still use Desktop apps, but what are they doing to make using Desktop apps a better (and more solid and efficient) experience?</p>

<p>I hope you're right.&nbsp; I hope they *do* release these things.&nbsp; They need to, or many more people are going to lose faith in Microsoft having any sort of reasonable vision for the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used OSX/MacOS and many flavors of Linux on many occasions over the past 15 years (correction, 18 years), I have many times made those things my primary operating system.&nbsp; I always come back to Microsoft and Windows, but their inability to actually
 complete Windows 10, as well as how they're focusing on things that make no sense (like, as you said, pushing for UWP when there's no longer a mobile market for it), make it hard to keep faith that Microsoft will pull through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I LOVE windows.&nbsp; Let me state that again:&nbsp; I <em><strong>LOVE</strong></em> windows.&nbsp; I do
<strong>not</strong> want to see it fail.&nbsp; Microsoft truly needs to listen to their primary user base, not a hypothetical user base that has proven to have died out.</p>

            <p>As far as Edge, I've had nothing but problems.&nbsp; Right now, on Insider Preview Build 15055.rs2_release.170307-1445, I can't watch YouTube videos unless I never try to skip forward in the video.&nbsp; This build did the same thing to Chrome--actually in Chrome
 it's even worse than in Edge, so I've had to use Firefox for this particular build when watching YouTube videos.&nbsp; I *am* using Edge right now to type this, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The things I dislike the most about Edge is how it slows down at the strangest of times, during times that there should be no CPU usage spikes, at times when no other browser even has a blip of a slowdown, it's as if some regular browser functions that have
 always been fast on other browsers have trouble in Edge.&nbsp; Granted, there's a tradeoff, there are some thing in Edge that go faster than other browsers.&nbsp; Then there's the times where it just instantly crashes and closes if I click the wrong link, which doesn't
 crash it on other occasions, it's completely inconsistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that a NoScript or similar extension will eventually become available.&nbsp; I think NoScript is far better than AdBlock, because it can actually allow many websites to load at 10, sometimes even 20 times the speed.&nbsp; One of the things about modern websites
 is that virtually all the things that slow them down have nothing to do with displaying the content, it's all about different servers communicating with each other and trying to track people (the do-not-track option in Edge is worthless, honestly), and not
 *letting* you see the content until they're done.&nbsp; NoScript can actually stop this sort of thing, though it sometimes breaks websites (unless you allow more servers), but it certainly doesn't cause browser instability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, it's honestly sad that, even though on average, this country has FAR faster internet speeds than even just a few years ago, many websites still load as slowly as the faster websites loaded on dialup in the late 90s.&nbsp; This is how much garbage is on
 websites now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, a long story short, besides the instability problems, there needs to be more extensions available for Edge.&nbsp; They'll eventually happen, but it's sure taking a while.</p>

            <p>Ah yes, Insider build Edge can be buggy sometimes. But on my PC with production build, running the latest updates, Edge trumps Chrome and FireFox in most of the cases. Streaming videos, opening pages and specially battery saving, Edge outperforms all other
 browsers. I agree that Edge bogs down a bit when multiple tabs are opened, and then I use Chrome. But for all other purposes Edge is my go-to browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for extensions, better write to the devs to port their extensions to the Windows Store. AdBlock Plus works wonders for me. The uBlock Origin extension is also available and it works wonders.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Wrong Data in access data in a PowerPoint Graph</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everybody,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a presentation on PowerPoint 2016&nbsp; and after configuring a embedded graph, I copied and pasted the same slide some times. It was a fast way to use the same style but with different data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, when I go to first slide and click the edit data, it shows a different data. The data looks like the new slides that I pasted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original graph had 2 columns. When I try to change data, there is 5 columns (like one&nbsp; I copy/paste/change). And it updates automatically. Even if click undo, the original graph disappear. I have to close without saving, but now I can edit anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve this error?<br />

            I'd advice you to use the freeware <a href="http://www.freewarepocketpc.net/ppc-download-todayagenda.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TodayAgenda</a> since this IMO does what you want. Thouigh when you're using TouchFlow3D then you'd also need a program which let you see the 'Today Plugins' within one one of the TF3D tabs called '<a href="http://www.freewarepocketpc.net/ppc-download-manila-today-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manila
 Today Page</a> '. Let me know if this worx 4U.<br />

<h2>            OneDrive is syncing my desktop into the OneDrive folder on my PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just started out with using OneDrive for my backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set the preference to sync my desktop, documents and pictures to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened next is that after (or rather while) uploading the files, it created a new desktop folder in the OneDrive folder on my PC, and copied over all the files in there. Same happened to documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing the settings of which folders to sync to my PC and I got the following message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>
<p>

<p>You should only have one Desktop folder in OneDrive.&nbsp; If you have more than one Desktop folder in OneDrive you should make sure they both have the same name "Desktop" and then they should merge into one folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Word 2013 new files print blank pages</h2>
                    I have just installed Office 2013 on my windows 8 Toshiba laptop with AMD chip. When opening old files and printing, everything prints normally. However, when creating new flies from "Blank" template, and selecting print, the page comes out completely
 blank. I have tried different templates always with the same result. Printer responds, page is produced; only nothing is ever printed on the page. It's always just a blank sheet of paper. Weird and a real pain.

            <p>It depends what you mean by "boot time scanning".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you mean does it allow you to initiate a manual boot time scan of the files in general on the PC, similar to the other old and now archaic methods used by some third-party antivirus products of the past then no, it doesn't contain this now nearly useless
 'feature', since boot time malware had&nbsp; rendered this method ineffective years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you mean rather does it support the new 'Secure Boot' ability made possible by the UEFI firmware&nbsp;standard, which is a replacement for the traditional PC BIOS, then yes.&nbsp; Windows 8 utilizes secure boot to ensure that the pre-OS environment is secure, assuming
 that UEFI firmware is available and enabled (in place of BIOS)&nbsp;on the PC itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are huge differences in the two items mentioned above, so you need to understand these differences to determine if what you are seeking is really something useful or simply an anachronism&nbsp;from another time in the distant past.</p>

    <title>MS Excel 2013 Problem with File Content - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandgroper48ig  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Excel 2013 Problem with File Content</h2>
                    <p>Recently I am continually receiving the following message when opening an existing Excel file:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>We found a problem with some content in &lt;file-name-here&gt;.
</em></span><em><span>Do you want us to try to recover as much as we can?</span></em></p>

<p><span><em>If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.</em></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>By trial and error I have found the following:</p>
<p>(a) It only relates to files with embedded Charts</p>
<p>(b) It only happens when Excel has been left running (typically overnight) but not with any files open (other than my "Personal.xlsm")</p>
<p>(c) If I answer "yes"&nbsp;to the&nbsp;question posed the attempted system repair does not fix the problem</p>
<p>(d) A tell tale sign is that all the Excel File Icons in&nbsp;&nbsp;the Recent Files list are blank icons i.e. they do not exhibit the Excel Logo.</p>
<p>(e) I have found that the fix is to Close Excel - then restart Excel then open the alleged damaged file and everything is back to normal</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just from memory the problem seems to originate from around the time that I inadvertently clicked on a prompt asking me if I wanted to install Power Maps for Excel. Since then I have gone into Add-Ins and disabled the Com Add-in Power Maps but the problem
 still persists.</p>
<p>Attempts to uninstall&nbsp;Power Maps as an administrator fail. Even though it is disabled I still strongly suspect that this application is causing the problem.</p>
<p>Searches on the Web suggest that Power Maps can be uninstalled from "Programs and features" through the Control Panel but when I look in programs it does not appear.</p>
<p>I can navigate to the Power Map files with File explorer but am reluctant to delete the folder and all its DLL files in fear of messing something else up with Excel.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions. Thanks</p>

            The link most likely contains a file path that is specific to Windows. You'll have to navigate to the file manually in Finder. Once you get to the file you can create an alias to it so you can return to it should you need to.<br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I am an independent Advisor trying to help, I suggest to you disable the office add-ins that sometimes have this effects: 
<br />
<br />1- Try to open outlook in safe mode:
<br />Close the office app
<br />Press the windows key + R and write 
<br /> 
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />2- Disable the add-ins:
<br />Go to file &gt; options &gt; add-ins select COM and uncheck the first add-in checked, close outlook and make your test. If the issue persist repeat this step until disable all add-ins.
<br />
<br />If this doesn’t solve your issue, you have to performance an office repair, before you have to check and install the operative systems and office updates.
<br />
<br />Repair steps:
<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the quick repair. This will take a few minutes.
<br />If this doesn’t work try the online repair.
<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the online repair. This can take around 10 minutes or more.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this worked for you.
<br />Regards.

<p>Hi Ami,</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>It should be automatic. You should be able to smoothly scroll and switch from using the Surface pen and your finger. We'd like to learn more about your concern, so we can determine the best solution or direct you to the correct forum if needed. Can you provide
 the answer to the following questions?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using a Surface device with your Surface pen?</li><li>Have you already tried recalibrating the touchscreen?</li><li>Have you already checked and installed all pending updates for your devices? Keeping your device up-to-date ensures that you have the new and improved features.</li></ul>
<p>

<h3> finlandsberet  say:</h3>
<h2>            IP address and location don&#39;t match-up</h2>
                    <p>After recently having a few email/account scares, I've been keeping a check on my recent activity, and everything seems to have been fine and normal up until a few minutes ago, when I tried looking at my activity again.</p>
<p>I found that my IP address has changed recently, and the IP address in question doesn't match-up with my actual, physical location. I've included a screenshot below. In addition, in the entry below there are two unsuccessful IMAP attempts, which is worrying
 too as I've managed to desync my devices&nbsp; - or so I had believed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does someone have access to my account? Should I change my password and everything else? Seeing this all of a sudden is really worrying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick edit: It seems that the new IP address is still for my physical location, but if that is the case, why does the map in the screenshot show me as being at the other end of the country? I tried logging out and back in to my email account to see if that
 would do anything, but my location is still the same as in the screenshot. This is very worrying.</p>

            Hello finlandsberet, <br />
<br />
I know how alarming it is to see that the reported geological location of your IP address does not match your physical location. Don't worry, they are harmless and a common occurrence.
<br />
<br />
IP addresses right now, like what you see, are IPv4. There are unfortunately, <strong>
insufficient IPv4 available addresses</strong> to meet the global demands. Therefore, many entities re-use the same IP address for different purposes.
<br />
<br />
See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exha...</a> <br />
<br />
Unless you have a static IP address, your ISP will normally assign you a <strong>
random</strong>&nbsp;IP for you to surf the web, even though it may not have the correct profile/information that best describes you. Which means, it is possible, and very normal, to receive a… New Zealand (example) IP address even though you live in UK and your
 ISP is UK-based. <br />
<br />
Another reason why the geological location might be inaccurate is because the <strong>
<br />
Really, you do not have to worry too much about this, and since you already have done all my
<em>3 suggestions</em> in our previous interaction, you are safe! <br />
<br />
Cheers! <br />

            Hi Diane,
<br />It sounds like you had outlook setup with a pop account before. You can still do that as long as the server you use still supports POP3, but will need to set it up manually.  If you don't know the server names to use, who is your email provider? 
<br />
<br />
<br /> (Just adding a pst to the profile wont help - you need to move mail into it or use POP3 and deliver directly to the pst.)

            <p>I am having similar popups from my own computer, my Hotmail accounts, my home network, and when I log on to other systems I get very authentic looking popups that ask for my password(s).&nbsp; I started just clicking the exit button to see if I would be refused
 access to these other systems and I was not refused.&nbsp; I think this is a serious and insidious malware.&nbsp; I have Norton's and have run multiple scans. certainly by now "they" have and know all of my passwords if this is a malware.&nbsp; Or, something is wrong in
 windows...</p>
<p>Norton's assures me my system is safe.&nbsp; This leads me to believe it is a software update problem&nbsp; or malware posing as a softwareupdate.&nbsp; Please help me to review this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            Making a .ACCDB database read-only for colleagues in Access 2010</h2>
                    I have a .ACCDB (2007/2010) database that I need to be able to edit and update, but set user-level security for my colleagues so that they are only able to read and look at the database and not make any changes.&nbsp; How do I go about doing this?&nbsp; I am using
 Microsoft Access 2010.

            <p>User-Level Security (uls) was done away with with Access new formats (accdb).&nbsp; That said, if your db is still in mdb format, you can still support it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming since you are using 2010, you have an accdb (oh, wait.. just reread your post and you clearly state this, I'll wake up eventually).&nbsp; As such, to implement such security, you need to do it yourself.&nbsp; You'd need to create a security system to
 suit your needs or search around for examples.&nbsp; I know there are a number of examples of such setups on utteraccess.com in their archives.&nbsp; everything depends on the level of security you need.&nbsp; It can very easy or very complexe to create.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its simplest form, you could create you user interface, save a 2nd version where you change everything over to snapshots, allow edit = false, etc..., so no editing can occur and then distribute this version to your colleagues.&nbsp; But then further development
 requires continuously updating 2 dbs.</p>
