<h2>            Outlook 2007, Archiving, PST file</h2>
                    <p>When I perform an email search in Outlook 2007 it is taking 10-15 mins&nbsp;to find all the emails that relate to that search.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe this is due to the fact my emails haven’t been archived in 7 years. The reason I haven’t archived my emails is because I often refer to emails that were sent years earlier and as I have been told by archiving all the emails get put into a mixed
 separate folder and when you perform a inbox search it wouldn’t include the archive files.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now my question is, is there a program that you can buy that will one: make the email search faster? Two: have all the emails searched and three: keep the emails in the sub folders they are currently in?</p>

            <p>Outlook can search from multiple data files.</p>
<p>As the size of the PST is 24GB, search will take time to pull out the results.</p>
<p>Select the PST file and check for indexing status. Outlook can search from multiple data files. Due to large data, indexing may take hours or even days depending on computer usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If indexing keeps restarting or stops abruptly, then run scanpst for the old pst file. Once complete start indexing again for the PST file.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Create a backup of the Outlook data file before running scan PST.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, create new Outlook data file and set it as default to receive the future emails.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> If you have additional folders created/rules setup, you may have to re-create it on the new Outlook data file.</p>
<p>To create new Outlook data file, refer to the steps in the section

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the steps from the following link to check if Outlook is using indexed search and not Outlook search:</p>

<p>You may use the search option to search archive folders as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may run the scanpst tool to check for any error message following the steps mentioned in the following link:</p>

<p>Hi Paul, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using clipper in OneNote is an easy way to capture, edit, annotate and share information. You can only use the OneNote Web Clipper in the Internet browser or in OneNote on the web. The notebooks that you clipped on it will save automatically on OneDrive
 and there’s no way to changing the location to computer local storage. Clipping a notebook in OneNote desktop app can be done by using the
<em>Screen Clipping</em> option in the application. It’s under the <em>Insert</em> tab and in the<em> Images</em> section. You can save this notebook in two locations, OneDrive as its default storage and computer local storage.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work for you, we highly suggest that you send this as a suggestion on our
<a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote UserVoice</a> feedback platform. This helps our engineer and developers to improve the OneNote’s features and overall functionality in future updates and a better visibility on what features are most important
 to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have any other concerns, don’t hesitate to let us know. </p>

    <title>MS Teams quits during screen sharing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Teams quits during screen sharing</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently run into an odd issue with Teams with a user that we support. This person works remotely and travels around a lot so they use a hotspot quite frequently. When connected to the hotspot and having full LTE signal, they'll try to share their screen
 and Teams will fully quit out. We tested this while connected to a local network in an office which worked fine and switched over to the hotspot; it happens very consistently. Are there any specific bandwidth requirements for being able to share their screen?
 This does work in other applications such as TeamViewer and GoToMeeting, it seems that Teams is the only one that has difficulty with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the diagnostics log if I can send to anyone, below is their information:</p>
<p>Windows 7 - 64 Bit</p>
<p>Office 2016 - 64 Bit</p>
<p><span>Teams version: 1.1.00.13555 (64-bit).</span></p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<p>Hello Matthew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, there isn’t any documents about the specific bandwidth requirements. Since you can reproduce the issue consistently, would you mind please provide some detailed information about it:</p>
<p>1. You mentioned that the Teams will fully quit. May I know if there is any error message or notification? If yes, please capture a screenshot.
</p>
<p>2. Does this issue occur on difference PCs when joining a meeting in Teams?</p>
<p>3. What if you use other Wi-Fi connection, not LTE? Can you reproduce the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see that the version number of the Teams is not the latest, please <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/update-microsoft-teams-535a8e4b-45f0-4f6c-8b3d-91bca7a51db1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
check for updates</a> for the Teams desktop client and see if the issue can be fixed. If the issue persists, I may need to collect some logs for further investigating.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

            Not a stupid question at all. I'm afraid the answer is "You can't."
<div><br />
<div>Entourage for Mac did offer this ability but Outlook does not.&nbsp;Please be sure to let Microsoft know you'd like to see this feature in future versions by using the
<b>Help</b> --&gt; <i>Send Feedback...</i> mechanism in any Office application. If you have reading disabilities then be sure to say so.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You do have a few options built into Mac OS X that may help you. Go to <b>Apple</b> menu --&gt;
<i>System Preferences...</i> --&gt; <b>Universal Access</b>&nbsp;--&gt; <b>Seeing</b> tab and enable
<b>Zoom</b>. You can use the <b>Command</b> + <b>Option</b> + <b>+</b>&nbsp;(plus) keys to zoom in and
<b>Command</b> + <b>Option</b> + <b>-</b>&nbsp;(minus) keys to zoom out. Also, if your mouse has a scroll wheel or scroll function then you can hold the Control key down and scroll to do the same thing. Very handy!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</div>

Enter into your keypad *#7780# and when prompted, enter the default passcode 12345. If you have changed the code, it will be the code you changed it to.<br />
A backup will not be needed as this will not delete any data.<br />
<br />
After this, re-downlaod opera mini and try connecting to the internet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Storage card not working&#34; but no storage card inserted...</h2>
                    Phone: Samsung Focus SGH-I917 with Qualcomm 3G HSDPA chip
<div>Provider: AT&amp;T</div>
<div>OS: WP7 (most current version, but don't know version &nbsp;number as phone inoperable)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After updating two apps today via wi-fi &nbsp;(USA Today and bar code scanner whose name I cannot remember) my phone restarted twice and gave the "Storage card not working" error message.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>The strange thing is that I have never added a micro-SDHD or any other type of storage card</b>, although I was thinking about it -- &nbsp;but was put off my the thought of having to do a hard reset.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried removing battery and SIM card, but keep getting the same error message and can only use the phone to make an emergency (911) call so it's basically a brick.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Based on this situation the error message was itself an error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions on how to get my phone working again?</div>

            <p>From what you are describing, it sounds to me as if there is an issue with the device and you need to bring it in for repair Fred.</p>
<p>I might try a hard reset again but if that fails and it remains on the Samsung logo then clearly something is wrong.&nbsp; Bring it in for replacement.</p>

<h2>            Office Professional 2007 - Removing 2 of 7 suite programs then later reinstalling&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good day to all:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After six years of using my notebook computer ("Yes, it still works just fine!), I've been trying to manage my hard disk (HD) free space.&nbsp; Now, I am making some moderate progress since I've gone through my Add/Remove program list and deleted that which I
 felt was no longer needed.&nbsp; Currrently, I am going through my document files.&nbsp; My HD free space last Tuesday was 4.23 GB.&nbsp; Now it is at: 7.18 GB.&nbsp; This progress is small, but it took alot of work to make this increase of almost 3.0 GB of HD free space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now there are alot of Microsoft (MS) programs in the Add/Remove program list, and some of them, well, I just don't know if I can delete them?&nbsp; So, question #1: How do I confidently know whether I can delete a MS program?&nbsp; For example, there's a Microsoft
 SQL Server 2005 program which uses 488.0 MB - can this program be safely removed?&nbsp; There are many other MS programs like .net Framework versions.&nbsp; Do all of them need to be on my computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait, I've got more questions:</p>
<p>If I eliminate the Accounting 2007 program and its related programs from the 2007 Office Professional suite of programs then I know I can increase the amount of free space on my HD.&nbsp; However, what if I want to reinstall it again at a future date?&nbsp; Oh my
 goodness, that can be a lion of a problem.&nbsp; And even though I'm a tiger this can still be a difficult situation to resolve.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep smiling,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
<p><u>The .Net and probably SQL entries are Important updates, removing them may cause other installed programs to fail.</u></p>
<p><em>This is helpful since I did not know how to interpret the .net and SQL entries.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Office accounting was withdrawn by MS some years ago, assuming you have the installation media &amp; Key it can be reinstalled</u></p>
<p><em>Okay, now I can feel confident in removing the Office Accounting program from the suite of programs.&nbsp; I&nbsp;just confirmed that I have the product key for the suite of programs on MS Office Professional 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>However, a follow up question before doing
 so:</u></em></p>
<p><em>When and if I decide to reinstall the Office Accounting 2007 program&nbsp;and it's sub programs then:&nbsp; Will I be able to do so without reinstalling the complete suite of programs.&nbsp; My fear is if I have to reinstall the entire suite of programs then it will
 effect items which those programs control.&nbsp; For example, Word 2007 lists document files that are either currently available on my hard disk (HD) or have been moved onto a CD-R for storage.&nbsp; Now, if I&nbsp;have to completely reinstall the Word 2007 program then
 Word's ability&nbsp;to find currently available&nbsp;document files on my HD,&nbsp;from the formerly&nbsp;installed Word 2007, it may not be possible to find those former document files--however, I am not sure about&nbsp;this prediction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a similiar concerns for Excel, Outlook,
 Publisher, and Access 2007.&nbsp; Can you elaborate on this question?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>At the end of the day, your disk maintenance/clean up is a sticking plaster approach to the fundimental issue of to small a HD</u></p>
<p><em>I understand that you're saying the disk maintenance/clean up is like putting a bandaid on a wound when it really requires some bacitratcin oinment before the bandaid is applied,&nbsp; In other words (IOW), it may be necessary to figure out how to increase
 the size of my small HD.&nbsp; For your information, currently, the size of my Local Disk (C:) is 96,9 GB of which 89.6 GB is used space and 7.29 GB is free space.&nbsp; Keep in mind, I am making continued efforts at increasing the amount of free space on my HD, as
 you can see by my questions herein.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>In Internet Options modify the temp files size to 50mb</u></p>
<p><em>Well, this may be a good idea.&nbsp; But what if the temp file needs more space to operate properly?&nbsp; When you say temp file, what type of files are you referring to?&nbsp; IOW, where are these temp files coming from or what program is creating these temp files?&nbsp;
 I'd be a bit concerned about modifying the temp files size to 50MB when I don't understand where they are coming from.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Run Disk Cleanup</u></p>
<p><em>Within the past couple of months, I may have done this once or twice.&nbsp; I've learnt, however, that this may be a regular good idea.&nbsp; I don't really know what is happening to my hard disk when a Disk Cleanup is being performed.&nbsp; Are gaps on the HD being
 eliminated during a Disk Cleanup process?&nbsp; Please explain.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Modify the size available to system restore</u></p>
<p><em>Firstly, I don't know how to do this.&nbsp; Secondly, isn't this kind of dangerous?&nbsp; I mean system restore should be able to have enough space on the hard disk to operate properly; if that's where the system restore resides.&nbsp; I would imagine this, since my
 HD space is 96.9 GB, and system restore may need to be the same size.&nbsp; I just don't know much about how this works.&nbsp; In addition, is system restore located on my HD or is it someplace else?&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>You dont mention whether you have any other partitions on your HD, if you do you may be able to modify these to increase the size of C:</u></p>
<p><em>I do not know how to create partitions on my HD.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never done this.&nbsp; I've just been using my notebook computer without setting up any&nbsp;partitions.&nbsp; So doing what you suggest here is something I don't know much about.&nbsp; I do understand what a partition
 is, but that's about it.&nbsp; I'm just someone who's trying to get more familiar with some advanced computer concepts.&nbsp; And I give myself a gold star for getting this far into these technicalities.&nbsp; Time permitting, I'll do what I have to do.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Win requires a minimum of 15% free space on the win drive for correct functionality</u></p>
<p><em>When you say "Win", I think you are referring to Windows.&nbsp; When you say "win drive", I think you are&nbsp;referring to a separate drive called "Win drive".&nbsp; On my system, there is no "Win drive".&nbsp; I am using: Windows XP Professional Media Center Edition,
 SP3.&nbsp; The only drives I see on my computer are: Local Disk (C:), HP Recovery (D:), CD Drive (E:);&nbsp;5 memory_card(s) for hp (v:), (w:), (x:), (y:) and (z:); mobile device; a folder called Shared Documents; a folder for&nbsp;&lt;my first name&gt; Documents; and a Norton
 Backup Drive.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I think what you refer to as&nbsp;"Win drive", that it is part of my Local Disk (C:).&nbsp; But I'm not sure about where "Win Drive" is actualy located.&nbsp; I think when you referred earlier to system restore then perhaps that is located in the HP Recovery (D:).&nbsp;
 My CD Drive (E:) regards what is in my disc drive.&nbsp; The 5 memory cards-- well-- I have absolutely no idea what is on them.&nbsp; The other items are understandable.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>So, where do I go to check whether there's 15% free space for Windows to operate correctly?&nbsp; Keep in mind, currently, I don't have any problem with Windows.&nbsp; However, where is my Windows XP Professional Media Center Edition, SP3 located?&nbsp; I believe the
 SP3 is on my Local Disk (C:).&nbsp; But where is the Windows XP Professional Media Center Edition located?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Furthermore, how much space is necessary on my Local Disk (C:) for the Windows DeFrag function to operate correctly?</u></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p>Please: Tame this tiger.</p>

            Freeing up 3GB is not bad.&nbsp; You are at about 92% (89.6/96.9) full. Although 7GB is a lot of free space in absolute terms, relatively Windows sometimes does have problems running with only 8% free space.&nbsp; Some of the Windows tools have hard coded limits
 that are based on percentages (hard coded 20-30 years ago).<br />
<br />
A 100 GB drive is relatively old, probably more than 5-7 years old. That is on the extreme end of the life of a HD.&nbsp; Your ultimate fix may be to replace the HD and / or migrate data files to an external USB HD.
<br />
<br />
An external USB HD 1-3TB costs about US$100.<br />
<br />
A replacement HD around 200-300 GB will cost you around US$50-100 ie:<br />
http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale/wholesale-seagate-2.5%2522-sata-hdd-200gb.html<br />
<br />
Getting a technician to install it and transfer the data will cost about the same, US$50-100.<br />
<br />
So the question is, do you want to spend $100-200+ for a new drive, or $300-400 for a whole new computer that is HUGELY superior to the current machine ...
<br />
<br />
The very minimum I strongly recommend is buying the external USB HD.<br />
<br />
<br />
*****************************<br />
<br />
<b>!!!!! BEFORE YOU DO ANY MORE, DO A FULL IMAGE COPY BACKUP to an external HD !!!!!</b> (actually, do 2 or 3 and test that they are useable!)<br />
<br />
Doing this kind of work, deleting files and defragging excercises the HD a great deal. If there are any weaknesses in it, it could die in the middle of the process!<br />
<br />
<br />
****************************<br />
<br />
The "Win Drive" Palcouk is talking about is your C: drive, where Windows is installed. It probably is almost all of your drive. The little bit of space used in the D: (Recovery partition) cannot be reclaimed.<br />
<br />
Reducing TEMP folder allocation is good if the current allocation is too large.&nbsp; If you run out of space in the folder you will get an error message. You just have to run disk cleanup to free up space again.<br />
<br />
Disk cleanup does NOT uninstall applications. It does delete temporary files that accumulate.<br />
<br />
Another cleanup tool I can recommend is CCleaner: http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner<br />
It is a safe tool that I've been using for over a decade. <br />

<p>
(2012 09 – Ron) I have played with it I like that you can filter out files &amp; folders as you identify you can’t touch them allowing you to focus on remaining space.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also like that it redraws space allocations in real time as files are deleted.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>Here some Other options to free up HD space. – tree map – space map</b>
<p><b>Note: </b>Buy the USB drive first, then make a Full Image Copy backup BEFORE you start deleting. That way when you realize you "oopsed" and deleted something you REALLY NEED, you will have something to recover from. Use a tool that
 will allow you to easily extract the files. DriveImage XML</p>
<p><b>External USB drive</b></p>
<p>Buy an external USB drive in the 1TB or larger size range. That way you could move all of your data files to the drive if needed. PLUS you will have space to make several image copy backups to this drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you plan on buying a new
 computer in the next year or two, you should consider buying a "USB 3" type drive. Although USB3 is not important for your current machine (it will work at USB 2 speeds), on a new computer it will work up to 10 times faster than a USB 2 connection. So you
 might as well consider planning for the future.</p>
<p><b><u>"Decrapify"</u></b></p>
<p>If you are deleting apps, take a look at other apps you have and do not use regularly.&nbsp; Here is a link to a review of a couple of tools to help you "decrapify" your computer:</p>
<p>www.7tutorials.com/removing-bloat-crapware-pc-decrapifier-or-slimcomputer</p>
<p>Consider using 3rd party tools to unisntall apps. The third party tools often are more aggressive about deleting everything with old apps.</p>
<p><b><u>Disk Cleaner Utilities</u></b></p>
<p>It won't hurt to use a couple of disk cleaners. They are tuned to look for different things.&nbsp; But don't let any of them run automatically. Do a scan and check the results to ensure it doesn't get over enthusiastic</p>
<p>CCleaner is a free util that will identify and delete many unused files: http://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER</p>
<p>http://www.wisecleaner.com/wisediskcleanerfree.html - another one I use periodically</p>
<p>http://www.thewindowsclub.com/system-restore-manager-for-windows-released - I don't know if it will work on XP. What it does is allow you to see and delete system restore points you may not need.</p>

<p><b><u>Duplicate File Finders</u></b></p>
<p>Use one or more duplicate file finder tools, ie:</p>

<p>http://www.mindgems.com/products/Fast-Duplicate-File-Finder/Fast-Duplicate-File-Finder-About.htm</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>there are a lot of small system and application files that are duplicates that you really don't need.&nbsp; The main example is alternate language support. You will see things like the EULA and HELP files in a dozen or more languages
 you don't read. You can delete them.</p>
<p><b><u>Locate Large files to delete</u></b></p>
<p>Find a "tree space" type disk mapping utility. They display file and folders sizes as relatively sized boxes. This makes it easier to identify places to focus on because they have the largest impact. Here are some examples:</p>

<p><b><u><br />
</u></b></p>
<p><b><u>File Compression</u></b></p>
<p>After you do all other file cleanup, and before Defragging, consider turning on XP System File Compression.&nbsp; File compression will add a little delay when you read and write file, but is a worthwhile trade when you are short of space.
 You can identify a lot of data files you don't use frequently.&nbsp; The same goes with Applications. While you don't want to compress the whole "Programs" folder, you could compress application subfolders for applications and application sub elements you don't
 use frequently. Things like "graphics" or "artwork" or "samples", or even "Help" are very rarely used, so taking a little longer to open them is not going to be a significant impact on your performance.</p>

How to Use NTFS Compression and When You Might Want To
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/133264/how-to-use-ntfs-compression-and-when-you-might-want-to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/133264/how-to-use-ntfs-compression-and-when-you-might-want-to/</a>
</p>

<p>
The NTFS file system used by Windows has a built-in compression feature known as NTFS compression. With a few clicks, you can compress files, making them take up less space on your hard drive. Best of all, you can still access the files normally.</p>
<p>
<span>Using</span> NTFS compression involves a trade-off between CPU time and disk activity. Compression will work better in certain types of situations and with certain types of files.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><u><br />
</u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Defragment Utility</u></b></p>
<p>After you finish all of the file deletion, run a file defragmentation utility. This will consolidate files and free space.&nbsp; it may coincidentally free up a little space. The main thing is by defragging your HD it will read and write files
 faster.</p>
<p>XP comes with a simple defragger: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314848</p>
<p>there are also better freeware. I've been using defraggler for a while, but have used others in the past.</p>

<br />
Save HD defragging for after you have finished your cleanup efforts.<br />
<br />
"Gaps" on the HD are not eliminated by the disk cleanup process. To do that you have to run a "defragmentation tool" . Defraggler is a good tool that I've also been using for a long time http://www.piriform.com/defraggler .<br />
<br />
De-fragmenting is a necessary process in XP, but it is NOT designed to reclaim space.&nbsp; Sometimes it does free up some space but you can't count on it.<br />
<br />
Defrag should work with the space you have, but it may take a while.&nbsp; Don't use the "Quick Defrag" option. It is only appropriate after you've done a full defrag.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you run Defraggler (or any other defrag tool) you will probably see that your Windows "Swap file" / Virtual Memory file is greatly fragmented.&nbsp; If it is, there are 3 things you should do.<br />
<br />
First, turn off the "let Windows manage swap file" setting<br />
Second, consider changing the swap file size.&nbsp; A rule of thumb is Swap file size should be 1.5-3 times the RAM you have installed. More will not help and less will slow down your machine.<br />
Third, defragment the Swap file. That takes a separate tool other than Defraggler.&nbsp; Do an initial defrag, then defrag the swap file, do another full hd defrag.<br />

Here is a tip that describes how to change the System restore allocation:<br />
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html<br />
<br />
What you want to do, is take a look at the number of restore points you have now and decide if you can afford to reduce that number<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>I gave it a try and it looks like a really handy tool!</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;System Restore Explorer is a tool which allows you to browse system restore points on your computer and select individual ones for deletion should you wish to free up some disk space. It also allows you to mount the contents of
 a restore point into a folder so that you can browse and copy individual files, without the need to perform a full system restore.</p>
<p>When you select a restore point and “mount” it the tool will create a shortcut to that particular restore point in the root folder of the drive, which will allow you to browse the contents and copy files. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<br />
Partitions are a way of subdividing your HD into "logical" drives. With an older, relatively small drive like this it is very unlikely that you have any unallocated space. There is probably 1 partition in addition to the C: drive, the one used for the "recovery
 partition".<br />
<br />
Here is some more information on partitioning although I don't think it will help in your specific situation<br />

<b>User profile info to Data drive</b>
<p>If the reason you are doing an image copy backup is that you are re-installing windows, now is a good time to consider re-partitioning your HD to create a separate DATA partition. That way, in the future, if/when you have to re-install
 windows again you are at risk of losing less personal data simply by saving all personal files to this new drive. With a little extra effort, you can also redirect much (all) of your personal windows "profile" files. That way, even if you don't re-use them,
 you lose even less of your personal files</p>

            <p>Wow: So much to learn.&nbsp; Gosh, will I ever find the time to learn all this stuff?&nbsp; However, much of what you've shared has set my mind and actions in the right direction.&nbsp; I do have regular backups, but I've instructed Norton 360 to put them onto my HDD.&nbsp;
 I am now thinking about using their (what I believe) is their cloud drive.&nbsp; I just have some confidentiality concerns before doing so.&nbsp; I'm also thinking of purchasing an external Hard Drive as another possible option for my&nbsp;computer backups.&nbsp; Like you pointed
 out, the cost of 1-3 TB is reasonably priced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing all this information.&nbsp; I have not tried to run defrag again, which I purchased from PC Tune Up Maestro.&nbsp; I learned that I had to free up, at least, 3% of my Local Disk (C:) before attempting to run their defrag function.&nbsp; Before I started
 to remove files from my Local Disk (C:), I don't believe I had the minimum space requirement to run PC Tune Up Maestro's Defrag function.&nbsp; This is one reason why I've been in the process of moving files off my Local Disk (C:) onto CD-R disc(s) and video files
 to a DVD+R disc(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also just reconsidered using PC Cleaner Maestro.&nbsp; They ran a special on it for $9.95.&nbsp; I haven't purchased it yet.&nbsp; I was planning on getting it next week.&nbsp; But now that&nbsp;you've reminded me about CCleaner, which I've also used on occasion, I'll have
 to ask their tech support at PC Cleaner Maestro what makes their program any different than what CCleaner does, which is (as we know) free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Sonic burner which came with my notebook computer had some issues.&nbsp; After going to the website Creator, I discovered that the verison of Sonic on my computer was no longer supported.&nbsp; So, I removed it from my computer.&nbsp; Upon the recommendation of another
 tech person online, I found out about FreeBurner.&nbsp; I've been using that burner to&nbsp;move my files to disc.&nbsp; However, I experienced a few problems with using their software that I've written them about.&nbsp; I am waiting on answers to a few recent questions the past
 couple of days.&nbsp;&nbsp; The freeburner software has worked for the most of my efforts.&nbsp; However, their program really lacks good tech instructions on using it properly, which may be the cause of some minor difficulties that I've experienced.</p>

<p>(I'll rewrite it here for your convenience.&nbsp; Please elaborate.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Office accounting was withdrawn by MS some years ago, assuming you have the installation media &amp; Key it can be reinstalled</u></p>
<p><em>Okay, now I can feel confident in removing the Office Accounting program from the suite of programs.&nbsp; I&nbsp;just confirmed that I have the product key for the suite of programs on MS Office Professional 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>However, a follow up question before doing
 so:</u></em></p>
<p><em>When and if I decide to reinstall the Office Accounting 2007 program&nbsp;and it's sub programs then:&nbsp; Will I be able to do so without reinstalling the complete suite of programs.&nbsp; My fear is if I have to reinstall the entire suite of programs then it will
 effect items which those programs control.&nbsp; For example, Word 2007 lists document files that are either currently available on my hard disk (HD) or have been moved onto a CD-R for storage.&nbsp; Now, if I&nbsp;have to completely reinstall the Word 2007 program then
 Word's ability&nbsp;to find currently available&nbsp;document files on my HD,&nbsp;from the formerly&nbsp;installed Word 2007, it may not be possible to find those former document files--however, I am not sure about&nbsp;this prediction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a similiar concerns for Excel, Outlook,
 Publisher, and Access 2007.&nbsp; Can you elaborate on this question?</em></p>

<p>In fact there are various laws in place that can force the cloud providers to hand over your files without any notification (US Patriot Act, but there are others around the world).&nbsp;

<br />
Yes, the interpretations I've read say that the "patriot" act allows the US gov't to subpeona files from foreign subsidiaries of US companies.&nbsp; Say your cloud company is "Pie in the Sky, UK" and is only a UK owned company, your data is "safe" (until the UK
 police ask for it. And they have a law that forces you to give up your encryption passwords!). But if through the miracles of "bags of money" someone like MS owns a piece of the company, as a US company the gov't can require that they provide the files stored
 on "Pie in the sky, UK".&nbsp; And since the "patriot" act deals with Terrorists, and the gov't is never wrong (WMD, 9/11, Ruby Ridge etc) you and your granny are automatically considered terrorists who are guilty until proven innocent (maybe) so they don't even
 have to tell you they have subpeonaed your information....<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>Encrypting Backups:</b><br />
Sorry, I haven't looked that specific feature so I can't make any recommendations. Google is your friend. There are lots of magazine articles reviewing software.<br />
<br />
If your favorite package doesn't offer it, you can use an external encryption program, for example Truecrypt, to encrypt your backups before you store them in the cloud<br />
<br />
<br />

I don't know for sure, but I believe that the shortcuts you are talking about should not be removed during the uninstall.
<p><em>I think the uninstall process automatically takes care of short cuts.&nbsp; Again, I'll look into this before doing anything.</em></p>
<p>The simplest thing to do is copy them some other place BEFORE doing the unisntall, then you are safe.<br />

<br />
Using DVD (or CD) +/- RW&nbsp; rather than only +/- R&nbsp;&nbsp; is simply a matter what the hardware and software you are using supports.

<em>I'll be able to copy my files now stored on CD-R's or DVD's to the USB TB removable HD.&nbsp;
<u>I'm just wondering if that will be easy or cause any concerns?</u>&nbsp; Once that is accomplished, I'll have both copies on my CD-R's or DVD's and the USB TB HD.&nbsp; So that will be suffficient.&nbsp;
</em><br />
<br />
Sure, copying from CD/DVD to the USB HD is a good idea. Make sure to store them in different locations, so if one is damaged/lost, the other is not.&nbsp; ie ask family or friends to store the CD/DVD for you.<br />
<br />
******************<br />
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>2) Files are one thing.&nbsp; Programs are another.&nbsp; <u>I wonder how do I copy the programs on my computer to the USB TB removable HD?&nbsp;</u>
</em><br />
<br />
Some (small) programs are explicitly identified / defined as being "Portable". These programs can simply be copied to another device, like a USB drive. But Windows programs that have to be "installed", cannot.&nbsp; Installed Windows programs tend to scatter files
 in multiple directories, and they create many, sometimes hundreds and even thousands, registry entries.&nbsp; You cannot simply copy them to a new location.&nbsp; That is why you have to do IMAGE COPY Backups. The backup files can be stored on the USB HD.&nbsp; Then you
 can use the backup program to restore them back to the HD when you need them. But the whole drive is restored, not just individual programs.<br />
<br />
<br />
EULA's typically do allow you to make image copy backups of installations. And they often even allow you to make (a) backup copy(ies) of your installation disk or file.<br />
<br />
So, the real answer to your question is that you should make backups of the installation media, disk or file, and the Registration number /product Key required to re-install them.<br />
<br />
***********************************<br />
<br />
Part of your backup process should include running one (actually more, since they don't all find the same programs) of the following programs. They generate reports of programs currently installed and their Product Keys (in many cases).
<br />
<br />
<b>Tools to Extract Product Key</b>
<p><span>FYI: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem. The underlying mechanics of Windows
 8 are essentially the same as Windows 7 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</span></p>
<p><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>Your original package or purchase confirmation email</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>Online download account</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>You can extract the Product Key from the machine itself</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>Image copy backups of system with Office installed</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>Activation backup utilities</span></p>
<p>From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called
<b>TOKENS.DAT</b> to store encrypted product activation keys:</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\Tokens.DAT
</p>
<p>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareLicensing\Tokens.data</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</p>
<p>I have tried the first 6 in this list with various degrees of success:</p>

<p>For the longest time I've told Norton 360 to backup my computer items to my computer's HD.&nbsp; So, Question:&nbsp; If I change where I put my backups (like to a 1 to 3 TB USB HD (most probable choice for me) or to DVD+RW discs (a possible choice for me) or even
 the Norton 360 cloud drive (an unlikely choice for me)), then how can I remove prior backups from my computer hard drive known as Local Disk (C:)?&nbsp; And if the backup on my Local Disk (C:) is hidden [You may have said that somewhere in this exchange] then how
 do I find it?</p>
<p>And...and ...how do I make an image backup of my HD?&nbsp; How is that different than just telling my machine to make a backup of something?</p>

<h2>            Infinite redirect loop when loggin in to Mail</h2>
                    
<p><em>Split from this thread</em></p>
<p>I have the exact same problem with Chrome (IE works). Item c above (signing in directly) doesn't work for me. The ct=xxx number increases infiinitely. If I attempt to access a shortcut direct to, for example, a sharepoint site I can login on Chrome but if
 I then attempt to access the Mail app I go back into an infinite loop</p>

                    Hello! I've been using the Nokia Asha 206 since April of this year. Everything is going allright but whenever I try to install an application, it shows that ''You don't have enough space on your phone memory'' Even after clearing all of my files in the
 phone memory (ofcourse I can't delete system files) the problem still persists. Could you please rectify it ?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)

<p>I've been having the same problem! Everything is on my memory card but the phone still says the phone's memory is full. (It also says I've got 3.8 MB worth of files in an empty gallery...) I can't download anything, the browser's slow and it's even slow
 when I turn it on. When I've tried using the phone without the memory card it's even WORSE.</p>
<p>Please help us out here, Nokia.</p>

<h2>            How do I print just one label.</h2>
                    Hi, I have Publisher 2013 and it works great on every label that I have had to print using Avery templates.&nbsp; Here's my question, what if I've used every label on the sheet except the last label in the last row.&nbsp; In
<strong>Word</strong> you can just simply tell the program what row and what column you want, but you can't seem to do this with publisher, or can you?&nbsp; All advice appreciated.<br />

            <p>My advice? Throw that page away &lt;grin&gt;. Seriously, the chances of getting your sheet to align properly in the printer are not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Publisher does not have that Word feature.&nbsp; To use Publisher instead of setting up your publication page as a single label and then printing multiple copies per sheet, you will set up your publication as a full sheet of labels, laid out exactly as your label
 sheet, with columns and rows of text boxes the size of a label aligned to each label on the sheet. Now you can type in any text box on the page, including the last remaining label, and print a single label per sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not use Word?</p>

            this would be amazing and would allow devs to get a better understanding of hardware/software communication and could allow for better and more stable apps and more devices being ported to one OS or another so better for the consumer

</p><p>Sign in using Facebook is on the process of retirement, although Skype has not released an announcement yet. Skype also does not have an option to import Facebook contacts. You can ask your Facebook friends for their Skype Names and manually add each Skype

<h2>            na.exe- I think there I have a worm in my computer that isn&#39;t being detected by my antivirus software.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there I have a worm in my computer that isn't being detected by my antivirus software. When I was removing things from the startup menu by running msconfig there was a file called NA.exe. How do I remove this? Is it enough to just uncheck it so it
 doesn't start when I boot up?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

    <title>Microsoft Security Essentials reporting false positives in the Bitcoin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edc678  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials reporting false positives in the Bitcoin blockchain, constantly notifying users.</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today, a virus signature from the virus "DOS/STONED" was uploaded into the Bitcoin blockchain, which allows small snippets of text to accompany user transactions with bitcoin. &nbsp;Since this is only the virus signature and not the virus itself, there
 apparently is no danger to users in any way. &nbsp;However, MSE recognizes the signature for the virus and continuously reports it as a threat, and every time it deletes the file, the bitcoin client will simply re-download the missing blockchain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be a joke or prank, simply because this particular virus does nothing more than periodically show "YOUR COMPUTER HAS BEEN STONED" on one out of every eight computer boot-ups, and is over 25 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to get a verification here that a) what MSE is actually detecting is the signature for a virus and not actually the virus itself, b) that there is truly no danger to users of bitcoin simply because of the limitations of the blockchain to carry all
 the code needed for a virus, and c) MSE can and should be updated as soon as possible to bypass signatures found in the blockchain, as its constant alerts of finding threats in the blockchain is not only worrisome, but can create panic and negative perception
 of bitcoin as a whole, damaging its reputation and annoying users. &nbsp;It's important that MSE be updated with a more selective virus detection algorithm for blockchain files.</p>

            <p>You have a couple of alternatives:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run linux inside a VM on your PC, for example on vmware or virtualbox, and then run bitcoin on top of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Alternatively, run visio on top of Wine on linux. I'm not sure how well this works, the licensing aspects etc., but the purpose of Wine is to run native Wind*ws apps on linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, if you have a serious amount of coins in your on-line wallet, it's better to put them on cold storage, or if you need them to be online, they should be on a clean, dedicated machine not running anything else.</p>

            I'm not even sure the Stoned virus would run on machines that MSAV does. Appropriate action would be quarantine if it cannot run. Appropriate action would be quarantine just due to it's known impact. Adware these days has more of an impact than Stoned.&nbsp;

<h2>            Teams not working</h2>
                    Hi, I think there has been a new update to Office 365 and my teams Desktop App stopped working. I tried the following things but no avail:<br />
1) reinstall the app and sign back in<br />
2) Try Web Version<br />
3) Installing on another windows&nbsp;computer<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, MAC and Mobile App work just fine. Thank you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
