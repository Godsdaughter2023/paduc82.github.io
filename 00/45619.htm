<p>Seems to be a bug and not a sync issue, since many are reporting it in the feedback app.</p>

            <div>That was my thinking too.&nbsp; Continuing to research it.&nbsp; Thought I'd let you know that I contacted my friend in San Jose and his issue occurs on AT&amp;T U-Verse which is his personal home ISP.&nbsp; He's not using AT&amp;T U-verse webmail, but rather Gmail &amp; Yahoo!
 Mail, so I will be sending him your fix above to try.&nbsp; That's 3 different&nbsp;ISP webmail failures &nbsp;so far [Verizon, Cox, and AT&amp;T U-verse].&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>Some more information from today; when logged into my Win10 with my Live ID account, I can now send E-mail from Win10 Mail from Verizon E-mail account to my Outlook.com E-mail account.&nbsp; (Outgoing external E-mail).&nbsp; However, I still cannot do a self-check
 E-mail test from my Verizon E-mail account to my Verizon E-mail account when attempting to send from with Win10 Mail app.&nbsp; Self-check E-mails work on all ISP webmails, all versions of Outlook clients, Outlook Express, Thunderbird, Postbox, and just about any
 other E-mail client you can name.&nbsp; Also, did not receive the reply back in my Verizon inbox (from within Win10 Mail) sent on the same computer from my Outlook.com E-mail account.&nbsp; On this particular test I did receive an
 all down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I'd also like to mention that I only have 2 E-mail accounts in my Win10 Mail app: (1.) My Outlook.com E-mail account, and (2.) My Verizon.net E-mail account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!&nbsp; My friend in San Jose was somewhat satisfied that we were all working on the problem.</p>

<p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got an update with Good News for you I think.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I believe I may have solved the problem with the Win10 Mail syncing issue.&nbsp; I was testing Gmail &amp; Yahoo Email accounts for my friend I mentioned who lives in San Jose with the AT&amp;T U-verse webmail.&nbsp; While trying to get those to work, I got the same syncing
 error, and I experienced an epiphany!&nbsp; What if my Anti-Virus &amp; Firewall in my Norton Internet Security were blocking the&nbsp;Mail syncing?&nbsp; I temporarily disabled them both, and voila: it worked!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=D&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First my Verizon ISP webmail synced, and it began sending/receiving to/from my Outlook.com account.&nbsp; Next I reinstalled my Gmail and Yahoo webmail accounts and they too began working.&nbsp; After I tested sending both self-check tests and outgoing external E-mails
 between all 4 accounts in Win10 Mail; I re-enabled my Norton Firewall and AV auto-protection; everything continued to work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some theorizing on why; I believe that Norton could not complete the syncing with incoming and outgoing ports that the Verizon POP3 servers require (Incoming server: pop.verizon.net:995:0; Outgoing server: smtp.verizon.net:465:0).&nbsp; It appears that when I
 ran the<strong> "fix it"</strong> button in Mail, it puts in the old non-SSL ports (incoming:110; smtp: 25), which didn't work.&nbsp; Microsoft might want to take a look at that for Verizon and each of the other ISP webmail providers.&nbsp; With the Norton off, Mail
 was able to sync since Norton wasn't<strong> "holding" </strong>those ports closed as security holes, and let Mail do it's thing to sync with the Verizon Mail servers.&nbsp; Once working, after 15 min. or so, I re-enabled my NIS both Firewall &amp; Auto-protect.&nbsp; It
 appears that Norton added those server/port numbers to an internal&nbsp;"whitelist", and once added closed up all other ports not being used by any of the other webmail accounts.&nbsp; All 4 E-mail accounts continued to work, send/receive ok between one another including
 the all important Verizon account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've sent this information to my San Jose friend with the AT&amp;T U-verse.&nbsp; Hopefully, he'll get it working too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'll post back what we find out.</p>

            My situation is different.&nbsp; I have an admin account and a user account.&nbsp; With Windows 8.1, Windows Mail worked in both accounts.&nbsp; After upgrading to Windows 10, The admin Windows Mail is synced and works.&nbsp; However the user account says "not synced."&nbsp; If
 I take the path of mail, settings, accounts in admin, Outlook and Yahoo are listed.&nbsp; When I take that same path in the user account, there no files listed that can be deleted.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            <p>I have had the same problem for weeks. MS chat have tried to resolve it on numerous occasions and sometimes get it working for a day. &nbsp;I got it working on my old POP settings for a couple of days then 8007274c error comes back. &nbsp;All accounts work fine with
 Outlook from browser WLM works if I kill my MS account. &nbsp;I have tried all the suggestions( stopped my anti-virus. &nbsp;Still does not work. WIN 10 Mail does not work on IMAP or POP accounts its DEAD like the Parrot.</p>
<p>If anybody finds a solution that works for more than a day please Post.&nbsp;</p>

 strange to me.</p>

            <p>I also have not been able to receive pop3 emails with win 10 Mail. I use verizon.net for email pop3 server. I can send emails ok, but not receive. Mail tries to sync, but hangs for a long time with nothing downloading. I tried to disable windows Defender,
 but no luck. I tried to log in as a local account, but also no luck. &nbsp;Often when clicking on mail accounts, and then the problem email address, it will not let me "change mailbox sync settings", it is grayed out.</p>
<p>This seems like a bug in win 10 Mail. &nbsp; My gmail accounts work perfectly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Blu-ray burners in windows 10 home 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I just 'upgraded' to windows 10, and one of my two Blu-ray burners&nbsp;has disappeared from my hardware list, and it was working perfectly in windows 7 home premium 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed that the second drive is&nbsp;there in&nbsp;my cmos, and neither the windows device manager nor the disk management&nbsp;see it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;five media devices:&nbsp;1x 500GB SSD, 2x 500GB HD, and 2x Blu-ray burners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me if we are limited to only one burner?</p>

            Hi Amanda.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.

<br />Type printui.exe /s &gt; OK.
<br />Click on Drivers tab.
<br />Look for Printer driver. If you see it click on it and click Remove at the bottom.
<br />Select OK.
<br />Select Apply and OK on the Print Server Properties windows.
<br />Close Devices and Printers.
<br />
<br />B. Install the Driver

            If you want to buy the $1 deal you would need an Xbox gift card. A Game Pass gift card would just add game pass to your account and you would just be paying the amount you have to pay for the gift card itself.

    <title>&#34;turn adapter off&#34; missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexofindy  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;turn adapter off&#34; missing</h2>
                    <p>I have an Iogear GRU521 Bluetooth USB adapter, which uses the Broadcom Bluetooth 4 chip.&nbsp; My computer is new and runs Windows 7 Ultimate. &nbsp; Occasonally, the adapter loses connectivity and I have to reset it.&nbsp; The easiest way to do&nbsp; this would be by using
 the "turn adapter off"&nbsp; menu&nbsp;item that should appear in &nbsp;in the context menu (i.e., right click menu) for the Bluetooth icon in my system tray.&nbsp; But "turn adapter off" is missing from the context menu.&nbsp; Similarly, if I look at the context menu for the "Broadcom
 BCM20702 Bluetooth 4.0 USB Device" in Device Manager there's the usual item to "disable" the device is missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea how I can get the option of disabling or otherwise reseting the adapter without either rebooting the computer or&nbsp; physically disconnecting the USB adapter?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Wasn't quite what you said, as it turns out I didn't give quite enough information when I posted my question. &nbsp;My computer is new and had Atheros bluetooth built in to the motherboard. &nbsp;This never quite worked right, and disconnected all the time, so I
 disabled it in the Bios and installed a Broadcom based Iogear bluetooth usb adapter. &nbsp;But, I did not uninstall the Atheros drivers that came with my computer.
<div><br />
<div>Once I uninstalled these, and reinstalled the Iogear/Broadcom drivers as you said, I got the "turn off adapter" menu item back. &nbsp;Seems fine now (I hope!)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks very, very much for posting an answer!!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OS:&nbsp; Windows 7</p>
<p>Program:&nbsp; VST Synth Roland Edirol HQ Orchestral VSTi 1.01 (ArCTiC)</p>
<p>Problem:&nbsp; Won't install</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried numerous times to install the above program, and I keep getting an error message reading, "Windows cannot find C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\ARCTIC~1.exe.&nbsp; Make sure you typed the name correctly, then try again".&nbsp; The only option is to click
 "Ok" and after I do, another box reads, "Could not execute the external program C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\ARCTIC~1.exe".&nbsp; After I click "Ok" on that message, another error comes up and reads, "Windows cannot find C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\arctic-loop.exe.&nbsp;
 Make sure you typed the name correctly, then try again".&nbsp; After clearing that message, the
<strong>final</strong> error box displays reading, "Could not execute the external program C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\arctic-loop.exe".&nbsp; After clearing
<strong>that </strong>error, the program automatically closes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried these fixes:&nbsp; I have gone into "folder options" and clicked "Show hidden folders" to make the App Data folder visible.&nbsp; That didn't work.&nbsp; Then I tried to run the program as an administrator, and
<em>that </em>didn't work.&nbsp; I have even tried running the program in compatibility mode, and even
<em>that </em>didn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have searched the internet to find out if and where I could download the executable files&nbsp;ARCTIC~1.exe and arctic-loop.exe so I could place them in the App Data file, thinking then the program would be able to see them.&nbsp; Nowhere
 have I found a way to download these files.&nbsp; I have run out of options.&nbsp; Please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you on this issue. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the query, it looks like you are unable to install VST Synth Roland Edirol HQ Orchestral VSTi 1.01 (ArCTiC) software on the computer as you get loop error message prompting “<strong>Windows cannot find C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\ARCTIC~1.exe.
 Make sure you typed the name correctly</strong>”.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to ask some questions in context of this issue:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) How are you trying to install the program? Is it using a media or using a setup file on the computer?<br />
2) Did you download the software from any website?<br />
3) What is the error message that you get when you try to install the program in compatibility mode?</div>
<div>4) Do you face any issue while installing other program or software on the ocmputer?</div>
<div><br />
<br />
<div>It seems to be an issue with the setup file of the program as it is unable to find the ARCTIC~1.exe file while installing the software.<br />
<div><br />
You can check for the compatibility of the program in Windows compatibility center. You can refer to the link to check:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, let’s try to uninstall the programs completely using Microsoft Fixit and then try reinstalling
<div>it again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the methods accordingly:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now try to install the program again and check if you get the same error message.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to install the program in clean boot and check if any other application or
<div>program is restricting the installation of the software.</div>

            Hi Debbie, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />It sounds like you're connecting directly to the printer instead of printing over your network, which is why it would be asking for a password.
<br />
<br />You could try the default HP Direct password, which is 12345678.
<br />
<br />That should help you direct connect, otherwise you could try printing through your wireless network.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

                    <p>I'm trying to install Windows 7 onto a new SSD but I lost my install disc, so I'm trying to download an iso from this site:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's an error when I put in my product key. I contacted technical support, and while they were able to verify that it is a valid key they weren't able to do anything else, only pointing me towards this site which also had an error:&nbsp;http://whistlercloudservice.cloudapp.net/en-us/software-recovery</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if there's any other way of obtaining an iso, or if I just have to call Microsoft to try and fix this.</p>

<p>bom dia Beetle... </p>
<p>vamos lá... quando eu usava pen-drive no Xbox 360 (faz mais de um ano - agora uso HD externo - não sei se mudou)... ao formatar no Xbox ele criava arquivos de 1 gigabytes para uso exclusivo no Xbox... ou seja, se a pendrive tem 16 giga, ele cria 16 arquivos
 de 1 giga cada... todos sem conteudo mas no momento da formatação ele já faz isso... de tal forma que ao abrir no PC voce consegue visualizar tais arquivos. Ao abrir seu pendrive no PC verifique se tais arquivos existem ou não (se não me engano eles são criados
 como HIDE). Se for isso, sem problema algum, pode usa-los normalmente em seu Xbox.</p>
<p>Antigamente (e creio que continua válido ainda hoje)... o Xbox só reconhece FAT, logo formatações NTFS não sao reconhecidas pelo Xbox.</p>

<p>latm76, o processo acima é para Xbox ONE, como o OP não referiu o console, coloquei o da última geração, mas você tem toda a razão. O processo que citou para para o Xbox 360</p>

<h2>            Laptop hangs at Microsoft Corporation loading screen&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>My HP G60 Laptop (Vista) won't boot up.&nbsp; It "hangs" on the Microsoft Corporation loading screen that has green bars in the load bar.&nbsp; It won't go into safe mode, and when it tries to "repair" the problem it only gives me a list of what is wrong (technical
 messages) and it repeats the hang again. I can post a reply of those messages to you after this post.</p>
<p>I knew it would fail soon, because it was running entirely too slow and it's only a year and a half years old.&nbsp; What upsets me is that I had finally earned enough money to purchase an external hard drive (it is also an HP) and when I tried to start up my
 laptop, it did this! It worked a few days ago, too. I really want my personal data to be saved so any kind of complete clearance of my laptop data and such is not what I prefer.</p>
<p>I am hoping to find a solution on here as to how to fix the problem, and if I do indeed need to take it to Best Buy, how much will it cost to repair it and is it worth the cost?&nbsp; Is there a cheaper place to get it?</p>
<p>I understand I have many questions so please bear with me and thank you so much for taking your time to answer!&nbsp; Also I am not completely technologically efficient so if you prepare steps for me to follow please make sure they are simple to understand.</p>
<p>Thank you!!!!!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Best chance to retrieve the data is to put the drive into another computer as a 2nd drive,<br />
or into an external USB case. Either way you should be able to copy the data to removable<br />
media such as CD, DVD, or USB drives.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7</strong>.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;serious error and "may" not be repairable without professional tech support from<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your<br />
System maker's Support.</p>
<p>Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Vista disks. Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
With a Windows 7 or Repair disk try Startup Repair - (the possible fixes are same as these though<br />
the titles are named differently.)<br />
<br />
Here are the troubleshooting methods to try to fix the issue :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

=========================================<br />
<br />
If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />
<br />
If you need to make repair disks - these help repair Windows not re-install.<br />

<p>==========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help :<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Windows 7 disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can retry System Restore from the Recovery or Windows 7&nbsp;disk.<br />

<br />
Or from the Command Prompt :<br />

C:\Windows\System32\rstrui.exe<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
1.&nbsp;Do you also get an error code?<br />
2.&nbsp;Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the following methods and check if it resolves the issue.<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>Windows backup or restore errors 0x80070001, 0x81000037, or 0x80070003.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973455</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If you are using an external hard drive for the backup, make sure it is turned on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>Try to exclude all the pre-selected libraries when you start the backup. To do so, follow these steps.<br />
a)&nbsp;Open Backup and Restore. Make sure to select “Change settings” in the backup and restore window.<br />
b)&nbsp;Select the drive you wish to use for the backup.<br />
c)&nbsp;Now, select “Let me choose” before clicking Next.<br />
d)&nbsp;From the list, uncheck all the pre- selected libraries and also uncheck “Include System Image”.<br />
e)&nbsp;Select files that you want to backup or your user profile which is usually; C:\Users\’Username’ (where ‘C’ drive is the operating system drive) and then click Next.

<h2>            Skype Calling&#58; Answer Automatically&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    The most-recent Skype update (version 8.0.0.44736) has made once-simple settings incredibly difficult to find. The previous version of Skype allowed me to check a box labelled "Answer incoming calls automatically". If anyone would be able to direct me
 to this setting on the newest version of Skype (or explain how it would be possible to safely download an older version of Skype), I would be incredibly thankful. Thanks!

    <title>Worst gaming console&#47;experience ever - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coupledmink83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Worst gaming console&#47;experience ever</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong><span>As far as my complaint list for Microsoft X-Box goes, I'm not even sure where to begin ... Do I start with the frustrating logistics of securing an XBox Live
 account, or should I place my focus first on the console's apparent design flaws?&nbsp; Or perhaps I should address the much larger problem of corporations increasingly forcing console users to interact online (a no-no in my book.)</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>(sigh) I'll start with XBox Live.&nbsp; Forget&nbsp;the instruction manual that comes with the package, because those who wrote it apparently skipped&nbsp;their required collegiate
 courses in technical writing.&nbsp; The only thing the manual tells you how to do is hook up your "ethernet" cable to your high-speed internet modem.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk about&nbsp;the bare minimum of information!&nbsp; Would you like to know what happened when I&nbsp;did&nbsp;what
 those few instructions told me?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nada.&nbsp; Zilch.&nbsp; No prompt&nbsp;displaying further instructions appeared, no<em> anything</em> appeared!</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>So I went online to investigate further and found an X-Box-Live-For-Dummies-type article&nbsp;written by self-proclaimed technical guru Jared Newman called "How&nbsp;To
 Hook Up XBox Live" ...&nbsp;Here's a snippet, under the heading "Getting Started":</span></strong></span></p>
<p><em>Connect your ethernet cable to the Xbox 360 on one end and to either your cable modem or an open spot on your router on the other end.&nbsp; Turn on your Xbox 360. If you have a disc in the tray, press the center button on your controller and
 select the option to return to the console dashboard.</em></p>
<p><strong><span>Folks, I stopped reading once I got to Step 2, because there's no way to "turn on your XBox"!&nbsp; LMAO!!!&nbsp; I tried with the controller and then I tried&nbsp;by pressing&nbsp;that
 big circle on the front of the console ... y'know, the one that just arbitrarily fires up the "red ring of death"<br />
every now and then to let you know that your console sucks?&nbsp; I also attempted to make sure that everything I
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">could</span></em> connect between my console and my computer
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>was</em></span> connected.&nbsp; Again, more nothing.&nbsp; More nada.&nbsp; More zilch.&nbsp; Yes, I was online and, yes, I checked everywhere for something ... something to let me know I was on the right path!&nbsp;
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Sorry, Mr. Newman, but it appears as though you should demand a refund for all those college degrees you boast in your byline --&nbsp;Either that, then you need
 to learn how to be more specific in your instructions and not just assume that certain technical steps are being taken
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>before</em></span> the reader is supposed to "turn on the XBox" ...</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Now, recall what I said in my opening paragraph about corporations like Microsoft and Sony increasingly forcing video-gamers&nbsp;into an online setting.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I'm not even sure how this kind of crap got started -- or am I the only&nbsp;gamer on the planet who believes that video games and the internet should remain two
 separate entities unless I specifically <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>ASK</em></span> for that marriage-made-in-Hell?&nbsp; Apparently so.&nbsp; I've&nbsp;had my X-Box console for&nbsp;almost two years now and have never once entertained the idea of bringing my games into an online setting with a bunch of anonymous&nbsp;mean-spirited teenagers who
 only want to *** up my chances for unlocking more "achievements".&nbsp; That sort of thing might be fun for the younger crowd, but I grew up&nbsp;playing Pitfall&nbsp;on the Atari 2600, and I like things simple.&nbsp; Uncomplicated.&nbsp; As completely devoid of the prospect of a
 "hassle" as&nbsp;the situation&nbsp;can possibly be.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Video-gaming online should be an "option" for a Microsoft XBox customer like me, not&nbsp;a requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;But thanks to the greed of the corporation to which I
 unwittingly became a ***, I can't unlock all the set-achievements that come standard with my games or&nbsp;even&nbsp; "update" my dashboard-profile.&nbsp; I
<em>used</em> to be able to "update" that profile regularly ... until one day, out of the bayou-blue, an "error message" popped up instructing me that I could no longer update my gamer profiles until I signed up for XBox Live.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>As frustrating as&nbsp;it was, I had been able to at least
<em>tolerate</em> this ridiculous arrangement for a little while, thinking:&nbsp; <em>
I'm being blatantly forced to sign up for something I don't care for in order to fully enjoy&nbsp;a product&nbsp;I've already PAID for, but that doesn't mean I have to give in, right?&nbsp; That doesn't mean I have to be&nbsp;the willful&nbsp;sucker.</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>And then the worst happened:&nbsp; One of my all-time favorite game-titles,
<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, originally only available for PlayStation 2 and GameCube, was re-released for the XBox 360 console in September 2011 with a brand-new makeover.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp;reading this bit of news in the latest edition of
<em>GameInformer</em>, I was ecstatic, more than chomping-at-the-bit to get my hands on it.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Except I couldn't just go out and buy a hardcopy of the disc as I could do with other games.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Nope -- I had to sign up to XBox Live and then download it!</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>So I caved in.&nbsp; Finally, after two years and&nbsp;thanks to
<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, I caved in and decided to sign up for a&nbsp;membership.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Which, of course, leads me back to the first part of this complaint.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>And the complaints just keep coming!&nbsp; How about&nbsp;a snippet of the&nbsp;following letter I&nbsp;wrote on July 22, 2010, Microsoft&nbsp;case-number (1135679509):</span></strong></p>

<p><em><span><strong>I purchased a brand new X-Box 360 Elite in February, unaware of an apparent flaw in the console design that places the game-disc itself directly in danger of being destroyed
 each time it’s engaged.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>According to at least one Microsoft representative, an employee for a local GameStop here in Birmingham, and a disturbingly high number of sources obtained via online,
 the slightest bump to the console, or even a mere fluctuation in the vibrations emitting from the console, can actually cause a permanent, irreparable searing into the data-side of the disc as it’s engaged.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>This is exactly what happened to my brand new Alan Wake disc this morning: As I was playing the game, the screen suddenly went dark, and a prompt appeared informing
 me that the game-disc "could not be read". This was accompanied by a small trouble-shooting menu suggesting that I either remove the disc and wipe it for smudges or scratches, or simply restart the console.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>Because I take special care in the handling of all my games, music and movies and knew well that there
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">were</span> no smudges or scratches on the disc, I employed the latter suggestion first, and to no avail. I then removed the disc, examined the data-side, and discovered the anomaly that certainly wasn’t there before
 I had placed the game inside the tray: a perfect curving scratch running very near the outer rim or edge of the disc itself, long, deep and lethal.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>How did this happen? The console itself had not been moved at any point prior to the moment the disc was destroyed. Nor did I or anyone else "bump" it. My XBox, which
 I’ve owned for less than six months, was perfectly level and stationary when it scorched my game, thus rendering the disc fit only for the nearest wastebasket. I’ve only had Alan Wake, for which I paid the full $60 price, about three weeks.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>Also, even supposing I or someone else had accidentally bumped the console, that still doesn’t explain the severity of the scarring to the disc or even precisely how
 it was scarred. Normally, moving or bumping a console during gameplay results in a screen-freeze or some other perfunctory "hiccup"... not the kind of permanent damage I saw this morning. It is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> unreasonable for the consumer to expect technical safeguards to be in place against actual property damage caused by normal, everyday outside interference.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>(TWEAK) Furthermore, why is the XBox console always being advertised as standing horizontally when doing so clearly puts the game at unnecessary risk? Microsoft representatives
 tell me that it’s unwise to stand the console as it's actually advertised in the instruction manual.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>According to the GameStop representative and other sources, this specific problem isn’t uncommon with other XBox owners. He cited an actual design-flaw in the console
 regarding the absence of a second "buffer" component that helps hold the disc in the tray as the data is being read. While certainly sympathetic to our situation, said representative also told us that GameStop employees receive discs bearing the very same
 type of scratch each week from customers trying to obtain refunds or store-credit. These discs, understandably, are automatically refused.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>Even worse, we have absolutely no satisfactory recourse with Microsoft, one of whose representatives actually confirmed the console’s extreme sensitivity to vibration.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>We have spoken to four separate Microsoft customer-service representatives, two of them supervisors. We were told by all that a monetary refund for the defective console
 was out of the question – a response we actually anticipated, because the 1-year warranty offers decidedly unspecific terminology regarding actual monetary reimbursement.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>However, the warranty
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">does</span> specify that we at least have the option of having the console serviced or repaired within the given time-frame.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>The problem with this is that the Microsoft representatives told us service or repair was neither necessary nor even an option, declaring the damage to my copy of Alan
 Wake as user-related, not console-related ...despite our insistence to the contrary, in addition to the evidence we are now amassing to support our claim.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>And, again, according to that evidence, the problem with my console isn’t damage or a system-component gone bad, but an actual design flaw.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>I’m out $299.00 over a video-game console I’ve owned and used responsibly for less than half a year – a console I certainly cannot use now over fear of what happened
 this morning repeating itself. I’m also out an additional $60.00 for Alan Wake. Furthermore, my other XBox games are now worthless because I have no console. And, to top it off, I’ve incurred the added insult of one of the richest companies in the world allowing
 me no avenue of legitimate recourse whatsoever as a consumer.</strong></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><strong>Apparently, Microsoft’s policy when it comes to resolving matters like these is: "It’s your fault and your problem, not ours."</strong></span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firstly , if you needed help connecting to Xbox LIVE , Xbox Support ( 1-800-4MYXBOX ) has always been an option to call and troubleshoot , and also , here on the forums there are many people that could have assisted you with that .</p>
<p>Also , you have been able to update manually via a USB Flash Drive , CD or DVD or even Xbox LIVE , link below .<br />
( &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-360/how-to/update-xbox-360/system-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-360/how-to/update-xbox-360/system-updates</a>&nbsp;) .</p>
<p>Connecting or being a part of Xbox LIVE has always been a free service , only having a "Gold" account is paid .</p>
<p>Now , referencing the issue you had with the console standing up and the disc rendering useless now , usually , a console will run just fine standing up with no issues , the only the thing that would have made do as it did , would it being on a slightly
 un-even surface "and I mean even in the slightest" , or being tipped over while the disc was in use .</p>
<p>To solve that problem , just simply lay it down while in use (:</p>
<p>Now , some discs are replaceable via the retailer you purchased it from , &nbsp;or you can exchange it via "Xbox 360's Disc Replacement Program" link provided here - (
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-360/troubleshoot/games/disc-replacement-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../disc-replacement-program</a> ) .</p>
<p>As I'm sorry to hear about your misfortune with Xbox , I honestly hope things brighten up for you , hope this helped is some shape , form , or fashion ! .</p>

                    <p>I need to give you "Feedback" You are making my life a living hell. I cannot download your windows 10 update as its 8GB!!!!!!!!! I only have a system on my laptop with 2GB Installed... Its shocking that I cannot stop these updates, and you are not smart
 enough to produce smaller updates, As for your "Feedback App" You have included it in your 8GB Update that I cannot download..... I do not want to use an external drive. I want to make my own choices like we used to have on Windows? You have taken away our
 choice, I am so upset you are invading my personal space in these ways, and not serving your customers who use small systems. That you cannot work that out is incredible. I feel like ditching Windows forever and moving to google. You do not have any interest
 in serving your customers interests anymore. Just your Corporation and Governments. This is what happens in evolution, eventually you will be gone as consumers find more user focused applications.</p>

            What you are describing is appreciated, however there is nothing about this update that indicates its a special one, its just 8GB in size and I have a 2GB simple laptop. No I do not want external drives or pen drives attached.<br />
<br />
You are presenting a "Stay of Execution", in that I can temporarily block, however when they bring out the next one, my system will be killed, and I will have to buy a new laptop.<br />
<br />
The biggest crime here, is Microsoft themselves, hiding, and not allowing me to contact them directly about this issue. I am hopping mad.<br />
<br />
After all these years, I am considering dumping Windows all together, going to Google or other more user friendly options. They have not deserved my loyalty all these years.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please access your account through the web to check if the recovered emails that you are looking for are available online. One of the possible causes why your emails are lost is you are using an e-mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access
 your account. This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option “Always leave a copy of the message on the server” is not selected. There are also security programs that include e-mail filtering systems. There are instances
 when the software configuration causes false positives causing valid messages to be either sent to the junk folder or deleted altogether.</p>
