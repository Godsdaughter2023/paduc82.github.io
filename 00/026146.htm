<p>As I already stated: Try to switch your tenant to modern authentication. This seems to solve the problem for us or is at least a good workaround. You can check your tenant Modern Authentication setting by using an Exchange Online PowerShell using this command:</p>
<p><strong>Get-OrganizationConfig | Format-Table -Auto Name,OAuth*</strong></p>

<div>
<p>After showing off some of the new features in Windows 10 at today's <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/build-2015-day-1-keynote-wrap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Build 2015 Day 1 keynote </a>Windows Insiders in both the Fast and Slow Rings can try out the newest version. That release to the Slow Ring also means the ISOs are immediately available for download so you can clean install this new build.</p>
<p>Microsoft <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/04/29/new-windows-10-insider-preview-build-10074-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
announced the availability of the latest build in a blog post </a>by the Ring Master Gabe Aul.</p>
<p>According to the blog post this build brings back some highly requested <span>
<a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/aero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Aero</a></span> Glass elements in the user interface and the development of the OS continues to benefit greatly from&nbsp;the input of Windows Insiders. In fact, Insiders received a nice shout out
 in one of the Windows 10 keynote videos today.</p>
<p>As you prepare to update to this new build here are some of the new&nbsp;features you will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>General UI improvements throughout including a new Live Tile animation on the Start Menu.</li><li>Improved high DPI display support.</li><li>An A/B test is in place for the return of Aero Glass and if it is widely accepted it could return in other areas of the OS and not just in the Start Screen/Menu transparency.</li><li>Continuum gets the simplified taskbar we saw in today's keynote demo and closing an app returns to the Start Screen in Tablet Mode.</li><li>Improvements with multi-tasking with &nbsp;Alt-Tab, Task-View, and Snap Assist.</li><li>Updated default Windows sounds.</li><li>Cortana visual changes as shown <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/build-2015-day-1-keynote-wrap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
during the Day 1 keynote</a>. She also gets some Bing Instant Answers integration and several new questions she can answer.</li><li>Updates to&nbsp;Music, Video and Xbox Apps</li><li>Windows Store Beta, now with the Blue tile, has been expanded to 41 markets and Xbox Live games and in app purchases should be working.</li></ul>
<p>Microsoft did fix some of the issues in build 10061 that should improve the experience including:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now launch Win32 (desktop) apps from the Start menu again.&nbsp;</li><li>You should be able to download music in the Xbox Music and Music Preview apps.</li><li>When you minimize an app playing audio, it should continue playing in the background.</li></ul>
<p>As with any of these preview builds there are some known issues so make sure you are informed before clicking the install or update button:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers cannot enable Developer Mode in the Settings app for installing and testing apps on this build. We’ll enable this in an upcoming build. In the meantime, you will need
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=536447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">enable your device for development using the Group Policy Editor</span></span></a>.</li><li>There is an issue in this build preventing some games from playing in full screen mode. We’re working to get a fix out via WU as soon as possible.</li><li>The People app continues to crash. We’re planning to release an update for the People app through the Store Beta that fixes this.</li></ul>
<p>This build can be installed by going to Windows Update on your current Windows 10 Technical Preview system and checking for it or you can go to the
<a href="https://insider.windows.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Insider website </a>
and download the 10074 ISOs directly.</p>

<h2>            Printing labels in Word 2010 in a vertical order</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to get an Avery label (J8160) mail merge in Word 2010 to print the data down each columns rather than across them. &nbsp;I've got a mailing list sorted alphabetically and want it to print down the first column, then the second, then the
 third. It only seems to offer you printing horizontally across each one and then moving to the row below.

<h2>            Just bought Office 365 Home but won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>I've just purchased Office 365 Home but it won't install - a message keeps appearing that reads "we had a problem installing your Office programs. Is your internet connection working? Do you have enough free space on your hard drive?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet connection is fine and the laptop is relatively new so disk space is not a problem (have checked it anyway).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've read the online help guide and tried the suggestions - turning off firewall etc.</p>
<p>Nothing seems to be working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know why it won't install?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the except same problem as LM92. I also tried to clean boot the PC and see if the problem persists.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's still there. I believe its nothing to do with the applications installed in the system. Nor does it have anything to do with the internet connection (assuming I get a speed of 95Mbps or so).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have around 104GB of space in my Windows_OS partition. I still have no clue as to why there is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, please help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>So, I recovered back to windows 8 and then installed the software. Rather than a solution, I believe it more like running away from the problem.</p>
<p>If anyone above is using Windows 8 (which I don't think is the case), they should be able to install the software without any problems.<br />

            I understand. I also had a lot of problem finding a solution. Why don't you find a way to directly contact a Microsoft Technician, or wait for LM92 to respond to the question.&nbsp;

<p>I think I pressed the online support link that comes with the error box, and at the bottom of that page there's a link to another online support? You should be able to chat online to a technician or request a call back. You can pick the technician you talk
 to, from what I remember.</p>

<h2>            I need to move text on label to the right without moving label page itself</h2>
                    Windows XP.<br />
I am using Avery labels 5261.&nbsp; I have used WORD 2000 and the merge function to create the labels..&nbsp; The labels were printing too close to the top of the label and too close to the left edge.&nbsp; Was told my new laser printer is feeding correctly and that it was
 a software issue.&nbsp; I was able to do a workaround of the merge document by using 2 paragraph marks instead of one between each name and address and selecting print blank lines.&nbsp; Now the labels print one line done further on label which is much better.&nbsp; An Avery
 tech was able to move the text over further to the right so the text is not printing too close to left edge.&nbsp; She did this by selecting all the text (then the ruler disappeared).&nbsp; I blieve she told me to click on the plus sign or something to get the ruler
 back.&nbsp; I somehow get the ruler back but seems to be missing the parts I need to move.&nbsp; Can you advise me.&nbsp; Maybe you can also advise the correct was to adjust the label to be placed lower from the top edge.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            Labels are simply tables. You can format the first label in your merge document to give the appearance you require, either by changing the table cell margins or by indenting the paragraph style used to format the text in the label. You can move all the
 labels down a tad by inserting space before the first line or by increasing the top margin of the labels template. When you have the first label correct, propagate the labels to transfer the revised layout to the remainder of the labels - see<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/mail_merge_labels_with_word_xp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Backing up OneNote classroom when leaving a school</h2>
                    I'll be leaving my college at the end of the year, and I've share my OneNote files with another staff member who can share it with whoever's replacing me so they get that material to use, but I want to keep a copy for myself as there's a lot of hard work
 in there. How can I back up the lot (several year's worth of articles etc) so I can open it in a private onenote account after I leave?

<p>Hi Shaz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please check the followings and see if they meet your requirements:</p>
<p>1. Sign in your OneNote Online via a broswer.</p>
<p>2. Click Class Notebooks tab under Notebooks.</p>
<p>3. Right click the notebook &gt; click Save a copy to your personal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If there are many class notebooks, we would like to suggest going to your OneDrive for Business via browser &gt; select Class Notebooks folder, download it and then upload it to your personal OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Tina</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t receive emails using Windows live mail. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t receive emails using Windows live mail.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: a changed webmail password has not been updated on my microsoft live hotmail account,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;For security reasons I changed a webmail password, this was the password to my default primary main etc e mail in my microsoft account and live mail and hotmail.</p>
<p>But then I noticed I stopped receiving mail on the live hotmail ( under the&nbsp;control of the&nbsp;microsoft account).&nbsp;I could receive e amils from the account through live mail on the desktop but this is no use to me as a working platform as I am abroad and cannot
 send from this (<em>although &nbsp;if there is a way I could I would like to know it</em>)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;tried a number of times to update the e mail account password including messing around with alias e mail addresses&nbsp;but nothing worked, and&nbsp;I found no way to get the live hotmail to receive e mail from this account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;other accounts linked to live mail were working. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error message on the account says it cannot receive e mail,&nbsp;previously it said there were sign in and password problems . For the last 24 hours or so it says "We couldn't get your messages: Please wait for a moment The problem should be fixed soon."&nbsp;&nbsp; but
 still with the error message in red at the account list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fhave found&nbsp;no access to correct these problems, password correction attempts take me back to the microsoft password eventually, and other attempts to change password in the e mail&nbsp;accounts section would not save.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In desperation I tried uploading to the cloud to seee it this would kick it back into some sort of connection/password&nbsp; verification update and it did re connect the primary / default&nbsp; e mail account but when I connectd the other accounts to the cloud the
 acceptance/congratualtory e mails all came through to the default account even though I had elected to "add another e mail account" and actually chosen the different one by name.
</p>
<p>Now the error message are still on the default account though it seems to be receiving mail but the mail has stopped on another of the linked accounts and I have received nothing in the hotmail since I "joined " the cloud . live hotmail has not registered
 this and reports that all is working fine on t his acount though still as I said above with error measssages on the one which is now receiving e mail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I have new folders which are called "uploaded messages" I have no idea what to do with these or why they have appeared.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I opened a support query and added to it a few times yesterday, it said they would reply in 24 hours but they didn't. ... &nbsp;and today&nbsp;it has shut me out. It was at:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?tp=il&amp;tenant=WOL&amp;sd=winlive&amp;incno=1213588020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">https://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?tp=il&amp;tenant=WOL&amp;sd=winlive&amp;incno=1213588020</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;so I am back at square one. I would uninstall the whole thing and reinstall if this is&nbsp;the way to get it working. Can I do this and not loose all my e mails? Can anyone help me here?</p>

<p>your response relates to WINDOWS MAIL which is a separate programme from<strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WINDOWS MAIL <strong>is </strong>receiving the mail fine but as I am abroad I cannot send from it. This is normal .</p>

<p>To send and receive all mail for the last year I have been successfully using <u>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WINDOWS LIVE HOTMAIL</strong> ( ie the new OUTLOOK which under the dominion of the microsoft account ) &nbsp;IS THE PROGRAMME WHICH IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. It is this one which does not allow access to check change or update information about e mail
 accounts. Neither can I export my e mails from here and neither can I find out if I can safely delete all the accounts and add them again and not loose all my e mail records. I have no idea why the microsoft outlook /live mail hotmail &nbsp;is broken and&nbsp;and has
 not recieved e mails from &nbsp;two of my&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;since 9th. &nbsp;of this month, after i changed the account passwords on eircom for security reasons. THe WINDOWS MAIL programme allowed me to update those passwords and continued to receive mail, the WINDOWS
<strong>LIVE</strong> HOTMAIL/OUTLOOK programme has not successfully updated passwords and has not received mail and has not allowed me access to change or update the e mail account passwords. I hope this is clear. thanks again

<p>Thanks, explored the site and yes it does have some challenges with N8 (touchscreen only h/w). I have posted a comment checking for a Symb ^3 update, lets see. Within a few weeks I will also try it on my N8.</p>

<p>It looks like SimpleIRC was ported to Qt which fixes most of the issues found in the older Java version. You can check it out at

<h2>            Room mailbox auto accept in a hybrid environment</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have a hybrid environment with Exchange 2010.</p>
<p>On premise environment contains several conference room resource mailboxes; those are configured to auto accept meeting requests. On-premise users are able to book meetings with the room mailboxes and the bookings are accepted automatically.</p>
<p>Office 365 users cannot - the meeting request is not accepted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it supported?</p>
<p>I've seen this post:</p>
<p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/6614fe7f-192b-4f13-8d29-d60a23b5d99e/hybrid-deployment-room-mailbox?forum=exchange2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/6614fe7f-192b-4f13-8d29-d60a23b5d99e/hybrid-deployment-room-mailbox?forum=exchange2010</a></p>
<p>However creating a transport rule did not solve the issue for us so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice will be appreciated.</p>

<p>My outlook/hotmail account was recently blocked, and to fix that im supposed to send a verification code to unlock it. However, when i try putting in a mobile phone number to have the code sent to (not mine since i dont have one atm, though its not supposed
 to matter which i put) I get the message "Service unavailable, please try again later".</p>

    <title>iPad Pro 9.7 and Smart Keyboard problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            iPad Pro 9.7 and Smart Keyboard problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had a problem with the iPad Pro 9.7, Excel and the Smart Keyboard? Every time you type into a cell, the software keyboard pops up momentarily before promptly disappearing - like Excel makes the cell editable, displays the iPad keyboard, then
 realises the Smart Keyboard is attached, and then removes the iPad keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reproduce:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Type something into any cell</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Press return to move onto the cell below</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Start typing something, and the software keyboard will pop up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just me, or is there a solution/known bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anthony</p>

<h2>            Issue with Activation of Windows after a Hardware Change</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Greetings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Windows Insider since 2015, one of those who were given a copy of Windows 10 in July 2015. Last week, the machine I use most often developed a Motherboard fault. I opted for a better Motherboard. Now I am receiving a message to activate Windows. I
 have tried the Start-Settings-Update and Security=Activation-Troubleshoot route. It doesn't work. How do I get to link my free Windows 10 license to my current machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All advice will be appreciated. Thanks and regards.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 / 8 with a retail license, then you may have a one-time chance to re-activate your copy on the new hardware, namely motherboard. Go to "Change Product Key" page and enter your W7/8 retail product key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>The Activation Troubleshooter is designed for this situation. As long as you were logging into the same Edition (eg. Home or Pro) of Windows 10 with the same MSA as now, the Activation Troubleshooter should find that digital license and apply it to the new
 motherboard.</p>

</p><p>Greetings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thanks to all those who put in time and effort to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I feel that perhaps I will need to do what Don Cuthbert has suggested. I have tried to reactivate via the Settings . . .&nbsp; I recently changed my hardware . . .troubleshoot route many times and will try it again, but the result is always; "We could not reactivate
 Windows on this device. Try again later." I am baffled by the fact that the Hard Drive on which Windows is installed is the same one on which Windows is installed since July 2015. Updates are set to automatic. No update has been missed; therefore, the details
 or signature of the ab initio installation would be somewhere in Windows, as well as the entire history of updates.&nbsp; In the light of this:</p>

</p><p>Greetings Don and thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A few moments ago, after posting my latest response, I tried reactivating, again with the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully appreciate that changing a Motherboard and simply transferring the Hard Drive to another computer is indistinguishable right now. Perhaps software engineers may find some means to do this at sometime in the future. As I said earlier I am not a computer
 person. I have, however, heard that every hardware component has a distinguishable signature. This maybe incorrect and what follows can be incorrect as a consequence. In my case, the type of Motherboard in the machine I was using was not available and I had
 to buy a different type of Motherboard, which also necessitated a change of casing. So this is, in effect, a different machine. It, however, contains the same Hard Drive and the same RAM. I also added an auxiliary Hard Drive (160 GB) for the purpose of mirroring
 my Windows installation. If the reactivation process could take into account a combination of different factors such as the signatures of various components on the one hand and a few key questions pertaining to the user's personal information, it could, to
 a certain extent, minimize misuse of the reactivation process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, however, someone is bent upon using the reactivation process with mala fide intent, they will certainly find some ways to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again and regards.</p>

<p>Yes, since you have only used the hard disk and RAM from the old PC, the new one has no license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a stand-alone Windows license from the old PC, then you are legally permitted to transfer that license to the new PC. But if it was an OEM, or any other non-stand-alone Windows license, it is not transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, installing a new hard disk and RAM in the old PC and then clean installing Windows 10, without using a Product Key, would still activate, so the old device still is licensed.</p>

</p><p>Greetings Don and thank you again for the time and efforts you are putting in to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far as I know, the free license has to be stand alone, because the Windows 10 installation I had was one of those given free by Microsoft when Windows 10 was launched in July 2015. I had preregistered. The license cannot be an OEM one, because I had myself
 installed Windows 7 Ultimate on that old machine. I think the crux of the problem is the processor in this machine. That old machine had an X86 (32-bit) processor. I talked to my computer vendor about an hour ago. He confirmed that the processor is an X-64
 one. The present, in-activated Windows 10 is a 32 bit one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bear with me. This may be a tad bit long. I need multiple machines for my bouquet of free educational sites - so I buy used machines. Pakistan is a huge market for used machines. Organizations in the US routinely upgrade their computer
 inventories and their redundant machines end up as cheaply exported lots to South Asian and other markets. These machines are reconditioned in some cases and sold at something like 40 to 60 per cent of the price of a new machine. I am a semi-retired person
 and try to conserve as much resources as I can for my sites, so, since 2009 I have been using used machines, which, incidentally, serve me very well. The machine whose Motherboard conked out and mired me in this issue was bought in 2009, when I first set up
 my site. It was destroyed by an abrupt withdrawal of power supply by the power utility. Pakistani manufactured UPS do not deliver pure sine waves, so I do not use them. Imported/smuggled UPS that do deliver proper sine waves cost about 50 per cent more than
 a new computer. A new, properly configured computer with 4 GB DDR3 RAM and 3 GHZ processor and synchronized clock speeds costs upwards of US$1250 (That would be around PKR 1.5K here) here. I subsist and finance my sites with my pension and some free lance
 work . What with the cost of hosting, the Internet and other incidentals I need to scrounge wherever I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The free Windows 10 was a boon. It added immensely to my productivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bearing with me. Regards.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Credit card declined.</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Support.</p>
<p>In late November 2015 we received a new Credit card and updated the credit card information in the subscription section of our 365 account.</p>
<p>The new card <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">replaced</span> one ending 4010 (I believe). The new card ended 8590.</p>
<ul>
<li>A few weeks ago we received a mail saying that the card ending 4010 had been declined.
<ul>
<li>We checked, and the 4010 card was not listed against any of our products. </li><li>Just in case there was a problem with the new card we added a second card (ending 7295) and set this to have payments taken from it.
</li></ul>
</li><li>We then received a mail saying that the card ending 4010 had been declined.
<ul>
<li>We checked again. None of the cards ended in 4010. </li><li>In case there was an error, we deleted the replacement card entry (ending 8590) leaving card 7295 as the sole payment method.
</li></ul>
</li><li>We then received a mail saying that the card ending 4010 had been declined<br />
<ul>
<li>We checked again. None of the cards ended 4010. </li><li>We added another card, in case there was a problem with our card issuer. This last card was on my personal account ending 3217
</li></ul>

</li><li>We then received a mail saying that the card ending 4010 had been declined. </li></ul>
<p>As far as I can tell no payment has been taken from the final card. I cannot check the earlier ones as our accounts dept is still on Holiday break.</p>

<p>I need someone from Microsoft payments to contact me directly, we have to get this resolved as our business relies on mail!</p>

            You can't. These "descriptive" definitions, and their specific dimensions, are built in to the printer drivers.  

You can define a "custom" size, but the default "Legal" will still be there

    <title>Problem with email containing Zix encrypted link being removed from - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with email containing Zix encrypted link being removed from user&#39;s mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Thanks for any help you can give me on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have an Exchange 2007 server which our employees connect to using Outlook 2010, Outlook 2007 &amp; Outlook 2003. This particular user used to get emails from this one organization that contained a zix security link in their email. This user had Outlook 2003.
 I just gave them a new computer with Outlook 2010 on it.&nbsp;They are&nbsp;able to send and receive emails just fine except for these emails with the Zix security link in them. I had them sent to me and I got them just fine and I use Outlook 2007. Also I checked exchange
 2007 and it shows the emails being received and delievered. I had the user close out of Outlook 2010 and I went into their mailbox using OWA. I had the user who sends these Zix emails send this email again to the user experiencing the issue. It appeared in
 OWA just fine. When I had the user open up her Outlooks 2010 the message just disappeared. I checked their inbox, deleted items and junk email and it wasn't anywhere to be found. Sounds to me like Outlook 2010 is somehow removing this message from the users
 mailbox. When I look in OWA it is gone in there as well. They have no rules setup to do anything with these emails when they arrive. Any ideas what might be going on or has anybody seen this issue?</p>

<h2>            Project Spartan missing in Build 10049 &#40;UK&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been looking for Project Spartan in the newest Windows 10 build but have had no luck. I have looked around to find it, searching it, looking at the 'All Apps' tab on the start menu etc. Is it because it's not available in the UK maybe because I
 would really like to use it ASAP so I can get to work on using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Alex</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Another Issue has formed after I restored a backup, I go to re update and it doesn't show the latest build!</p>

<p>Thank you for the replies...</p>
<p>right after I posted I thought I would double check how I was getting my updates.</p>
<p>Sure enough I had ticked "Slow"</p>
<p>I clicked on "Fast" and immediately I had an fbl_impressive download.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sure was impressive....5 hour download and overnight to install.....(Is this a record?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have 10049 with Spartan so I will now go and hide untill this"I am insignificant" feeling leaves me.....</p>

    <title>FEEDBACK Windows 10 build 9860 UI Improvements &#40;and some - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            FEEDBACK Windows 10 build 9860 UI Improvements &#40;and some others&#41;</h2>
                    <p>First off I would just like to say Ive been using windows since windows has been windows (and before anyone remember dos shell? lol). Win10 So far looks to be shaping up nicely. I am not, and never was, a fan of the 8* linueup and its UI was rancid to say
 the least. It made it difficult for productivity users in an effort to over simplify things for the facebook/twitter chatters. In order to unify the OS to make it work on all platforms you have to select the lowest common denominator and go from there. Ive
 never seen a tablet that has as much power as my desktop. This is why basic functionality (like changing colors?) was removed and more specifically aero. I dont believe it would be possible to run aero on your 4" windows phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tile concept is not new of course its been done todeath but hundreds of developers spanning more than a decade now. The windows tiles does improve it a bit but it still looks dated. Ive seen the side by side pics of Win8 and Win3.1 and while the color
 wash is obvious in 3.11 (due to severely limited hardware like cpu's and gpu's of the 1980's) the setup seems the same. However im not exactly opposed to the concept. Having a small "item" that can relay some basic information and, when accessed, perform larger
 tasks is a great idea. Currently we have this ability in the form of Icons but with a slightly less functionality (live tile). The live tile thing only works for certain things anyway. Its great, again, for the facebook hipsters but does nothing for me (such
 as a system tile that displays resource usage maybe). So on with my list of improvements I would like to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - The dreaded Tile Interface.</p>
<p>I want the tiles when i want them and dont when i dont. Im a desktop user and in that mode i dont want tiles unless specifically asked for. Tiles should be resizable to any size with a few default values. I would like a small, medium, large that i can snap
 to if needed but then be able to resize them anywhere in between. This would allow you to fit any type of layout a user may need. Make live tiles live. All tiles should be live. I should be able to choose whatever information i like such as cpu speed/temp
 or hdd throughput and display them (or at least add a system live tile). Jailbreak the tiles. They should not be locked to any particular place. I should be able to drag a tile to my desktop if i choose to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - Modern "apps"</p>
<p>Let me start off by saying I hate the term app and prefer program. Mixing the so called modern into the desktop was a stroke of brilliance. Before 10 I wouldnt even consider running one of these but now (albeit a small few) I find myself using some. Such
 as the OneNote app which is something ive been looking for a long time. Its UI however is lacking. it looks far too basic and the captions/borders arent even in line with other desktop programs. My suggestion would be to run the modern app in a desktop window
 frame. (Side note: build 9860 seems to keep all modern app captions as black).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - Window caption's/border's (The meat of the problem)</p>
<p>I understand the minimalist look. Way back in the day we had nothing but squares with no borders. It looked then, as it does now, as if the windows were simply Cut and pasted "INTO" other windows. Completly defeating the Z-Order. I Need to know that the
 C Drives properties dialog is above the Computer (This PC) window I activated it from. The square captions would be OK (We had this forever + a day with 95, 98, ME, Win2k, and Classic look in XP) if it werent for the next to zero borders. When XP arrived we
 saw a slightly larger border with RoundRect windows. This to me was a great improvement. When vista and 7 came along we saw the borders get much larger. I didnt like this although i did get used to it. It made it easy for resizeable windows on large format
 monitors (which I use). My suggestion would be to go back to the 2/3 pixel border (the ones we say in the 9x line) allowing for 3d edges like raised and sunken. It wont add too much and yet still allow improvement. Captions can remain square (i would like
 an option for rounded) but you simply must bring back gradient fills for them. A gradient consumes almost no resources with hardware from 10 years ago. nowadays its almost non existent. All of this needs to be applied to other aspects of windows such as the
 start menu and taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 - On a desktop I want power appearance.</p>
<p>If im using a desktop PC thats plugged into an a/c outlet I dont care about power usage. Its my power bill and ameren will like me more. Thats when I want to use all the features we had with aero (whatever you want to call it now). Translucency, alpha blended
 32bit icons, icon/cursor shadowing and transitional effects. I would also like this to be an option on portables (altho likely off by default) because i dont really care if i only get 2 hours from a battery ill just by an extended battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5 - Continuum</p>
<p>What can I say? Brilliant Idea. It was a brilliant idea when I (and everyone else in the world) came up with it 48 seconds after the release of Windows 8 Consumer Preview. I would suggest however a means to access it and switch between the two manually instead
 of just via plugging/removing peripherals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6 - Animations</p>
<p>Im seeing some people not liking the new(ish) window animations (open/close etc...). Personally I like it as a welcomed difference from the Win7 animations. My suggestion, however, would be to create a few more and allow them to be switched and maybe even
 a random option for those of us who like to change things up a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7 - Themes/Visual Styles</p>
<p>Whatever you call them we need them back. Including the capability of creating our own. We should be able to customize things like icons/wallpaper/animation/colors/fonts/dropshadows etc.. and store them. There should be web sites where i can download others
 in case i want a fresh look from time to time. We shouldnt need to install 3rd party programs that alter system files (uxtheme?) in order to something thats so basic its been built into every OS (including windows) for as long as most people can remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8 - Start menu functionality</p>
<p>While this isnt so much a GUI improvement it is a UI one. There is no valid reason for removing customizations from the start menu. Grouping (and REORDERING) items in the all "apps" section of the menu costs you absolutely nothing in the way of resource
 or power usage. It does make things more organized, easier to see, and easier to use your PC. Again think productivity. Pinning items should have an option to pin to the Start "MENU" not just the tile side of it. Again costs you nothing and for those of us
 who are unliekly to use the tile portion of the new start menu it doesnt make sense to first pin it there creating a portion of the menu we dont use, then moving to where we actually want it effectively destroying the portion we dont use. Seems like more time/work
 to do something so very basic. The right hand tile portion should be useable without the tiles. If i dont want tiles there It doesnt mean i want a super skinny menu thats been effectively halved. I can see two choice both of which i would like. first set it
 up with basic links for things like This PC, Control Panel etc.. or Second at least allow for cascading menu's. Personally i would like to see both but a super tiny menu is less productive and defeats the productivity gained by having a start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9 - Icons</p>
<p>Remember when we first got alpha blended icons. We could now do transparency layers and add shadowing right in the icons themselves. While it may seem small this actually rounded off the overall appearance of the OS. Virtually every window you use had some
 (File open dialogs,explorer windows etc...) and it made the appearance feel more like everything was integrated as in one OS. Looking at the new Modern Icons they feel simple flimsy cheap and plain. Some of them however do look good and ive gotten accustomed
 to them a bit from using Visual Studio (which ive also used since VS6). Perhaps either a better blend maybe something like modern icons with some shadowing or something or allowing icon sets to be switched. Either modern or alpha icons that can be changed
 in its entirety (similar to icon packager) allowing ME to choose how I want MY PC to look. what a concept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10 - Control panel v PC Settings</p>
<p>I am a die hard con pan fan. However, I do see the need for both. In this new unified OS format you cannot have just one. Heres why. In windows 8 the biggest gripe i had was with the start screen. I didnt want to be violently jerked away from my work (VS,
 PS, IRC lol) only to be teleported to what seemed like an alternate dimension when i just wanted to open a new program. Im fairly sure that even the 8* groupies wouldnt like this phenominon either. So no matter what UI you use (since continuum will allow both)
 you dont want to have to jump over from it. If im in desktop mode thats where i should stay. Control panel is where i set my settings and so on. However If im using a tablet and im in Modern mode I likewise dont want to be hurled back into the desktop. So
 PC Settings and Control panel both need to exist togethor (Im thinking we could call this continuum what do you think?) Both of these should mirror each other. I was dumbfounded when i first went to change my User account picture (ya i still do that) in control
 panel and got kicked over to PC Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11 - Virtual (About damn time MS) Desktops.</p>
<p>Ok ok I know that any windows developer will tell you that the ability has been in windows forever. Simply take a look at CreateDesktop on the msdn library website. This was a case of the OS not using its own capabilities. Remember not everyone is a software
 developer. So far this is a step in the right direction. Ive used multiple desktops for many years now (3rd party programs for windows). Most of these lacked some functionality that I wanted but had so much more that it made up for it. The live preview in
 task view is simply brilliant. I even watched an entire episode of family guy right from task view (just to test it) with no lag or stutter. Even the desktop thumbs were live as well. Brilliant MS I tip my hat to you good sir. However... There is still some
 room for improvement. Of course as many others have suggested each desktop should be its own sandbox (sorta). Icons/wallpaper etc.. should be customizeable. each one should not only have a label but also be passwordable (is that a word). In case someone is
 around when im in task view I may not want them to see sensitive work material or source code. Animations should exist even in task view mode. I love the switching via KB animations. Task view itself should have more. I may wish to use something like expose'
 or even a cube (yeah ok i am a cube fan what of it). I would like to be able to drag open windows from one desktop to another seemlessly. Not sure how to do that with aero snap but that would be great not just in task view mode. Live preview and/or desktop
 monitor. We should be able to do live previews similar to peek of the desktops we have. One difference however is the previews should be resizeable. small popup windows makes it hard to see the preview. Program/window rules. We should be able to set rules
 for various programs and force them to start on a certain desktop. For example I have a desktop strictly for Visual studio. When launched it automatically opens there. Automatically switch to desktop when needed (defeatable of course) such as opening a new
 program on a desktop or if a program requires my attention (you already have this option with tabs in Internet explorer). And last but certainly the MOST Important. Desktops ABSOLUTELY MUST SURVIVE REBOOTS. Without this the whole thing is useless. I currently
 have 6 desktops but only use 4 of them extensively (Im actually on desktop 5 right now which is labeled VMWare using Win10). If i have to take the time to set it all up everytime I reboot (windows is a reboot heavy OS) then productivity goes by the way side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12 - Online v Local account.</p>
<p>I Dont really like using an online account for my OS but I would like to use "Some" of the features. Ones such as OneNote and OneDrive without requiring me to log into the MS account. I like the idea of syncing my OS settings but ill likely never use it.
 If i do decide to use it I would want my password to be different than the MS live account password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>13 - OneDrive</p>
<p>OneDrive really needs In Place usage. I Shoudl be able to just right click my "Code Projects" Folder thats on D: (approx. 850MB thus far) and select "Sync with OneDrive" or "Send to OneDrive" or "Whatever you want it say with OneDrive". It should then mirror
 my directory (Creating a new Code Projects dir and storing the contents). Later i should be able to create a d:\CodeProjects\ directory on say a tablet and do the same thing by right clicking and boom file sync done. I keep my projects on a different drive
 and back it up to a 3rd drive. this works great for formatting and also helps in case a hdd dies adding OneDrive will simply further secure and safeguard my projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a few caveats here. I know this is a very early build and im sure some of these things are either coming or are at least on the TODO list. I simply wanted to make my case and exercise my vote. (you cant complain about the politician if you didnt vote).
 Im sure not everything here will suit everyone. Im aware of the modern ui lovers and i respect that choice. At least now it seems like we will have a choice. Desktop users didnt get one in the 8* line. All of these could be configurable and/or defeatable to
 better suit more users. I am definately loving the direction 10 is going and already its improved over 8* I look forward to seeing whats next.</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feedback. I will focus on this one part of your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Tiles for Modern Apps will be undergoing many changes with the new Universal Apps effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are a Desktop user, you are probably using the new Start Menu. When you pin a Modern App to the Start Menu, there are many new things you can do. All of the same Resizing options are still available. The Live Tile information is limited by what
 the app developer has programmed into the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can Move a Modern App to the Desktop (Create a Shortcut).</p>
<p>Simply use the left mouse button and drag it to the Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7ceaf8b-2a39-448f-bfd1-d5080ed697bf" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>After you drop the app on the Desktop,&nbsp;the Tile will&nbsp;still appear in the Start menu. Simply Right Click the apps Tile&nbsp;in the Start Menu an select the Unpin from Start option.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The Shortcut for the app on the Desktop can be configured just like any normal shortcut in Windows such as, Renaming, Changing the Icon, etc.</p>

            <p>Hi Ronnie Im glad to hear about new things coming down the line. When i was refferring to size I basically meant any size for example 44x61 or any size between (within limits of course) and I have used the shortcut for the modern apps to the desktop I think
 i meant more along the lines of dropping a tile on the desktop and its still a working live tile. similar to the way gadgets worked but not quite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured the livliness (sp) of a tile was dictated by the programs developer im thinking there should be more system tiles. For example a tile for This PC should be configurable to display various data such as ram/cpu/hdd usage or similar. My meaning in
 this is that after installing all of my software (tons btw) I end up with more than 30 tiles on the start screen less that 2% of which are "live". it looks disjointed and almost feels like an incomplete feature of windows even though i know live tiles are
 complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all in all thanks for the reply im curious to see what you guys do with the tile interface as time passes (maybe non rectangular tiles?) but the other features are definately more important to me.</p>

            <p>I have to say I believe MS really did try with this version to make everyone happy.&nbsp; Being an IT Pro, I found 8.x to be skipped by many Enterprise orgs due to user and current hardware compatibility.&nbsp; It is easy for those of us that are good at learning
 tech and taking time to learn to educate ourselves.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the everyday enterprise user has so many other tasks and job duties, they don't take the time, nor do they wish to be bothered with learning a new UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, this version I would be comfortable with going to my management and saying let's use it.&nbsp; It was very simple to set up with a base install of standard user productivity based apps, and was just so much cleaner to me than Windows 8.x.&nbsp; The
 new Start menu to me, is the best idea MS has ever had.&nbsp; The best of both worlds, Tile and old start.&nbsp; I like the more modern look of the icons also.&nbsp; I would have to say I believe this version will be a hit with all big organizations.&nbsp; I am running it as
 a VM on fairly old server hardware and it is really snappy and runs smooth.&nbsp; I have just had one issue with the background not wanting to go a different setting.&nbsp; I had to apply it twice by opening personalization two different times to get it to take a solid
 color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than bashing MS like I have seen on many of these forums, I think we should quite a bit more positive and view this from the user's point of view and set aside what we think is the best way to move forward.&nbsp; Remember we as IT Pros are here to server
 our customers, which is the user base.&nbsp; Of course, I am not saying we shouldn't express what we would like to see or what we don't want in the final OS build, just stating what the true purpose of an OS is.&nbsp; Stability, functionality, responsiveness, and most
 importance of all, compatibility and acceptance.&nbsp; MS is a for profit company, employing thousand upon thousands, and providing&nbsp;a path of employment to millions.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I couldnt agree more with this. I dont worry too much about stability because windows is very mature and aside from some hiccups every now and again it is pretty much very stable. Of course im only counting final releases and not beta's. functionality on
 the other hand is just pot luck sometimes. The start menu lacking orginization options (that by the way existed in every other itteration) is less functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will admit i am an aero fan and greatly miss the eye candy. Its partly because we had to wait so long to get any of it. It didnt even begin until XP and others like Mac and linux had tons for years. I do a lot of work with my PC and spend hours (and sometimes
 days) on it at a time. Something a little easier on the eyes is a good thing. plus i like to have fun once in a while too :)</p>

            <p>I prefer to use the term program instead of app myself.&nbsp; I think 'app' sounds more like something for a smartphone and not a PC.&nbsp; Also, Linux has some good ideas of Window animations, like the Window bursting into flames when exited, or making it look like
 a genie going back into his magic lamp when minimized.&nbsp; The best example would be Manjaro Linux, which (even for Linux) is very customizable.<br />

            <p>Hello!<br />
I read the whole post and was pretty much impressed. So i decided to take some&nbsp;time and comment on most of the things AmiMizuno &nbsp;mentioned, especially since they match my ideas to a certain degree as well. So here is my view:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Tile interface: Completely agree with AmiMizuno on this one. There are even a&nbsp;few separate discussions that demand those features to be implemented in future&nbsp;builds. There was even a post where a guy did a photoshop render of some kind.<br />
2. Modern applications really lack some features in comparison with their desktop&nbsp;alternatives. So this should be fixed. Unfortunately I do not have any knowledge&nbsp;of programming, but it seems to me that the so called Metro apps have some&nbsp;restri<em>ctions that</em>
 prevent the developers from creating the same&nbsp;application/program with the same feature sets as their desktop counterparts. It&nbsp;might be that the limitation comes from the attempt to use the same or almost the&nbsp;same api sets for phones, tablets &amp; PC. If so-then
 there is a lot of work to be&nbsp;done.<br />
3. Windows borders: I think this is a great suggestion.<br />
4. While I do not care about the power usage on my desktop, I do care when it&nbsp;comes to portable devices. So an option to turn that feature on/off would be a&nbsp;good approach, but it should still remain for those who would prefer to use it.<br />
5. Continuum-I agree that there should be an option for auto detection and an&nbsp;option for a manual setting. It would be even better if there is new hot key&nbsp;combo to switch between those two when a user wants to.<br />
6. Animations are good idea. I would only add, to the suggestion for a few more&nbsp;animations, the ability to change the speed of each animation itself.<br />
7. Themes work fine for me right now. While I do not personally care about fonts&nbsp;&amp; visual styles, many of my friends and acquaintances spend a lot of time&nbsp;customizing their Windows style: adding new styles, fonts, shortcut packages,&nbsp;etc. And they do it on a
 regular basis too. So this should be taken into&nbsp;<br />
consideration as well.<br />
8. <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Start Menu:</span></strong> Now that is my real problem. I have been asking for a&nbsp;customization abilities since day one, when I first installed the preview build&nbsp;and found out that those are removed. My suggestion
 here: as mentioned above-cascading menus, <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the ability to place shortcuts into user-created&nbsp;folders,including the tile applications</span></strong>, I do not want to have to cross an entire&nbsp;line of Metro apps
 in order to start a specific application. In older Windows&nbsp;versions I always placed my shortcuts in folders created by me. This allows for a&nbsp;tidy and compact list of folders and much, much quicker access to the program I&nbsp;want to start. I do not want to have
 to type and/or search for the application I&nbsp;want to start. I just want to start it from the location I placed it. There are&nbsp;times when I have more than 300-400 applications installed. So imagine what would&nbsp;the start menu look like if all of those have to be
 placed separately on it. My current Win7 installation has 245 programs installed and all of&nbsp;them are placed in 18 folders, including the 2 basic Win 7 folders-accessories &amp;&nbsp;startup.
9. Icons are not a big concern to me. So I will not comment on this one.<br />
10. Control Panel &amp; PC Settings should exist together as mentioned. I had a&nbsp;similar experience, although not with changing my account picture. I wanted to&nbsp;change some settings from the PC Settings menu and there I saw a warning, that I&nbsp;do not have the ability
 to change it as I needed Admin privileges!!?? I was able&nbsp;to change the settings that I wanted after opening the Control Panel and changing&nbsp;some settings there, then returned to PC Settings &amp; was able to change the main&nbsp;thing I wanted to change-then go back
 to the Control Panel and change back the&nbsp;other settings there to the state they were... Anybody got confused?? Well, now you&nbsp;see....<br />
11. Virtual Desktops-a great feature, but needs some improvements as described by&nbsp;the author above.<br />
12. I do not mind the online account, but I really do want to use a different&nbsp;password for some of the features. Plus I do not want to always be online when&nbsp;using the online account option. I prefer to choose when I want to sign out of an&nbsp;application (e.g.
 Skype-the Metro app) and then sign in automatically when I&nbsp;choose to be online. Still there are other users that are concerned (about their privacy mostly). So there is something to be improved in this field also.<br />
13. I do not care about OneDrive, I have separate external storages that I use to&nbsp;backup my files to. But for a person that actually uses it-the improvements&nbsp;suggested here would be welcome, I suppose.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 520 keyboard quit working using text</h2>
                    <p>I did the 8.1 update not long ago..</p>
<p>A few days later my sms texting went nuts.</p>
<p>The predictive text disappeared even though the keyboard setting say it's still enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst part is when I hit the space key the keyboard quits working.</p>
<p>I type a word.. hit space and then next letter will not show up. It shows I am hitting the letter
</p>
<p>but it does not show up in the actual text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I hit the back arrow then go back to my text I can type the next word but then when I hit space it quits again</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to actually text is a night mare..</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> .. space .. back arrow .. click back on text .. <strong>thing</strong> .. space .. back arrow .. click back on text ..
<strong>does</strong> .. space .. back arrow .. click back on text .. <strong>not</strong> .. space .. back arrow .. click back on text ..
<strong>work!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried to soft reset and that worked a few times but no longer is.. Hoping to avoid a hard reset..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?<br />

            <p>I had been using Office 2003 for 14 years no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I bought a new computer with Windows 8 everything was fine for a couple of weeks then Windows 8 updated itself and Office 2003 stopped working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Images would flicker in Word and you couldn't save changes. I would get constant 'Runtime error messages???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I 'upgraded' to 2013 which is unusable- I couldn't see a thing- I did all the recommended changes- lowered screen brightness, increased the font size and changed the appearance from white on white to the maximum grey on white but still couldn't see a thing.
 I changed the theme as well but that is just a joke right... a little squiggle appeared in the top right hand side with the theme on and then disappeared with the theme off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now using Office 2010- it's better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to send out my monthly newsletter via mail merge- it usually takes about 3 hours but already it's been 6 hours and both Outlook and word appear to be active but I've no means of determining the progress- in office 2003 there would be a status
 bar in the bottom left-hand corner which would say "Word is merging record number 758 of 1200 records... Word is merging record number 759 of 1200 records... &nbsp;Word is merging record number 760 of 1200 records... etc"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every piece of software under the sun tells you how long things will take- at the moment all I can see in word 2010&nbsp;is a revolving blue circle- I refuse to believe Microsoft would be so stupid as to remove something so fundamental from one version of Word
 to another... surely????</p>

            <p>For something like a Newsletter, you might want to consider using the Merge with Attachments facility on my Merge Tools Add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can download the MergeTools – 20150422.dotm

</span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>(There are no user serviceable parts inside and it should NOT be used as the basis for creating your mail merge main document.)<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The MergeTools – 20150422.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.&nbsp; In Windows Vista and Windows 7,
 8 or 8.1, and 10, the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8,&nbsp; 8.1 or 10, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box
 for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
&nbsp;When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:<br />

</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letter type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel
 workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.
<span>&nbsp;</span>For the Chart Merge utility, download the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page of my OneDrive for additional requirements of the data source for use with that utility</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the data must start in the second row of the worksheet and there should be no empty rows within the range of data that is to be processed.</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span><span>If there are multiple addressees in either the To or CC fields of the data source, the email addresses need to be separated by a semi-colon.</span></span></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>NOTE: The MergeTools applications cannot handle “Compound” MergeFields such as the «AddressBlock» or «GreetingLine».</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Instead of using those fields, you will need to insert the individual merge fields.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also want to download:</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachments, either as the body of the message itself or in the form of Word files or .pdf files.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page.<span>&nbsp;

            You should have asked about mailmerge on Macs first. For anything but the simplest merges, you're likely to find the experience much less satisfactory than on a PC.

            Regardless of which Word version you're using on the Mac, one of the things you'll find is that the Mac mailmerge converter is even less flexible than the old DDE converter that has long since been superseded on the PC versions. For example,&nbsp; the Mac mailmerge
 converter doesn’t let you specify anything other than one of the suggested names ("Entire Workbook" or a sheet name). Despite the fact that you can type into the combo box, you can’t specify a named range. Typing a range name greys out the OK button. Only
 typing a range in AnBn or RnCn:RnCn formats works. On the PC, you can use a named range on any worksheet which, amongst other things,&nbsp;means the mailmerge range can be expanded/contracted automatically - or even redirected to a different worksheet -&nbsp;as the
 named range's scope changes.

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have OneDrive folders on my personal computer that are connected to a work account that no longer exists (as I no longer work with the company). I can't delete these folders, and my OneDrive keeps trying to sign in to this non-existent account. I want
 to delete these folders and make OneDrive just forget about this account, but I can't figure out how to do so.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Meaghan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand you want to remove a OneDrive account from your computer. It seems you added the account to the OneDrive sync client on your computer and you want to remove its sync folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try following to check the outcome:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to C:\users\&lt;user name&gt;, check if the folder with unwanted OneDrive account exists, if so, delete it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Open Registry Editor and find the following place:
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Find registry with the unwanted folder name in<span style="font-weight: bold"> Data</span> column, delete the registry by right click on it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: please first backup the registry before making any changes. You can right click on it &gt; export to save the registry in another location.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5426acba-a68c-4731-9881-f2db51d2936d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5426acba-a68c-4731-9881-f2db51d2936d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">WARNING</span><span style="font-style: italic">: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your
 operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Edit at your own risk.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Then check if that OneDrive account's sync folder will disappear from your computer and check if OneDrive sync client still tries to sign in to that account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

            Hi Douglas,<br />
<br />
This issue may have been caused by corrupted system files, software conflict, or due to add-ons or extensions of Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
You can run Internet Explorer without add-ons. To do this, press the <strong>Windows key</strong> +
<strong>R</strong> on your keyboard, type <em><strong>iexplore.exe -extoff</strong></em>, and then hit Enter. Check if you will encounter the same issue.<br />
<br />
You can also refer to the steps provided in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17447/windows-internet-explorer-11-manage-add-ons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to manage add-ons in Internet Explorer
 11.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed.

If it's more than nine hours (which is how long I've left it in the past) then there's still a problem. If yours opens in less than nine hours, then your system is performing better than mine.

<h2>            Processor of New Asha Series</h2>
                    There is no talk from the Nokia about the processor of Nokia Asha 230, 500, 501, 502, 503. There are rumours that the Processor of Asha 501 is 1 Ghz single core and that of Asha 230 is 1.2 Ghz dual core.... Is this true.... If yes why one should buy 501....
 Plzz confirm that if these rumours are true?

<p>Never cared about the processor type, however, I am curious why you are so curious about the processor! Any feature which is bad because of this? The Nokia Asha 230 is a stripped down variant of the Nokia Asha 501, therefore, if you have the money, why bother
 with that model at all?</p>

            I am a techy boy of my area. Generally in my area people know very less about mobiles and mobile technology. They always consult me before buying a device; they often ask me about processor of these devices, if someone has got its answer.... Then plzzzzzz

            As Asha OS is a light mobile operating system; a 1.2 Ghz processor could effect that how fast the device will be. Thats why people ask such questions and me too is very curious to know about it

<p>Some of the main differences between these models is that Asha 230 does not have Wi-Fi and no MixRadio support (in any country). Also it has a 1.3 Mpix camera as opposed to 3.2 Mpix camera on Asha 501.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Hotmail&#47;Outlook - spam from senders pretending to be the Microsoft account team</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've decided to purge my hotmail by going through all the inbox, junk-ing all the spam e-mail in it, then going in my junk folder, selecting everything and clicking block - that way I hope never to see the same spam in my inbox again. (Oh yeah, tell
 me if there's a better way to do this)<br />
<br />
Yet what took me by surprise was that a huge portion of the spam I'm receiving is from &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;. Now that e-mail is associated in my contacts with the official "Microsoft account team" who I need to unlock my e-mail when
 I forget my password. However in this context, the spammers aren't just pretending to be them, they appear to actually be using the same e-mail! (see below)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6077f289-194f-4706-a5aa-7c8e7b45e24f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6077f289-194f-4706-a5aa-7c8e7b45e24f" /></a></p>
<p>This is an e-mail I might receive, here from "The Claim Guys", but in general from countless sources. Automatically this will go in my inbox as I have the e-mail on my safe senders list</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75b4b0c8-e0bb-49e3-84f2-7dfa33cba021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75b4b0c8-e0bb-49e3-84f2-7dfa33cba021" /></a><br />
And here's what I think is the root of the problem; when I hover over the address, Outlook quite clearly mis-identifies the spam e-mail as one from the account team. That (correct me if I'm wrong) must be the reason it's not currently filtered</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this seems so unusual to me that I'm tempted to think there might just be something wrong with my account. I mean how can the spammers possibly send from microsoft's address? Also there's some bizarre results when searching my inbox of c. 600 spam e-mails
 for stuff from this address - basically nothing comes up, and what does come up is from a different address altogether!
</p>
<p>It's possible I already moved all the account-noreply stuff into my Junk folder manually (which isn't covered in the address search), but when I move an offending e-mail
<em>back </em>into the inbox, the search still doesn't pick it up - so there's definitely something fishy going on there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway, please, anyone explain if you can. I find it worrying if junk e-mail is actually coming from these official addresses and not being picked out! But even if just to say that my account is in some way broken, any help or advice would be excellent!
 Thanks</p>
