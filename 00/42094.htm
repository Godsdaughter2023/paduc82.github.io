<h2>            Share feature on Adera causes crash.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell insperon 620 that came with Win 7, but now has the Win 10 upgrade. When I try to use the Share function on Adera, it locks up, then shuts down. I have tested the Share function on other Apps and it works fine. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling
 the game but it did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can offer.</p>

            Thanks, but that doesn't get me to a point where I can download it. That takes me to the Microsoft store site listing, but the only button is "Get the App". When I hit that, it opens the store App and I'm back to just the install option.

            I was not able to get this to work, even though it worked on the "Lite" version. I finally ended up installing it on my Win 8 tablet and got the achievement.

<h2>            Changing the channel from windows 7 media center</h2>
                    I opt to record all shows in a series .&nbsp; I had the media center running in background today while I'm browsing.&nbsp; When I bring it back into foreground, it says it is recording the show I scheduled, but it's actually recording the show
 from the channel I was watching. &nbsp; Still, I was able to change the channel using keyboard after dismissing the warning message that the tuner is currently in use.<br />
<br />
Please help.&nbsp; I do not want to miss recording a show while I was not at my computer in the future.<br />

            Hi TrinityHK,<br />
<br />
Media Center might encounter an error when changing channels to begin recording a show, or it might simply record the wrong channel. These problems are more common if your TV signal comes through a set-top box. A channel-changing error on a set-top box could
 be due to one of the following reasons:<br />
<br />
I’d recommend you to access the following link and refer the <strong>Media Center can't find the channel or recorded the wrong one</strong> section for more information:
<br />
<br />
Why didn't my TV show record in Windows Media Center?<br />

                    <p>99% of the time it just does this for infinite warfare . Every time theres an update the whole 54gb game reinstalls.&nbsp; EVERY TIME. 900mb update pops up, then the whole game just automatically uninstalls and starts reinstalling. Closer and closer to smashing this piece of junk. Cant find anyone else online having this problem. And its extremely annoying.&nbsp; </p><p><br /></p>

We appreciate your response. Based on your answers, there may be a problem with your console's operating system that is preventing the game from playing properly. To resolve your concern, you can reset your console’s OS without deleting your games or apps.
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To reset your console without losing your game data, follow these steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Scroll left on the&nbsp;<b>Home</b>&nbsp;screen to open the guide. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>All Settings</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>System</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Console info &amp; updates</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Reset console</b>. </li><li>On the&nbsp;<b>Reset your console?</b>&nbsp;screen, select&nbsp;<b>Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</b>. This option will reset the OS and delete all potentially corrupted data without deleting your games or apps.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Be sure you don’t select&nbsp;<b>Reset and remove everything</b>&nbsp;at this point. This option resets the console to factory settings, and all user data, including accounts, saved games, settings, home Xbox associations, and all games and apps will be deleted. You should only use this option as a last resort in some troubleshooting cases.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the console reset is successful, you may be prompted to repeat some general console set-up steps before you are returned to the Home screen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I already tried that, i chatted with support for a few hours. Im pretty sure we covered anything i can do. I dont know what else to do but get rid of the system. I was hoping someone else had this issue and found a fix, but i havent found anyone yet.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are still experiencing the same issue after performing the steps that we have provided, that means there is an issue with the console’s storage. It causes the updates not to install or download properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since we have already exhausted all the possible troubleshooting steps to resolve your issue, we recommend that you send the console for repair by following the steps on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are unable to access the <b>Device repair</b> page online, you can also contact our Xbox Chat Support so they can process the repair manually for you.

<p>Let us know if you have further queries.</p>

<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:

<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

<p><span>1 - Click the Windows "Start" button and select "Control Panel."</span></p>
<p><span>2 - Double-click the "Add or Remove Programs" icon if you use Windows XP. If you use Windows Vista or Windows 7, click the "Uninstall a program" link instead.</span></p>
<p><span>3 - Select the "Microsoft Office" entry and then click the "Change" button if you use Windows XP. If you use Windows Vista or Windows 7, right-click the "Microsoft Office" item and then select "Change."</span></p>
<p><span>4 - Select "Add or Remove Features," then click "Next" or "Continue." If you use Office 2003, you must also check the box on the following screen labeled "Choose advanced customization of applications," then click "Next."</span></p>
<p><span>5 - Double-click the "Office Tools" item.</span></p>
<p><span>6 - Click the drop-down menu next to the "Microsoft Office Picture Manager" item and select "Not available."</span></p>
<p><span>7 - Click "Update" if you use Office 2003. Click "Continue" if you use Office 2007 or later.</span></p>

            <span>Hi Gladwin Henald,<br />
<br />
1. Were you able to play cricket 07 before?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
</span><span>I would suggest you to un-install and re-install the game.<br />
<br />
Uninstall or change a program<br />

    <title>Windows File Size Reporting Not Accurate&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows File Size Reporting Not Accurate&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">I notice when I transfer files from one HDD to another, there can often be differences in bytes. Sometimes
 It's fairly dramatic and other times it's subtle. And yes, even with hidden files/folders selected and every other applicable folder option I can think of with just a single file in a folder, there can still be a difference. Even if I use TeraCopy to hash
 check via MD5 during and after the transfer, TeraCopy says the transferred file is 100% correct, if so, what would explain the reduced file size? I think someone said this may be a Windows bug.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">If I right click a file &gt; Properties,&nbsp;Windows says GB, but do they really mean GiB? Because I notice when
 I download files, websites will often say GiB, but when I check the file in Windows It'll say GB, but I think Windows really calculates in GiB, so why not list it as GiB? There's a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">1 Gigabyte = &nbsp;1000 Megabytes</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">1 Gibibyte = 1073.74 Megabytes</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">Also, kind've annoying, but if say--as an example--I download a file from a site that says: 26.68 GiB, then
 I right click &gt; Properties in Windows, it'll just say 26.6x (missing the 8) which leaves me to calculate the bytes. WHY can't Windows display the full file size in GB/GiB? Is there a third party piece of software I can use that will make this calculation?
 Because I backup A LOT of data and&nbsp;It's very important for me to know if my transfers/backups are accurate. I need 100% identical files, but Windows 10 doesn't exactly instill confidence.&nbsp;</span></p>

            The file size is actual size of the file. The top 2 examples show the exact same file size. Which is good!  And you get the same MD5 hash. Again, good!
<br />
<br />The file size on disk reflects the way files are saved on disk.  The disk is split up into small equal sized "blocks". When writing a file Windows finds the first "free" block, fills it then moves on to the next one.  Eventually the last block is only partially filled. The unused space is included in "File size on disk".  
<br />
<br />Windows creates an entry in the "FAT" (or newer equivalent) that identifies the next block being used by the file. Depending on how fragmented the drive is you will not have the same number of fragments and entries in the FAT.  I wonder if the size of these entries are included in the file size on disk.
<br />
<br />Other than that I don't know what would cause the difference in size on disk.

            Both drives are brand new, so there's no fragmentation.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I guess as long as "file size on disk" doesn't matter and the only thing that does matter is "size" then I'm fine with that.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t boot after first run. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt-euc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot after first run.</h2>
                    <p>After upwards of twenty re-installs of Windows 10, I am still having an issue where after the initial run, I am unable to boot again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted multiple times to run start-up repair, and Windows has run it's automatic repair many times but repeatedly feeds back to me that none of these have been successful. It shows me that an error report has been logged occasionally, but that's
 no damn good when I can't boot to view the file!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few times while trying to boot, I have had&nbsp;a message telling me that there is a file missing. I did not, unfortunately, have the forethought to write down exactly what it said, but it was something to the effect of "winstart.exe" or "winload.exe".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have managed to get the PC to boot fully into windows, is to re-install and not reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once, I managed to reboot into windows and install some drivers, but after that, I get the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have built and rebuilt many PCs and have never had so much trouble just from the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help that goes beyond your standard tech support "turn it off and on again" would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also add, that I am not a complete moron and have already run all the available repair tools built in to windows that I am aware of. In addition, I have set a system restore point after first boot and tried to restore to that, with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update: I went into the BIOS and set it to boot in Legacy mode. This has allowed me to boot back into windows. I will now attempt to install some drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Matt.</p>

                    Wireless 802.11 wireless LAN Card and Microsoft virtual wifi miniport adapter have red x's.&nbsp; I right click to enable wireless network, and it tells me waiting for users.<br />
<br />
I am attempting to use the mini for my laptop, but when I login or try to with my laptop it tells me the network is not available, which by looking at it, it obviously isn't.<br />
<br />
I switched to share the wireless network connection and it still has the red x.<br />
<br />
I have updated adapters and made the items active in the device manager, so now I don't know what to do.<br />
<br />
I tried to insert pictures but they didn't stay on after post.&nbsp; <br />

            Thank you,<br />
<br />
I have an HP6510, windows 7 64bit<br />
<br />
It is not a firewall issue as I cannot even get the computer to activate the connection, it shows a red x and when I try to activate it it tells me it is a manual connection.<br />
<br />
For pictures and clearer idea go to my post at <br />
<br />
http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Other-Desktop-PC-Questions/Microsoft-Virtual-WiFi-Miniport-Adapter-has-red-x/m-p/1757039#M27320<br />
<br />
In the mean time I will look at the the couple other ideas you listed, however the firewall and access are a mute point if I can't even get the computer to recognize the connection.<br />

<h2>            software that only runs on xp</h2>
                    I have&nbsp; very expensive engineering software that will only run on XP. Contacting the vendors - brought forth a few upgrade offers for many thousand of dollars. No enhancements other then that it would run&nbsp; on 7 or newer.&nbsp; Any suggestions ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also lost
 much software including my xp pro discs and manuals in a office fire. How may obtain a disc to setup for aother computer or to reinstall if neccessary - or reinstall if necessary.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Well xp is certainly getting phased out,building&nbsp;applications on&nbsp;current</p>
<p>software from MS has advantages.However,you can run a pc on xp and</p>
<p>another os with application virtualzation.For that info,go to this MS link.</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/appvirtualization/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/appvirtualization/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>As for lost cds,if the pc came with xp,then contact the mfg,if it</p>
<p>was retail version,its going to be tough,probably repurchase another</p>
<p>cd.Also,with xp being on the way out (3yrs ago),maybe check other</p>
<p>engineering vendors,if they are still working with xp only,question thier</p>
<p>business practices,just about every software vender has upgraded software,</p>
<p>most dont even consider xp at this point in time...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Did you run the upgrade advisor to find out if you system could run win 8?<br />
<br />
It appears you had a BSOD.&nbsp; Can you boot normally?&nbsp; If so please follow these to find and upload the log files of the crash called DMP files.<br />
<br />
We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
&nbsp;*Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive or"Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please also run MSinfo32 and upload the output as well.<br />
<br />
To run MSinfo32 please go to start&gt;run&gt;MSinfo32<br />
Go to "file" "save" and upload the saved file with the DMPS<br />
(Instructions for XP, Vista, Win 7, Win 8)<br />

            <p>I have the same problem as Deborah has/had.&nbsp; I ran the upgrade advisor, it came back clean, so I purchased the Win 8 Pro upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it was running&nbsp;it came back with that error and those parameters.&nbsp; My machine would not reboot normally at that point so
 I had to reload Windows XP Pro SP3.&nbsp; I had purchased the Windows 8 Pro backup disk so I waited 6 weeks for it so I could try again.&nbsp; When I boot with the disk in it starts the upgrade process,&nbsp;I get the new blue window logo for about 5 minutes while the harddisk
 is wiped and the new files are loaded.&nbsp; Then it gives the same&nbsp;error as before, it never gets to a menu or repair option like in past versions.&nbsp; The only thing I can do at that point is&nbsp;to reload XP again.&nbsp; It not the traditional BSOD, it's black, black as
 deep space and just as empty, so I don't believe it ever gets to the point where it's loading drivers because it's not a blue SOD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Did either of you try having Win8 reformat the harddrive and do a clean install rather than an upgrade installation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have OEM recovery discs for your system (to return it to factory OS in case the Win8 install still doesn't work) then this might be something worth trying. Alternatively you could try installing Win8 as a dual boot on its own separate partition, alongside
 the original OS,&nbsp; just to see if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is going&nbsp;work for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With OEM installed systems there may be reserved or hidden recovery partitions and or boot managers or other low level software&nbsp;on the hard drive that could interfere with the upgrade process.</p>

<p>Did either of you try having Win8 reformat the harddrive and do a clean install rather than an upgrade installation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have OEM recovery discs for your system (to return it to factory OS in case the Win8 install still doesn't work) then this might be something worth trying. Alternatively you could try installing Win8 as a dual boot on its own separate partition, alongside
 the original OS,&nbsp; just to see if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is going&nbsp;work for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With OEM installed systems there may be reserved or hidden recovery partitions and or boot managers or other low level software&nbsp;on the hard drive that could interfere with the upgrade process.</p>

Unfortunately I purchased the upgrade-only disk&nbsp;as it was on sale in January for $39.&nbsp; The disk doesn't give you the full install wipe everything option.&nbsp;

<p>I had a similar problem and I may have addressed it. I am waiting for the next scheduled backup&nbsp;to execute to verify and my configuration is different to yours but this may give you a hint for your scenario.</p>
<p>My set up is Windows&nbsp;7 x64&nbsp;ultimate&nbsp;backing up to a HP&nbsp;MediaVault 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem was the first backup worked and subsequent backups failed with 0x80070005.</p>
<p>I found out from the <a href="http://k0lee.com/hpmediavault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://k0lee.com/hpmediavault/</a>&nbsp;web site that the media vault ran a linux derivitive as its OS and there was a section on this page dealing with "Files that cannot be deleted". I used the command
 "<span>chmod -R 777 *</span>" recommended on that website to fix the "privileges" issue and found that I could then run the backups fine.</p>
<p>I actually have two windows 7 machines backing up to that mediavault that both had the same error and both were fixed by running the chmod&nbsp;command.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 License Agreement when upgrading from an earlier version of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bri the tech guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 License Agreement when upgrading from an earlier version of Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me preface this with the statement that I am not suggesting that anyone do anything that would violate a licensing agreement, just to get some clarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a question asked last year in a thread entitled, <em><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/what-happens-to-my-old-license-when-i-upgrade-to/1e7e058b-215d-4bcf-8aa2-7a2ca891dc16">What
 happens to my old license when I upgrade to Windows 10?</a></em> , the following statement was made, "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Your Windows 7 license will always be valid and will not be changed or deactivated
 because of the upgrade to Windows 10: you'll be able to install or restore Windows 7 again in case you'll need to do that (provided that you've the Windows 7 installation DVD or a set of Windows 7 restore discs or a full disk image of your PC running Windows
 7, of course).</strong></span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, I absolutely believe that this is true if and only if you were reinstalling the previous version of Windows on precisely the same machine that you had earlier upgraded to Windows 10, replacing the Windows 10 instance with whatever Windows
 happened to have been used as the basis for its upgrade process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot believe, though, that the license for the earlier version of Windows remains valid under any other circumstance, for example, dual booting the upgrade-result Windows 10 and the earlier version of Windows that served as the licensing basis
 for the upgrade. &nbsp;I have to believe that any upgrade, while leaving the original earlier Windows license intact for a downgrade, even if that downgrade is done via a system image recovery, it does not remain valid in any other context.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have to believe that there is wording somewhere in the EULA that states something to the effect that your license for Windows 10 is a direct replacement for the license for the earlier version of Windows and that you cannot install that earlier
 version of Windows on any machine, for any purpose, other than the one where it had been installed and then only on the condition that it is replacing the Windows 10 instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If anyone can give absolute clarity on this, particularly a pointer to the verbiage in the EULA regarding how the license from the earlier version of Windows transfers to Windows 10, and how and when one can legitimately use the license that
 formed the base license for the upgrade, I would very much appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brian</p>

<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>

<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

    <title>device manager reports&#58; &#34;This device cannot find enough free - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bossanovawitya  say:</h3>
<h2>            device manager reports&#58; &#34;This device cannot find enough free resources that it can use. &#40;Code 12&#41;&#34; after the fitting of an ST Labs PCI-E USB card. </h2>
                    Strange one this. <br />
<br />
the properties for the card (in device manager) also says "If you want to use this device, you will need to disable one of the other devices on this system.". The resources tab does not say what resources the card is trying to access (IRQ, memory address etc).
 Windows 7's troubleshooter in the action centre cannot solve the problem. <br />
<br />
Device manager reports the card as: PCI standard PCI Express to PCI/PCI-X Bridge. Device type: system devices. Manufacturer: (Standard System Devices). Location: PCI Slot 1 (PCI bus 3, device 0, function 0)<br />
<br />
Running Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit. <br />
2gb of DDR2 800 RAM (64 bit, single channel).<br />
AMD Athlon 5600+<br />
FOXCONN K8M890M2MB-RS2H Motherboard. <br />
No BIOS updates available. <br />
I have disabled everything on the motherboard that I can from the BIOS set up (On-board sound and Ethernet).
<br />
No Windows updates available. <br />
Have tried updating the driver - no more up to date drivers available.<br />
<br />
Any ideas gratefully received. <br />

<div>Hi Bossanovawitya,</div>
<div><br />
This error can occur if two devices that are installed on your computer have been assigned the same I/O ports, the same interrupt, or the same Direct Memory Access channel (either by the BIOS, the operating system, or both). This error message can also appear
 if the BIOS did not allocate enough resources to the device.</div>
<div><br />
Recommended resolution</div>
<div><br />
You can use the Troubleshooting Wizard in Device Manager to determine where the conflict is, and then disable the conflicting device.</div>
<div>Disable the conflicting device<br />

            Hello Rehman.<br />
<br />
The general tab of the properties dialogue box for the device <em>does not have</em> a 'Troubleshoot' option. Running the trouble shooter from action centre has not solved the problem either - it simply reports that the device is not working properly.
<br />
<br />
I have checked the standard solutions to this problem. I have also posted it at: <br />

Where some other folks are having similar problems. <br />

Quite peculiar. <br />

Please read this FULL thread and look at the screen grab which I have posted. You will note that your recommendation has already been made. There is no 'troubleshoot' option on the general tab of the device properties dialog box, shown clearly in the screengrab
 I've posted. <br />
<br />
Troubleshooting wizard from the windows actions centre cannot locate the conflicting device either.</p>
<p>If the problem was as easily solved as above, then I would have had to come here looking for help!<br />

Any suggestions of insight greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Ok, in desperation I did a clean install of Windoze 7.<br />
<br />
Still no luck, and still the solution suggested in this thread fails for the same reason.<br />

I guess it's just what we've all come to expect of Microsoft - if you aren't a business customer, your end user experience just doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Hi Bossanova,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>What other devices are installed on your computer? (External HDD, flash drives, PCI cards, etc.)</p>
<p>Is this a computer you put&nbsp;together&nbsp;or is it an OEM, like HP or Dell?</p>
<p>Do any of the other 8 USB ports on the motherboard&nbsp;have an issue?</p>
<p>Are you using a USB port on this machine?</p>
<p>What is the size of your power supply?</p>
<p>You may have mentioned this, but what cards are you running in the other slots on this computer?</p>
<p>I suggest re-enabling the devices in the BIOS you are using and removing the other cards in the slots, if possible, to see if anything changes.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>thanks for your input.</p>
<p>The computer was assembled by myself.<br />
None of the other USB port have any issues.</p>
<p>Many USB ports are in use:<br />
1 for a ethernet adaptor, 1 for keyboard, 1 for mouse, 1 for license key device (syncrosoft Cubase license), one for a USB flashdrive (dedicated to 'ReadyBoost). On occasion other flash drives, an external HDD, a card reader and an xbox controller are plugged
 in via USB.<br />
Powersupply is a 650w Coolermaster Extreme Power</p>
<p>Other devices installed:<br />
Soundbaster Audigy2 ZS Platinum sound card (PCI Slot)<br />
Powercolour Radeon HD4870 Graphics Card (PCI-E x16 Slot)<br />
An external HDD is occasionally used via USB, with it's own powersupply.</p>
<p>3 IDE hard drives and 1 IDE DVD RW drive are also installed.</p>
<p>When reinstalling Windows I did remove the soundcard to see if it would allow the new USB card to work. Sadly it didn't, but I'll try removing that AND the graphics card to make sure.</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions!</p>

<p>Well it seems as Startup Repair cannot fix your Windows 10 Startup, so I would try other options in the Windows Recovery Environment, starting with System Restore . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start your System, then just after the Manufacturers logo disappears and Windows 10 tries to boot, press and hold the power button down for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do this Twice</strong></p>
<p><br />
On the third boot attempt, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment, from there you can access Startup Recovery, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.<br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - System Restore, see if you have a recent restore point you can revert to<br />
<br />
If you do not have a recent restore point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Startup Settings, click restart.<br />
Upon restart press 4 to boot into Safe Mode, if you can get into Safe Mode, backup your data, reboot and see if your system boots normally<br />
<br />
If all this fails go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC, choose to keep all your files and Apps<br />
This will re-install Windows 10 whilst keeping your data and applications<br />

    <title>Splice Desktop App not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex92hp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Splice Desktop App not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to run a desktop app called splice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the app and that the installation seems to work fine, the problem comes when I try and run the app. On opening the app a blank white box pops up and doesn't disappear, the app never opens but the Splice app icon appears in the icon box and
 the app appears to be running but not displaying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spoken to the team at Splice and tried everything that they have suggested with no luck, I think this is more of a Windows 10 problem then a Splice app problem. I have tried the following: Uninstalling and installing the app again, restarting my pc
 several times, turning off my computer security and firewall will trying to run the app, checking for windows updates and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
