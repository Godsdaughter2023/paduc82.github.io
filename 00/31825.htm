<h2>            Official MS refurbisher license is for 32 bit version only &#40;Windows 7 Home Premium&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    Bought a refurbished Dell laptop that said it came with Windows 7 Home Premium (didn't say bit version) and because it actually came with Win XP and needed a repair I asked them to provide me with the 64 bit version when they fixed it. I was told their
 OEM agreement allowed them to only install 32 bit version of W7HP. Is this correct? I feel a little cheated since the laptop is 64bit architecture and can fully use all the memory only with a 64 bit version.

<p>Unfortunately, it is at the discretion of the OEM to provide the architecture they believe is suitable for the system. Some manufacturers will provide an option to purchase the 64 bit disc separately, if not, you will either have to purchase a retail upgrade
 package for Home Premium which will include the 64 bit disc.</p>
<p>Another option is to download the .ISO image for Home Premium, please note, this might be voiding the warranty. You will also have to obtain 64 bit drivers for all the components of the Dell. You should check Dells website to find out if the computer model
 supports Window 7 64 bit, if they don't have Windows 7 64 bit native drivers, you can use Windows Vista 64 bit native drivers.</p>

<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

<p>Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?</p>

<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers</p>

Is the computer licensed for XP or Windows 7? You can only install what you have a valid license for.<br />
<br />
There should be a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker somewhere on your computer, on some laptops it’s in the battery bay. It Will say XP or Windows 7 - that is what you can install. You can also buy a retail license to upgrade if you want.<br />
<br />
OEM only includes one bit type, and the OEM is responsible for providing install media.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks.
 ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.<br />
<br />
If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows 7. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ - check your manual if you're not sure how to. If you have
 install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process. Reinstalling will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee. Contact information for the manufacturer of your computer can be found here:

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) or the actual<br />
OEM WiFi device maker's support, their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and<br />
ask in their forums about any known issues. Many have methods to turn on/off or enable/disable<br />
the Wifi device. And you may need to update or re-install the WiFi drivers.<br />
<br />
There could be a hardware problem with the Wifi and if so the WiFi device can either be removed<br />
if a separate device or disabled in the BIOS and/or Device Manager. Then an add-on WiFI device<br />
can be used which is not expensive.<br />
<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually <br />
using the methods&nbsp;below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System <br />
maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests <br />
one just HIDE it as they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers<br />
manually as needed.</p>

<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Left&nbsp;Side click Manage <br />
Wireless Networks - Right Click the Networks - Remove Networks - <br />
REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect&nbsp;To - to logon on to Network.<br />

            Hi snigdhsharma,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode,
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
<br />
<br />Backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally

<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<h2>            error code 0x80073712 on update KB4480116</h2>
                    This update failed a week or two ago, I've tried several fixes including running the troubleshooter (came up with nothing), and file corruption fix. I'd rather not resort to resetting the pc or doing a clean install, any have any other options?

            Hi nwhitney,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I recommend that you do a manual update for this KB. 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. You can download the updates from Microsoft Catalog and update manually.  
<br />
<br />Microsoft Catalog KB4480116 - <a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4480116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search...</a>
<br />
<br />4. If all fails, I would suggest that you hide it so that it doesn't install automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi nwhitney 
<br />
<br />Try installing that update from the offline installer. Click the link below to download that, on that page, make sure to download the correct version for your system (32bit or 64bit and not for ARM processor)
<br />
<br />When that downloads, disconnect form the Internet, temporarily turn off any 3rd party security software you may have running, then install that update by double clicking the msu file . ..

    <title>How can I file a formal complaint with regards to your customer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I file a formal complaint with regards to your customer service&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">
The free upgrade to Windows 10 bricked my computer. I waited 5 hours for a callback from their technology support who, after about 45 minutes, were unable to fix my problem. They directed me to contact sales in order to purchase a new copy of Windows. The first
 representative was extremely condescending and rude and refused to provide me with a replacement copy of Windows. His manager was equally unhelpful and has insisted on personally contacting tech support a second time. I have been on hold for 30 minutes waiting
 for a response from him.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">
Each and every representative I have spoken to has suggested I purchase a new copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">
I refuse to purchase a new operating system because their update destroyed my old operating system.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">
If anybody has any advice on how to file a formal complaint, I am all ears. I am fuming at the incompetence of each and every one of the 5 (and counting) representatives I have spoken to. Not a single one of them has responded to my simple request for a replacement
 copy of Windows. I have either been waiting for a call back, on hold, or on the phone with customer support for over 8 hours and counting.<br />
<br />
The second tech support person (to whom I was directed by the sales manager) had me follow the exact same procedure as the previous tech support person. When that procedure failed (again), I was put on hold for over an hour - a duration that I am still waiting.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I want to know how to file a formal complaint about the quality of customer service.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
I want to know how Microsoft will make this right. My time is valuable, yet your customer service has taken 8 hours (and counting!) to resolve this issue. I have had an entire day's work wiped out by this terrible customer service and am furious with the lack
 of regard for which this company has treated me.&nbsp;

            <p>Babu/Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar experience to Michael this morning - see <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/formal-complaint-extremely-poor-and-rude-microsoft/d6e4dc2d-27c4-410d-b28d-9855d45fc6d7">

<p>
</p><p>I was initially cautious about upgrading from Win7 to Win 10 - traditionally I have waited 3-6 months after a new version is released before upgrading to allow time for the inevitable bugs to be ironed out. On this occasion, however, I was
 Still cautious, I did some background research by reading tech blogs relating to Win10 - all of which seemed to tout the wonderfulness of Win10 and that it was vastly better then Win8/8.1 (which I was running on another computer). I also thought that - having
 jumped from Win8 direct to Win10 (i.e. no Win9) - that MS must have sorted out most of the bugs. Like Michael, the Win10 upgrade resulted in innumerable bugs - some were minor but some (like the file permissions issue) effectively stopped me working/earning
 an income. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Like Michael, I also waited patiently for a callback (6 hrs in my case). The tech was sympathetic but couldn't/didn't provide any solution other than to offer to send by e-mail all information relating to this issue - which never arrived. Realising that
 the MS Tech Support staff had likely been inundated with support requests from other users affected by these bugs, I've spent
 and suggestions via the Feedback app (which is actually not bad).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago I posted a question on the forum asking for some tech advice. After not receiving any response, I used the 'Contact Support' app. The rest is well explained in my complaint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am looking to escalate this atrocious customer service via the formal complaint mechanism. I know that not all techs behave so badly, however this is a crucial time for MS and MS would do well not to alienate its customer base (which, if you haven't
 quite worked out, MS relies on for its profits .... which I should also point out are dwindling).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not actually expecting any response - from anybody at Microsoft - but I will continue to pursue this with vigour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael: Hope MS were able to win you back. Nice to see others who are willing to take a firm stand against poor conduct.</p>

            Me too Martin! I'm just wondering if atrocious tech support constitutes 'abuse' and I then can have the pleasure of hitting that 'Report Abuse' link?? The context-sensitive help for that link does say "<em>Report inappropriate content</em>" - I reckon
 a complete lack of response from MS is pretty inappropriate!

            <p>On February 15 <span>&nbsp;</span>around 3 p.m. I started chart concerning word documents (restore down button didn’t work). Case # SR # 1374744322.</p>
<p>The first agent named Grace assured that my office 365 was corrupted and I needed to perform online repair. As long as it take time, she interrupted a chart. On my question, “What if it didn’t help?” she answered that it would help and all I had to do is
 to reboot my PC.</p>
<p>I spent hours waiting for downloads but it didn’t solve the problem. </p>
<p>Next representative, Mary tried to persuade that this is not their problem at all. Then, the supervisor, Jeff tried to establish remote control on my PC. When the remote control was established, I saw that Grace!!! (the same first lady that had done a “****”
 service) is in control of my PC. But I hoped for the best and let her do it. She uninstalled office and started installing it again. During installation she just left the session leaving the remote control active!!! When I called 425-635-2970 number, David
 started telling me something incomprehensible. On my question “Will you help me?” I didn’t get the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be short, these people know nothing about computer, disrespect this country and taunt their customers.</p>
<p>This issue with restore down button should not even exist if a company creating office program for computers respect itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is getting impossible and dangerous to get help from microsoft team!</p>

<p>I also have a complaint about a customer service agent named "Grace", who actually sounded automated or like a guy using one of those software programs to sound like a woman.&nbsp; I was hoping Microsoft would send me a survey as to how my customer service experience
 went, but as of now, I've received nothing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After about an hour long update and/or updates to my laptop, I was being kicked off of wifi every 20 or 25 minutes; this is exactly what happened when I had Windows 8.&nbsp; I was pretty annoyed that I was having this problem again, so I contacted customer service
 and "Grace" called within 1 minute.&nbsp; I told her what was going on and she asked if I had a Windows product ????&nbsp; Then, in general was rude and condescending, which made my attitude get worse.&nbsp; She suggested I undo the last update, which I did and it worked,
 however, if Microsoft "forces" another update on me, will I need to do this again?&nbsp; I was originally calling to ask when they would send out an update to fix this issue, because I can't be only person with this problem; she had no answer to that.&nbsp; After I
 located the undo update section, she asked for my name and number - she had called me - and I thought she was verifying, so I said it all quickly.&nbsp; Then, without saying, do you have pen and paper close by, you need to write this number down, she quickly gave
 me a number, and I said hold on, wait a second; while I obviously grabbed a pen and paper.&nbsp; Then, with so much condescension that I'm surprised she didn't trip over her tongue, she read the numbers back very, very slowly.&nbsp; She was a complete beotch and she
 needs to be fired; training does not help ****, stupid or rude.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This was my first contact with a human at Microsoft and saying I'm disappointed and aggravated is an understatement.&nbsp; Microsoft, get your stuff together and send surveys to everyone who has to deal with your customer service/no service humans.&nbsp;

<p>I just spent 2 hours and 54 minutes on a support call for the elongated screen distortion issue that occurred after the 11/22/17 windows update.&nbsp; My "technician" was Nico.&nbsp; After all that time and installing and/or re-updating my system (which by the way
 should not have required updating?!) Nico was frustrated because he could not see what I was saying about the screen distortion.&nbsp; His solution was to end the support session and hang up on me - yes, he hung up the phone and purposefully ended my support session
 without any warning or a word about why.&nbsp; I was not rude, just concerned that the issue was still not resolved!&nbsp; I waited 10 minutes thinking surely he will call back but no. Really Microsoft?&nbsp; Is that all you got? I didn't want to believe what EVERYONE on
 the support community was saying about the lack of resolve on this issue by your support teams but it is true - very sad, but true.&nbsp; Your team is horrible and whoever created the latest update should be fired along with Nico!!</p>
<p>I am not a computer wiz and I need help for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

    <title>Why Win Modules Installer and WMI Worker always activate&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaloyanmarinov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Win Modules Installer and WMI Worker always activate&#63;</h2>
                    Why Win Modules Installer and Windows Modules Installer Worker always activate, in spite that I've set them to Manual in Services?&nbsp;<br />
I didn't disable them at all, because as I read their descriptions, it seems like they are really important. Also I've set&nbsp;Windows Management Instrumentation to manual, because if Disabled, it will make 2 more services not work.<br />
<br />
..so is it safe to disable WMI and WMI Worker?<br />
ps: I have set updates to, "List updates, and let me choose which to download and install" option, could this be related to the problem..?<br />
<br />
Please help, Thank You!

            Hi Tamir, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sorry for the Inconvenience caused with Windows 10.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I appreciate if you could answer the below question to narrow down the issue and to provide you better assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>1.&nbsp;Is this issue specific to one game or all the games?<br />
2.&nbsp;Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
3.&nbsp;Did you install all pending updates on your PC?<br />
4.&nbsp;Did you run the game in compatibility mode and check?</p>
<p>5. Do you get any error code with error message?</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let’s try the below methods and check:</div>
<div><br />
Method 1: You may update the graphics driver and check if it helps, you may refer to the below article on how to update the drivers in Windows 10.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-update-drivers</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If updating the graphics driver did not resolve the issue you may follow method 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2: Let’s boot your computer into clean boot and run the game and check if the problem exists.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note 1: The above link also applies to windows 10.<br />
Note 2: please refer “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” section to start the computer back to normal mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This article describes how to start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." This
 article also provides information that you can use to troubleshoot application or service conflicts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>Method 3: You may also refer to the below article and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Troubleshoot blue screen errors:</p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors</span></a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Reference:</p>
<div>KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE</div>
<div><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj569891(v=vs.85).aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj569891%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would recommend you to check for latest Windows Updates. Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates. If you have any pending updates remaining to install, kindly install them and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance, we will be happy to help you.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank You.</div>

    <title>Problems with the PowerVR SGX OpenGL driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilan silver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with the PowerVR SGX OpenGL driver</h2>
                    I just purchased a Samsung 500T windows 8 tablet with full Windows 8 (not RT) installed on it. &nbsp;I installed this game called "Ticket To Ride" and it is missing some important text on the screen while playing the game. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have contacted the&nbsp;manufacturers&nbsp;of the game and they say it has something to do with the implementation of "PowerVR SGX OpenGL driver". &nbsp;They claim it's a known issue and have advised that I contact Microsoft for a fix. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done all the Windows 8 updates and have installed the Samsung utilities and done all the updates through it. &nbsp;Everything is running great on this machine but this one game. &nbsp;Here are the details of my system:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 8</div>
<div>Tablet</div>
<div>Intel Atom CPU Z2760 1.8ghz 2 cores, 4 logical processors</div>
<div>2gb's ram</div>
<div>64 gigs hard drive with 32 gigs free. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I even tried to format and reinstall windows 8 and the same problem on the game is&nbsp;occurring. &nbsp;The game runs but a lot of the text is invisible or very hard to see. &nbsp;I have been in touch with Samsung themselves and they have also directed me to Microsoft.
 &nbsp;So I'm wondering if you guys have a fix or an update for this issue. &nbsp;I have quoted exactly what it says in the e-mail below:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Unfortunately this is a bug in the windows PowerVR SGX OpenGL implementation that doesn't support alpha/luminance textures that we use to render text (that's the reason the texts are all blueish or absent), even though the driver reports that it supports
 it."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a patch or a fix for this issue?</div>
                </div>

<p>Wiggle the cable end on the console that goes out to your TV. Mine is faulty and I get the same lines from time to time, but giving that cable end a wiggle usually fixes it until someone comes stomping through the living room.

<p>Hi here are something you could try out.</p>
<p>1. Ensure your Xbox and power supply is in a well ventilated placed and on stable surface.</p>
<p>2. Try another HDMI port and if this doesn't work try another TV.</p>
<p>3. Try a friends HDMI.</p>
<p>4. Try adjust your screen settings and follow instructions from this link:<br />
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/adjust-display-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../adjust-display-settings</a></p>
<p>5. If you decide to send your console to repair try a factory reset.</p>

<p>We have been away on holiday and when we returned my husband went to go onto xbox live however it states that we are now banned from using this service.&nbsp; We can not understand why.&nbsp; The console that we have was purchased new and has never had any modifications
 completed on it.&nbsp; We are not very technical and wouldnt have a clue where to start with doing any other mod things that it talks about.&nbsp; Has my account ben hacked into?&nbsp; Is it possible to find out why it was blocked?&nbsp; Is there an appeal process?&nbsp; Is there
 a complaints process?&nbsp; Can I be refunded the money that I have only just paid out for the Gold membership?&nbsp; Who do I need to speak to?&nbsp; I understand that there needs to be rules but thought i lived in a country in which you were innocent until proven guilty
 and I can hand on heart say that we are innocent.&nbsp; I would gladly welcome anyone from Microsoft into my home so that they are able to demonstrate to me how we have violated any rules.&nbsp;</p>

However if your console is banned then I'm afraid there is nothing anyone can do. Microsoft don't discuss console bans, so when one happens it is permanent.

<p>I am going thru the same thing!!! I have phoned and spoken to XBOX support and they keep telling me my son must have breached the code or tampered with the box!! He would have no idea how to and he is not the one swearing and being rude on it.I have spoken
 to the manager of xbox support and they keep saying no appeals and the console is banned for Life. I asked for a refund of gold membership and they have said to bad..I have told them is must be illegal and I have asked them to esculate it as I believe the
 account has been hacked but no-one will give me any numbers of emails for the so called enforcement team. We are taking it the media next step.</p>

<p>Microsoft can tell on what console a tag has been used. So if the profile had been 'hacked' and used on another 360, Microsoft would have known that and not taken again against your console.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your responses. &nbsp;I am finding this whole thing very distressful. &nbsp;Very much like your case sr wogboy10, my son is 10 and although he is no angel he would never be abusive to anyone. &nbsp;I think if he was that we should at least be advised
 before hand. &nbsp;To be honest i couldnt afford to pay for this live thing in the first place so this is a real kick in the teeth. &nbsp;It is so difficult contacting anyone to discuss it with and feel that we are being punished for a crime we have not commited. &nbsp;I
 am sure that I must have some sort of rights. &nbsp;It has been suggested that as there is a football team in his tag that maybe he has been targeted as a result of this. Surely the people at Microsoft have some sort of safeguard re this. &nbsp;Let me know how you gt
 on with the media. &nbsp;I have emailed as many people who i can think of foradvise. &nbsp;My bosses husband is a solictor so i am going to seek some advise off him. &nbsp;Good luck

<p>I doubt this is because of his choice of football team.<br />
<br />
One complaint or one thousand, if you've done nothing wrong then you have nothing to fear. The process is not automated, Microsoft only suspend or ban after an investigation by a member of the Enforcement team.<br />
<br />
<span>As mentioned elsewhere, the only people who can answer your query are the Enforcement team and they don't answer questions about console bans. So everyone is at an impasse at the moment.</span>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are unable to install updates for Security Essentials and get error
<span>0x8024002.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To work with the issue, I would suggest you to follow the steps suggested:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run the update troubleshooter</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: Disable antivirus</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Refer the site:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Disable antivirus software</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important Note:</b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you
 shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer
 is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists or if you face any Windows issues in future, let us know and we would be glad to assist you.</span></p>

</a></p>
<p>Check if your computer reads other CD's other than the Polaroid. Simultaneously, check if your Polaroid software CD functions in another computer.</p>
<p>If your Cd does not work on a different computer and subsequently, if other CD's work fine on your computer, The I conclude that CD is faulty. Get it replaced.</p>

            Are you connected to AC power or are you running on battery power? If your battery life is not critically low or there no specific issues with your battery life, you are not gonna see any. My own says the same thing.

<h2>            Snowball mic does not function with Windows 10</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 and wanted to use Cortana. I obtained a new usb mic, installed it according to guidelines, made sure my settings were correct, and Cortana could not hear it.&nbsp; I returned the mic and bought a Snowball at Best Buy's recommendation.&nbsp;
 Same thing....no functionality at all.&nbsp; I have made sure all the settings are correct (desktop mic, volume settings, etc.).&nbsp; Any help here?

    <title>Connect Windows 10 PC to Smart TV - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Connect Windows 10 PC to Smart TV</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Multimedia files can be projected/played on a Smart TV from a Windows 10 PC by the following methods:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>1. CAST (Media Streaming):</strong> Media is streamed in compressed file format from a source device to the media player on a receiver device which decompresses the file stream to play the media in real time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>2. PROJECT&nbsp;(Screen Mirroring):</strong> The&nbsp;image displayed on the screen of a device is replicated on the display screen of another device in real time. In essence, the video-out port of the sender device is connected
 to the video-in port of the receiver device. The bandwidth required for Screen Project is much higher than Cast, because the&nbsp;pixel data stream between the source and receiver is raw video in&nbsp;decompressed format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>3. DLNA (Media Sharing):</strong> A Media File&nbsp;is streamed from a media storage Server on request from a media player Client which decompresses&nbsp;the file stream to play the media&nbsp;in real time. Cast is a variation of DLNA
 where the sender (server) initiates media streaming to a ready-to-connect receiver (client) listening on a common Wired / Wireless network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">1. CAST:</span>&nbsp;</strong>Cast is the easiest method to play a multimedia from a PC on to a Smart TV called Smart as they have an Operating System. However file formats supported for casting are
 limited to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV for video and MP3, WMA, WAV for audio. The audio system of the TV can either be built-in or externally connected to a Hi-fi system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The Cast setup requires that (i) the PC and the Smart TV are connected to the same Home WiFi network (ii) Network discovery And File sharing are enabled on your currently active&nbsp;network profile (Private / Public) through Control
 Panel &gt; Networking and Sharing Centre &gt; Change advanced sharing settings (on left panel).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Just as networking needs to be configured on the PC, similarly networking has to be configured on the Smart TV through the Settings menu, to either establish a peer-to-peer&nbsp;direct communication path Or inter-connect by hooking
 up to a common access point. As with any operating system, a network once created on a Smart TV, persists as the default network until a new network is created.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">To play a video, Open File Explorer on the PC, right click on the video file and from the shortcut menu choose Cast to Device &gt; Smart TV (name). It may take some time for the PC to search for the TV on the network before displaying
 its name on the shortcut menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Select the TV name on the shortcut menu and the media will automatically start playing on the TV, with the Cast Window for media control appearing on the PC. You can use the PC for other work by minimising the Cast Window while
 the media continue to play on the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Once a TV is successfully linked to a PC, the TV-name gets registered in the Devices list under Windows Settings and the TV-name will be readily available&nbsp;thereafter in the Cast to Device menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">On Windows 10, Casting is the simplest and most reliable choice for playing multimedia files from PC to any TV.<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">2. PROJECT:</span>&nbsp;
</strong>Project or Screen Mirroring allows a Windows 10 PC to project its Screen to a Smart TV by using the Miracast technology. Unlike Cast, Screen Mirroring allows any type of file that displays on the PC screen to be projected on to the TV, be it a text
 document or a movie played from the DVD drive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Miracast is a standard introduced in 2012 by "Wi-Fi Alliance" – a non-profit organisation, for wireless screen mirroring of devices with an operating system like PC and Mobile, on to Displays such as TV, LED panels and Screen Projectors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Microsoft is one of the main promoters of Miracast in their Windows OS, while Google dropped Miracast support in their Android OS starting Android 6 Marshmallow, in favour of Google's own proprietary Chromecast technology. Miracast
 in android devices is now possible through miracast apps in Google Play Store. Some mobile device manufacturers with customised android provide Miracast built into their OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">At the core of Miracast standard is the WiFi Direct technology originally developed by Intel but subsequently discontinued, on adoption by the Miracast organisation. Much like bluetooth, WiFi Direct devices&nbsp;creates its own&nbsp;hotspot
 to&nbsp;network with other WiFi enabled devices without the need of a Wireless Access Point. WiFi Direct must be built into the hardware of one of the communicating devices. In contrast, Chromecast works on a WiFi network hosted by the Router.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Miracast serves to establish a peer-to-peer WiFi Direct connection between a OS device and a Display device, and allows streaming of up to 1080p HD video and 5.1 surround sound.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The objective of Miracast is to separate the streaming network from the Home WiFi network used to access the internet. A PC on a home network use the WiFi direct path to stream data to a TV receiver, without having to consume the
 bandwidth of the home network used by other devices for inter-communication and accessing the internet. The PC can simultaneously stream data and access internet, but that could strain the WiFi port on the PC unless it has two separate WiFi ports – one configured
 for Miracast and the other for internet access.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Windows 10 implementation of Miracast requires that (i) the&nbsp;PC take ownership of the media streaming part of Miracast to effect pixel data&nbsp;streaming of the PC&nbsp;screen, and (ii)&nbsp;the Display Device (TV) take ownership of the WiFi
 Direct networking part of Miracast to establish a direct&nbsp;communication path with the PC, by incorporating the WiFi-Direct hardware technology which we shall henceforth refer to as a Miracast adapter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In Windows 10, the Miracast feature is part of Windows installation depending upon the capability of the hardware. In other words, it is upto the PC manufacturer to provide the necessary hardware to ensure that the media streaming
 part of Miracast is in place. The hardware elements that engines the Miracast feature in a PC are the Processor, Graphics driver and the WiFi adapter driver which should correspond to the Windows 10 Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) version number.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Miracast is natively available on a TV when the Miracast adapter is integrated into the TV electronics. Even if a TV has Miracast built-in, it might not support the Windows 10 Wireless display protocol. Miracast can also go entirely
 missing on an android TV.<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Whatever may be the case,&nbsp;a TV can be made to support Windows&nbsp;Wireless Display&nbsp;by attaching a Miracast dongle, which among others is also offered by Microsoft specifically for Windows PC projection. The dongle called Microsoft
 Wireless Display Adapter has to be connected to the HDMI port of the TV with the USB end of the adapter connected to an USB port - preferably the one on the TV set, to draw power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">To project a PC screen to a TV, the following steps are necessary:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">(i) Enable WiFi on the PC and the TV. They can be on the same / different network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">(ii)&nbsp;First determine if the PC is Miracast compliant. Press Windows Key + P on the PC keyboard to open the Project action bar (Charms Menu) which must contain the link "Connect to a wireless display" at the bottom. Miracast is
 not available on the PC if the link is not seen on the action bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><br />
(iii)&nbsp;Ensure that the TV has a built-in Miracast adapter Or a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter is attached to the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><br />
(iv)&nbsp;Mirroring is enabled on the Smart TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><br />
(v)&nbsp;Set the Signal source for the TV with a built-in Miracast adapter to the Mirroring port; Or set the signal source to the HDMI port where the Microsoft Wireless Display adapter is attached.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><br />
(vi)&nbsp;Press Windows Key + P on the PC keyboard to invoke the Project action bar / Charms menu and select the "Connect to a wireless display" link at the bottom. The action bar will now broadcast the Microsoft adapter name Or the TV-name if&nbsp;it has a built-in
 Miracast&nbsp;adapter Or both including all nearby devices which are ready to connect via Miracast. Select the one applicable to start mirroring the PC screen on to the TV. If the TV-name or the Microsoft adapter name is not found on the Project action bar, ensure
 that you add the TV-name / adapter within Devices of Windows Settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">If Miracast is not available / not possible&nbsp;on a PC, then the fail-safe alternative is to go for the legacy wired connection by a HDMI cable between the HDMI port of PC and the HDMI port of TV, provided the TV and the PC are in
 close proximity. Set the Signal source for the TV to the HDMI port where the cable is attached. Press Windows Key + P on the PC keyboard to invoke the Project action bar / Charms menu and choose the Duplicate option to simultaneously display the PC screen
 on to the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Since Miracast evolved as an WiFi extension&nbsp;to HDMI, it is sometimes referred by&nbsp;the mnemonic "HDMI over WiFi".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">A TV with Miracast will contain a Setting within the Networks section, which will show the SSID and Password of the WiFi Direct Access point. This access point on being enabled will show up as a hotspot on the "WiFi available networks
 list" of a PC. A PC can use the WiFi Direct hotspot for Cast and DLNA without the need of a Home network. However, Miracast will not be possible when using the WiFi Direct hotspot as a WiFi access point.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Caution !</strong> A Smart TV can broadcast two names: The system defined Miracast SSID for Screen Project and the user defined name when using the Home network for Cast and DLNA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">3. DLNA:</span>
</strong>DLNA (Digital Living Networking Alliance) is the older standard for interoperability of digital multimedia devices. All participating devices must be DLNA certified to establish a network connection. Windows 10 is DLNA certified and you have to ensure
 that DLNA is available on the Smart TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The DLNA network&nbsp;between a PC (Digital Media Server) and a Smart TV (Digital Media Receiver) can be set up through a wired Ethernet connection or a wireless WiFi connection. The DLNA framework for communication&nbsp;is constituted by
 the&nbsp;Windows 10 Library Folders of the user which is configured by design to be the Digital Media Server (DMS) for sourcing and streaming the media files to a receiver TV via a wired or wireless network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The TV performs the Digital Media Receiver (DMR) client&nbsp;functions by acting&nbsp;as a Digital Media Controller (DMC) for being able to access the media files on the DMS (PC) and instruct the PC to stream the media file, AND as a Digital
 Media Player (DMP) having a decoder unit capable of&nbsp;decompressing the streamed&nbsp;media for playing, AND also as a Digital Media Renderer to display the&nbsp;decoded&nbsp;stream on its screen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">DLNA services has to be explicitly enabled on a Windows 10 PC by opening the Control Panel &gt; Networking and Sharing Centre &gt; Media streaming options (on the left panel) &gt; Turn on media streaming (button).<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6514f344-8447-48e8-89ff-29fc81b01e9c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6514f344-8447-48e8-89ff-29fc81b01e9c?upload=true" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the media steaming options window (screenshot above), enter a name for the user's library folders on the PC and allow access to the TV-name appearing under the devices list on the Local network.<br />
<br />
If the TV-name does not appear, first ensure that both the TV and PC are connected to the same local network. Then use the Cast to Device menu on any MP4 file to register the TV-name within the Devices list of Windows Settings and also to show up on the Media
 streaming options window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Once enabled, DLNA services will automatically start everytime the PC is powered ON. To disable DLNA you need to open the Services applet by calling Run dialog (WinKey+R) and then entering services.msc in the dialog &gt; scroll down
 on the Services applet and double click on "Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service" to open its Properties window &gt; Stop the Service by clicking on the Stop button &gt; change the Startup type to "Manual" from the drop-down &gt; click OK and close the Services
 applet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The DLNA&nbsp;network can be implemented in one of the following ways:<br />
(i)&nbsp;<strong>Wired: </strong>A direct connection by an Ethernet Cross-Cable between the LAN (RJ-45) port of PC and the LAN (RJ-45) port of TV.
<br />
(ii)&nbsp;<strong>Wired:</strong> The PC and the TV connects to a Router / Switch by a normal Ethernet cable.<br />
(iii)&nbsp;<strong>Wireless:</strong> The PC and the TV connects to a Router through WiFi.<br />
(iv)<strong> Wireless: </strong>The PC connects to the WiFi Direct Hotspot of the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The direct Ethernet cross-cable connection is the most reliable and simplest method. The WiFi connection although simple can cause stuttering and&nbsp;latency issues during HD video streaming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Once the PC and TV establish a network path for mutual communication, the TV will automatically identify the PC as a DLNA server. If everything goes right, the PC-name will appear on the Device / Port / Server list of the TV, generally
 accessible from its Home Screen.<br />
<br />
Finally, the PC has to be chosen as the signal source for the TV from the input port list Or the connected device / server&nbsp;list of the TV. The Windows 10 Library folders will display on the TV screen from which a media file can be selected for playing on the
 TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The Digital Media Player (DMP) module within the TV must provide native support to the media file format for playing on the TV, and this DMP which is built specific to every TV model defines all the&nbsp;types of media it can support.
 The easiest way to ascertain the capability of DMP within a TV, is to experiment playing different&nbsp;multimedia file types from a Pen Drive directly attached to an USB port of&nbsp;the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">DLNA scores over CAST when it comes to browsing and choosing to play files from the Media Library on the PC, right from your TV seat with the aid of TV Remote acting as a DMC -&nbsp;without having to move around and reach the PC to
 initiate media streaming individually for each file.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Windows Media Player (WMP) which was the original DLNA Server for Media Library and Media Streaming, now supports Cast. Right click on any media file on the WMP Library and you get the Cast to device function in the shortcut menu.
 WMP has a Playlist feature but the streaming controls remain in the Player itself - not accessible from a TV. Films and TV app is the new age media player in Windows 10 and is the one in the advancement path, although WMP remains a&nbsp;more popular and preferred&nbsp;DLNA
 networking device.<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">On the reverse direction, when the TV is enabled as a DLNA Server through the TV Network settings, it allows media files&nbsp;in storage devices attached to the TV to be accessible from the WMP of a networked PC.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><br />

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My Sharp Smart tv used to see my pc as a n media server, it now doesn't. If I sect Media server on the tv it says media server "not found".</p>
<p>I have checked that media streaming is turn on and it is.</p>
<p>If I cast photos to the tv they are displayed will a banner at the bottom showing "pause" etc. however casting only shows photos in landscape mode, if the photo was taken in portrait mode the tv displays it side ways.</p>
<p>I'm running Win10 Home Build 1809, 64 bit.</p>
<p>After the 1803 upgrade, I managed to get everything working again, but now it's worse than ever.</p>
<p>Do I now need to install a Media Server&nbsp; program to do the job the pc once did?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Colin</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">From what you say, I believe that your PC is able to communicate with TV but not the other way round.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">This could be because of the WiFi driver of your WiFi adapter in PC (Internal/USB) is not DLNA compliant.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Microsoft is updating the NDIS driver version with every new version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Check the following link to see the latest version of NDIS applicable for Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Driver_Interface_Specification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Driver_Interface_Specification</a></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The NDIS version of you WiFi adapter should be at-least version 6.7 for DLNA operation. Anything less will not work. Even then, video streaming from PC is likely to stutter.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">You can check the NDIS version of your WiFi adapter by typing
<strong>Get-NetAdapter | Select Name, NdisVersion</strong> at the Windows Power Shell prompt of your PC. Simply copy the command from here and right click at the Power Shell prompt to enter the command.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Try updating the WiFi driver of your adapter to NDIS version 6.7 or above, if available from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">You are out of luck if this adapter is out of support. Try experimenting with a new USB WiFi adapter and see if it works before you decide to buy one.</p>
<p>

<p>Sushovan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Home Network consists of a BT Broadband Hub to give internet access.</p>
<p>The hub is connected to a switch which connects to my Desktop Pc running Win 10 Home Build 1809.</p>
<p>The desktop holds all my media files, Videos, Music&nbsp; &amp; photos.</p>
<p>Also connected to the switch are my Sharp Smart TV, BT Youview Box, Freesat Satellite box.</p>
<p>Before the October Update, I could select Media Server on my Tv and it would show the desktop and I could stream all my media files.</p>
<p>Now it just shows "No server found".</p>
<p>I have made sure that media streaming is turned on, but still no joy.</p>
<p>Are we now saying that my network adapter is not DLNA compliant?</p>
<p>I have tried installing Universal Media Server software, but that is very hit and miss when it comes to starting up.</p>
<p>When it does start the tv sees it and can play media files.</p>
<p>Am I missing something in my PC setup, to allow the PC to act as a media server?</p>

<p>My pc doesn't have a WiFi adapter as I use an ethernet cable to connect to my home network.</p>
<p>The tv is also cable connected, I have tried Emby as a server the tv connects, but all my jpeg's are seen as "Unsupported File".</p>
<p>It seems to me every time there's an update I lose functionality, first there was Homegroup and now Media Server, what next?</p>

            I was using Screen Mirroring with Windows 10 PC to project to a Sharp Roku TV apparently using Miracast. It worked fine until a Windows 10 update auto installed (I'm at windows 10 version 1803 (kB4462933)); In my efforts to resolve this all drivers have
 been undated. While the smart TV name displays, after a minute i get "couldn't&nbsp; connect". &nbsp; Is this an open issues?

<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Personalization - Taskbar
<br />
<br />From there you can put Command Prompt back on the Win + X menu . . .

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Control panel in Windows 10 is less important than Settings.
<br />
<br />But you can add Control panel to start menu if you find it useful.

 keeps happening. It occurs if I flick fast and then click. So I sometimes see a tab when I am the middle of a game and that’s annoying. It looks like I clicked on something in a taskbar. I usually have two monitors but if I turn off one of it this problem
 is still here.</span>

            Hello Andy, my name is Alexander. I'm an Independent Advisor and I'm happy to assist you!
<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of RAM on your PC, it will be able to handle heavy programs like high-end games. So, the multitasking depends on the amount of memory.
<br />
<br />
Please, try playing the game without doing other tasks because multitasking interferes with the performance of the video card. It might generate the issues with screen viewing such as switching a game screen between your desktop environment.
<br />
<br />
Start your game again and not pressing alt-tab when you are playing that will allow the video card to work for graphics performance during a game only.
<br />
<br />
Best regards, <br />
Alexander B. <br />

    <title>Why do people moan at campers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tymondo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do people moan at campers&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>First of all, I camp sometimes, or rush, to me it depends on the game type I am playing because I really dont care about KD, its all about playing the objective.</p>
<p>I find that if I am camping, the people that moan tend to be those who are running around going to kills instead of capturing the bases or planting the bomb (I never play TDM or Slayer). So what gives them the right to moan at me when they are the ones not
 actually playing the game how it is meant to play? Please, can someone give me some insight to this.</p>
<p>Remember, I do not only camp, I also rush when needs be, it really does depend on both the game type, and how my other team mates are playing.</p>

<p>Here is this thing. Like Skill said, camping is only acceptable if you are playing TDM and have a good spot that overlooked a pathway or area that the enemy would frequently comes through. The other acceptable time for camping is if you are guarding an objective
 like Rush in Battlefield 3, or Domination in MW3. But if you are playing an objective game where you should be helping your team out trying to capture and defend objectives and you are just camping off somewhere to get kills for yourself, then that is unacceptable.

    <title>Windows Media Player-how to remove visualizations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> musitronix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player-how to remove visualizations</h2>
                    Visualizations<br />
How do I remove Visualizations from Media Player? I tried deleting the Visualizations folder, but no dice. The Options window shows both Visualization and a delete button, but the button is greyed out. It used to be possible to select "No Visualization", but
 this does not seem to be the case any longer. <br />
<br />
This is driving me nuts. Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
