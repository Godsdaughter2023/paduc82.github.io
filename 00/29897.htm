<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Quick questions, where are you getting your video’s from and how are you getting them on Movie Maker?<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You can import files with the following file name extensions into Windows Movie Maker to use in your project:</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong>Video files:</strong> .asf, .avi, .dvr-ms, .m1v, .mp2, .mp2v, .mpe, .mpeg, .mpg, .mpv2, .wm, and .wmv</span></p>

<p><span><span>You can also import files into Windows Movie Maker that have a different extension from the ones listed above, but not all file types will work
 when you try to use them to make a movie.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Microsoft Recorded TV Show files (with a .dvr-ms file name extension) that are not protected using digital rights management can be imported

<h2>            Printer stopped working with Windows 10</h2>
                    All of a sudden my printer has stopped working with ndows 10.&nbsp; I have run all available diagnostics with the manufacturer (HP) and there's nothing wrong with it.&nbsp; Following advice from other threads and online I have tried removing it which didn't work,
 it remains greyed out.&nbsp; Otherwise, settings just tell me that the driver is unavailable.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I can't uninstall and reinstall it.&nbsp;I have also tried removing the printer software and restarting yet still the removal fails.&nbsp; I'm (obviously) no PC expert but this
 is very frustrating.&nbsp; Can anyone help please?

<p>Hi Michael, </p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, <span>since your operating system is unstable, we recommend that you perform an in-place upgrade using an ISO file to repair any broken system file while keeping your personal files, settings and installed applications. To do this, follow the
 steps provided by Andre Da Costa in this </span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">article</span></strong></a><strong><span>.
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, performing an in-place upgrade would be your best approach to resolve your concern and it will make your system work on its full functionality again.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">TennesseePaul</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disconnect any external devices connected and reboot the computer and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also perform a factory reset from the Dell recovery console which will install back&nbsp;Windows 8. You will need to install Windows 8.1 again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things to keep in mind while trying to install Windows 8.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to check whether any Windows updates are pending in the Windows update history.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Press Windows key + W and type “view update history”.<br />
2. Check any updates are pending or failed in the computer.<br />
3. If any updates filed, I suggest you to right click on that and try to install them once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can refer to the article for more information.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you done with installing all the pending updates, I suggest you to install Windows 8.1 preview once again and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Temporarily disable Security Software:</span></b></p>

 disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">M</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ethod 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to place the computer in clean boot and check for any software conflicts. You can perform the following troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</span></p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4022716 black screen with flickering cursor after unlocking</h2>
                    <p>Hi, after installing the latest update (KB4022716) on my Surface Pro 4 (Windows 10, 1703), I lose the screen display after locking. When I unlock, the wallpaper flashes and then disappears and the mouse pointer flickers in front of a black screen. I can
 type my password and log back in, but again the screen displays very briefly and then disappears. I can use Windows P&nbsp; and a double tap on the up arrow to change from extended to PC screen only and that clears it, but it happens every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling the update clears the issue but Windows 10 reinstalls it again. I'm looking at the delay feature for updates to stop it coming back for the interim, but can't work out why this is happening. Has anyone else had this issue and been able to fix
 it properly?</p>

=======================================<br />
If you simply burning files to a Data Disk...most CD Players<br />
will not recognize the CD.<br />
<br />
In order for the Music CD to be read in most CD Players...<br />
the rendered format must be .cda. Windows Media Player<br />
can do this if you use the correct options.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you recently upgraded the operating system? if&nbsp;yes, which previous operating system were you using?
</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the computer? Do you have external speakers connected?
</p>
<p>3. Have you check the status of device manager in Windows 8? Do you see any yellow exclamation mark over devices?
</p>
<p>4. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have external speakers, you may check if you have connected the hardware properly and make sure it is working.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also check if you have any updates available through Windows updates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the audio troubleshooter and check for the issue. If the issue still persists, you may download and install the driver from Manufacturer website.

            Hi Naeem
<br />
<br />If this was a one off, this is nothing to worry about, that may have been an update causing that
<br />
<br />If you ever see a cmd window opening on a regular basis, that would need looking int, while not a sign of malware, it would be a sign of a problem in Windows or Office
<br />
<br />Malware would rarely produce a cmd window like that, because that would alert you to its presence . .

            Hi, NaeemNismo,
<br />cmd itself is save built-in program. But it may be used by any other program including malware. 
<br />Did you install something at that moment? Some installers may run cmd for their own needs.

    <title>Mouse cursor visibility during TeamViewer remote session - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lowaltidude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse cursor visibility during TeamViewer remote session</h2>
                    <p>My parents will be moving to an assisted living facility in another state and I'd like to send my Win 8.1 tablet with them so we can video chat and I can share photos, etc. They no longer have the mental acuity to use a computer for anything but the simplest
 of things without my help so I'm working on a solution which allows me to run the tablet remotely for them. I have
<strong>TeamViewer</strong> working quite well for that purpose but there's one little snag which I can't seem to overcome:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse cursor on my computer doesn't show up on the tablet <strong>unless there's a mouse connected to it too</strong> - but no mouse - no cursor. My ability to point with the cursor will be instrumental in reminding them how to do the simple things themselves,
 but I'd really rather leave the mouse factor out of the equation if at all possible. Their ability to use a mouse is essentially gone and the only reason they're even willing to try to use a computer anymore is touch screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So here's the question:</strong>&nbsp;Is it possible to fool a Win 8.1 tablet into thinking a mouse is connected without actually connecting one? That, or is there another way to make the cursor on my desktop (controlling computer) show up on the tablet
 (controlled computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop: Win 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>Tablet: Win 8.1</p>
<p>Software: TeamViewer 9 with the full version installed on both devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            <p>That option will let me see the tablet's cursor if a mouse is connected, but that option (or even that toolbar) doesn't appear to be available on the tablet as long as I'm connected to it from my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll add that I have TeamViewer set up as a system service on the tablet so I can connect any time that it's turned on. That basically means I'm working in a remote desktop mode when I'm connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I just tried a "Switch sides with partner" and then checked "Show remote cursor" on the tablet. Then the desktop's cursor appeared on the tablet but when I switched back to desktop control the cursor disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could be wrong, but I think the path of least resistance is to fool the tablet into thinking that a mouse is connected. Not sure that's possible, though.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I found your question while trying to solve the same problem, but using a different remote desktop software to connect to my home theater PC running Windows 10. My HTPC is in the entertainment center keyboard or mouse attached because the USB ports are under
 a panel on the front, and I can't close the cabinet door with that panel open. So like you, having a mouse attached is not feasible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I wasn't able to find any settings or software to show the cursor all the time or trick Windows into thinking a mouse was connected, I bought a used Logitech Unifying Receiver for ten bucks online. It's a tiny little dongle that sits flush enough that
 the panel can close. It may be small enough to be unobtrusive on your parents' tablet.</p>

            <p>Thank you for this! Our scenario was not involving a tablet--desktop to laptop--but the viewing person on the other side could not see the mouse pointer of the controlling laptop. We thought maybe it had something to do with his dual desktop setup or perhaps
 the use of a wireless mouse on the laptop, but it wasn't either of those. This "Show remote cursor" option was unchecked and once he selected it, it could instantly see the controllers pointer. Why would this option be unchecked by default??? Certainly makes
 instruction difficult...</p>

<p>The trailing cursor is on EVERY Team Viewer connection regardless of the type of computer on the other end, making it necessary to uncheck the option each time, or be annoyed by the shadowing ;)</p>

            <p>They can, the long string name folders are leftovers from Windows Update which does have the habit of leaving them behind at times.</p>

    <title>BSOD then NTLDR is missing, but system will boot after power - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSOD then NTLDR is missing, but system will boot after power off&#47;on</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I randomly have an issue with my laptop: over the last 3 months I had 3 times a BSOD and then a screen telling me that NTLDR is missing. However if I maintain the power button for a few second and that I power it on again, the laptop will start again. Sadly,
 it has always been too short for me to this the error code, and I can't seem to find it anywhere:&nbsp;I checked but no dump file is created despite the options being correctly set up in the system (I guess it's due to the power off/on after the BSOD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a new SSD as the system disk ~3 months ago and keep the older disk as a secondary disk, which leads me to believe that the SSD may be the culprit, but the SSD seems to be fine (it's a Crucial MX100).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could I do to solve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could be caused due to change in hardware device or corrupt system files.</p>
<p>To assist you better, please provide us the following information:</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the Computer?</p>
<p>2. Have tried to use the old Hard disk as primary disk? </p>
<p>If not. Please check with old hard disk as primary disk.</p>
<p>Try to send the screen shoots of events manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Causes of NTLDR Errors:</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of possible causes for NTLDR errors, including the most common "NTLDR is missing" error message.</p>
<p>The most common reason for this error is when your PC is trying to boot from a hard drive or flash drive that is not properly configured to be booted from; in other words, it's trying to boot from a non-bootable source. This also would apply to media on
 an optical drive or floppy drive that you're trying to boot from.</p>
<p>Other possible causes include corrupt and misconfigured files, hard drive and operating system upgrade issues, corrupt hard drive sectors, an outdated BIOS, and damaged or loose IDE cables.</p>
<p>Refer to the methods to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to perform the system maintenance troubleshooter. It will resolve the common system problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + W Key</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without the quotes and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting.</strong></p>
<p>3. Then click on <strong>System and Security</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click on<strong> System Maintenance</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, refer to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: How to Fix NTLDR Errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Restart your computer. The NTLDR error could be a fluke. </p>
<p>2. Check your floppy and optical (CD/DVD/BD) drives for media and disconnect any external drives. Often times, the "NTLDR is Missing" error will appear if your PC is trying to boot to a non-bootable floppy disk, CD/DVD/BD, or external hard drive or flash
 drive.</p>
<p>Note: If you find that this is the cause of your problem and it's happening a lot, you might want to consider changing the boot order in BIOS so the hard drive with Windows installed is listed first.</p>
<p>3. Check the hard drive and other drive settings in BIOS and ensure they are correct. The BIOS configuration tells the computer how to use a drive so incorrect settings can cause problems, including NTLDR errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: There is usually an Auto setting for hard drive and optical drive configurations in BIOS which is usually a safe bet if you're not sure what to do.</p>
<p><strong>BIOS Disclaimer:</strong></p>
<p>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for your answer but none of the solution provided are working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be that after the blue screen error, my SSD drive is not recognized any more, and my laptop tries to boot on my secondary hard drive which doesn't have windows installed on it, thus the NTLDR is not installed error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to get the dumpfile for the bluescreen but it is not created, since when the laptop crashes, I have this NTLDR error and even pressing ctrl + alt + del is not working? I have to push the power button for a few second to restart the computer, this
 windows doesn't start just after the blues screen and the dump file is not created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition the blue screen only remains for less than a second and I don't have time to see the error message. Is there a way to disable automatic reboot after a bluescreen (so that I at least have time to see the error code)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my SSD with the program provided by Crucial and it shows no problem on my disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options to see the error code for the blue screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply with the current status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As we you have tried most of the troubleshooting methods. Then I suggest you to perform the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to boot into clean boot state and troubleshoot with the issue. Check if the issue occurs. Refer to the below Microsoft Help Article to perform clean boot.</p>
<p><strong>Clean Boot Disclaimer</strong>: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network,
 network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>If the issue still persist, refer to the below method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: I would suggest you to perform Automatic Repair.</p>
<p>If you doesn't have an installation media, then I suggest you to refer to the below Microsoft Help Article to create an installation media.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to perform <strong>Automatic Repair</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer.</p>
<p>2. If you see a message asking you to “<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>,” do so.</p>
<p>3. When you see the Install Windows page, tap or click on <strong>Repair your computer
</strong>to start the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment.</strong></p>
<p>4. In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, tap or click on
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Then Click on <strong>Automatic Repair</strong>.</p>
<p>If the issue still persist, refer to the below method.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: I would suggest you to try to perform <strong>System Restore</strong>.</p>
<p>If you think an app or driver that you recently installed caused problems with your PC, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed
 apps and drivers.</p>
<p>Refer to the below steps to perform system restore.</p>
<p>1. Start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer.</p>
<p>2. If you see a message asking you to “<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>,” do so.</p>
<p>3. When you see the Install Windows page, tap or click on <strong>Repair your computer</strong> to start the
<strong>Windows Recovery Environment.</strong></p>
<p>4. In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, tap or click on
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Then Click on <strong>System Restore</strong>.</p>
<p>If the issue still persist, refer to the below method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer for system restore</strong>: Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while
 system restoring. </p>
<p>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss
 of important files as well.</p>

<h2>            Gmail and Yahoo Mail repeatedly reload on Edge &#40;and IE11 in protected mode&#41;</h2>
                    I just updated my work laptop to Windows 10 and I cannot go to the Gmail or yahoo mail sites on Edge without&nbsp;it reloading the sites several times a second.&nbsp; It allows me to login to the sites the first time, but as soon as it tries to take me to the page
 with my emails, it starts reloading and&nbsp;jumping from a blank page to the login page to the email page, and cycling over and over several times a second.&nbsp; Gmail actually stops after a few cycles and gives an "invalid request" error, but yahoo just keeps cycling.&nbsp;
 This also happens on Internet Explorer 11, but stopped when I disabled protected mode. I have a nearly identical laptop&nbsp;for my personal laptop, and this does not happen on it...only on my work laptop. Please help...

try to state your audio chipset, or the complete model name of your motherboard.

<p>Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord
 from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; While the console is off unplug the router and let it say unplugged for 2 to 3 minutes.&nbsp; Then plug everything back in and after everything is ready see if it is working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Try and see if you can hotspot with your phone. To see if there is an issue with the router or console. If anything, the MAC address might be a problem where the device can't get the right IP address. You can try and clear that under settings in the console.</p>

<p>Well it seems the problem is around the wireless and IPv4 v IPv6 . I can see the xbox listed on the router but trying to connected as Ipv4. as far as the router appears to be concerned its there but the xbox give the cannot get IP address though it shows
 an ip address on the network screen - the same ip address as the router shows. But xbox insists cannot get ip address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got an ethernet cable an connected the xbox to one of the wireless extenders - turned everything off and on again and xbox ( which now thinks its on a wired connection) has connected as IPv6 and all is well apart from the ethernet cable snaking across
 the floor. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove the cable and the xbox goes back to trying to connect as IPv4 and error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea why as as far as I can tell nothing has changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can only hope that some future update on either side will help... but my gut feeling is that the issue is with the xbox as nothing else has a problem.</p>

<p>It seems that when the xbox decides for some reason connect via ipv4 it cant access the live service. It is on the network and actually has an ip address but cannot function.</p>
<p>unfortunatly once it has done this you can only enter an ipv4 ip. This is on wired and wireless. Only answer is keep restarting until it decides ipv6 is possible.</p>

    <title>missing script engine &#34;VBscript&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            missing script engine &#34;VBscript&#34; </h2>
                    Hi, when trying to load a program for my child, it would not load because I seem to be missing a Vista file. The message read like this:<br />
Can't find script engine "VBScript" for script "E:\setup\support\jsw_install.vbs". Is there a way to load a small file or a utility that could fix this? Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks

            Hi Qswan,<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;Which program are you trying to install?<br />
•&nbsp;Are you able to install other programs without any issues?<br />
•&nbsp;Are you installing from a CD/DVD?<br />
•&nbsp;Also check if the file “jsw_install.vbs” exists in the location “E:\setup\support\jsw_install.vbs”.<br />
<br />
First, check if the program is compatible with Windows Vista. You may visit the <span>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vista compatibility center</a>&nbsp;</span>to check that.<br />
<br />
If it <strong>says not compatible</strong>, you may try installing the program in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
i.&nbsp;Click Start, and then type the name of the program in the Start Search box. <br />
ii.&nbsp;In the Programs list, right-click the program name, and then click Properties.
<br />
iii.&nbsp;On the Compatibility tab, click to select the Run this program in compatibility mode for check box.
<br />
iv.&nbsp;In the list, select an operating system as Windows XP, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
More information, check the article “How to troubleshoot program compatibility issues in Windows Vista”
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927386</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>If it says it is compatible</strong>, you may try reregistering the VBS script and then load the program.<br />
<br />
i.&nbsp;Click Start, type the following in the search bar and hit enter: <strong>regsvr32 %systemroot%\system32\vbscript.dll<br />
</strong>ii.&nbsp;If the registration was successful, you should now see the following message: DllRegisterServer in vbscript.dll succeeded.<br />
