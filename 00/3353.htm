<h2>            Removing or Disabling OneNote from Office 365 on Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    <p>I have a current subscription to Office 365 on my Windows 7 Ultimate laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to permanently disable or remove OneNote. I do not use it, do not want to use it and am tired of it being the default printer option in many of the programs I use daily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is NOT in regards to the OneNote app. This is in regards to OneNote that is bundled with Office 365. PLEASE, is there a way to disable or completely remove OneNote from a Windoes 7 Ultimate computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>This is probably expected from a company like Microsoft. &nbsp;Here's the problem with that. &nbsp;Once you open OneNote - BY MISTAKE - the program becomes predatory. &nbsp;It opens on its own, becomes a hassle to deal with its blunt user interface, and makes Office less
 valuable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you won't let us uninstall it, how can I stop it from being proactive? &nbsp;Make it like it was before I started it accidentally??</p>

                    When I watch YouTube videos in Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 8 Pro, the videos&nbsp;are completely green. But in Google Chrome, the videos work just fine, and this definitely isn't a Flash glitch. Can anybody help?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting the query on Windows Community forum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the description, it shows that on Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), the video display is completely green
 in YouTube and it works fine in Google Chrome. This may happen if there is an issue with the display drivers or an issue with the settings in IE 10. I will help you to troubleshoot the display issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would like to ask a few questions for a better understanding.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined only to YouTube’s website only on IE 10?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you updated the display drivers?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s go ahead with the following instructions and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1: Update the Windows 8 drivers for the display adapter from the manufacturer’s website.</strong>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Try to disable the add-ons and check</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer in the classic view.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on tools, Internet Options and Programs tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Manage add-ons and disable them. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now check the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:
</span></b><span>If Step 1 does not work then try to
<b>reset the </b></span><b><span>Internet Explorer Settings</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, I recently received windows 10 a week ago so I decided to start using Windows Edge. But when I use youtube, bing videos, anything to do with videos, it doesn't&nbsp;show work. When I use YouTube it's just black. When I watch videos from bing, it turns green.
 Please help!

<p>I apologize Microsoft.&nbsp; It was not Windows 10 that caused the problem.&nbsp; I turned out to be the underlying culprit, which resulted in "Green Screen Video" in Windows 10 Edge browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar problem. Two identical computers and same computer settings. One of them played Flash videos within Windows 10 Edge browser and the other one did not. The culprit turned out to be "Hyper-V" and "Hyper-V" virtual switch (Virtual Network Adapter),
 which was enabled a long time ago during my experimentation with virtualization in Windows 8.x Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling Hyper-V and Hyper-V's virtual switch resolved the problem I was experiencing by:</p>
<p>1. Open Control Panel</p>
<p>2. Click on Programs (make sure you are using "Category View")</p>
<p>3. Click on Programs and Features</p>
<p>4. Within the navigation panel on the left click on "Turn Windows Features On or Off"</p>
<p>5. Locate Hyper-V and uncheck the box to disable</p>
<p>6. Click OK</p>
<p>5. Click "Restart the computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: One the computer restarts, go to your network adapter setting and disable "v-Ethernet (Virtual Switch)" and make sure your real (i.e., physical) network is set for DHCP or manually configured to work on your local network.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>When troubleshooting video you look for what is working for not working that is associated with hardware and or software.</p>
<p>First - we can assume your video (i.e., hardware [video card], software [video drivers]) is working because you can see your Microsoft desktop on your desktop monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second - we can further assume the nature of your complaint concerns not being able to see a video image (i.e., YouTube, ABC Go, etc.)</p>
<p>So we can establish the root cause of your problem is not hardware, due to the fact that if it was a hardware issue, there would be no video images rendered on your desktop do to loss of video signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also can conclude that the software (i.e., video drivers - software instructions) are working due to the fact that you can see your desktop, interact with desktop applications, open an internet browser, surf the internet and see returned results. And
 the only exception is watching Flash based videos inside your computer's browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the truth of the issue is Layer 6 &amp; 7 of the "Seven Layers" of the OSI model, which are the "Presentation" and "Application" layers, are not working. It is such the case that I can eliminate layer 7, the application because layer 7 is incorporated into
 Microsoft security schema itself and if it was not working, every Windows 10 computer would not be able to see flash based video inside of their browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we must deduce that layer 6, "the Presentation layer" of the OSI model, is the root cause of the problem that you are experiencing. For example: layer 6, which is driven by software instructions, interprets the video signal/instructions received by your
 computer and tell layer 7 how to render the video signal within your computer browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: In your case, layer 6 &amp; 7 are affected either by your browser configuration settings and/or by the video driver itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>So lets troubleshoot the video driver:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Is your computer, a desktop or laptop. If a laptop, go to # 4</li><li>Was your computer custom built or was it purchased from a computer manufacture (box store or online). If custom built, go to # 4, if the video card is integrated into the motherboard, else go to # 5.</li><li>If desktop, is your computer video card integrated into the motherboard or does it insert into an expansion slot (i.e., PCIe or PCI) on your motherboard. If it inserts into an expansion slot on your motherboard, go to #&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If your computer's video card is integrated into the motherboard, locate the model number, serial numbers and or part number on your computer and then go to the manufacturer's website and download the specific video drivers needed for your computer model
 and its respective operating system (Windows 10). Once downloaded, install the manufacturer video driver and reboot your computer.&nbsp;</li><li>If your computer's video card inserts into an expansion slot, locate the video card's part number and/or serial number, go to the manufacturer's website and download the specific video drivers needed for your computer 's video card and its respective operating

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The software configuration settings:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>From the Window Edge browser, click on "..." =&gt; Click on "Settings =&gt; Click on "View Advance Settings" =&gt; Make sure the selector switch for "Use Adobe Flash Player" is in the "On" position</li><li>From the Window Edge browser, click on "..." =&gt; Click on Open Internet Explorer" =&gt;Click on "Tool" =&gt; Click on "Internet Options" =&gt; Click on the "Advance Tab" and try one of the following configuration settings and click "OK" (closing and reopening your

<p>Lastly, if the above process does not work, I would advise you&nbsp;to contact the customer support&nbsp;for&nbsp;your computer manufacture (Dell, Lenovo, ASUS, etc...) requesting specific instructions, based upon on the model number of your computer, on how to configure
 the appropriate settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: computer driver related issues are manufacturers issues that affect the&nbsp;computer hardware/software experience when using a Microsoft compatible computer.&nbsp; It is also easier to blame Microsoft, versus blaming the&nbsp; manufacturer of the hardware component
 for failing to develop the appropriate component drivers prior to the release of newer operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases that have one or more years of lead time to develop the appropriate hardware driver prior to the new operating system being released.</p>

            <span>I share your pain. &nbsp;In several trials to "@msn.com" and "@hotmail.com" addresses from an SMTP MTA I administer, only one message was actually delivered (and yes, I've checked the "spam" folder of the test accounts). &nbsp;In every case, Microsoft's inbound
 MTA presented an SMTP reply of "250 &lt;message-id&gt; Queued mail for delivery".&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
My originating MTA is covered by valid SPF and DKIM DNS records and inserts a valid DKIM signature in each outgoing message. &nbsp;On the one message that got through, Outlook mail asserted:&nbsp;
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>&lt; removed by moderator &gt;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>However, the SPF testing tool linked at openspf.org asserts the SPF record for this domain is correct and gmail.com asserts that similar test messages bear valid SPF and DKIM credentials.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Details of the last silently discarded test message (timestamp is UTC+1, Central European Time):</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>&lt; removed by moderator &gt;</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>If Microsoft insists upon silently discarding messages after acknowledging receipt, the least it could do would be to (1) provide an interface by which sysadmins can determine the reason for such discards, similar to what reputable blacklist operators
 provide and (2) notify their email subscribers daily of the number of silently discarded messages addressed to them, along with the originating domains of those messages that pass MTA reverse address lookup tests.</div>

            To interested readers of this thread: the private message referred to above provided no answers, but requested additional information, which was supplied the same day. &nbsp;As of the evening of January 17, 5 days later, Microsoft has not responded to the information
 provided and continues to block email from two servers I administer. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The servers in question have static IP addresses within the data center of a major commercial hoster. They share those addresses with no other entity, appear on no public black list I can find, and generate very little automated email for a small non-profit
 public interest group, which is sent only to dues-paying members of that group. &nbsp;Moreover, all mail originated by these systems bears DKIM authentication and is covered by DNS SPF authorization -- both of which satisfy the relevant test tools as well as passing
 muster with gmail.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>It appears that if you are a low-volume non-commercial sender of email, Microsoft feels free to discard your mail because you haven't established a "reputation" within their proprietary and/or outsourced email filtering systems, even if you implement virtually
 every new open-standard anti-spam technology (only thing lacking in our toolset: DNSSEC ... maybe Microsoft will eventually deign to tell me if that will make any difference).</div>

            There are 2 acceptable ways of dealing with incoming spam mail.
<div>1. refuse to accept it and bounce it back to sender</div>
<div>2. accept it and mark it as spam (put it in the spam folder)</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, Microsoft is silently discarding the message it deems unworthy. This should be treated as a critical bug as data and information is being lost in the process. I believe that this bug has been around for a few years and hope some engineer from
 Microsoft can look into it.</div>

            Laura, I share your frustration at the lack of substantive assistance from Microsoft, but your suspicion that this is not the right place to seek a solution of your problem was correct.&nbsp; This thread deals with the ENTRY of email from outside of Microsoft
 Mail / Outlook Mail / Hotmail and its non-delivery to end-user accounts like yours.&nbsp; It is oriented to system administrators of non-Microsoft mail systems ("postmasters") whose outbound email is discarded by Microsoft Mail with no indication of error to either
 the sender or the intended receiver.<br />
<br />
I suggest opening a new thread whose title includes one or two key phrases in the EXACT wording of the first (or most severe) error message you receive when you attempt to unsuccessfully delete mail from your account.&nbsp; That way, people who have the same problem
 are likely to find your thread when searching for posts containing the error message and, putting your heads together -- especially looking carefully at those error messages from your different viewpoints and user experiences -- you may find a solution working
 together.&nbsp; It might also be useful to take a careful look (again!) at Outlook Mail end-user help text and FAQs.<br />
<br />
I am sorry I cannot offer you any useful advice for your problem.&nbsp; I use Outlook&nbsp; Mail exclusively to help diagnose problems that my users encounter in getting mail delivered to Microsoft Mail / Outlook Mail / Hotmail accounts.&nbsp; I thus have less experience
 with its end-user interface than you do!<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<h2>            Word 2016 - right-click for misspelled words not working properly</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Office 2016, I've found that right-click for spelling errors in Word is not working as it used to. The red squiggly line still appears under misspelled words, but when I right-click, the context menu displayed is for formatting, rather
 than containing spelling suggestions. If I then click away from the word and go back and right-click it again, I get the spelling context menu. This is pretty irritating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried doing a "quick repair" of Office, but the problem is not fixed. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Office 365 on a Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>senderscore reputation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            senderscore reputation</h2>
                    So, creating a new ticket since the FMs in the old ticket could not even understand the problem.<br />
<br />
The old ticket can be found here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/emails-being-delivered-to-junk/6ac59380-01af-46a4-9f15-0e3fb412e7d6">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/emails-being-delivered-to-junk/6ac59380-01af-46a4-9f15-0e3fb412e7d6</a><br />
<br />
The problem has increased now, and like i previously stated, a feedback loop is being created which is further lowering the 'senderscore' of my email servers.<br />
<br />
A. senderscore is lowering the 'reputation' of email servers when another server bounces a 550/554 to them.<br />
B. my analysis is that these were old hotmail accounts, and outlook.com generated these 550/554.<br />
C. now my email server has a 'low reputation' as seen by senderscore.org (which microsoft uses to determine rep).<br />
D. since it has low reputation (was 78 last week), the emails are being placed in the outlook.com junk folder of all my customers and contacts (they cannot receive my emails).<br />
E. this further creates a feedback loop since senderscore also reduces your reputation for services that place your email in the junk folder. (now the reputation is 72 and dropping like a rock)<br />
<br />
you need to fix this feedback loop, in coordination with senderscore.org who you use as a third party to rate email server reputations.<br />
<br />
To simplify: outlook.com first bounced 550/554, which lowers your 'reputation', then it places email in the junk folder, based on that lower reputation. this further lowers the reputation... feedback loop much? eventually nobody will be able to send email to
 outlook.com users.<br />
<br />
law enforcement authorities have already been notified, since these practices are anti-competitive. they are increasing the administrative burden for email providers/ISPs as well as reducing the information/choice available to consumers.<br />
<br />
you can read my analysis here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/having-problems-contacting-outlookcom-emails-read/bd0be879-3363-4d5a-96f7-370d4c1bedb0">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/having-problems-contacting-outlookcom-emails-read/bd0be879-3363-4d5a-96f7-370d4c1bedb0</a><br />
<br />
here is proof that you use senderscore: <a href="https://snt145.mail.live.com/mail/services.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://snt145.mail.live.com/mail/services.aspx</a> and <a href="https://www.senderscore.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.senderscore.org/</a><br />
<br />
however, i think gmail/yahoo use senderscore as well, and my emails are not being 'junked' there, so it's something on your end. fix it.<br />

            reputation is now 82, up from 72 yesterday. however, it's taking a month for that reputation to improve.<br />
<br />
furthermore, it never worked before with a rep or 82, which seems odd because 82 is in the 'green'. probably before i receive a response, the rep will be up to 90. still probably won't work by then.<br />
<br />
a related side-note. i contacted senderscore last week. it said i should receive a reply within 1 business day. it sent that same mail every day for 4 days, each time saying '1 business day'... when i tried to add more information to the ticket, the system
 emailed me saying that the representative is away on holiday until monday the 15th... seriously? 2 weeks to contact senderscore? how is someone supposed to fix these issues in a timely fashion? ;\ my email provider also told me that it takes weeks to contact
 snds/partner support. in fact, there is no phone partner support for ISPs, just that one email form - junk mail partner reporting program...<br />
<br />
however, my question is: how can you expect consumers to understand all this information? this is ridiculous. either make the information publicly available so consumers can have a choice, or provide adequate response times for these issues. a month is unacceptable.<br />

            oh wait, let me guess, just another reason my account is 'under investigation'? because you consider this to be a 'dupe'?<br />
<br />
well, let me provide you with some friendly advice:<br />
<br />
A. do not close people's original ticket when it is in progress.<br />
<br />
B. do not mark your answer as the correct one when it doesn't even describe the problem.<br />
<br />
C. don't abandon tickets that you can't understand in this fashion either.<br />
<br />
D. don't threaten to ban users simply because they are frustrated at not being able to receive a response.<br />
<br />
do all of those things, and people will not create 'dupes'. btw, technically its not a dupe since the issue has escalated/gotten worse. new circumstances. in any case, consider it what you will. reply to my original ticket if you want, i don't care... but so
 far, the response has been inadequate.<br />

            Hi&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e874830e-e51e-4f22-851b-8515444ec3eb">A. User</a>,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community. I understand that the reputation of your email servers lowers as emails arrive in the junk folder. We would like to inform you that we have no control over the change of your reputation score so
 I would suggest that you contact the <b>Junk Email Reporting Program</b> by filling up the form on this
<a href="https://support.msn.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsjmrpp&amp;ct=eformts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. If you haven't send a form yet, please do, or if you have already sent a form, please resend again for follow up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have other questions, feel free to post back.</div>

            Hi, my original account was banned by moderators because they could not answer my question. Please, continue banning my accounts and a shitstorm will ensue with law enforcement being involved.
<b>Also, please reinstate my previous account.</b> furthermore, some of my posts are not searchable. The threads are not locked or deleted. they are 'hidden' from public view, but i cannot ascertain that from the original account, which can still search them
 publicly. only when searching from another account did this become apparent to me...
<b>censorship at its finest.</b> In addition, some of my comments were deleted. They were not insulting/offensive, they were simply complaints directed at microsoft or the service provided...<br />
<br />
also: you did not provide me an address i can contact for dispute resolution to have my account unbanned, or a specific reason for the ban. This is completely unprofessional to say the least, pathetic to say the most.<br />
<br />
My response follows:<br />
<br />
I understand, however, that link is only available to the ISP/email provider themselves.<br />
<br />
Users have no access to this information. furthermore, they cannot even be expected to understand the situation.<br />
<br />
Microsoft is failing to provide end users with the support/information they require about their personal and mail server reputations as viewed by outlook.com/SNDS.<br />
<br />
The only information available to us is the returnpath 'senderscore'. But this isn't the 'reputation' as viewed by outlook.com/microsoft. It is only part of the reputation score.<br />
<br />
However, as already stated, the senderscore of my email server is above 80 and in the green. Emails are not being junked by gmail/yahoo, only on outlook.com...<br />
<br />
Therefore it is something on Microsoft's end... and senderscore is only PART of the problem.<br />
<br />
My email services provider has already filled out the junk mailing form 2 weeks ago. However, they told me they generally do not receive a response for weeks or months, if ever from microsoft regarding mail deliverability issues.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, email service providers have to sign up for 2 microsoft services, just to have their mail delivered: partner program and SNDS. This is anti-competitive, and I've already written to several government agencies to describe this blatant effort to
 limit consumer choice.<br />

<p>We understand that you want the issue about your account's sender score to be resolved. However, it would be best to post your concerns in the old post you mentioned above, since our Support Speicalists are already engaged in the investigation. Having said
 that, we have now locked this thread. </p>

<p>I found it myself: <em>this control belongs to the Skype for Business (né Lync) Web App plug-in.
</em>This is the plug-in you have to use if Skype for Business isn't installed and you attend a **** meeting, which I do quite regularly. I don't know why Outlook.com wants to load it specially, but it's something to do with the Skype/Outlook.com integration.
 It looks quite harmless.</p>

            <p>I'd also like more clarity on what exactly this addon is. I use Skype, but not Skype for Business, and I also did not select the option to have Skype scour my webpages to highlight phone numbers to be able to call via SkypeOut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an addon is requesting permission, then it really needs to be more transparent and descriptive what it does. For example there could be a description as with monthly OS updates, so at least we know what it is, otherwise we get suspicious of planted malware
 and spend valuable business time researching this stuff.</p>

<h2>            Navigation Pane - Headings move around when I click on them</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the last couple of weeks, I'm starting to have problems with my Navigation Pane.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headers are all nice and aligned -- and then I'll click on one to navigate to another part of the document, and it'll move out of alignment -- either getting promoted or demoted. Sometimes the style that's applied to that heading is changed, sometimes
 it's not. I can't re-promote or re-demote back to its original condition consistently, either -- depending on the style and if it's changed or not, promoting or demoting will mess up the styles even further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below - the DRUC headings should all be aligned, the Scenarios should be aligned, etc. Somehow they all get nested and wonky, just from clicking on them once to navigate elsewhere in the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80b5f7cc-e93f-4b38-9b2a-004672a1cebf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80b5f7cc-e93f-4b38-9b2a-004672a1cebf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if it has to do with the fact that I have a laptop and 2 external monitors connected -- never had an issue in the past but it's been brought up by coworkers as a possible issue. I'm working off of files that are stored on Sharepoint - maybe
 a factor? Again, I've never had an issue in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone have any guidance for me? It's driving me batty and makes my document very hard to navigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!<br />
Kristin</p>

<p>Hi Kristin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, could you record a video for those behaviors mentioned in your post? It will let us see more details. You could use mobile phone or PowerPoint to record a video. Upload the video to a cloud storage and share with us a
 guest/download link of it. I have sent you a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
private message</a> to collect the link. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you mentioned the document works properly before. I want to confirm if the issue occurs after you uploaded it to SharePoint Online. If other users in your tenant are able to edit it, will they change some style settings in it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, in Word, please click File&gt;Account&gt;capture a screenshot of all info under Product Information (you may record this info in the video).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi Kristin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the video, it seems you are operating with Word desktop app. So, do you mean the local copy doesn't have this issue, but the issue occurs if you directly open the file from SharePoint Online? If you open it in Word Online, will you encounter the same
 behavior? </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned the issue is related to SharePoint Online, could you share with us the file which you use to record the video in my private message? We want to check the same file in SharePoint Online.
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Kristin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to my private message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Given your description, it seems the document now works properly in SharePoint Online. If you just remove some PII info and restore the file to former version without changing other settings in the document, it might be a temporary issue with Word Online.
 As now it works well, we cannot investigate the behavior further. I suggest you monitor the status of this document and other documents when using Word Online. If the behavior persists, please feel free to post back. We can look into it further.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Why are my games jerky now I have downloaded IE10</h2>
                    Is it because I have downloaded IE10 as before there was no problem. All the games I play are not running smoothly, everything else it great.

<h2>            The end of windows phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am/was an enthusiastic supporter of windows phone. I put up with the lack of apps hoping that will change with time and could do with the great few apps in store. Alas, those apps were Nokia legacy and Microsoft saw fit to let the wither and die; i.e.
 Mix radio, Here maps, etc. Even so, I could do with other features like large storage space in OneDrive to automatically backup my phone. But now, that is also gone, from 30Gb storage to 5Gb and they give me a month to delete the extra data! Also flagship
 phones let out of the windows 10 update, and the list of slights goes on...</p>
<p>This apparent disregard for customers I find outrageous!&nbsp;</p>
<p>What options do we have but to change to either Android or iPhone?</p>
<p>Has Microsoft given up on phones?</p>

            <p>You are right on all your points, but that doesn't change the facts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. No equal replacements for the previously Nokia star apps.</p>
<p>2. Most people never got/acted on OneDrive and hence are going to lose the storage. Google still provides 15 Gb free storage. Even if you did retain your storage most people didn't and are not happy about it.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I like the lumia phones and the software but although I see a future for windows apps,&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see a future for windows phones. I wish it was different but it seems to me like a sinking ship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could wait a couple of years (hopefully) for windows 10 app store to become popular and with as many apps as the other platforms, but in the mean time you still need a phone and the last thing you want is for that phone to loose apps and cloud storage.</p>

            Mobile isn't going anywhere. MS has stated many times that mobile is not their focus this year, they are working on polishing Windows 10. There is a "surface phone" due to release in April 2017. By then, Redstone 2 should be the RTM release and much more
 polished. Unfortunately, we are all just testers/enthusiasts in the meantime. MS can afford to do this, other's can't.

            <p>Actually those are the options, either&nbsp;yearly at $69.00 or $6.99 a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you use Word or Excel once in a blue Moon, if you check the figures you actually get a better deal to buy yearly than Monthly. If you maybe open word or Excel once every couple of months then monthly is the way to go.</p>

    <title>Syncing OneNote to Onedrive confusion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roqueja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing OneNote to Onedrive confusion</h2>
                    <p>Two posts in two days..oops!</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm trying to sync my onenote files to OneDrive because I want lots of people to access it in lots of devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main problem is the way I created these notebooks, I think it makes sharing a bit difficult due to the settings I chose (originally didn't care about sharing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I want to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 4 notebooks, for 4 different courses. I want to save the files to OneDrive, so that much like word or excel, when I save (or whenever onenote automatically saves), it goes to OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know technically it's already in the cloud because it'll save to my microsoft account ( I hope that's how it works), but for people without office2013 / when I somehow don't have my account, I still want the file. Currently, the files are on my computer
 (hard drive, off-line). These have whatever the onenote extension is, and the little purple logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, whenever I "change location" in the book properties to point to onedrive's path, it creates a "internet shorcut" type file there, the one with a little chrome (for me) logo. I want the actual purple onenote file to be in onenote, since I
 can't click the chrome-type file to open the OneNote app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when I actually go and copy/paste my onenote files from wherever they are now (on my hard drive) to onedrive, it has problems syncing (it just says cannot sync). What is wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tl;dr - essentially I want to save/sync OneNote the same way as Word/Excel/Powerpoint instead of relying on it's built in cloud/internet whatever it uses feature</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I've provided enough info but if not I'll update.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I see really some confusion about how Onenote works.</p>
<p>At first:</p>
<p>The Onedrive application on your computer with the ominous shortcuts is useless for Onenote.</p>
<p>And to use "change location" repeatedly for different ways of access is just unnecessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a notebook is on Onedrive you can access it all the time, even without Internet connection.</p>
<p>For that Onenote keeps a local copy of the notebook in its local cache, so you can change the notebook while offline. This is valid for Onenote desktop client and Onenote App from the Windows Store.</p>
<p>After reconnect to the Internet the offline changes are synchronized to the notebook master on Onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other people without Onenote software can use the Onenote Web App aka Onenote Online in the Web browser of their choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your intention&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"essentially I want to save/sync OneNote the same way as Word/Excel/Powerpoint instead of relying on it's built in cloud/internet whatever it uses feature"</em></p>
<p>is not realizable with Onenote.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            5310 - IS IT JUST TOO THIN&#63;</h2>
                    Hello All,<br />
<br />
Newbie post here, so be gentle!<br />
<br />
I bought a unlocked/any network 5310 recently just so I could put my work mobile SIM in it so I could have more features - as work just give you very basic handset.<br />
<br />
However after just 30 days the screen cracked! I got a great big 'So what!' from Carphone **bleep**, as I did not have specific insurance and they said that no screens are covered by manufacturers warranty.<br />
<br />
Is that right? This seems very poor service and they are just washing their hands of it.<br />
<br />
Having looked at the unit now I wonder if design has gone too far, and that it wont be up to the job of everyday use as it is so thin. It was not dropped or banged, I just took it out of my pocket to use it and discovered the display was mush!<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this?<br />
<br />
I intend to just fix it myself using the various suppliers on the internet as I refuse to pay CW to repair it.<br />
<br />
However, I am not very confident that this wont happen again. :-(<br />
<br />
Rgds<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will assist you with this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x0000000A. This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error message is displayed when one of the drivers is not working as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps below and see if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/how-to-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors-in-windows/58d5eb2f-ca88-4f82-9631-82fefd11d774">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/how-to-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors-in-windows/58d5eb2f-ca88-4f82-9631-82fefd11d774</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some users have also reported that using McAfee software has also caused the issue. If you have any McAfee software, uninstall them, boot the computer in normal mode and check if the issue persists.</p>

<p>I read that thread that you listed. This error is occurring towards the end of the windows update. gets to about 60% on the install then it will stop and shows sad face and gives the error, then says it is putting the old version back in place. All my drivers
 appear to be updated.</p>
<p>Figure eventually it will succeed with the install.</p>

<h2>            MS Office 2013 Word Mail Merge Alt F9 Moves Cursor to First Field Code</h2>
                    <p>I've expanded my use of Mail Merge to create automated updated data, pulling from Excel. I like this feature but am getting bogged down because every time I hit "ALT F9" the page jumps to around the very first inserted field code. I need the cursor to STAY
 where I am editing. I have to continuously find my place again in the document, and this becomes cumbersome as the document grows. I've used the SHIFT F5 key to find my last place again, but this is not always working; moreover, I tried to add an ICON to a
 customized "menu" section on the Ribbon,&nbsp;but I&nbsp;can't find the appropriate "Go Back" Icon under "Customize the Ribbon". Does anyone have&nbsp;a solution?</p>

<h2>            Activation Wizard does not work - it can&#39;t connect to internet and it won&#39;t provide a telephone number so I can activate my product. Please help.</h2>
                    I downloaded Microsoft Office 2010 from my school, because I'm a student and it's provided. I have 30 days to activate the product and enter in my product key (which I have).
<br />
When I prompt the Activation Wizard to "Activate software over the intranet", I get an error message saying "An unspecified error has occurred, your request cannot be processed at this time. Please try again later. (0x80070001)"<br />
When I prompt the Activation Wizard to "Activate software by telephone", I can select 'United States' - but no additional information appears.
<br />
<br />
Does anybody have this telephone number or know how to fix this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

    <title>Change Outlook To&#58; field from Display Name to Full Name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lauramlutz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Outlook To&#58; field from Display Name to Full Name</h2>
                    <p>I have two computers running Office 2016. On one computer I changed Outlook to display the Full Name (first + last name)&nbsp;field instead of the Display Name (name + email) field when typing an address in the To: field in a new email. I remember searching high
 and low online to find out how to make this change and once I found it, it was an easy change in the Outlook settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I set-up a new computer, the new one uses the Display Name (name + email). I want to change it to show just the name without the email address. I don't remember how to make this change and can't find it online. Can anyone tell me how to do this.&nbsp;THE
 CHANGE DOES NOT INVOLVE CHANGING THE DISPLAY NAME FOR ALL MY CONTACTS. IT IS A SETTING IN OUTLOOK.</p>
<p>

<h2>            What version Windows Media Audio &#40;.wma&#41; do I have on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to rip music files to a 32gb&nbsp;SDHC card to play in my VW Jetta Sportwagen.&nbsp; VW tells me the player in the vehicle will play "WMA (.wma) files up to 9.0."&nbsp; I formatted the SD card as FAT32 and then ripped files to the SD card using Windows Media
 Player 12 (12.0.7601.18840, to be precise).&nbsp; When I inserted the SD card in the car, the player's screen&nbsp;ran through all the albums and songs but the player could not play any of them.&nbsp; I got an error message that there is a problem with the SD card.&nbsp; Wondering
 if the files were written in a WMA version 10 (or later), but I cannot figure out how to check that.&nbsp; The file properties indicate only "Windows Media Audio file."&nbsp; Can anyone help??

            <p>First, the version of Windows Media PLAYER may be 12.0, but the latest .wma format is 9. That's the music file itself, not the player software.
</p>
<p>Many car devices and other things seem to be stuck on FAT 16. Why? I don't know. Some cars play FAT32 and some don't. Before you pull your hair out, re-format in FAT 16 and give it a shot. Some car players can handle different bit rates, too. Try something
 at 256kbs or under (in a car, your road noise is probably going to kill your super high fidelity file anyway). I've also had bizarre results with car systems trying to play something that contains both .wma and .mp3 files---it seems to pick either one or the
 other. Try all .wma files on your USB drive. You can check the format details on a PC by right-clicking on the music track and looking at "details". I doubt that's the issue, however.
</p>
<p>Check your file structure itself on your SD card. There are nearly always limits on how many levels of folders you can use and how many files per folder. You might have to re-organize somewhat. If you've got Genre/Artist/Album you've got at least 3 folder
 levels and not all players can deal with that. </p>
<p>Let us know how you make out. </p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I’d like to share with you that as far as I know if we
<strong>have added</strong> normal members or Guests into the teams, we cannot directly change their display names in the Teams members lists. However, if you want to change the users display names, you can try to sign into the Azure Active Directory ( assume
 you are the global admin of your Office 365 organization). When you sign into the AAD, please go to Users &gt; find out the user that you want to change, and then edit there. After that please save your changes and this action may need some time to take effect,
 thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information, please refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/edit-guests-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Edit guest user information</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another hand, if you concerned about directly changing users information ( like their display names) in the Teams, it is recommended that please give a feedback to
<a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public</a> and post your good ideas there. The dedicated engineers in Microsoft will keep monitoring customers feedback, some features would
 be added to the product based on customers feedback in the future, and your good ideas will be very helpful for them to improve the product, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the display names of your guest users, if you got any further updates, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

<p>Oliver, when you enter in a guest email address on Teams before you click "add" there is a pencil that will allow owners to edit the name. I edited all the new users and but when I ultimately clicked "add" only 10% of the names actually took my edits. The
 other 90% have their email handle before the @.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am not the global admin I am just the owner of a team. </p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, when we add a guest into Teams for the first time, there would be a pencil icon near the guest email address, and we can use it to edit the guest display name. However, if you added the same guest to another team, the guest will still show as the display
 name which was edited before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, concerned that some of the display names of your guests didn’t show as the names you edited before, my understanding is that you added the guest for the first time. In this case, if the display names of the guests don’t show as the names you edited,
 first please remove the guests from <strong>All the team member lists ( you may added them to different teams).
</strong>After you removing them from all your teams, please contact your global admin and ask him to remove
<strong>the guests</strong> from the Azure Active Directory (AAD) user list, and then please wait for some time and
<strong>re-sign in</strong> your Team to re-add the guests into your team. At this time, you would be able to see the pencil icon and use it to edit the guest display names again. After that please see if it can make any difference. For more information about
 managing users in AAD, please refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you got any further updates when you re-add them, please feel free to let me know, thanks.</p>
<p>

 do it in another way. I am not sure how he attempted to achieve that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I continue to have the frustration that I cannot edit the display names and they do not reflect, in many cases, an identifiable name of the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this problem, as we talked before, the Guests related information are controlled by the global admin. As you said your admin try to do it in another way, if he can't change it, please suggest him to refer to our previous
 talke to have a try at your convenience, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you got any further updates, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>

<p>I have reviewed Azure Active Directory and learned that the display names are reflecting as I desire. However, on the desktop app users are reflecting the email handle before the @ instead of the display name. Additionally, my guest users ARE seeing the
 edited names but the owner is not. Also, the display name being reflected on the desktop program for the owner is different than the display name that is being reflected on the phone app which is different from what the guest users are seeing on their end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be an issue outside of our internal business and administration and one that lies within the Microsoft programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Nick,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your description, I did a lot of test about the Teams guest with AAD, I got a similar scenario as you mentioned. When I changed the guest display names in the AAD or via powershell, the guest name did change in the AAD, guest side, and the Teams
 for mobile. However, the Teams Client is still showing the old display name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the guest name can't be changed, the recommendation we can give is that you can refer to my second reply above to have a try, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I got a similar scenario as you mentioned, I need some time to consult our related teams for this scenario, if I got any further updates, I will notify you within three work days, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your patience and time will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>

            We were able to get all the guest display names fixed through Azure Active Directory. However, everything was appearing exactly the way we wanted but then it arbitrarily changed 3 days later. I am not sure how that happened without the administrator actually
 making that change.&nbsp;

    <title>Copy of sent items to different mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonclapham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy of sent items to different mailbox</h2>
                    
<p>As part of FCA requirements a client of ours is required to keep a log of all outgoing emails to external email addresses that they can search through when they want.. The simplest way I can see of doing this for them is to have all of their outgoing emails
 to bcc to a mailbox accessible only to the correct people. To accomplish this I found another article&nbsp; which said</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Connect Windows PowerShell to Exchange Online.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Create a new mailbox to collect all the messages. For example, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Run this command in Remote PowerShell:</p>
<p><em>Get-Mailbox | Where {$_.SenderType -eq "<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>"}| Set-Mailbox -DeliverToMailboxAndForward $true
</em></p>
<p><strong>4</strong>. Run another command to set forwarding rules for all the user mailboxes:</p>
<p><em>Get-Mailbox | Where {$_.SenderType -eq "<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>"}| Set-Mailbox -ForwardingAddress *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</em></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Remove the forwarding rule for the public forward mailbox:</p>
<p>Set-Mailbox pulicforward -ForwardingAddress $null</p>

<p>This would have to be repeated for all users.</p>
<p>I also read that this could not be sent to a shared mailbox as I found on a TechNet page</p>
<p>"In-Place Archive can only be used to archive mail for a single user or entity for which a license has been applied. Using an In-Place Archive as a means to store mail from multiple users or entities is prohibited. For example, IT administrators can’t create
 shared mailboxes and have users copy (through the Cc or Bcc field, or through a transport rule) a shared mailbox for the explicit purpose of archiving."</p>
<p>So from the looks of that it would have to use a full mailbox with its own licence</p>
<p>To summarise, my questions are</p>
<p><strong>1) </strong>Is the script Correct</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Would the destination have to be a full mailbox with a new&nbsp;licence?</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Is there a different better way that this&nbsp;could be done which I have not considered?</p>

<p>hi jason,</p>
<p>from the description, i understand that you want to forward all the internal users outgoing emails (sent items) to external email addresses for keeping a future log.</p>
<p>you may consider the transport rules for this scenario:</p>
<p>use the exchange admin center to create transport rules.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;go to <strong>mail flow &gt; rules</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;click <strong>new +&gt;</strong> select<strong> create a new rule…&nbsp;</strong>click&nbsp;<strong>more options,</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;in the new rule dialog box, name the rule, and then select the conditions and actions for this rule:<br />
4.&nbsp;in <strong>apply this rule if</strong>…, select <strong>the sender</strong>&gt;<strong>is external/internal</strong>&gt;select
<strong>inside the organization</strong>&gt;click <strong>ok</strong></p>
<p>5. click <strong>add condition</strong> &gt; the recipient &gt;&nbsp;<strong>is external/internal&nbsp;</strong>&gt; select
<strong>outside</strong> <strong>the organization</strong> &gt; click ok.</p>
<p>6. . in <strong>do the following…,</strong> select <strong>add recipients</strong>…&gt;select to the bcc or cc or to box (whatever you want)&gt; select the external mail contact or license office 365 mailbox&gt;click
<strong>ok</strong></p>
<p>7. click <strong>save</strong></p>

    <title>Diffuse, ultimately useless complaint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lance beasley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Diffuse, ultimately useless complaint</h2>
                    <p>It's 4:44am. I came in early to get some work done.&nbsp; I decided to access and edit my OneNote notebooks online. I had re-arranged a few pages into different sections, deleted some old pages, etc. You know, basic house keeping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it happened. I got a really good work idea that needed to be jotted down somewhere. QUICK!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know how really good ideas can be. They have to be treated gently, carefully and lovingly. They need safe, reliable, comfortable, luxurious accommodations where they can be carefully fed, watched, visited, nurtured. They need to be able to roam freely,
 yet not be allowed to escape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where should I put it? Paper? No. Too easy to loose or leave behind at the office. Notepad? No. It doesn't get backed up, and I can't get to it on my phone or tablet. Google Docs? Maybe, but I can't use my sweet new iPad Pro and Apple Pencil with Google
 Docs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I reached for OneNote, the perfect solution for capturing and organizing everything across your devices. So I entrusted my rare, precious, infant idea to OneNote. The perfect Luxury Birthing Suite for great ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quickly started a new section and new page. Watched as my new idea began to take shape on the page.&nbsp; When WHAMMMM!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Red "UNSAVED CHANGES"... "UNSAVED CHANGES"... "UNSAVED CHANGES"... lights begin to flash, klaxons wail, and all I can remember is the frightened look on the face of my good idea as it VANISHED! Sure, there are organic traces of the once beautiful idea left
 on the transporter pad for Dr. Crusher to autopsy, but its essence evaporated. Nothing left but a few DNA fragments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It... it all happened so fast. The room is still spinning. The idea was there, and then...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it wasn't...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has the great Microsoft fallen so far that it can't make a 99.9999% reliable product any more?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the best software in the world, I SHOULD be able to create, edit, move, delete, invert, mirror, annotate, marinate and do ANYTHING ELSE someone would reasonably anticipate to a document- including TYPING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But instead, I'm staring at a red "Unsaved Changes" failure and am now in ABSOLUTE LIMBO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will you people PLEASE get a handle on your software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm firing up Google Docs, someone please tell me how to shut of that red, flashing "UNSAVED CHANGES" alarm...&nbsp;</p>
