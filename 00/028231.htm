<h2>            Outlook Error message &#58;  Cannot remove messages from the folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Office 2003 Pro under Win 7 Ultimate 64bit. My main email account is through GMail and when I created the link Outlook created a&nbsp;PST file for it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use a separate master PST file for all of my emails, including Hotmail and other POP3 based accounts, with its own archive database. The POP3&nbsp;accounts download directly into the master, while Hotmail&nbsp;is accessed through the Outlook Connector.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a rule on the system for the GMail account to copy any incoming Inbox messges to the Inbox in my master PST, which has been working for the last 6 weeks. But I have noticed that some messages, after being copied, are still left as unread and/or untransferred
 in the GMail PST. If I run the rule again, the messages are transferred and correctly flagged in the PST. Today, I started getting error messages from the system syaing 'Cannot remove messages from the folder' while transferring messages from the GMail PST
 to the masterl.&nbsp;A header record gets created with addresses and subject, but no content. If I run the rule, the system happily&nbsp;transfers the message, and generally flags it as transferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no error messages in Event Viewer. As far as I know, I did not have this problem on my previous XP system over the last 6 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the GMail account is IMAP based. I occasionally access it through the web or mobile if I am not at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the ScanPST, after killing Skype and Google search, and got this error log.</p>

<p>No idea what it is saying, apart from there being issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I loaded Outlook this evening, before the scan, it had downloaded 17 messages from GMail, but left 11 of them as not transferred and highlighted. It also skipped one message, but I had read that on the web interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the scan, it copied one message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will see what it does tomorrow night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the scanprt on the GMail PST file this morning - a problem as the system insisted it was open, even after&nbsp;I killed everything who could have opened it, so in the end I ran it in Safe Mode. Came up with no errors.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my old XP machine, I was using POP3 for the GMail account, while i have now moved to IMAP. My other option is to disable the Rules&nbsp;from running automatically and to just running them manually, since this seems to work. Running them automatically just
 causes issues :</p>
<p>1. Create the header but no body, and raise an error display.</p>
<p>2. Copy the message but leave it flagged as untransferred.</p>
<p>In both cases, if&nbsp;I run the Rule manually it will copy the message..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I switch back to POP3&nbsp;or do i need a way to reduce the size the of the GMail PST or the GMail database itself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have problems with PST file format. Both my master and archive PSTs are in the 97-2002 format. This has never been a problem on my old XP machine, but now the Archiver complains that it cannot archive Calendar data and needs a 2003 or later format.
 Not sure why it thinks that it needs to Archive Calendar data at all. So i now have two archive PSTs and have to figure how to merge them, which should work through Export/Import.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also a Outlook.pst buried in C:\Users\Chris\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook, along with the GMail PST.&nbsp;My own PSTs are in D:\Users\Chris\Documents\Chris\mail, since that way I know where they are and can copy them easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also scanned my old archive PST, which came up with a lots of errors. Can I assume that the rebuilt PST will not have lost any data??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Contacts have disappeared from People App</h2>
                    <p>It has been a while since I've been connected to the internet with the phone, and after I did it today, suddenly all my phone contacts have disappeared.</p>
<p>There seems to be a synchronization issue with the People App, because my primary email account has disappeared as well and when I try to readd it it tells me that it's already in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contacts themselves are ok, because I checked it in my Live account and they are all there, so the issue is with the People App, which is not connected to the primary outlook email anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a solution for this, yet? I already tried all the different suggestions from other threads and none of them worked...the app simply can't add my outlook account</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is basically due to how the Office 2007/2010 (.docx) file format renders the chart that you created in .doc. This is due to rendering of the chart in these 2 formats.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above information helps.

            So, basically, all i can do to retain the format is by using docx? Thanks!

<p><span>Scheduling a scan by adding a trigger to the Windows Defender Scheduled Scan task doesn’t work:</span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/how-do-i-schedule-a-defender-scan/9857bdcc-ef25-40f9-a08a-2e9b3d244f4f"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/how-do-i-schedule-a-defender-scan/9857bdcc-ef25-40f9-a08a-2e9b3d244f4f</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is still possible to schedule a Windows Defender scan by calling the Command Line Utility (MpCmdRun.exe) or the old Windows Defender UI (MSASCui.exe), but the rules for this could change “without notice” at any moment – as they’ve done so frequently
 in the past: </span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/windows-defender-how-to-schedule-a-scan/d4ba70ce-a70c-4d82-bb26-18902b4e8f9e"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/windows-defender-how-to-schedule-a-scan/d4ba70ce-a70c-4d82-bb26-18902b4e8f9e</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now<span> these issues certainly aren’t creating any kind of crisis for Windows Defender users, because the priority for running scheduled scans with Windows Defender is actually pretty low. Defender’s real-time protection will generally find any active
 malware that Defender is capable of detecting, and will only leave inactive malware (archived malware) or inactive malware remnants for scheduled scans to pick up. So running periodic manual scans with third-party malware-removal tools is usually a more productive
 strategy – just because these apps work with different signature sets, and consequently have the potential for finding active malware that Defender simply can’t detect:

    <title>problems merging large Office Word documents - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            problems merging large Office Word documents</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For years I've used Microsoft Word 2003. I keep a personal daily journal or blog and over the years I've added pictures, icons etc. About three years ago at a certain point in the document I would get this error message:&nbsp;<b><span>The
 save failed due to out of memory or disk space.&nbsp;</span></b> It took me many hours of trying to figure out the problem, before I figured out that I just have to start a second document.&nbsp;Naturally, this gives me two documents that are one year of daily additions
 in my journal. I downloaded the trial Microsoft Office 2010 and attempted to merge these documents and have failed 3 times. I do not understand why Office which is a computer program can not keep my journal in one file. This year after only 95 pages I had
 to continue with a second section. It seems that 525,000 KB of text, pictures, icons different font styles and graphics is close to the limit one can save in Microsoft office. Why is that? In addition, last year I sized my pictures on a separate page before
 inserting them into my journal, thinking this would make a difference. Can anyone please help? I would purchase Microsoft Office 2010 if it could meld or merge my documents, but 2010 seems to also have this same flaw. Thank you for any help with this matter,
 James Atzesberger&nbsp;</div>

            Microsoft Word 2010 can certainly handle documents this large.<br />
<br />
With a copy of document 1 open go to the end of the document and click so your insertion point is at the end.<br />
<br />
On the Insert tab click on the object button on the right side of the ribbon. This gives you a drop-down. Select text from file. Pick your second file.<br />
<br />
General notes on large documents and combining documents.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Combining documents is probably easiest if they are based on the same <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
template</a>. </li><li>If possible, all formatting should be done using
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">styles</a>. Direct formatting exponentially increases document complexity and makes editing much harder. With short documents this isn't a big problem, with long ones it is.<br />
</li><li>Hard page breaks should be avoided. Use paragraph formatting of page break before where a page break has to be forced.</li><li>Never, ever, use the <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/masterdocuments.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Master Documents Feature in Microsoft Word</a> - at least not until you read the articles at this link.</li><li>If you use automatic paragraph numbering read Shauna Kelly's articles on numbering and bullets. Start with
<a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to create numbered headings or outline numbering in Word 2007 and Word 2010</a><a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to create numbered headings

<h2>            Adding a Tiscali email address on Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Outlook.com will not accept my Tiscali.co.uk email address.&nbsp; It keeps saying check&nbsp;email address and password, when I know they are correct as I use the same email address in Windows mail and on an IPad.&nbsp; I have even tried changing the password to be absolutely
 sure, but it just will not accept it.&nbsp; The other part of the response is&nbsp; Server Response: 500 5.7.0 Qdlxamy2L7DWM Authentication Denied (TT320).</p>
<p>I have spent 2 hours on Live Chat with Microsoft, but they have been unable to resolve it and won't help further unless I sign up for their Premium Service, which I'm not prepared to do.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this problem and resolved it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm a student and I created an education account with my school e-mail. When I try to install Office apps, website only allows me to download an exe file for Onedrive. There is no other apps like Word, Powerpoint etc. (I have Windows 10.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note: Make sure you install the bit version that you're using for Office"</p>
<p>

            The basic Office 365 Education version only has online versions of the Office applications. Onedrive is free for anyone regardless of the version of Office 365. You would have to talk with your school if they acquired anything above the basic version but it seems like they didn’t.

            Your account given by your school is entitled for only online versions of Office and offline version of Onedrive. That is why you can download only Onedrive.
<br />
<br />You need to login to <a href="https://www.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.office.com/</a> to use these.
<br />
<br />You need to talk to your school and get upgraded account which will provide you offline versions of products. These are paid account and your school get charged.

<p>Thanks for the forum entry. </p>
<p>If I understand the issue correctly you have an issue with the Back up</p>
<p>please try the following. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>restart the Phone cheek the date and time.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Deactivate the back up restart once more
</p>
</li><li>
<p>volume down and power button until device restarts.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Verify that the date and time is correct.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Activate the back up and have a look if the same happens.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Try over wifi and over data connection.
</p>

            <p>ok - one important concept. the phone doesn't actually talk to the laptop (or the other way around) - they never did, not even on 8.1.</p>
<p>the phone and the laptop talk to your online account which holds the calendar. that account is then read by all the devices where you've signed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>open a browser on your laptop and go to calendar.live.com. can you see the changes you had done via your laptop's calendar app?</p>
<p>also, on your phone, go to settings / email and accounts &gt; tap and hold the entry with your Microsoft account and select sync. then check your phone's calendar app.</p>

<h2>            Cortana limited functionality in UK settings</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lumia 620. I participated WP Dev Prev and was using Cortana happily in US settings.</p>
<p>After latest update, I wanted to use it in UK settings, but now Cortana does not understand chat and general commands, tries to match what I told to phone book entries only. Calling contacts, including non-European names works fine.</p>
<p>I have an adult account, OS version is 8.10.14147.180 and firmware revision: 3056.40000.1404.0002</p>
<p>Speech and Language are all English (United Kingdom), Region is United Kingdom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After latest update, I switched Region, speech and language from US to UK. It should have worked, but I only got this limited functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One topic to mention:</p>
<p>In another thread, somebody asked if I downloaded English (United Kingdom). It was there, I just selected, the phone did not download English (United Kingdom). Should it have downloaded? Maybe it was there (as an older version) and that is the reason?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this all we get in UK settings, or does my phone lack the abilities Cortana US has?</p>
<p>If it is a problem that I experience, could you help me get the full functionality in UK settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Özgür</p>

            <p>Hi Özgür, thanks for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue isn't one that I've seen reported by any other users as yet.&nbsp; It might be worth investigating the scope of this issue in order to try and identify some kind of solution (even though Turkey isn't Cortana enabled yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you happen to know if any other Turkish Windows Phone users are also affected the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there a reason why you need to use the UK Cortana in preference to the US version?&nbsp; The UK variant isn't currently as functionally rich as the US counterpart, so I am thinking that the US version may work better for you until Turkey comes online.</p>

                    My work place switched to outlook this past fall after numerous years of using Groupwise.&nbsp; When one created a group in Groupwise, some members could be "To's", "CC's", or even "BCC's".&nbsp; So far, I haven't found a way to replicate this feature in Outlook.
 Every group member seems to participate at the "TO" level whether I want them to or not.&nbsp; Is there any way to give group members "CC" or "BCC" status as opposed to "TO" status in Outlook?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any help!!<br />

    <title>Blu Win HD not recognizing apps installed on the SD card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jos1988  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blu Win HD not recognizing apps installed on the SD card</h2>
                    <p>First of all, sorry for my bad English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just have bought a Blu Win Hd via Amazon and I got it by yesterday, the phone runs amazingly and I like it a lot but I'm facing problems with the apps installed on my SD card, the phone detects the SD, stores content on it and everything is fine until
 I restart the phone, then the icons of the installed apps are not shown in my home screen and the name is shown in the list but I can't open it. If I go to the storage sense option I can see the size of the apps installed on the SD card but nothing else, I
 though it was maybe because of the capacity of the SD card (SanDisk sdxc 64 gb class 10) but I tried with a 8 GB card Kingston ( Sdhc class 4) and the icons are shown again but it tells me that the apps are not installed. Another thing is that when I'm downloading
 the apps and for some reason my phone needs to restart (installing/updating language, for example), the apps that were queued then start to show "paused" and never start to download. What can I do in this case? Could it be a matter of updating wrongly when
 I first turned on my cellphone and it noticed me about the update to gdr1? I tried to solve this by doing several hard resets but it didn't work for me</p>
<p>
</p><p>My actual version of WP is 8.10.14203.306. Facing this is worse than my experience with the Huawei W1 that doesn't recognize the see card after restarting the cellphone but at least it runs the installed apps by reinserting the sd card

            <p>Hi Jos1988,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post on the forum. </p>
<p>I understand that your issue is related to the fact that it is not possible to open apps installed on SD card in your Blu Win HD and that it happens each time you&nbsp;restart your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would advise you to format your SD card but please make sure to do so in the phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above solution does not solve the problem I advise you to contact the manufacturer for replacement of your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,<br />
Agata J.</p>

    <title>Word 2010&#58; Why don&#39;t documents scroll vertically in Print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> big red 2007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010&#58; Why don&#39;t documents scroll vertically in Print Layout view&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have vertical scroll bars enabled in Word 2010.&nbsp; Note that I am NOT asking about how to enable vertical scroll bars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Print Layout view with more than one page viewed at a time, dragging the vertical scroll bar does nothing except show a small page indicator as shown in the screenshot below.&nbsp; In other words, when scrolling vertically with the scroll bar, the pages actually
 displayed in the document window do not change and I cannot quickly scan through the document nor see where I am scrolling to.&nbsp; This is very annoying.&nbsp; This does not happen in Draft view or in Print Layout view when only one page is viewed at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that this Print Layout view problem occurs in previous versions of Word as well.&nbsp; Can anyone confirm that this is a permanent "feature" in Word?&nbsp; Is there any way to change this?&nbsp; It seems completely pointless and similar document views in other
 programs --such as "two page scrolling" in Adobe Acrobat-- do not have this problem.&nbsp; What is the rationale?&nbsp; Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>A display driver's games performance is quite irrelevant to its performance with Word.&nbsp;So too is the comparison with Acrobat, which doesn't have to handle and kind of text reflow, something Word has to do all the time. Your situation&nbsp;is quite common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As for your questions, the answer is yes, that is how my system behaves. However, you didn't previously specify those parameters and that's not how I normally use Word, which I typically run at a 120% zoom in Print Layout view. Used that way, I see the behaviour
 I described.</p>

<h2>            Any way to resize images in OneNote for iPad&#63;</h2>
                    Now that adding new notebooks etal has been added, the next " missing" item of frustration is the inability to resize images. Even if you can't interactively resize via resizing handles (maybe double-taping image could activate resize handles as in many
 other iOs note apps), adding shrink/enlarge as with the Web App would be better than having no way to adjust image size.

    <title>How do I intercept Visio&#39;s Save As from a VSTO Plug In when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ralphmack  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I intercept Visio&#39;s Save As from a VSTO Plug In when exporting to a PNG&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am writing a plug-in to export some related data that I need for my business process when I export my Visio drawing to a PNG.</p>
<p>The most natural way to do that would be to capture the DocumentSavedAs event and, if the output is a PNG, do the processing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However:</p>
<p>* When I intercept DocumentSaved and DocumentSavedAs events, if the output isn't a Visio file (of some era), those events never fire.
</p>
<p>* The&nbsp;BeforeDocumentSave and BeforeDocumentSaveAs events fire, but give no indication of the target filename or filetype.
</p>
<p>* What event *can* I intercept as my trigger? </p>
<p>
</p><p>This leaves me with the prospect of providing a button on the ribbon for the user to export things separately, which is nowhere near as elegant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm at it, is there any way to intercept the information supplied during the export, like the page coordinates it cropped to and the pixel resolution of the exported PNG? This would allow me to supply an accurate image map along with all the business
 data that got squirreled away in the shapes.</p>

</p><p>Using IE 11, when I'm forced to close a browsing session that may have 10, 20 plus windows of hard to accomplish searches open (ones that I only want to keep for that "day's" work not forever so don't reply that I should just bookmark them as that in itself
 is a process---and perhaps another question for another day!)</p>
<p>Whenever Adobe, Norton et al programs ask me to "restart" the computer for the changes to take effect I lose the browsing session.&nbsp; I seem to poorly remember that the words under the Tools menu: "Reopen last browsing session" would be black and not greyed
 out when I returned to IE.&nbsp; But in IE 11 they are greyed out!&nbsp; I read the Microsoft pages on this issue, and made sure that the boxes in Internet Options/Advanced/Browsing for restoring sessions after crashes have always been checked as yes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is either: </p>
<p>1. Is there a method of retaining large numbers of pages open when the computer shuts down for the next time it opens again in IE 11?</p>
<p>Or, failing that, </p>
<p>2. Is there a program/app/etc that would accomplish this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I have to go into the "history" and pull down the menu for "today" and click on each and every line (pages visited today) that I want reopened again after making a brand new window in IE 11 for the site to be opened to... and then I lose the position
 in the long list of opened sites which pull down under each domain site name.&nbsp; Then I still have to search the list of opened pages within each "site" and find where I left off in reopening the list of pages--- (yes I'm aware that there is a "setting" somewhere
 for keeping all the tabs and sites open in History, but that just complicates things as they stay open and only by resetting and closing the whole IE 11 program does that particular setting "go away".... its sort of I'm caught between the rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Sorry for nixing a lot of your good suggestions before you can give them to me but I felt I wanted to let you know where my searches and efforts have reached dead ends before I began to consult with the Community).</p>
<p>Maybe this is something Microsoft can do for future IE versions?&nbsp; (the other guys---Apple--always have a option to reopen the entire browsing session from one two three days or even weeks ago just as you left it and I can use that on my "other" computer---just
 annoyed its not that way---or maybe it was? in earlier versions of IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading all my comments and notes about this issue!</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information....I'm a very very slow and cautious user of advice so its taking me a while to try out and test your suggestions...</p>
<p>I did choose the "easiest" option first from Rohit Nagpal's&nbsp;&nbsp; Method 1&nbsp; in jerrym's suggestion...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the Tracking Protection was disabled... and enabled it&nbsp; (wish there were instructions on the menu page how to operate this and not just hitting buttons until it turns on as the method for learning how to do these things!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed out of my IE 11 and opened it up right again aftger a wait time to make sure everything was settled down in computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The direct link on the Task Bar for IE 11 opened up to the "last browsing session" automatically!!&nbsp; But it was not my 25 other windows of searches..... it was just my last 4-5 windows I had open with the Microsoft Community Question--and your (2 Community
 members') suggestions that I opened up to read each of the hyperlinks.&nbsp; That is all!&nbsp; My other searches had vanished and the "Reopen last browsing session" was of course grayed out again as it had done its job this time like I remembered it used to do....</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then over the past year or so, I learned something new in Windows 7 which is I always open new IE 11 explorer windows using the UAC: "Run as administrator" setting, so I right clicked the new (2nd icon) of the IE that appears in the taskbar and lo! and
 behold!&nbsp; (old English phrases) the "Reopen last browsing session" was black!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I immediately clicked on it and got back one..&nbsp; That's right one, just one of the 25 other windows of searches....&nbsp; OK, I thought maybe I have to open more windows using the UAC method of running as administrator---but then each successive window that opened
 showed the "Reopen last browsing session" as greyed out... so it was a one time, one window/site one shot deal (I don't evne know why IE 11 happened to have chosen that particular one to open for me...&nbsp; It was no different than others --it was not open or
 selected when I closed the IE 11, it was minimized just like every other window except your Microsoft Community and its associated answers/hyperlinks I was investigating how to choose to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other interesting thing here ...&nbsp; I discovered about and read what is "Tracking Protection" and decided to turn it on---it was never turned on.&nbsp; I don't think that had anything to do with it as its in the top menu under Tools, but it looks good to use
 and I thank you for pointing it out to me when I enabled the other setting hidden under the advanced tab.&nbsp; I'm busy now learning all about Tracking Protections Lists (yes I understand Microsoft does not regulate or recommend such lists all are user risk etc
 as to if they work or not)--- but I appreciate Microsoft's writing about it---wish it was more detail than the one FAQ link on that page before I choose a list to try out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to get back to Rohit Nagpal's&nbsp; 2 questions:</p>
<br />
</span></span><span><span>
<p>1. Do the "Reopen last browsing session option" always greyed out?</p>
<p>Yes, unless computer&nbsp; gives&nbsp; BSOD or I purposely crash the IE---- that brings it back of course as black and restores all 25 +- windows,&nbsp; but I knew I had to write to your Community as purposely crashing a plane to get it to land it is not the way I want
 to fly!&nbsp; Right?</p>
<p>2. Which anti-virus is installed on the computer? NIS Norton Internet Security 2014 just reinstalled it this past week to correct some other "problems" that now does not need to be asked here as they went away, leaving just the "Reopen last browsing session"
 as a continuing problem to be solved.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Robert Aldwinckle on forumns' suggestions: I'm not 100% familiar with many of the terms used in your (and other's) replies in that thread you replied to, so I'm reseaching what these terms mean and how to apply them to "toggle" it on/off as you suggested...&nbsp;
 just to let you know I read your posting and appreciate it also and always learning something new in computers..</p>
<p>
</p><p>(and yes, as your thread had one person commenting):&nbsp; How difficult is it for someone to actually try out these things on a real world, non-perfect Microsoft company owned computer and see what is going on out here...&nbsp; Please have some beta testers doing
 the work---I'd volunteer, but I'm pretty slow, so others really have to step up and take the lead so Microsoft can develop and perfect these complicated codes for all their products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for reading all of this, everyone.&nbsp; I'm sending this now so you know I'm on the case and will try the other suggestions too.&nbsp; (not certain what the Reset Internet Explorer Settings are yet, but will save that one for last if the others do not
 work as it appears I might have to research what things I might lose if I use that option)...</p>

            <p>Thank you Basith M for responding to my inquiries....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been wanting to write more about what happens but it just complicates the issue....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your two methods in your July 14, 2014 posting, I've checked out and searched and Its not "my" computer so Method 2 of ceating a new user account "forever" may not be able to be done as its already just one account and really difficult to get the computer
 to recognize the "administrator" most times.... just found that easy method of UAC opening up IE 11 pages on a prior question to Community Forums (may not have been Microsoft's Forum).... that allowed me to do this....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Method 1 does not seem to cover my crashes or sources as they seem to be other programs (older 16 bit) programs I imported from older computer disks.... WHY?? Because again lack of money and the actual owner of this computer refuses to pay a single penny
 more for any help or programs.... so I'm stuck using programs from older computers already purchased with older product keys... can't upgrade to newer Windows 7 ones as that costs "money" again which is not allowed to be spent on this computer as it took away
 lots of money and not returning any back in what it does (or doesn't it do)....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I followed the prior suggestions to use "Tools" "Manage Add Ons" "Tracking Protection" and "Enabled personal list"....</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>.....today when I lost IE 11 due to crash for having "too" many windows open, loss of memory warnings, "Exceptions" screens that go by so quickly I can't copy them (would be nice if there was info in the "memory dump" area others have told me to visit and
 post online for analysis... cbc? or ccb? has some code for the run box..... but I've been there and these messages do not get saved!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Back to today's problem.. when I lost IE 11 a warning notice suddenly appeared (never saw that type before----on black screen closing program screen I think it is) ----warning that 11 web pages have been lost!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I checked to see if all the settings were ok upon restarting computer and restarting IE 11 and yes personal list was enabled...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>YET NOT ONE web page was restored!! All my opening new IE pages whether directly or using UAC as admisistrator showed the greyed out line under Tools: "reopen last browsing session"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The web pages that I lost (I had more than 25 windows open at same time.... were really lost... and they seems to have been all the work and research I was doing from tabs of links provided here at the Microsoft community screen items! (in case that was
 not clear... for my one quesiton I've asked here "Restore last browsing session in IE 11 does not work like prior....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OK, I then opened up a new IE 11 browser page using UAC method...</p>
<p>
</p><p>.........and then I went to the upper right corner of IE page: "Star symbol" and "history" but NO MICROSOFT history!! No "support Microsoft" history no "Microsoft community" history.... all were (as I was warned but not able to do anything about it) lost
 and rest of history seems to be ok, but again</p>
<p>I had to reopen slowly all of my jobs and site searches and work I have not completed and sign back into all the places that need to be signed in.... slowly and just finished doing it now.... about 12 noon here and spending rest of time researching and reading
 your reply to my prior message which I did not see until I signed back into Microsoft Community again....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know I'm not being cooperative with trying to follow your advice... but I'm unsure what I'm doing, its not my computer.... I can't ask anyone for help... no one is willing to do this all for free and no one else here is willing to put money back into the
 computer... (the hardware company charges $200 per year for help, and the computer's software section (covering windows 7 errors) charges $300 per year... that's $500 so far and Microsoft has some $149 charge for just&nbsp; three questions deal going on since Windows
 7 has been supplanted by Windows 8 and 8.1 so now its no longer "free" support but charge as you go per question (and of course as you see here I have multiple questions.. not just "one time" one charge but still can't input more money into this unit....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I do have Anti-virus working---each year its a struggle to explain why more money has to be spent to get the latest virus definitions and several free malware and spyware programs... all my anti-virus etc programs say the computer is "empty" of all such
 items except for some reoccurring tracking malware called "sweetpacks" "sweatpea" I don't have screen in front of me... and those get quarinteed and removed when I encounter them....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can't figure out what to do (other places say empty cache and delete history and that would just ruin all the work I do as I can't just keep making more bookmarks for temporary web pages I visit on a day to day week to week basis.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you everyone for reading this far and trying as best as you can to help me!</p>

<p>Thank you for replying to my long typed message...</p>
<p>Great!&nbsp; I did not know about "sfc /scannow"&nbsp; I will keep that command for future use as needed.</p>

<p>I ran the operation as an "administrator" as requested.</p>

</p><p>FWIW I just discovered that I&nbsp;may be&nbsp;back in the bug state.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. in&nbsp; About:Tabs Reopen old tabs&nbsp; shows tabs but&nbsp; Reopen last session&nbsp; is not available.&nbsp; I really don't use the feature that much to pay attention to when this happened but I will try to remember
 to use the workarounds discussed in that thread to get it going again.&nbsp; Ever since that thread I had been using the feature with it the option off, e.g. I had only set it on to confirm that it was working and then set it off and retested to confirm that the
 Reopen last session would still work even though its tabs would not be opened automatically.&nbsp; (That was a relief.)&nbsp; So I still imagine that as a repair for my case setting it on and then off (toggling it) will be a sufficient repair.&nbsp; TBD.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>1.Please refer to this thread to convert mailboxes to mail-enabled users in Exchange 2010. For your reference the link:
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/464e9b33-716c-4b42-a286-ec8f653efb92/convert-mailbox-to-a-mail-user?forum=exchange2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/464e9b33-716c-4b42-a286-ec8f653efb92/convert-mailbox-to-a-mail-user?forum=exchange2010</a>.</p>
<p>Actually this kind of issue is related to the Exchange on premise which we’re not familiar with. If you have concerns regarding this in the future, we’d like to suggest you post in our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?category=exchangeserver%2Cexchange2010%2Cexchangeserverlegacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange On Premise Forum</a> for dedicated assistance.</p>
<p>2. For the attributes related issue, after we remove all the Exchange servers, the Exchange related attributes will still be stored in the user's attributes in the on-premises AD but we're not able to view/edit them. That's why we suggest you keep at least
 one Exchange server in the on-premises for management purpose.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Brook</p>

<p>Doing some research.</p>
<p>Are we able to set a limit in OneDrive for business instead of default everyone having a whooping 5TB?</p>
<p>If so how?</p>

<p>Hi SArnst19. Yes you can set a limit through PowerShell see <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/07/16/new-it-management-controls-added-to-onedrive-for-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Baker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If by any chance you we're able to back up these music files into the cloud, try to login to
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive, </a>
and check if the music files are there. You can also use a card reader, and insert the SD card into a PC, now check if the files are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it works.</p>
