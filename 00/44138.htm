            Hello

We're sorry for the trouble this has caused. 

A red X means a file is out of sync.

Are you able to login to Online Onedrive at&nbsp;https://onedrive.live.com&nbsp;through a browser, same problem?

Can you try to log out of OneDrive app windows 10 and then log back in? To do that right-click the OneDrive icon in the lower right of the taskbar near the clock, go to more, then settings, then Account and then select unlink this PC.

Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.  

Regards       
        </p>

            If you are facing OneDrive problems on your Windows 10 PC, carrying out a full reset of the OneDrive client may help you fix most of the issues. Let us see how to reset OneDrive settings to default values. 
<br />
<br />Type Run in Start search and hit Enter to open the Run box. 
<br />
<br />Next, copy-paste the following and hit Enter to reset OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset 
<br />You will see the OneDrive icon in the notification disappear and then reappear again. 
<br />
<br />Later, you can try to install the last version for OneDrive for Windows 10 in the following link below: 
<br /><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/</a> 
<br />
<br />If you already have the latest version, the installer setup will end automatically. 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key, search for OneDrive and then open the OneDrive desktop app. 
<br />
<br />Feel free to contact us for any further assistance. We will be happy to help you.
<br />
<br />Thank you very much for using Microsoft products.

<h2>            If I Turn Off My Monitor, All Icons Move Back To The Left &#40;Win 10&#41;</h2>
                    Have seen similar issues posted but not this specific one...<br />
<br />
Brand new Windows 10 Pro (64 bit) Dell Desktop.<br />
<br />
Replaced old XP system (which ran like a swiss watch).<br />
<br />
If I turn off the monitor (which I do every night as I need the computer on 24/7) when I turn it on all the desktop icons have moved back to the left.<br />
<br />
This DOES NOT happen on a reboot or a shut the computer down and turn it on.<br />
<br />
Medium icons, all power saving is turned off, auto arrange icons and align icons to grid are both unchecked.<br />
<br />
I am not at all computer savvy...be gentle and help this old guy!

<h2>            Cursor moving around rapidly and out of control</h2>
                    a few hours ago i spilled a little water on my touchpad. At first the cursor behavior wasn’t very severe it just moved around randomly whenever i touched it. Now it is moving rapidly across my screen out of my control, it also randomly clicks on this like
 it has a mind of its own. I tried restarting but that didn’t work. What should I do

            Hi Christopher
<br />
<br />You need to dry out your laptop, some of that fluid has entered the circuitry on your laptop and is causing an electrical short . . .
<br />
<br />Turn your laptop upside down (keyboard and screen facing down)
<br />
<br />Then, either store that is a warm dry place like a hot press or above a heater that is set to low and leave it like that for maybe 4 - 5 hours
<br />
<br />PLEASE NOTE: do not place your laptop above direct heat that is strong enough to melt or damage your laptop - it should just be a warm environment!

            Hello my name is Brad and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I wanted to assist my colleagues on fixing your issues with your touchpad. 
<br />If you have a can of compressed air available, you can blow air into your laptop and allow to completely dry an hour or two in a room that is NOT humid. 
<br />A quicker way to dry the laptop is to:
<br />1. Shutdown the laptop. 
<br />2. Remove the battery if possible, if not it's okay. 
<br />3. Use a Hair Dryer SET TO THE LOWEST POSSIBLE WARM SETTING and blow warm air through the vent holes, as well as directly pressing the dryer's opening against the keyboard to force warm air through the air gaps. 
<br />4. Then allow the laptop to sit in a location with good airflow (in front of a fan or a/c vent). 
<br />5. If using my or my colleague's method doesn't help and you have to have your laptop service PLEASE CHECK your laptop's warranty to be sure that it covers "water damage" as many standard warranties do not. 
<br />When you have a moment please give me an update on your laptop's condition.

 because the folder is on an external hard drive and I might use it on different computers.&nbsp; Can anybody help me with this? Any help is great.

<p>Hi Red,<br />
<br />
The issue that you’ve encountered decrypting the folder on your device may be caused by some configuration or files mismatched. To sort out your concern, we’d like to know to following information:
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which program are you using to encrypt the folder?</li><li>After encrypting the folder, were there any changes that happened?</li><li>Which antivirus are you using?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
We’re looking forward to your response.<br />
<br />
</p>
        </p>

<p>I was using Win10's own encryption by ticking "encrypt content to secure data" in properties.</p>
<p>The system told me to backup my keys but I canceled it.</p>
<p>i was using Sophos anti virus software because my school network requires it.</p>

            Since you’re using an antivirus, we suggest that you temporarily disabled it, and then try to decrypt the folder. This is to verify if the issue is not related to the program. The program may have blocked the process since the changes are related to the
 security. On the other hand, you may re-enable the antivirus once you’re done decrypting the folder. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Keep us updated about your concern for additional assistance.<br />

<h2>            KB2887069 - portcls.sys</h2>
                    <p>I believe there may be either misinformation on <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2887069/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB2887069</a>&nbsp;or a problem with the patch itself. Using ConfigMgr 2012 OSD to deploy Win8x64 Enterprise the patch installs clean via the native online patching process but fails to update portcls.sys to the version documented in the article above (6.2.9200.16726).
 Instead the system is left with an older version 6.2.9200.16433. I can uninstall and reinstall the patch but the result is the same.</p>

 que hable al SAT para que lo cambien, ahora vengo aqui a cerciorarme de que esto lo puedo hacer efectivo en la garantía, gracias.</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x80820002</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased my Xbox One console early fall 2014. When I first began playing with it, I would occasionally get the error code pop up. Due to the small frequency, it never really bothered me to report it. However, recently, the issue has gotten much worse.
 My games and blu-rays will not start at all. I even just sat in front of my Xbox One for a solid 20 minutes trying to get Tomb Raider to start, just to keep getting the error message. I tried the 'solutions' provided in other posts, but none of them have worked.
 Not only that, but it seems the drive issue is something else that many other people have dealt with. It's very upsetting that I paid good money for such a faulty product.</p>
<p>That being said, does anyone know if Microsoft is fixing these issues? Or will I have to dish out more money and hope I don't get another faulty product?</p>

Please upload the dmp files from the folder C:\Windows\Minidump to your Skydrive [1] (copy the dmp files first to your desktop, if you can't upload them) and post a link here, so that I can look at the dumps, to see which driver causes the<strong><span><span>Bug

    <title>Surface not turning on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sleepingknight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface not turning on</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Surface Windows RT 8.1 back in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, I had some battery issue or it could be a charger issue, i'm not really sure.
</p>
<p>Whenever I tried to plug the charger in, the light of the charger will start to blink. I didn't know what that means but after disconnecting and reconnecting it back, the blinking light will just stay on like normal and my Surface will charge as usual.
</p>
<p>The problem in hand now is my Surface is not turning on and the light of the charger is shining but not blinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this means the battery is dead completely or I have an issue on the charger?&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your information, I've been charging my Surface for more than 2 hours now but it is still not turning on. &nbsp;Just a moment ago, I realised a description behind the box which states "Battery has limited recharge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced
 by an authorised service provider." &nbsp;Does this means the battery is completely dead and I would need to send my Surface back to Microsoft to replace the battery?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft has NEVER replaced a battery, regardless of what the box states. They only exchange for
</p>
<p>refurbs. And if you have an original Surface RT, even if Microsoft had any refurbs in stock, it would not
</p>
<p>be worth the money to do get a refurb for the RT device. Microsoft also doesn't sell replacement
</p>
<p>chargers any more for this device. You can try your luck with a third party charger from Amazon - pick
</p>
<p>the one with the best ratings if you go this route

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But chances are, your RT is dead.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to be so negative, but there really aren't any good options here.

</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked your Skype account associated with the email you used to sign in to the community and found out that your UK subscription is already cancelled from your Skype account. In this case, it would be best to repurchase the said subscription for
 you to use it again. You may open this link:&nbsp;https://secure.skype.com/en/calling-rates/ to purchase UK subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reply!</p>

<h2>            broadcom network adapter 802.11g stopped working after trying to fix &#39;unknown device&#39; in Device Manager</h2>
                    <i>It may be a coincidence but my Broadcom network adapter 802.11g stopped working after trying to fix 'unknown device' in Device Manager (It was working perfectly before this).</i>
<div><i>OS: Windows 7 Starter on 'BenQ Joybook Lite U105'. I tried the Windows Network trouble shooter and it&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;work (saying there may be a problem with the driver. I uninstalled the driver and&nbsp;re-installed&nbsp;it (including a possibly newer one) and it&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;work.
 Within 'Network Connections" the Broadcom wireless adapter is shown as 'disabled' I &nbsp;R-clicked to enable it, a window popped up saying it was enabled but it still showed as being disabled. My feeling is that something is preventing it from being enabled, logically,
 I would guess. Also went to 'Component Services' and ether started or restarted&nbsp;everything&nbsp;with the word network on it still no &nbsp;luckAny suggestions? My&nbsp;Google&nbsp;search on an other pc , now on day 3,&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;find anything. (BTW the 'unknown device' which according
 to the icon, seems to be the joybook itself, is still not fixed and still listed as 'unknown device').</i></div>

<p>That's because a file with the extension .ts is a type of video file as far as windows is concerned. You would need to un-associate the file extension .ts with the Film and TV app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is posted as an answer for a previous question.</p>
<p><span>OK here is how to un-associate a file extension to unknown . . . Right click your Desktop, choose 'New' - Text Document When the document opens, you need to save the document with a .bat file extension Click File - Save As At the bottom of
 the save as dialog, change 'Save as Type' to 'All Files' Manually enter the file name XXX.bat Now right click any file you want to disassociate and choose 'Open with' - 'Choose another app' -' More Apps' Check the box marked 'Always use this app' Scroll to
 the bottom and click 'Look for another app on this PC' Navigate to the XXX.bat on your Desktop and select that Finally delete XXX.bat from your Desktop and restart your system The file association will be reset to unknown .

    <title>Desktop suddenly won&#39;t connect to any sort of wireless network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop suddenly won&#39;t connect to any sort of wireless network</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 desktop I've had for a year or two. It's always had some problems, mainly a startup problem that involves a black screen with a blinking cursor in the top left hand corner - I figured out a workaround, though, but it only works part of
 the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, today, my desktop decided it wasn't going to connect to WiFi anymore. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I thought what was happening was a regular thing at first - WiFi wouldn't connect, it was probably a problem with the router, so I'd go to the router (downstairs), reset it, mess around with it, go back to the desktop and it'd be a-okay after a few
 minutes. When I saw my desktop wasn't connected to the WiFi, like normal, I did just that. Nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't feel like figuring it out so I switched to my mobile hotspot - when the WiFi is being slow or just not working, I always resort to that, and it's always worked. So, I turn it on, and try to connect it - doesn't work. It simply doesn't connect. It's
 not like it <em>does </em>connect, but it just doesn't give any internet, no, it refuses to connect at
<em>all.</em></p>
<p>After a few more trials, I conclude that it's a problem with the desktop, and not with the WiFi or anything - the other desktop downstairs connected by Ethernet works like a charm, and connecting my phone to the WiFi yields no problems as well. So, I focus
 on the actual desktop. I turn it on and off, which, by the way, is a pain because of the startup problems with the black screen and blinking cursor, and when it finally turns back on nothing's changed. I go into wireless settings, forget all networks, try
 to reconnect and entering the password, but to no avail. Resetting all network settings (which restarts the computer) did absolutely nothing as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something weird happened in the midst of all that, though. Among the wireless connection list was the name of my regular WiFi, and then the number "2" after it - so, if my WiFi was named ATTg298d, it'd be ATTg298d 2. I messed around with it, and it wouldn't
 connect for a while, but at one point, it was suddenly connected - but it gave no internet. So, I disconnected and continued trying to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that brings me here. I've called GeekSquad for their thoughts, and all they told me was what I had already tried. I don't know what else to do, and it's extremely frustrating because of all the homework I do on that desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p><strong><span>Hi ljdaniels,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
1. Which operating system are you using?<br />
2. Which antivirus or any other security software are you using on the computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The error code actually denotes that the operation could not be completed due to file system limitation.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may check if the anti-virus or firewall is blocking the updates to be performed. You may refer to the below provided
 links and check if these assist you resolve the issue -</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you temporarily disable any security software for troubleshooting then do not forget to enable it after the troubleshooting gets
 complete.</span></span></p>

<p>from what ive gathered on other threads etc the error code&nbsp; 80072EFD means a problem wi internet connection.</p>
<p>so ive tried disabling mcafee, and all other firewalls/antiviruses that may be lurking (windows firewall/defender was all i had on my pc) but still getting same error message even tho internet is working fine and dandy.</p>
<p>i can tell you aswell that the last time i had any updates installed was 31/03/2009 and the most recent check was 01/04/09.</p>

<div>Is there a was to manually uninstall a Windows 8 <i>Metro</i> app or at least a way to reinstall one?&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just downloaded and installed the official version of Win8 Pro. I had this same issue with my Skydrive windows 8 app which displayed only a blue tile without a SkyDrive logo. Upon clicking, as with the Netflix app above, opened the store and not the app.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't manage to uninstall but was able to reinstall through the store by opening the store going into "Your App" by either right clicking or pressing win+z. There I found the skydrive app and clicked on it. A menu pops up with the option to install. click
 that and it will take you to the skydrive app page where it says "You own this app" in the top right it should say installing (in my case) skydrive.. Hopefully this works for Netflix too. I haven't had any other Win8 apps corrupt themselves yet so this is
 my only case for reference. </p>
        </p>

            Hi Luis.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br /> You cannot interrupt Windows or Version Updates.  Chances are Windows is now scrambled and you may need to reinstall.   I'll give you steps to determine this for sure.  First here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  This link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />

<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>This installation specialist does not know what he is talking about. I tried everything that is suggested and none of these work. I am really frustrated! I have not had my computer for about 4 days now because of an unwanted update. FIRST, I should be asked
 if I want this update, not automatically apply it to my computer. I stopped it so many times but I didn't get a chance to the other day and now I have a non-working computer that just keeps cycling through saying "<span><span>attempting
 to recover installation then it will say restoring previous version." It just keeps doing that over and over and never get past that to start up.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I am unable to do any of these so-called suggestions.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to get the computer in safe mode, it does pop up briefly some f functions and what each does and I tried pressing each of those functions and it does nothing but the cycle screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think they just want everyone to go out and buy a new computer. Mine is not very old and I really cannot afford another one since I have other bills and payments that I need to take care of. I would take my computer to a repair shop but that is like buying
 a new one almost the way some places charge and on top of everything else, if I cannot get this computer to work, I just lost everything! Thanks so much stupid Microsoft and your unwanted Windows update!</p>

<p>
</p><p>There are no product codes since this was purchased through the store as an in-place.</p>
