                    I can not connect my ATT Tilt to windows XP with active sync 4.5 via USB cable.<br />
<br />
i hadnt synced my phone for a month, so i decided it was about time. i connect via USB, and i get nothing. not even a little sound saying a device was connected. the phone charges but thats it.&nbsp; the computer doesnt recoginze the phone is connected, and i receive
 no error<br />
<br />
the odd thing is that it worked fine a month ago. i havent installed/uninstalled anything on my phone. on my computer i have installed Microsoft virtual pc, and picassa no other software has changed.
<br />
<br />
i have uninsatlled/re-installed ActiveSync.&nbsp; i have tried, muliple computers, multiple USB ports, multiple wires. I did a hard reset (set factory default) on the phone. i have also check/unchecked the "enable advanced network functionality" box.<br />
<br />
any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; <br />

<p>PS....</p>
<p>I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>D3 reflects the number of values in B2:B10 greater than C2 and less than or equal to C3 (&gt;70 and &lt;=80).</blockquote>
<p>Note that I wrote "&gt;70 and &lt;=80", whereas the FREQUENCY help page says "71-79", which would be "71-80" with the bin limits in your example.</p>
<p>I am right, and the help page is wrong.</p>
<p>That fact can be confirmed by selecting two cells and entering the following array formula (remember:&nbsp; ctrl+shift+Enter):&nbsp; =FREQUENCY({70,70.5,80},{70,80}).&nbsp; Note that the second result from FREQUENCY is 2.</p>
<p>I might also note that because it truly is "&gt;70 and ...", FREQUENCY might give unexpected, but correct results if you format data cells as Number with 0 decimal places, and the actual data value is between 70 and about 70.4999 (really about 70.49...9 to
 15 significant digits).</p>
<p>As always, you need to be mindful of the difference between displayed and actual values.</p>

<blockquote>How is the frequency below working?</blockquote>
<p>Your data seems to come from the Excel offline help page, but you made some changes that are inconsistent with the description of the results.&nbsp; That might be confusing you.</p>
<p>Suppose the data are in B2:B10 (79, 85, 78, 85, 50, 81, 95, 88, 97).&nbsp; And suppose your "bins" (really, the bin limits) are in C2:C4 (70, 80, 90).</p>
<p>To use FREQUENCY, select __4__ unused cells -- say, D2:D5 -- and enter the following array formula:</p>
<p>=FREQUENCY(B2:B10, C2:C4)</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; Enter an array formula by pressing ctrl+shift+Enter instead of simply Enter.&nbsp; If you make a mistake, select the entire range, press F2, edit the formula as needed, then press ctrl+shift+Enter.&nbsp; If you want to change the number of cells for the result
 of FREQUENCY, I think you need to select the original range, delete the formula, then select the new range and enter the array formula.</p>
<p>With your data, coincidentally FREQUENCY will return 1, 2, 4 and 2 into D2:D5, as in the help page.&nbsp; But the interpretation is slightly different from the help page description, which you copied, because your bin limits are different.</p>
<p>D2 reflects the number of values in B2:B10 less than or equal to the bin limit in C2 (&lt;=70).&nbsp; D3 reflects the number of values in B2:B10 greater than C2 and less than or equal to C3 (&gt;70 and &lt;=80).&nbsp; D4 reflects the number of values in B2:B10 greater than
 C3 and less than or equal to C4 (&gt;80 and &lt;=90).&nbsp; D5 reflects the number of values in B2:B10 greater than C4 (&gt;90).</p>
<p>Note that in B2:B10, there is 1 value &lt;= 70 (50), 2 values &gt;70 and &lt;= 80 (78, 79), 4 values &gt; 70 and &lt;= 90 (81, 85, 85, 88), and 2 values &gt;90 (95, 97).</p>
<p>The important thing to note is:&nbsp; the values in the "bins" array contains the __upper__ limit for each bin; i.e. for each cell in the FREQUENCY result.&nbsp; Thus, the count in each FREQUENCY result is the count of the data less than or equal to the corresponding
 bin limit (and greater than the previous bin limit).</p>
<p>A common use of FREQUENCY is creating data for a histogram (chart).&nbsp; For that purpose, rather than have a mysterious 4th FREQUENCY result that is simply greater than the previous bin limit (using your example), I prefer to have 4 elements in the "bins" array,
 where the last element (C5) is the formula:&nbsp; =MAX(B2:B10).&nbsp; Then the FREQUENCY array formula would be (still selecting D2:D5):&nbsp; =FREQUENCY(B2:B10,C2:C5).</p>

<h2>            Digest emails appearing as .ezm attachments instead of inline on outlook.com</h2>
                    I subscribe to several mailing lists that send email as a daily digest. These digest emails appear as inline text in every email client in the universe, except outlook express and therefore outlook.com, where they appear as a bunch of .ezm attachments.
 Before the outlook.com rebranding, they used to appear fine as inline text on the old hotmail/live client. Because of this the digest emails are unusable as one must click on each and every attachment to read it, which gets highly annoying. Is this bug in
 outlook expected to be fixed?

    <title>Migrate Calendar from SharePoint 201 to SPO - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Migrate Calendar from SharePoint 201 to SPO</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are trying to migrate our old SharePoint calendar from SharePoint 2010 to SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>It appears that the only way I can do this is to connect both of the calendars to my Outlook client and copy the entries one by one. As this is a company 'time off' calendar, there are quite a lot of entries and this will take me days - it also does not
 automatically set them to the status that they were, approved, denied etc.</p>
<p>I know I can probably do this by exporting them to Excel, make some manual changes and import the spreadsheet, but when I export to Excel, I do not get the entire calendar but the month that I am on. More hands on work to export each month and import, but
 I am hoping that there is a more practical and less hands-on way to do this.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jarrod</p>

<p>hi jarrod,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to migrate sharepoint calendars, currently, the officially recommended way is using outlook client as

                    <p>My PowerPoint presentation is in 4:3 format and I want to run it on a 16:9 TV screen. When I change the Page Layout to the 16:9 format, all the graphics on all the slides get stretched widthways to fill the&nbsp;screen (text is not affected).</p>
<p>How do I alter the background screen to fill the 16:9 aspect ratio, but maintain the graphics sizes as in the prior format?</p>

            Actually, there *is* another solution, albeit a commercial one. &nbsp;I wrote an add-in to deal with this problem quickly.
<div><br />
<div>PPTools ReSize</div>
<div>http://www.pptools.com/resize/</div>
<div><br />
<div>The free demo works on up to five slides; the purchased/registered version lifts that restriction, of course.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But there are other approaches beyond copy/pasting. &nbsp;The link I included in my previous reply points to a page with several other useful ways of getting the job done. &nbsp;</div>

                    <p>Hi I hope someone can help me,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently opened a new email account to deal with work based emails only. I tried signing in the other day and forgot my password. I have tried to reset my password but since opening my account my contact details have changed, therefore the mobile number
 that outlook wanted to send a code to is no longer in use. I continued with the process selecting that I don't have a code. I had to fill out a form regarding recent emails, folders, senders, etc. But as this is a new account I haven't sent any emails, set
 up any folders, or done anything with this account yet! Due to this outlook is throwing out the message that there is not enough information on the form. But I have no information to fill out or any other options on this page!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone help, as I've said it is a work email account and want to try and use it ASAP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Natalie.</p>

<h2>            Removing the Restrict Formatting and Editing panel</h2>
                    We created several form documents in Word 10 and it works fine. &nbsp;The problem is that when our users open the document the Restrict Formatting and Editing panel pops up on the screen. &nbsp;It annoys my users and I cannot find any switch/option that keeps that
 from happening. &nbsp;The only way that the users can get rid of it is to close that panel. &nbsp;Is there a way to keep it from opening and the users can simply enter data into the form?

<h2>            Why does my &#34;new&#34; outlook look like a cell phone view&#63;</h2>
                    So I had one of the hotmail accounts that was automatically switched to outlook.&nbsp; I am not happy about it but since I have no choice.....I am trying to deal :)&nbsp; There is something wrong with the "new" outlook email account.&nbsp; It has no icons nor pic box
 that the customer service person from Microsoft said it should have.&nbsp; That is why she referred me to this site to get some help.&nbsp; With out the icons on the top right, I can't really do anything.&nbsp; I can hardly use this account with the bareness and lack of
 any icons.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I tried to download something someone emailed me, it said this mobile devise may not have capabilities to download, as though I was using my cell phone to check my email.&nbsp; But this was from my desktop!&nbsp; What do I do?&nbsp; How do I get the correct
 version/format of outlook going so I can use it properly again?&nbsp; I am already frustrated that it is no longer hotmail, and now this is really frustrating as well.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

                    I have set up Office 365 with Outlook 2013. Now&nbsp; I just notice that in my emails at the bottom there is a note that says "this is a test".&nbsp; I can find a way how to delete that message of the bottom of my emails. Can someone please advice.<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />

            <p>Sounds like a signature.&nbsp; Is this an Outlook.com account or what type of account is it?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signatures in Outlook are in File, Options - there is a Signature button on the Mail page. If there isn't a signature, what type of antivirus do you use? Some programs add a message to the bottom-&nbsp; usually saying the message was scanned.

            This is an Outlook account. I looked in the Signatures section, and there is nothing that I can erase in the section. We do have antivirus, but the message that I see when I click on an email message doesn't have to do anything with the virus. The message
 says " This is a test" <br />

            So you had the gmail account in outlook and messages sent from outlook had the gmail signature added? I knew it saved a copy of sent messages but don't think I'd want it also adding signatures.

<p>I have looked at them and tried it but nothing seems to be solving this problem. Also as I bought the phone of ebay a couple of months ago, does this mean I can use the paypal invoice as proof of purchase if I have to take it to&nbsp;Nokia Repair Centre?</p>

<p>That's because it is easy for them to shift the blame to Microsoft. BLU knows very well why their devices get or don't get the update, because they're the ones who approved/rejected the updates.</p>

            <p>It is a mis-coordination between those two companies. Even if it is so then neither Microsoft nor blu should have promoted the device as a device compatable to windows 10 mobile. Both the companies readily promoted the device until you buy it after which
 they start blaming each other. This is the customer support they provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
These companies don't even provide relevant answers to my queries. Microsoft says that they don't provide support for other manufactures while blu customer support don't know a thing about windows phones. I had contacted them to ask for help to block calls,
 as there was no such option available on this silly device. They told me that the option is not available and I must download any third party app to do the same. Do they not know that third party apps cannot block calls and SMS on a windows phone, as this
 is an OS limitation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note : The update has now been launched.</p>
<p>we blu mobile users have been cheated the update is not actually coming for this device as per reports. Both Microsoft and BLU had promised that this device is upgradable and I believed those liers. To prevent the disclosure and to suppress the customers
 what they are doing is changing all information on their respective websites asif there was no report of any update. We want an answer. Well you can verify the facts here I created this link to mark the sufferings of a customer due to the business tricks of
 various trustless brands, on the link you will see the variations before and after the update in general. The data has been combined from various sources. :

<p>Hi MartGoss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my understanding, you cannot configure your student’s Office 365 account into Mail client on your cell phone and cannot connect to Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To look into the issue, I suggest you follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log that Office 365 account into Outlook Web App to see if you can successfully login.</li><li>If yes, I would like to confirm if you use Outlook for Mobile client in your cellphone and if you do use it, please choose the corresponding method in this

    <title>Trouble inserting PDFs as printout in OneNote Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giverson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble inserting PDFs as printout in OneNote Online</h2>
                    <p>A couple of weeks ago I logged into my online office 365 account and got onto the online version of OneNote, where I inserted several PDFs of powerpoints for a class. I had no trouble using the insert as printout option to insert these PDFs and was greeted
 with the bonus of having the printouts show up with decent quality as well as the removal of the gray border around each page/slide, therefore taking up less space and looking neater.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to go do the same today, it appeared that my PDFs would insert as a file attachment, but would not upload the printout when I tried that option. It would show the little document on the top and have a grey box where the printout was supposed
 to upload and both would have the loading wheel on them. They would inevitable just end up with a red X on the document. I'm not sure what changed in the past couple of weeks, but it's extremely frustrating because the online version syncs better than either
 app or desktop version I have, and I occasionally only have access to the online version, which I use to upload stuff so I can take notes on my iPad later. I tested it out on a couple of computers and had no luck no matter what.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            I would suggest that let's get it investigated by Onenote product team.
<br />
<br />I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to Technet forum also as there this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. On Technet, even Microsoft Product team will look into your issue.

            Hi Gio79,<br />
<br />
It’s not supported for external users to sync the OneDrive for Business library with the OneDrive sync client for Mac.<br />
<br />
Given the situation, we suggest you vote for your requirement to OneDrive UserVoice via
<a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/suggestions/7881969-allow-external-onedrive-for-business-users-to-sync" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Is it possible to create and share templates in Outlook 2010 that - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h0gwarts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to create and share templates in Outlook 2010 that contain building block entries&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Building Blocks exist in both Microsoft Word 2010 and Microsoft Outlook 2010.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The building blocks for each are kept in their normal templates: normal.dotm and normalemail.dotm, respectively.<span>&nbsp;
</span>C:\Users\##\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates</p>

<p>In addition, in Word 2010, building block galleries can be used from templates, such as Built-in Building Blocks.dotx.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These templates are kept in: C:\Users\##\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Document Building Blocks\1033\14</p>

<p>The advantage to these templates is that they can be edited independently of the Normal.dotm, and will survive if the Normal.dotm must be replaced for any reason.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They can also be shared between users without affecting their individual Normal.dotm.</p>
<p>Question: Is it possible to create and share a template containing building blocks usable in Outlook 2010, like it is in Word 2010, so that these entries are separate
 from the Normalemail.dotm, and can be distributed to several users?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If so, how would that template be created, and which folder in Appdata/Roaming would it be kept to be accessible to Outlook 2010?</p>

<p>Hi, in the 'save and distribute' section of the HA010208653.aspx posting it says:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <b>Save As</b> dialog box, from the <b>Save as Type</b> list, click
<b>Outlook Template</b> (Windows Vista) or <b>Trusted Templates</b> (Microsoft Windows XP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These options do not appear in Windows 7 (the only save as options are: txt, oft, msg. html. mht)
</p>
<p>Any other thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards</p>

<h2>            Please provide a consistent app experience that scales well depending on the screen type and provide an always on, always available, pre-owned media streaming solution</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First a little about myself.&nbsp; I studied industrial design, technical writing and architecture and have studied human design, interface design,&nbsp;and ergonomics and wanted to give you and many of the readers of this forum some of my thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To those not liking the current&nbsp;style of the start menu, just wait a bit.&nbsp; The overall style of the start menu will be more polished in the final version.&nbsp; Especially as the time comes when all of the icons match the smooth flat style of the rest of Windows..&nbsp;
 Only then will&nbsp;the interface not look so disjointed.&nbsp; In addition, I would like to see all of the icons from within Control Panel as well as all Explorer icons that are currently styled the Windows 7 and Vista way, to be restyled to match the rest of&nbsp;Windows
 10.&nbsp; The Continuum feature which is coming&nbsp;will fix the problem of mode switching for those with convertible devices such as Surface Pro's, Lenovo Yoga's, as well as other Laptop Tablet hybrids.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Quick Rant - Skip Over if You Like Apple and Android</span></strong></p>
<p>After reading a few messages, it seems like too many people reviewing this technical preview release prefer&nbsp;the archaic ideas of&nbsp;skeuomorphism and transparency (window glass), but this isn't 2005, it's almost 2015!&nbsp; Vista is dead and gone&nbsp;(for 10 years now!)&nbsp;and
 so is the original design of&nbsp;OS X with its glossy reflections, and its faux leatherette shadow of the past...&nbsp; Good riddance!!!!.... and long live Windows 10!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sidenote: Of course if Microsoft is inclined, they could add these old bygone design studies into Windows 10&nbsp;as an option to appease those users and give me and other minimalistic users&nbsp;an option to turn it off and we won't mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To both Techies and novices!&nbsp; I implore you to learn to embrace the crisp simple modern styles of today!&nbsp; I, for one, prefer this smooth flat style, because it is simple, uses less system resources, and matches all of my Windows devices including my Lumia
 1520 running Windows Phone 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To those naysayers of the Metro style:&nbsp;Microsoft knew what it was doing all along, because look who is copying their style????&nbsp; None other than the competitors!&nbsp; iOS 7 was a huge departure from the Skeuomorphism that Apple was pushing for all those years.&nbsp;
 Android Jellybean and later look like a cut and paste from the Metro style manual Microsoft published all those years ago when they released Windows Phone 7 to the public.&nbsp; Microsoft did set the trend this time around.&nbsp; The media and fanboys alike both pretend
 that they didn't, but both are ignorant, suckling at the teat of the Apple ecosystem which pays them and praises them for their ignorance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, please&nbsp;don't forget that the flat apps were brought to Windows in order to create a cohesive yet ground breaking&nbsp;ecosystem that works across devices unlike Microsoft's main competitors' ways of doing things (highly disjointed experiences that change
 greatly across devices, i.e. Chromebook OS vs Android or iOS vs OSX)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And also to those ranting for Microsoft to bring back&nbsp;Windows Media Center; that&nbsp;has been a &nbsp;dying,&nbsp;sucking on the end of an exhaust pipe&nbsp;product that doesn't fulfill most people's needs anymore.&nbsp; I remember trying to get everything working across my PC's
 allowing one to&nbsp;stream to the other.&nbsp; What a difficult mess!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Quick Poll....How many novice users even knew what Windows Media Center is or that it even existed?&nbsp; With Plex and Kodi (Xbox Media Center), the need for WMC has faded into oblivion.&nbsp; But even the afore-mentioned third-party&nbsp;apps don't revolutionize the
 way we use media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A new idea needs to emerge and evolve&nbsp;starting with the media consumption hubs of Xbox Video, Photos, and Xbox Music.&nbsp; These have so much potential and really should be basis for the new media center of the decade.&nbsp; I wouldn't combine these hubs into one
 app though as each needs its own separate feature set.&nbsp; My vision extends to each type of&nbsp;screen mentioned in the keynote&nbsp;and allows the end user to enjoy his / her own content on any device, anywhere, at anytime whether his computer at home is off or not,
 as all of his / her content will be stored on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now this utopia of digital streaming relies on broadband companies and mobile carriers to allow greater end user&nbsp;data allowances or data allowance exceptions for streaming data from a certified partner's services (Microsoft - who could then offer finances
 for&nbsp;infrastructure expansion to the mobile carrier or broadband company in exchange for a greater push for Microsoft device promotions in mobile carrier stores&nbsp;in a "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" kind of deal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Read on to learn more of my vision for the future of Microsoft's proposed always on, always ready, free cloud-based streaming&nbsp;service&nbsp;of pre-owned, as well as allowing for the purchasing of un-owned, as well as rented content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Media and the Cloud</span></strong></p>
<p>No one has created the ideal cloud experience yet, but I think Microsoft is very close!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All that&nbsp;I ask for is the ability to stream all of my pre-owned music and videos through the cloud to all of my devices including Windows Phone,&nbsp;XBOX One and Xbox 360 without an XBOX Music subscription, i.e. OneDrive Music Locker - a future proposed feature
 of OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once internet connections on a mainstream basis allow smooth 4k quality streaming video whether it is&nbsp;rented or purchased through an online store, no one will need or want&nbsp;cable television packages&nbsp;anymore.&nbsp; Furthermore, if people could get the same streaming
 services they get on their Xbox One on their laptop, they would have true unparalleled freedom to enjoy their content anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Mobile and Stationary Seamless Experiences</span></strong></p>
<p>Modern Windows is not just about legacy x86 apps anymore.&nbsp; It is about creating a seamless environment that travels across all of your devices, not a disjointed OS that looks one way on a tablet, another way on a laptop, another way on an Xbox,&nbsp;and yet another
 way on a phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Universal Windows apps with a centralized cloud storage for app data is where the utopia of software design is at.&nbsp; If close minded people keep proposing regressive ideas, no progress will ever be made!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a Windows Phone User, I am looking forward to seeing Cortana (Microsoft's answer to Apple's Siri)&nbsp;on the desktop, laptop, tablet,&nbsp;and on the Xbox.&nbsp; I am looking forward to the opportunity to make appointments with my voice that will automatically sync
 with&nbsp;the cloud across all of my devices in case I need to leave the office for a meeting.&nbsp; I want to set geo-fencing reminders from the desktop (Within Outlook and Windows Calendar) that follow my Lumia 1520 when I leave the office syncing through the cloud
 yet again.&nbsp; To those who do not know what geo-fencing is, it is the ability to set a reminder depending on how close you physically are to a given destination when mobile&nbsp;(i.e. remind me to pick up a gallon of milk when I get close to Kroger).&nbsp; Cortana would
 then remind me as soon as I got within a block of the grocery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know the following idea is a&nbsp;feature that&nbsp;the next version of OSX (Yosemite) will have, but I also want to be able to&nbsp;pick up my text messages on my desktop, laptop, and tablet where I left off in a grand return of the Messaging app from the first version
 of Windows 8.&nbsp; This app needs to be extensible allowing the user to add notifications and messages incoming from Skype, Microsoft Lync, Viber, Facebook, AIM, Google Talk, and ICQ.&nbsp; In fact, the Skype app really doesn't need to exist as all of one's Skype contacts
 could be incorporated into the People App.&nbsp; All that one needs is the backend service.&nbsp; If I were Microsoft, I would incorporate it into a global messaging app with video capabilities.&nbsp; I want to type responses to those text messages from my full sized keyboard
 on my desktop and laptop&nbsp;as well as receiving incoming voice calls from my Lumia 1520 over Wifi using my stellar Samson USB microphone for crisp and clear phone calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Xbox Video app should be extensible as well allowing plug-ins from Youtube, LiveLeak, Wimp.com, Daily Motion,&nbsp;9GAG, Vimeo, and other services as needed and approved by Microsoft.&nbsp; These extensions and / or media hubs&nbsp;should be allowed to be turned off
 in an enterprise environment on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft, I'm once again asking you to think of each consumption service as a Media Hub, much like what once was in Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if a user has any video needs, he / she would go to the video hub and be able to access 90% of anything he / she could think of from 90% of the most popular media consumption networks.&nbsp; This would prove the same for music and photos (focusing
 on&nbsp;viewing services only, i.e. Flickr, OneDrive &amp; Facebook).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now editing programs need to remain separate from&nbsp;the media hubs unless one wants to provide basic editing functions, (i.e. trimming music / sounds&nbsp;for ringtones or&nbsp;notifications, cropping photographs, quick fix settings&nbsp;for photos, printing photos, burning
 DVD's of video,&nbsp;trimming&nbsp;video's and so on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many different apps exist just for editing photos alone, that adding them all as extensions or even the popular ones as extensions would prove difficult to manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But all of these media hubs should all be searchable from the start menu / search app which will save the user the time of entering the app and then querying their search.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Revise Touch Interfaces for Desktop and Laptop Scalability</span></strong></p>
<p>Like others have mentioned before, I also dislike the PC Settings modern interface.&nbsp; If Control Panel could be reworked into a similar style, but&nbsp;without the large wasteful expanse of space&nbsp;used currently in Windows 8.1, on laptops and desktops, that would
 be ideal.&nbsp; The idea is to get the Windows experience to scale properly across touch and non-touch devices giving the proper experience on each device (i.e. large and simple works on tablets with small tolerances for accuracy, but the same touch-friendly design
 creates far too much mouse travel on a non-touch laptop or desktop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">CASE IN POINT</span></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>To summarize, I don't agree with the way Microsoft currently uses the store as it creates a lot of confusion for the consumer because most apps simply copy another apps functionality.&nbsp; It is all about developers, developers, developers, but it's
 even more about the users, users, users.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to educate its developers to create something truly unique instead of rehashing the same old tired ideas that the developers are used to creating on other platforms.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>This system was procured from</strong></em><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>the way that&nbsp;Microsoft's competitors are doing things.&nbsp; It is apparent that these app ecosystems (Stores) are creating the implied need for a large amount of diverse
 apps (all with vastly disjointed experiences) which can be unmanageable because it is highly difficult to find the one app the user is looking for once he / she owns over 50 different apps, many of which&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;similar&nbsp;tasks even to the point of exactly
 the same tasks as another app but re-boxing it and calling it different (because it's Adobe Photoshop Express&nbsp;instead of Instagram).&nbsp; As one of those users, I typically remember that one of my programs has a such and such function, but I can't remember which
 one it is and I cannot remember where to find that function because it's buried within one of my many photo apps that seem to share some functions and differ on other functions.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I know that this app ecosystem&nbsp;is a software company's most profitable revenue stream and that's commendable, but&nbsp;the way it's currently executed&nbsp;creates a large amount of digital noise that people must sift through to find what they really need
 in that moment.&nbsp; In fact it becomes such a large amount of noise, that I don't even mess with the apps much anymore in Windows 8.1.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>If one could incorporate the basis behind all of those media consumption apps as a plugin extension for the hubs I proposed earlier, you will create the pinnacle of simplification which people need in their busy lives today.&nbsp; And whatever is
 left in the store after the media consumption hubs are properly implemented,&nbsp;needs to be sifted through.&nbsp; All apps that duplicate another app's functions&nbsp;along with scam apps that use another app's name as its own need to go in the circular file in the sky
 and those developers need to be notified that what they are submitting is not unique enough from another developer's offering.</strong></em></p>
<p>
