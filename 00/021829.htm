<h2>            Where is Nokia E66 Manufactured&#63;</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
<br />
In Saudi Arabia we are getting Nokia E66 KOREA Manufactured. My Question is simple. Is it also avilable in FINLAND Manufacturing or only Korea. What is the Difference between korea and finland manufactured Handsets. Is anyone using E66 FINLAND Made?<br />
<br />
Please do not ignore as i am willing to buy E66 but curious about its MFG countries and the difference Between E66 FINLAND and E66 KOREA?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
ALi...

            hi ali,<br />
<br />
i have used E66 that is Made in Finland, and basically there is no difference at all.<br />
<br />
in fact mine has a huge problem because the camera was having what i call: "Inverted Camera Syndrome" although there is work around it, but still i was waiting for a software update to fix the problem, otherwise the E66 is a great device... the built is solid,
 no wobbling slider, it is very elegant, fast menu, great add ons in the box. I really dont think you have to fear anything from an E66 that is Designed in Finland but Assembled in Korea...

    <title>10586.107 update gone wrong - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            10586.107 update gone wrong</h2>
                    <p>Warning: there's really no point to this post other than for me to rattle off some details about the upgrade (and upgrade failure, and subsequent recovery) experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in a <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update/error-while-installing-1058671/03a5551b-bfba-400b-88e7-580d8988c5c8">
previous question</a>, I was never able to install update 10586.71 on my 950XL because of error code 0x80073712.&nbsp; Yesterday, when 10586.107 came out, I tried again and got the same error, then a different error one, 0x80070570, but after trying a couple more
 times&nbsp;the phone&nbsp;installed some other Fast Configuration Update, then 10586.107, then rebooted, went to gears, then turned off.&nbsp; Turned it back on, got the Microsoft logo, the Windows logo, gears, then a sad face and it turned back off.&nbsp; Tried several times,
 same thing.&nbsp; So - haul out the device recovery tool; while the phone was plugged in and the multi-GB firmware blob was downloading, the phone just kept cycling through the reboot-logo-logo-gears-sad-reboot-etc cycle.&nbsp; Finally got the firmware, installed it,
 and rebooted the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set up Wi-Fi, and got to the reset protection thing, which is cool except I had 2-factor authentication turned on, and of course no Authenticator app.&nbsp; Tried authenticating by SMS, but didn't receive the text (or couldn't see it).&nbsp; Turned off 2-factor authentication
 and got past that.&nbsp; Did a restore of the last backup that was available, which was&nbsp;several days old.&nbsp; Phone took &gt;1 hour to finally reinstall the ~100 Store items.&nbsp; Despite enabling SMS backup, text messages were not restored (this annoys me greatly).&nbsp; Start
 menu background was not restored and I think the color scheme is a different shade of blue than it used to be.&nbsp; E-mail accounts came back but lacked authentication, which I guess is OK.&nbsp; Ringtone and SMS tone&nbsp;were restored, but call block list was not (call
 block doesn't reliably block calls anyway, so&nbsp;no biggie there).&nbsp; Glance screen settings were not restored.&nbsp; 2 of the 3 clock alarms I had configured were restored.&nbsp; It looks like offline maps are being downloaded now, which is cool though slightly surprising
 since I've been on Wi-Fi for the last 12 hours, but I'm not complaining.&nbsp; I haven't gone through other settings or apps yet (I was really hoping to wait for the weekend to wipe the phone) so we'll see how settings came over (or not). I'm pretty sure I've never
 restored settings after wiping the phone so I don't really have a baseline for comparison but it's only been mildly painful so far.</p>

    <title>default value on a subform - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t848  say:</h3>
<h2>            default value on a subform</h2>
                    <p>I have a database that tracks flights of aircraft. The main table has the aircraft in it. I also have a subform that is linked back to the main form thru aircraft ID#.On the subform I would like for the new record to look up the previous ending_hobbs&nbsp; and
 place it in the start_hobbs reading on the new form. I have tried in the afterupdate something like this</p>
<p>Me. start_hobbs.defaultvalue = me. ending_hobbs. This seems to work till I close the file and reopen it. then it default value is some other reading on another form.</p>
<p>Thank</p>

<p>I (or we both) were getting confused about which controls are on which form. The mainform doesn't HAVE a control named [Flight_Number] - that's on the subform. And the AircraftIDTBL doesn't have a ending_hobbs field so it's not there to look up - that's
 in AviationTBL</p>
<p>The correct expression is</p>
<p>Me.[Aviationtbl subform].Form!Start_Hobbs.DefaultValue = """" &amp; DMax("ending_hobbs", "[AviationTBL]", "[Aircraft ID Number]='" &amp; Me.[Aircraft ID Number] &amp; "'") &amp; """"<br />

<p>Eric,</p>
<p>1. I just tried running the cache tool, and it fails. </p>
<p>2. We have tried repairing (and reinstalling using the Fix-It from #3 -- 3 times.</p>
<p>4. No other users have reported this specific erro.</p>
<p>5. You don't even need to be attempting to sync. I ended the OneDrive for Business application, and the prompt returns every 3-5 minutes.</p>

<p>Hi Nate,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Please try manually clearing the OneDrive for Business cache instead and let us know the results.</p>
<p>1. Kill all Office processes, such as groove.exe, msouc.exe, msosync.exe in Task manager.</p>
<p>2. Open Explorer, go to these folders below and delete all contents in them. It is acceptable if a few files cannot be deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;C:\Users\<em><strong>username</strong></em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\Spw</p>
<p>&nbsp;C:\Users\<em><strong>username</strong></em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\OfficeFileCache</p>
<p>Please note that, you would need to re-build all syncs of your libraries after going through the above steps.</p>
<p>We will move forward to discuss the situation based on the above.</p>
<p>Feel free to post back.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

    <title>Solver execution time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> renatorenai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solver execution time</h2>
                    <p>As I mentioned in another post, Solver in my system has considerably slowed down after having made modifications in my worksheet - as I cannot go back to the previous versions, I was wondering whether there is a way to locate particularly heavy processing
 - as an alternative, considering the size of the worksheet (15MB) I was considering moving to an external worksheet all parts unnecessary for the Solver computation, e.g. all graphics (or is there a way to stop updating certain parts of the worksheet until
 requested?</p>
<p>thanks for any hint</p>

<p>Hi Renato,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, could you share with us the following info? We want to identify if the issue is related to Excel version, installation or the file itself.
</p>
<p>1. Is the issue mainly/only related to this specific 15MB file? Or it occurs even in a simple test workbook?</p>
<p>2. Does the Solver function work well with the former 16.15 version of Excel for Mac? What do you mean by "cannot go back to the previous versions"? Do you mean revert back to former version of Office suite or the workbook?</p>
<p>3. What "modifications" do you make to that workbook? Do the former version of Excel work well with these similar modifications?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi Tim, thanks for the prompt answer</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I assumed that it happens only with my big worksheet, but I'll try to run an old version of the sheet and will report what happens (however having automatic updating of Excel I do not know what Excel version was in use when the old sheet run ok)</p>
<p>2) I cannot go back in practice on my previous sheet version simply because it would mean throwing a lot of work out of the window..</p>
<p>3) I'm not able now to detail the modifications, but I was aware that I was doing CPU sensitive changes (e.g. adding several charts related to variables that were worked upon by Solver, so perhaps any variable update could mean a chart update..) because
 to that point the system did not seem to be sensibly affected by whatever modifications - I suspect the latest round of modifications has caused some exponential increase in processing - just between hitting the "Solve" button and 100% Done (Problem setting
 up) it takes about a quarter of an hour (30 variables with limits and a few additional limits)</p>
<p>
</p><p>in conclusion, I'll try to run an old version of the worksheet and check the difference - apart from that, if you have general suggestions how to improve speed of processing in Excel (e.g., is there a size limit of the worksheet above which Excel is forced
 to swap chunks? although I have a MBP 2016 with 16GB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again!</p>

<p>

<p>Hi Renato,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if my short summary for the current situation is correct: </p>
<p>In the former version of the workbook, Solver could finish calculating in one minute. But in the problematic version of workbook, it needs several minutes to finish similar calculation. The difference for the former version and current version is that you
 have added some charts related to variable to the workbook. You could not just return to use the former version as many data or contents are not in it.
</p>

<p><span>HI TIM,</span></p>
<p><span>"In the former version of the workbook, Solver could finish calculating in one minute.
</span></p>
<p><span>RIGHT</span></p>
<p><span>But in the problematic version of workbook, it needs several minutes to finish similar calculation.
</span></p>
<p><span>CORRECT</span></p>
<p><span>The difference for the former version and current version is that you have added some charts related to variable to the workbook. "</span></p>
<p><span>NOT ONLY, ALSO A NUMBER OF NUMERICAL CHANGES - AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE NOW SEPARATED IN TO AN EXTERNAL OPTIONAL WORKBOOK THOSE CHARTS, AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED W.R.T. THE PROCESSING TIME - HENCE THE PROBLEM IS IN
 THE ALGORITMIC PARTS (MOST CALCULATIONS ARE DONE 30 TIMES EVERY CYCLE, SO A CLUMSY STATEMENT CAN HAVE BIG CONSEQUENCES..)</span></p>
<p><span>You could not just return to use the former version as many data or contents are not in it.</span></p>
<p><span>DATA I CAN EASILY RECOVER, CONTENTS I HAVE TO SEE: I HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE THE OLD "FAST" VERSION AND TRY AND SEE WHAT HAS BEEN ADDED SINCE - REDOING LITTLE BY LITTLE THE CHANGES I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THE CULPRIT..</span></p>
<p>CONCERNING THE SOLVER ACTIVATION, I CAN ASSURE YOU IT IS DONE EXACTLY IN THE SAME WAY AND SET UP IN THE 2 CASES, FURTHERMORE I BELIEVE THE WORKSHEET IS VERY MUCH COMPLICATED AND I DO NOT THINK IT IS POSSIBLE
 IN A REASONABLE TIME TO IDENTIFY THE RELEVANT CHANGES - SO I'LL TRY FIRST TO RESURRECT THE OLD WORKSHEET AND I'LL UPDATE ASAP</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Renato,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK. Just feel free to share with some updates when you have time. Meanwhile, given your description, the issue seems to be related to some specific "changes" in this complex workbook. If you find which change will cause the problem and it will even cause
 problem for some simple workbooks. You could click the smile button at right top of Excel window, directly submit the feedback to our related team. Moreover, as the issue is related to this specific complex workbook, you could post a new thread in our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?category=officeitpro&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office TechNet forum</a> for further discussion. Check if there are some good suggestion to improve the calculation of Solver with your workbook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding. </p>

<p>Hi Dana,</p>
<p>1 - I'm quite sure it is my fault, something clumsy I must have done recently</p>
<p>2 - you say a proper model should stay within 10 columns and a couple of hundred rows - I do not know how to count, but in short my model is based on 30 columns of data (*) for 700 rows, and 30 variables that from the initial values (the ones Solver works
 upon), subject to their sum = 1, evolve, over the 700 rows, as function of the data according to certain algorithms (**) - Solver has to maximise a figure of merit which is derived from a number of values calculated from the evolution of the 30 variables</p>
<p>(*) data are provided from external sheets via an interface sheet which in turn feeds the calculation sheet used by Solver (the main worksheet is about 10 sheets for 15 MB, other few tens MB are for the external data preparation worksheets)&nbsp;</p>
<p>(**) in order to make those algorithms (which include lots of IFs) simpler to modify, each variable evolution logic is split in to 20 columns</p>
<p>I do not know how to simplify the model - in particular, as most of the variables are subject to identical processing,
<p>
</p><p>said this</p>
<p>a - I now run 16.16.2, but version has nothing to do with my running time problem, my old worksheet runs fast, the recent one doesn't - the equality error was possibly the cause of a previous problem, which I overcame by setting limits slightly off from
 equality, I think nothing to do here</p>
<p>b - <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I'm trying to identify the changes that cause the problem restarting from the old fast version</span> - so far not easy</p>
<p>c - I never find the overall max (of the figure of merit) as there are always a number of local maximums - it's up to me to see what's an acceptable solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>in conclusion</p>
<p>I'll appreciate suggestions to simplify the structure of the model</p>
<p>I'll try again to find what's wrong in the changes made</p>
<p>thanks for now</p>
<p>Renato</p>

            It appears you have to save the file in a PDF format, or one of the other supported file types.
<br />
When you save the file 'as' change the ending from .doc, to one of the supported file types.<br />

<h2>            Sync options for OneNote on Ipad</h2>
                    So whenever I use OneNote on my Ipad, the auto-sync feature is enabled but its lags behind my note taking and often freezes the screen in order to catch up. As you could imagine, this is extremely frustrating when trying to take notes quickly and your
 screen locks on you. I want to disable to auto-sync so that I can work offline and sync manually. However I cannot for the life of me find the file menu or any of the setting menus that would enable me to do so. On my Ipad version, there is no 3 lined menu
 bar in the top left and the only setting menu that could be accessed has limited function. Can anyone help me figure out where my file menu is and how I could re-configure the sync settings?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Jelena,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also view message header in OWA. Select the View message details in the drop down list on the right top corner as the following picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cbfc877-7778-4948-afac-b64055eadbdd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cbfc877-7778-4948-afac-b64055eadbdd" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But both in OWA and Outlook the alias would resolved to primary address based on my test. May I ask you how did you distinguish it in Outlook?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Ovi doen't delete my music on my Nokia N8 phone (I thought maybe that will enable sync option again?) I press delete it opens up the thing where it says it is deleting and then when I refresh all my music just comes back!</p>

            If you want to transfer music from NOS to Phone then you can follow this.<br />
1. Drag &amp; drop from NOS to N8<br />
2. Select song in NOS and right click &gt; Copy to device

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which makes OVi-suite yet more useless, again. I have no desire to manually select all music i want to transfer to the phone and to remember to re-transfer a playlist when I have added stuff to it on the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every other Sync software I know can sync music, even Ovi could until Ovi-Suite 2.x.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incompetence of the Ovi-Developers and the their utter and complete ignorance about how smartphones are being used are simply mind-boggling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's like Nokia is hell-bent on making sure that everyone moves away from their smartphones as quickly as they can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sad.</p>

<p>Yes, sadly the option to sync music has been removed. The latest version of NOS 3.1.086, has problems syncing. This takes forever, and always fails on messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on Nokia, support your customers.... Put back the missing content, and resolve these issues. Is it any wonder you are losing market share!</p>

                    My Windows 10 is on the latest. Update shows no updates available. Paint 3D allows me to open a JPG file, annotate it, then saves it as PNG. when I try and save it as JPEG, it says file type is not supported....

<p>It looks as though your copy of Paint 3D is faulty. I've just tried using build 18312 and was able to create and save JPEGs. Could you check that you are on the same build, 18312?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One quick thing you could do is reset the program. Search for Apps and Features and press Return. Select&nbsp;Paint 3D and press Advanced then Reset.</p>

<h2>            Gmail having Pop3 issues with Outlook - cannot connect</h2>
                    <p>As of this morning, I am no longer receiving my Outlook (post-upgrade) emails through Gmail.&nbsp; I use Pop setting as as per the Outlook help pages and have already done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>checked all the password, SSL, emails address and server settings - didn't work</li><li>deleted the hotmail account from my Gmail list of accounts altogether, closed Gmail, restarted the browser, opened Gmail and tried to add the hotmail account again - at this point I got this error...</li></ul>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75f71436-41bc-4458-8cce-9b4fcb4e9939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75f71436-41bc-4458-8cce-9b4fcb4e9939" /></a></p>
<p>Username and password is accurate as I can log into the outlook email account directly with these details...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is a minor headache at the minute as I'm not getting any emails to my smartphone which uses the Gmail app to consolidate our various emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Can anyone help please? Or is there just an Outlook pop/smtp server issue today?</p>

            <p>As MS doesn't inform us what so ever about this issue, let me show you what the issue is EXACTLY...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you go to your WEBMAIL outlook account please ? Go to hotmail.com and log in to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to options&gt;pop&amp;imap</p>
<p>First enable POP if you haven't yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then secondly, have a look at the set protocols :</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the option pop&amp;imap you can see the protocols used for incoming mail and outgoing mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incoming should be "SSL"...but I suspect you have it set to "TLS"</p>
<p>Outgoing (smtp) should be "TLS", but you probably have it set at "STARTTLS".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is MICROSOFT's doing, NOT YOURS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS is migrating (it seems) those protocols globally, from SSL to TLS for incoming mail, and from TLS to STARTTLS for outgoing mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already mentioned this to MS support, and all they can respond is that I have a 'misbehaving' account. Which is total BS by the way. All my accounts are verified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for everyone having sync issues, and I mean EVERYONE globally having issues syncing outlook on either MS Outlook app, Android or Iphone, Ipad,... anything other than the webmail itself, is in fact affected by this change in mail protocols !</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have sync issues, check the pop&amp;imap option, if you have TLS and STARTTLS instead of SSL and TLS, then you should blame MS, because it is a GLOBAL issue coming from THEIR SERVER END !</p>
<p>
</p><p>So MS, when you finally read this, be advised that SOME of your users already have identified the specific issue to be a SERVER issue coming from your end. STOP BLAMING YOUR USERS FOR YOUR OWN MESS UPS !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope THIS will help a LOT of users out there THINKING it is something they can fix. The END-USER CANNOT FIX THIS !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS should first pull their finger and admit this issue, then start to fix it.</p>

            <p>Hi ginocarlisconi and thanks for your reply...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what do you know... you're facts are spot on. My settings are indeed marked TLS and STARTTLS and I can't change them so looks like Microsoft is deliberately preventing users from adding outlook messages into other services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't about time Google and Microsoft stopped trying to score points over each other and just work better together for the planet's benefit? Just how much money do they need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the accurate response and have a good evening, although I'm not sure how this moves us forwards any :-(</p>

<div><span>I tried this, and it doesn't work.&nbsp; When I have all my contacts using home address as the "mailing address", when I click on Business Contacts by Source, e.g., the reports come up and only shows business
 address...which is pretty much blank since I am not using this field.&nbsp; If I try to modify under columns, there is only 1 address type selection...no options that distinguish between home or business so I can't figure out how to change the option to show home,
 or at least mailing address on my report.&nbsp; This is crazy is MicroSoft&nbsp;doesn't offer this flexibility w/o always having to&nbsp;download to&nbsp;Excel.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Any other suggestions?</span></div>

<h2>            Viewing blocked users in Yammer</h2>
                    
<p>Over a period of time various users have been blocked from Yammer. How do we see a current list of users blocked and Unblock them if required. I thought this would be a simple thing to find/do but am not having much luck finding it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

                    <p>Hello team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Right now I'm using Nokia Lumia 1020 and want to upgrade to Win10 from Win8.1, but INSIDER is now working for me. It is saying NO BUILDS (we weren't to find a preview built for you). I tried your previous articles solution Hard Reset, Time/Date setting,
 Region setting, Reinstall Windows Insider. But still I'm facing this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just I want to know is nokia lumia 1020 up-gradable to Windows 10 or not?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7a80a4b-d857-4080-b376-2e163528312f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7a80a4b-d857-4080-b376-2e163528312f?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07e2bf78-22b1-4368-b2a9-d903bfcf5d8e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07e2bf78-22b1-4368-b2a9-d903bfcf5d8e?upload=true" /></a></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you make any software and hardware changes to your computer prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span>Have you installed any third party antivirus or security software?<br />
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Please follow the troubleshooting methods given below to resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: Clear the cache from Windows store.</strong><br />
<br />
This command resets the Windows Store without changing account settings or deleting installed apps. It’s a system and hidden file. WSReset.exe is usually located in the %SYSTEM% folder.<br />
<br />
Please follow the steps given below.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press "<strong>Windows</strong>+<strong>R</strong>" key on the keyboard to open
<strong>Run </strong>window.</span></li><li><span>In the Run window type "<strong>wsreset</strong>.<strong>exe</strong>" and then click ok it will clear all the cache in Windows store</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Please move to the next method if the issue still persists.<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
Method 2: Temporarily disable all the security software and then check if this fixes the issue.</strong><br />
Temporarily disable antivirus software or any security software installed on your computer temporarily.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Warning</strong>: Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
<br />
Please move to the next method if the issue still persists.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3: Perform a SFC scan.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Sfc /scannow will inspect all of the important Windows files on your computer, including Windows DLL files. If System File Checker finds an issue with any of these protected files, it will replace it.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Command prompt (Admin).</strong></span></li><li><span>At the <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type: <strong>sfc/scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Feel free to laugh at my misfortune, I do not&nbsp;understand&nbsp;the technologies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once installed it said to verify my account by&nbsp; inputting the sms code. The number was correct but I was not receiving the text with the code. I tried to receive it via call but my phone never rang and then 20 minutes later it said I had a missed call. the
 last alternative was to put in another email. Now my stupid thinking was well if my email isn't working a friend can just verify it for me. So I put in their account (signing over my account :(&nbsp; ) . When I realised the mistake I tried to cancel this but the
 way it wanted me to do that was via inputting a freaking sMS CODE WHICH WAS NOT BEING RECEIVED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I AM STRESSING OUT AND THIS EMAIL IS THE ONE I USE FOR ASSIGNMENTS AND WORK ROTAS AND UCAS AND OTHER STUFF. I HAVE 30 DAYS BEFORE IT GO'S INTO MY FRIENDS ACCOUNT. WHAT DO I DO HELP ME?</p>

            <div>I had the same issue with apps not downloading/installing. A box would pop up, ask me to select an account and then go dark grey and disappear. I disabled the anti-virus, and a bunch of the standard apps began downloading. But for the App Store app, it
 asked me to "Retry". I did this, and then tried downloading an app again and it worked perfectly.

<h3> thecooldave  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is going on with Windows Media Center &#63; Are we going to get it with Windows 10 or NOT &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft needs to let us know what is going on here. Windows Media Center has been a part of my life from XP Media Center (yes, when you had to buy a OEM PC or OEM XP software) and I even purchased a HP computer back in the Vista days to get cablecard support
 (remember that limitation ?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was a Media Center MVP for 2010 and 2011, and I even took the Windows Vista Certifications for Windows Media Center (and passed with flying colors)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The eHome team (who was tasked to create WMC) was broken up years ago, In fact the head of Windows Phone Joe Belifore was the head of the eHome team for a while.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A lot of us have a large investment in WMC, lots of money spend over the years for tuners, hardware upgrades, extenders, custom cases for dedicated HTPC, etc.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Was never crazy about Windows 8, it was ok but, running the Windows 10 preview, I'm starting to like it, still a little buggy but, No MC...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would have no problem paying a good amount over the cost of Windows for a majorly upgraded version of WMC and I think many others would too. I would love to see Native 4K (2160p)support, Updated interface, Internet services (stuff used on the Xbox one),
 Native Blu-ray support, Better live tv support, Custom guide control (use different sources for guide info).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Times are changing, TV is changing, 4K Blu-ray is due by fall time, 4K tvs are the highest seller in the tv market right now, Giving support for this tech as it comes along to WMC would make it the EXCLUSIVE HTPC software, and market share for this will
 grow..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To think, Windows Media Center could grow up a little and at this point needs to. It's the only software out there that can use DRM protected cablecard channels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Doing a open source, or selling WMC to a company that will make it better, I am all for that, if Microsoft is NOT going to take it on....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Come on, do something with this Microsoft </p>

            TV tuners work just fine on win 10 using the software that comes with the tuner--like Win TV. Much better than media center ever did. DVDs are on their way out now that streaming video is the new norm. DVDs can still be played on dvd players connected
 to a tv.

<p>WMC has been an lower quality product compared to XBMC/Kodi for more then a decade now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kodi and its many&nbsp;</span>branches&nbsp;<span>have always been free and under continuous development.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had HTPC`s for more then 14 Years, and I have tried WMC on many occasions, it has ALWAYS been an inferior product.</p>

            <p>I agree. &nbsp;I'm my opinion WMC still is the best at handling live tv. &nbsp;I use mediabrowser to handle movies and TV episodes I have downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like the guide and how everything is setup on the Xbox One but since we will probably never see a TV Tuner for the Xbox One here in the US it would be great if they integrated that look and feel into WMC in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Kodi(XBMC) for live tv but it is still wonky and slow ant changing channels. &nbsp;WMC just works.</p>

<p>But this does not support playready and therefore can only get your local networks mostly instead of your full cable package. &nbsp;I'm a big fan of MediaBrowser. &nbsp;I've even started a thread there asking for them to look into adding playready support and would
 even be willing to pay for it. &nbsp;We'll see what kind of traction that gets.</p>

<p>This is a ridiculous post. First of all, you are making a blanket statement that ALL programs, regardless of manufacturer, have much better software than WMC? I have yet to see one that is better, let alone all of them.</p>
<p><br />
Next, DVD's are still perfectly usable and popular, especially for the large segment of the population that either cannot get streaming services, have insufficient internet speeds to stream, or have a large collection of existing DVD's. Have you seen the line
 at your local redbox lately?<br />
I would agree that there are better DVD players out there than WMC, but they are far from being a dead technology.<br />
<br />
WMC is a superior product, especially for TV tuners, and I really wish that MS would sell it off or let it go open source if they are going to abandon it.

<p>I do agree that&nbsp;WMC is a superior product, especially for TV tuners, even though it has a few flaws but,</p>
<p>I disagree with your statement that, TV tuners work just fine on win 10, using the software that comes with the tuner, because I` am using HDHomeRun&nbsp; on windows 8.1 and&nbsp;all is good, but when&nbsp;I try to use it on Win-10, &nbsp;I get sound on all the channels but
 there is on picture. </p>

<h2>            Getting &#34;The File Could Not Be Accessed&#34; message when Excel starts up or shuts down</h2>
                    Recently, out of the blue, when I startup Excel for Mac, the program goes through its normal boot up and the various com. files are loaded. When that's done, I get a "The File Could not Be Accessed" message dialog.&nbsp; I seem to be able to just click the
 OK, and the program comes up fine, but I'm wondering why I'm getting the message?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to "fix" the install, if something has gone wrong, without using a license of the ones I have?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Thank you. &nbsp;I had deleted and reinstalled Office and cleaned up the fonts, but I hadn't delved into all the Library system file locations to delete files there. So I did all that and after 20 minutes it's now all working as it should and the problem has
 gone. [An Uninstall tool and a automatic font uncluttering application would assist this process!]
<div><br />
<div>Any way, thanks for your help.</div>

            <p>Since both of you repaired permissions and have removed duplicate or bad fonts, it's hard to say what changed on your systems. If it were me I would do the following in this order (try again after each step)</p>
<p>1. Check for malware. Run this free scan from F-Secure</p>
<p><a href="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002346.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002346.html</a></p>
<p>2. Boot to a repair disc such as DiskWarrior, Drive Genius, TechTools Pro or other tool and use it to rebuild the volume and directory</p>
<p>3. Completely remove office 2011 and start over</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768</a></p>
<p>and then&nbsp;run Font Book to resolve duplicate fonts after installing Office for Mac (again) then&nbsp; Repair Permissions in Disk Utility after installing (again). Let Microsoft Office update itself till no more updates are available&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>HI All</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office 365 guys said to post here... hopefully someone will be able to point me in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have one user in an environment who has a Samsung laptop with Windows 7 64-bit, using Office Professional Plus 2013 (not via Office365) and Exchange and Lync Online.&nbsp; The issue we are seeing is that they can make audio and video calls, add whiteboarding
 and share powerpoint presentations but as soon as they want to share a monitor or an application you get a popup window saying Lync has unexpectedly stopped working and will restart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have made sure windows updates are uptodate, and completed a repair
 install of Office 2013.&nbsp; In the event logs it says Lync.exe crashed and it&nbsp;mentioned the Kernellbase.dll.&nbsp; I have updated the Intel graphics driver and even the display driver to be current but can't seem to find a resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone point me in the right direction?</span></p>

                    <p>Dear Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting irritated with a problem of scroll lock turning on while I work on excel automatically.</p>
<p>I know how to scroll off with on screen key board but the question is how and why it is getting on during working in excel, while I don't press any Key?<br />
I work on excel every day for a long time and all of sudden it gets on, WTF?<br />
It is irritating and Microsoft should answer of fix this bug, it can't happen that it will on automatically without doing anything from user side.</p>

</p><p>I'm trying to use OneNote as part of an assessment piece which needs to be ordered in a specific way. At the moment, whenever I enter OneNote the sections have rearranged or themselves (the content remains the same though). I was wondering if there was a
 way to lock them in place?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amber</p>

            Hi Amber,<br />
<br />
When using OneNote Online, you should be able to arrange your notebooks, sections and pages to your desired arrangement. Any changes made on your OneNote files will remain. Regarding your concern, have you tried opening the OneNote online on another browser
 or using an InPrivate window?

<h2>            Win 8.1 Pro Touch Screen Eliminated&#63; How Do I get It Back&#63;</h2>
                    I appreciate the conversion of the fact you had eliminated the Windows 8.1 Pro and wiping out the Touch Screen completely and turning this into a DESKTOP when it is NOT! This is an TOUCH SCREEN DEVICE, not a DESKTOP!

            <p>It's sad isn't it, they are creating a UX that everyone will despise equally. If they don't get it together soon, their entire vision of the past three years is gone and we're back to 2000 again, only because people who don't really use windows complained
 about 8. Now they are kicking sand in the face of every 8.1 user that loves it and have defended and supported them all this time.</p>

            <p>They're not going back to 2000, they're going back to 1995. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The big reason I upgraded to 8 was no start menu. I don't appreciate being stuck with a full-screen version of the latest incarnation as a poor replacement for the Screen. Hopefully this is just a placeholder while they rewrite the Screen &amp; Menu code. It's
 new code, that's why there are fewer customization options at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm willing to see what they come up, but I'm still going to make it perfectly clear that this preliminary version doesn't cut it.</p>
