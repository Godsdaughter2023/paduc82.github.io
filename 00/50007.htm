<p>Hi Aleksander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are two ways for you to change the Hardware Graphics Acceleration on your Windows 10 PC. You can change it on the
<strong>Display Settings</strong> through the <strong>Control Panel </strong>or on the graphics card settings. To enable the Hardware Acceleration, you may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>. Change the Hardware Acceleration in the <strong>Display Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start </strong>and type <strong>Display Settings</strong> in the search box.</li><li>Under <strong>Customize your display</strong>, click <strong>Advanced display settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Display adapter properties</strong> and go to the <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>tab.</li><li>If your current graphics card driver allows you to change the settings, you will be able to see the
<strong>Change settings</strong> button.</li><li>Click <strong>Change settings </strong>and adjust the <strong>Hardware acceleration</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>. Change the Hardware Acceleration in the graphics card settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go to the <strong>NVidia Control Panel (PhysX settings)</strong> or <strong>
Catalyst Control Panel</strong> for ATI graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you manually update the graphics card driver by uninstalling it from the
<strong>Device Manager</strong> and downloading it directly from the graphics card manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results and don't hesitate to contact us anytime if you need further assistance.</p>

<h3> derrickjackson2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3, options when closing keyboard while docked with remote monitors, screen off option is not available&#63;</h2>
                    I have my Surface Pro 3 on dock with 2 other monitors and earlier when I closed my keyboard on my Surface it would shut the screen down and move the desktop features to one of the other two monitors. Now it does not do this, when I go to power settings,
 the only options for when plugged in are; do nothing, sleep, hibernate or shut down. Where are the settings to have the screen to power down on keyboard lid close and continue with the remote monitors only?&nbsp;

<p>Hello Derrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us help you utilize the external monitors even when your Surface Pro 3's screen is off. The reason why the desktop features are not available on the external monitors when the main device's lid is closed, is because the source is either placed on sleep
 or hibernate. There are a few options you can try, so that the desktop features would still be available on the external monitors even after the Surface Pro 3's lid is closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Change the default for&nbsp;</strong>"<em><strong>When I close the lid</strong></em>".</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>Windows</strong> icon and choose&nbsp;<strong>Power Options</strong>.</li><li>Under&nbsp;<strong>Related settings </strong>on the right, click on <strong>Additional power settings</strong>.</li><li>Then click&nbsp;<strong>Choose what closing the lid does</strong>.</li><li>Change the action for "<em><strong>When I close the lid</strong></em>" on both
<em><strong>On </strong><strong>battery </strong>and <strong>Plugged in&nbsp;</strong></em>to
<strong>Do nothing</strong>.</li><li>Save changes</li><li>Restart. (not turn off and on)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Change the default for&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Lid close action</span> inside Power Options.</strong></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;icon and choose&nbsp;<strong>Power Options</strong>.</li><li>Under&nbsp;<strong>Related settings&nbsp;</strong>on the right, click on&nbsp;<strong>Additional power settings</strong>.</li><li>Then click&nbsp;<strong>Change when the computer sleeps</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Change plan settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Change advanced power settings</strong>.</li><li>Inside&nbsp;<strong>Power Options</strong>, collapse <strong>Power buttons and lid</strong>.</li><li>Then collapse&nbsp;<strong>Lid close action</strong>.</li><li>Change the selection on both&nbsp;<em><strong>On&nbsp;</strong><strong>battery&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Plugged in&nbsp;</strong></em>to&nbsp;<strong>Do nothing</strong>.</li><li>Apply changes and click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart. (not turn off and on)</li></ol>

<p>Dear AJ Don,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back so soon with the options, I followed your advise and it seems to have helped but it isn't consistent. On one restart the key pad on the lap top wasn't recognized, it would only work with the second keyboard (BT) it took two restarts
 before it came back to normal. During one of the restarts it would only power on the laptop screen and one remote monitor (I have two remotes) and in system/display it could see all three screens but would not send signal to the other. Another restart and
 that was resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This acts like it did 2 years ago when I first purchased the Surface Pro and hub, the monitor recognition was inconsistent. Several phone calls to tech support never resolved it then a few months later (I assume after an auto update) all was working perfectly
 right up to this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what the issue is but we do have it working as it was, lets hope it stays that way. Again many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Derrick</p>

<br />
<br />Type netplwiz.cpl in Cortana Search box &gt; Click netplwiz.cpl &gt; Select local account &gt; Uncheck Users must enter a user name  and password to use this computer
<br />
<br />Step 2. Windows Key+i &gt; Accounts &gt; Click sign-in options &gt; Under Require sign-in select Never

<p>
</p><p>You can play games without having to stream, that feature isn't needed. You should read the streaming services terms &amp; conditions as an 8 year old may not be allowed to stream.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of games have an age restriction so, your child may not be allowed to play the game without a parents/ guardians permission.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fallout has an age restriction of 18+.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a post on the internet regarding pro's and cons for children playing xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><span><strong>Pros</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span>Some of the most common positive effects of playing video games include that Xbox:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1); margin-left: 0"><span>Increases self-confidence</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1); margin-left: 0"><span>Improves hand-eye coordination&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1); margin-left: 0"><span>Can foster potential interest in video game design</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1); margin-left: 0"><span>Encourages socializing with friends</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><span>As video game technology becomes even more complex, many colleges have started offering degrees in video game technology. Kids who are able to have a healthy balance of time playing games and participating in other activities
 can find themselves potentially designing the types of games that they are playing today. Although communication with friends is done online through Xbox live, the
<a href="http://resources.uknowkids.com/blog/bid/334888/Digital-Parenting-7-Surprisingly-Inspiring-Kids-Tech-Trends-for-2014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
social aspect of the game</a> is a positive feature of Xbox, as this can be a bonding tool.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><span><strong>Cons</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span>While good things can happen when spending hours playing Xbox, more often than not when parents ask the question about whether or not Xbox is good for kids, the answer is a resounding no. One of the most troublesome aspects of playing Xbox concerns kids
 who play Xbox Live. Some of the most notable problems encountered by Xbox Live players include:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1); margin-left: 0"><span>Increased risk of running away from home</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1); margin-left: 0"><span>Possible development of physical problems</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1); margin-left: 0"><span>Potential death</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><span>Yes, strange as it may seem, there has been a documented case of an Xbox Live player dying as a result of sitting through a marathon session of gaming. An autopsy revealed the 20 year-old died from a pulmonary embolism that traveled
 from his legs into his lungs. Doctors blamed the fatality on the prolonged period of time the youngster spent sitting at the game, which is why parents are always encouraged to make their children take a break from playing to get up and walk around for several
 minutes. </span></p>
<p><span>There have also been reports of teenagers running away from home as a result of meeting others through
</span><a href="http://resources.uknowkids.com/blog/bid/159253/Xbox-101-What-Every-Parent-Needs-to-Know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live</a><span>. A 2012 incident in Iowa resulted in four teens meeting while playing Xbox Live and making a pact to
 run away together. While they were located unharmed and returned home safely, it shows how little parents know about what kids can do while playing video games.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>While some of these incidents are drastic examples, they do show the possibilities of what can happen if parents are not aware of the capabilities of Xbox. When asking if Xbox is good for kids, it's best to check into the many parental monitoring tools</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can turn on parental control to help monitor activities, please comment for further assisance.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks i hope this helps.</span></p>

</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Yes you can play any console without streaming to others. That is an option gamers have to let others watch, but it is not required.</p>

            If by streaming with others you mean playing online with others, that is possible, but you'll want to make sure the game's he is wanting to play offer single player. If he's wanting Fallout 76 (the newest one) that is an online only game so he would be

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a lots of age appropriate game and contents for younger kids.&nbsp; If you have hulu, Netflix, etc, they can also stream it on their xbox.&nbsp; Streaming is completely separate, and optional feature.&nbsp; I would also recommend checking out Fallout before purchasing
 it for them, to make sure you're OK with the content that is in the game, before letting them play.</p>

<br />		Scroll down to Skype
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options

<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter

            Oh, thats because you are using Skype 8.28, i thought you were referring to Skype for Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />1. Make sure that Skype is no longer running <a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10980/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10980/</a>.
<br />
<br />2. Press the Windows  + R 
<br />
<br />3. Type %appdata%\skype into the Run window then click OK. 
<br />
<br />4. Find and delete the shared.xml file. If file extensions are
<br />not displayed on your computer, the file will just be called shared.
<br />
<br />5. Open the folder that has your Skype name.
<br />
<br />6. Locate and delete the configorconfig.xml file.
<br />
<br />7. Press the Windows + R keys on your keyboard at the same
<br />time again.
<br />
<br />8. Type %appdata% into the Run window and click OK.
<br />
<br />9. Locate and rename the Skype folder to Skype_Old.
<br />
<br />10. Relaunch Skype. 
<br />
<br />Try again

<h2>            Initiate Bluetooth Audio device connection - W10</h2>
                    <p>Have a pair of Nokia MD-7W Bluetooth speakers and I much prefer them to the laptop speakers.</p>
<p>They connect and work fine immediately upon initial pairing but, once disconnected, the connection cannot be re-established.</p>
<p>The speakers continue to show as&nbsp;paired device and are listed as working properly in the Playback window and drivers show as up-to-date yet, Troubleshooting&nbsp;simply says they're&nbsp;not connected. It appears that W10 doesn't/can't initiate the connection.</p>
<p>So far, the only way to get them to connect is to remove them from the list of Bluetooth devices altogether and pair them again as a newly added device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to keep both the built-in laptop speakers as well as the Bluetooth speakers available and have the Bluetooth speakers as my default option so that, whenever the laptop comes within the speakers' range and they are powered on, the audio output
 switches to the Bluetooth speakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, that's&nbsp;a fairly mainstream thing to be wanting to do and there should be provision in the OS&nbsp;for just that, no?</p>

</p><p>In a perfect world perhaps?&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you shut down the computer at night, then you can't connect to the speakers when you get started the next day?&nbsp; Do you ever restart the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open&nbsp;the Action Center by clicking on the Notifications icon in the system tray.&nbsp; Do you see a Connect button there?&nbsp; These are the buttons in my Action Center.&nbsp; Connect is what you would need to click to connect to your Bluetooth speakers.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I don't have an Action Centre as such, but I have a Bluetooth icon and it should suffice to select 'connect' there, but once disconnected from the initial pairing the connection can no longer be made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either Reboot or simple disconnection results in the OS not being able to find and connect to the&nbsp;speakers.</p>
<p>There is no error message - speakers are enabled, but just don't connect.</p>
<p>Strange thing is that upon initial pairing the speakers work perfectly well, so it's just about&nbsp;repeat initialisation.</p>

<p>

</p><p>I set the Bluetooth services to start automatically and disabled the built-in speakers and it seems to work all right.</p>
<p>It's not ideal, because it should be sufficient just to choose a default rather than disable it, but it works for now.</p>

                    I'm getting "Not Responding" frequently when trying to open documents using Windows 7. I've had my new Dell PC for almost a year, but this just started happening within the last few weeks of June, July 2011.

            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I haven't tried the suggestions posted so far, but no, I have not had ANY type of PC problems-at least none that I can think of that could be causing this. I did read on some other Blogs that when an anti-virus pgm. is running (I have Norton) that this
 could interfere with accessing, using&nbsp;one or more documents. It also helps to not have too many other programs, e-mail, websites, PhotoShop, etc. all open at the same time. Normally it has not been an issue and is not unusual for me to have several applications
 open at the same time. Anyway, stay tuned and I'll post later what I experience.
</p>
<p>P.S. By coincidence, as soon as the Norton&nbsp;anti-virus pgm. was finished running (Did not find any virus attempts, etc.) I did not have this issue! However, keep in mind I've had Norton for the past 6 months or so and did not recall the "Not Responding" problem.
 Go figure! Could it be when I see Norton running, I should close as many applications as I can, so Norton can do it's thing?</p>

            <p>What version of Norton do you have. It could be that Norton is part of the problem.
</p>
<p>How much RAM does your computer have?</p>
<p>Select Ctrl+Shift+Esc to bring up Task Manager and click on the Performance tab. What are the figures for Total, Cached, available and Free?</p>
<p><span>Select Start, Run, type cmd and press ENTER. Type "chkdsk c: /f /r" without the quotes and hit ENTER.&nbsp;Make sure you include the spaces indicated.
 Enter Y when asked whether you wish to run chkdsk on restarting the computer. Exit and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Marking off bad sectors on a hard drive takes time so be patient. Marking off does not repair a bad sector. It places pointers on the drive telling
 the system not to read or write to those sectors which have been damaged.</span></p>
<p><span>If the number of bad sectors continues to increase after you have run the procedure above several times then you should replace the drive. If an
 important system file is written to a bad sector you can corrupt registry hives and lose the whole contents of the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand if having run chkdsk you see no more new bad sectors then the drive can work for you for years.</span></p>

            <p><span>The PC is almost new (2010 Dell Inspiron 560) and has all the "whistles and bells" and other than a recent issue concerning
 the following (Unedited at bottom) I have had no problems with the PC. It has plenty of ROM and RAM. Norton is the latest 2011 version, etc., etc. As I searched for the document to Paste below I did not have the dreaded "No Responding" problem. When I do,
 I go to Task Manager and have tried every selection it showed to no avail. </span>
</p>
<p><span>I will contact Norton just to see if something they are doing in their Scan is interfering with my working with documents.</span></p>
<p><span>I still have not found a solution to this issue below and every single time I turn off my PC I get a msg. not to turn off
 my PC until "Update 1 of 1" is finished. I could turn the PC back on immediately, do nothing, turn it back off right away and still get the "Update 1 of 1" msg.! There are numerous complaints and equal number of "solutions" on various Blogs found on a Google
 search-but I want the answer "straight from the horses mouth" so to speak-that is from MICROSOFT!! I have yet to receive one.</span></p>
<p><span>I downloaded this security update 6-25-'11:</span></p>

            Some time ago when my&nbsp;e-mail pgm. was acting sluggish and it was very annoying, I thought perhaps there was some Microsoft download "fix" after I tried everything else. I did not find any and eventually the problem went away-at least most times it "went
 away". However, while at the Microsoft "Check for the latest&nbsp;downloads" site I happen to see
<p><span>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistribution package (KB2538242)</span></p>
<p><span>Published 6/14/2011. </span></p>
<p><span>At first I questioned why would I need a 6 year-old Service Pack for a 2010 PC with Windows 7, but seeing that the Published date was "6/14/2011" I assumed it was something "important" so I downloaded it-against my own "golden rule"-which is-always
 first search the I-net, see what others are saying about this download. Is it&nbsp;really needed? is it causing problems?
</span></p>
<p><span>After I downloaded it, a message&nbsp;kept popping up every time I turned on the PC that I have a required download ready to install. Not knowing at first it was the same one I did it several days until I got suspicious that it may be the same one over
 and over and sure enough found out it was! Somehow, after a week or so, it (fortunately) went away, but as I pointed out earlier it still is giving a related msg. each time I shut down the PC! This is now going on for about 3 weeks!</span></p>

<a href="http://snipurl.com/1umwwx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://snipurl.com/1umwwx</a></p>
<p>I have not seen an explanation as to why it occurs?&nbsp; Norton creates&nbsp; a lot of strange problems and this could be just another of those problems.</p>
<p>Your not responding problem could well be caused by Norton as it commonly causes performance issues, although these are more&nbsp;prevalent on a Windows XP computer with limited RAM available. Norton renders using System Restore unusable, except with an obscure&nbsp;temporary
 setting change that few users know about and certainly do &nbsp;not remember when they are desperate to fix their computer.</p>
<p>Norton is a poor choice when deciding on security software for a home computer as there are many freeware alternatives available which do not bring the problems that Norton (and McAfee) do.

<p>Many years ago Norton was a highly reputable provider of security software but it's reputation with many experienced users is long gone.</p>
<p>Norton and McAfee are commonly preinstalled&nbsp;on new branded computers, notably laptops, on a 3 months trial basis. This gives them market penetration with&nbsp; computer users. Having read countless complaints about slow and unresponsive computers over the last
 12 years it&nbsp;is clear&nbsp;to me&nbsp;that dumping Norton solves many problems. I say this knowing that most PC Reviews suggest the contrary but that is the way I and a number of contributors to these forums read the situation.</p>

<p>Yes i found your new thread. The KB Article is a logical place to start but I doubt it contains the answer. Microsoft Technical Support can most likely fix your problem but a solution is needed beyond that. It is not just a problem with one update. There
 have been a number of updates where the same problem has arisen. If it was a Microsoft problem I would expect to see far more failures.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that it is third party software. Security software providing real time protection or a third party firewall&nbsp;are logical candidates. It&nbsp; cannot be all security software or you would see more problems. It would need to be a major provider of
 security or a more than one as a single less popular provider would not generate so many reports of problems.&nbsp; You are using a security product with a large user base known to create problems.
</p>
<p>Have you given up on trying to resolve your not responding problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Gerry, the "Not Responding" problem seems to have gone away. It's possible I had too many applications open, perhaps trying to do things too fast. However, it does trouble me that this happened several times on several days and I don't believe I always had
 several apps. open or trying to do things too fast. So, I'll have to take note if, when it happens again to see what else I was doing, had open at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp; As for the other KB article and problem-sadly, it's still there-as I just discovered when I turned off my PC a short while ago, then turned it back on before typing on this post!</p>
<p>As I pointed out in the other Blog, I noticed the KB security download first occurred on June 16th, perhaps I wonder if there was a tie-in or "issue" when coincidentally the day before-June 15th, I downloaded Real Player-Plus. After it's installation I was
 totally unable to burn Rhapsody or Real Player vids. as promised after agreeing to pay the $39.99! The problem: Out of dozens of compatible burning software listed-mine was NOT on the list! I confirmed this with a&nbsp;RP tech. support-whom initially wanted to
 do a "remote" on my PC to ck., but I refused.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think my old age is beginning to diminish my "golden rule" thought process to research potential issues before downloading or purchasing something off the I-net!</p>
<p>Big disappointment there and no, I'm not about to pay to have my CD/DVD unit taken out and replaced by a compatible one just for Real Player burning!</p>
<p>&nbsp;The KB issue is going to have to rest a while before I could afford to spend another 2 to 3 hours trying to find a fix. My next step is to contact Norton and see what they have to say. Perhaps I should contact Real Player as well, but keep in mind this
 is just a coincidence that I happen to ck. for Microsoft Updates at the same time these other&nbsp;issues-"Not Responding" and Real Player-Plus download were happening. I appreciate all bloggers efforts in sharing their opinions, suggestions. Certainly, if&nbsp;I find
 the right "fix" for the KB issue&nbsp;I will share it.</p>

<h2>            Photos App tile - showing limited amount of photos</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Photo App (Start Menu panels)</p>
<p>So I noticed i kept seeing the same photos in the Start menu photo tile and some were super old and some more recent.</p>
<p>It loops about 5 of them and i have no clue why those 5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i wanted to know why it was showing those. &nbsp;I went to settings in the app and to the 'Choose what to show on Photos Tile' and then realized you can only choose 'Recent Photos' or 'A single photo'. I dont want a single photo so i guess i have to choose
 recent photos. How about 'All Photos'. Why is that not a choice there??? How do i rotate all of my photos? Does anyone know?</p>

</p><p>Seems, it might be the limitation with the Photos app, causing this behavior. Also when you navigate to

<p>With Windows 10 there should be some kind of explanation file for these mysteries. &nbsp;Many , many users have this question about this odd app. &nbsp;Why keep customers in a state of confusion? i dont know. I wouldnt, but i am not the CEO or in charge of customer
 confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can i go to that location and add in photos I actually want to see and name them Tile 0 , Tile 1, and so on up to Tile 4? or is that not recommended? &nbsp;Maybe i should leave it alone and see the same old 5 photos that i am now very tired of seeing. &nbsp;It
 has ruined them.. because i see them so much.. over and over..same 5.</p>

            I just got updated to windows 10 and was configuring everything. I never thought Microsoft will build something like this. What is the whole&nbsp;point of limiting the tile to 5 images and with no knowledge to the end user of how the images are chosen. Not everyone
 will be able to find the AppData folder.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Along with Windows Vista, do you have older version of Operating installed on the computer? Have you setup a dual boot configuration?<br />
2.&nbsp;Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
<div><br />
Follow the methods mentioned below and check.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong>&nbsp; To start the default operating system automatically without displaying a list of available operating systems, clear the “Time to display list of operating systems” check box from Advances system settings. Follow the steps provided
 in the following article link:<br />

            sorry to bother you again but how long will it take for the refund to happen because the game i wanted to buy is on sale right now and it will go away in a few hours and its not worth it to pay 30$ for a 5 year old game. :(

            That is the only way of doing it. GTA V is on sale until November 26, so there should still be time to get it on sale.

<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you are having issues opening a saved email in Mail. To further isolate the issue, I would like to ask some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the file type of the saved email?</li><li>Do you receive any error message when opening it in Mail? If so, what is the exact error message?</li><li>What is the version of your Mail? To check, press <strong>ALT + F</strong> in Mail then click
<strong>About</strong>.</li><li>What is your operating system?</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

<p>My answers to your questions are as folows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you are having issues opening a saved email in Mail. To further isolate the issue, I would like to ask some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the file type of the saved email?&nbsp; - It is saved as a Windows Live Mail file, which apparently is the same file format as an Outlook file.</li><li>Do you receive any error message when opening it in Mail?&nbsp;If so, what is the exact error message? - &nbsp;I do not receive an error message. Rather, it assumes the file is an Outlook file and asks me to open Outlook, which Is not on my computer.&nbsp; Hence, I cannot
 open the saved file.</li><li>What is the version of your Mail? To check, press <strong>ALT + F</strong> in Mail then click
<strong>About</strong>. - Windows Live Mail 2011, Version 2011 (Build 15.4.3555.0308).</li><li>What is your operating system? - Windows 7</li></ul>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Julius,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file type is .eml.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I select "open with" and choose default program, and select Windows Live Mail, the file does not open.&nbsp; Rather Windows Live Mail opens.&nbsp; It open to whatever WLM folder I had last had opened (i.e, input or draft, etc.)&nbsp; If I close WLM, then go back and
 double clock on the saved file, it again o;ens WLM to the WLM (previously opened) Input folder. However, since I had previously deleted&nbsp;the file&nbsp;from the WLM input folder (since I had saved it as an .eml file elsewhere, it is&nbsp;not in WLM, and hence the file
 does not&nbsp;open.</p>

                    <p>not sure if this is the right section.</p><p><br /></p><p>i recently sent my xbox one off for repair it was received by the repair centre on the 30th and was repaired on the 31st now its the 6th and they still haven't posted it back to me this is making me think something has happened to it also the other reason why i think is is because when you send off your xbox for repair you can log in the device repair section and see the order number for your device which you can click on and it tells you whats happening to your device like when it was received when its repaired etc but for some reason when i now log in to the device repair section my order has suddenly dissapeared even tho it was there previously........</p><p>i have spoken to people on the live chat over 8 times trying to get an answer why and every time they pretty much ignore it and just tell me my xbox has been fixed.</p>

<h2>            HOW DO I OPTIMIZE A HARD DISK DRIVE THAT IS 35&#37; FRAGMENTED</h2>
                    <p>I have been getting lots of BSOD error messages. &nbsp;PAGE FAULT IN NON PAGED AREA (Ntfs.sys). ..SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED..KERNAL SECURITY CHECK FAILURE...ETC ETC. &nbsp; &nbsp;I seem to get the ..PAGE FAULT IN NON PAGED AREA (Ntfs.sys) even more regularly
 &nbsp;I have done some research and apparently a possible cause for these messages can be a Corrupted NTFS volume. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp;I have just noticed that I have a Hard Disk Drive which is 35% fragmented ..11?\Volume}2e92f4 . &nbsp; All of my computer drives are optimized automatically. &nbsp;I have tried to optimize this without success. &nbsp;Can this be what is causing all my blue screen errors
 ? &nbsp;What should I do ? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            XBOX One &#43; Digital TV tuner &#40;USB&#41; &#43; DVB-T2 rod antenna is not working ...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
I try to watch TV with a DVB-T2 rod antenna, the Digital TV tuner (USB) on the XBOX One.<br />
If I carry out the channel search, the XBOX One finds no channels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here are my question:<br />
1. Does the Digital TV Tuner (USB) work with a DVB-T2 rod antenna at all?<br />
<br />
If the Digital TV Tuner (USB) work with a DVB-T2 rod antenna at all, so what am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Thank you, Ardan</p>

<p>Hello Ardan Vulpayne!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox One OneGuide is designed for use with set top receiver boxes connected through the HDMI in from receiver slot in the back of the Xbox One. As such that is why it may not be detecting the USB Digital TV tuner you're trying to use. I recommend contacting
 the manufacturer of the device you are trying to use to determine compatibility. Also as stated please review the options located here

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out.</p>

<p>Hi Ardan</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the official <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/accessories/xbox-one-digital-tv-tuner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Digital TV Tuner</a>, then it should work with a DVB-T2 rod antenna as is stated on the article I linked. However, it's only supported in limited regions. Those include France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you fall under any of those regions or do you live outside of those regions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know to see if that's the reason why no channels are found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Left For Dead 2 recognised as blu-ray and not a game</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>I recently bought Left 4 Dead 2 Xbox 360 disc. It is the "standard" game edition. When I insert it into my Xbox One the Xbox tries (and fails) to play it as a blu-ray disc. I see no option to run it as a game.</p><p><br /></p><p>Left 4 Dead 2 is on the BC list, however when i try to digitally download, it advises it is unavailable for purchase. Could these issues be related?<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Any ideas would be much appreciated :)<br /></p>

            Microsoft Word 2007 and Office 2007 will run on Windows 10 but it is not certified compatible. So, keep that in mind. 
<br />
<br />If you experience difficulties installing the suite, try using compatibility mode:

            <p>HP doesn't support that model on Windows 10. (Check HP's website.) And if HP doesn't support it, there's nothing that you or Microsoft can do. Time for a new printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to offer a quick shopping guide. I bought my 6L (the 6P's companion model) in 1997. At the time, I paid $400. Your new printer will probably cost 75% less, and it will do stuff that your 6P can't even imagine. On the other hand, our model 6 could
 probably deflect a bullet, while modern printers are built from the cheapest **** the manufacturers can find.</p>

<p>[quote user="maniacmaXXine"]Why ................. in MSN/xbox live and all their great knowledge not allow it ...... it seems that it would an easy thing to do but then there are a bunch of things that xbox live could do to make the clients(those that pay
 real money) life a little easier but wont.</p>

<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The reason is that the information on every single Windows Live ID (the email address attached to your gamertag) needs to unique to that WLID. &nbsp;You can't remove information (game history, purchases, settings, etc) from that
 WLID to attach to a different WLID that is already in use.</span><br />

 but it was the right answer.<br />

So, to answer that. &nbsp;It's up to the OP or the Xbox Support staff to verify an answer.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>the gamertag that i am talking about is mine and at the moment has NO xbox live acct tied to it, free or otherwise &nbsp;...... but it does come up as a second profile when i turn on my console .... there isnt even a gamer-name for it ...it is just listed as
 profile 2 &nbsp;and I really could care less if each "Gamertag" needs to be "unique" to its WLID(a term no longer used btw)all i am trying to do is to take the game history and put it on the only gamertag that i used now so that i don't have to go back and play
 the games all over again just to get them on my main gamertag and i find it crazy-weird &nbsp;that i cant or to quote a famous alien ....."It is not logical"</p>

    <title>Chkdsk stalls for hours, HDD heats up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chalkbrd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chkdsk stalls for hours, HDD heats up</h2>
                    <p>When I perform a Chkdsk, it gets to the 4 of 5 and stalls for hours (at least 9).&nbsp; I don't mind letting it go for even longer, but the hard drive heats up excessively, and the file number didn't change for several hours (at least 3).&nbsp; (Not sure when the
 HDD started heating since I set it up to work overnight...the entire laptop was hot in the morning and for the three extra hours I left it run in the morning, so at least it ran hot like that for three hours that I know of.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hesitated rebooting, but it stayed on the exact same number for at least three hours and the machine was very hot, even though I had it lying on the back of the screen with the keyboard/computer portion in the air to allow it to cool better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Is this "normal" for the Chkdsk to stay on the same file number for hours?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Is the significantly increased heat normal?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Is there a possibility of the increased heat over the extended hours damaging the machine?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Should I re-perform the Chkdsk and allow it to run no matter how long it takes?&nbsp; (How long is too long?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 444 GB HDD space with 104 GB free, Intel i7-2670QM CPU @ 2.20GHz with 8 GB RAM, 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course overheating may damage your machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the vents for dust, hair, etc&nbsp;and do not use a Laptop when it is resting&nbsp;on material surfaces: bedspreads, blankets,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem persists, as it is a Laptop, take it to a local and reliable Computer Repair Shop and get them to open it up and clean the dust from inside it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an interesting discussion about the varied reasons for your problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html</span></a></p>
<p>N.B&gt; However 9 out of 10 cases of overheating are caused by an airflow blockage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test your Hard Drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop Manufacturer's website &gt; look for your Computer's specifications &gt; find out brand of Hard Drive &gt; go to Hard Drive Manufacturer's website &gt; find and download Hard Drive Diagnostic software and make a Bootable disk from it on the Computer
 you are using to get here, following their instructions &gt; test your Hard Drive to see if it has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can also use this Method to test your Hard Drive:</p>

<p>Hi Eddie, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from the error message the original poster is getting, will you be able to provide a screenshot of the other error? Before proceeding to any further troubleshooting, let's first try to diagnose and fix common connection problems
 using the Network troubleshooter. To run the Network troubleshooter, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Network troubleshooter</strong>, and then select
<strong>Identify and repair network problems</strong> from the list of results.</li><li>Follow the steps in the troubleshooter and see if that resolves the problem.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the troubleshooter can't identify the problem, proceed with updating the network adapter driver. If the issue persists, try to install the driver in compatibility mode. You may refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Compatibility </strong>tab.</li><li>Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop-down list.</li><li>Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out for you. </p>
<p>
