            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also set the Default apps, through Control Panel. Follow the below mentioned steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Click <strong>Start, </strong></p>
<p>* Type<strong> Default Programs </strong>and select the<strong> Default Programs</strong> from the list</p>
<p>* Click <strong>Set Default Programs </strong>and select the<strong> Media Player</strong> from the program list</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Click on <strong>Set this program as default </strong>or you can also use the option
<strong>Choose default for this program </strong>to select the files &nbsp;manually which should use this app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way is Right-click on the <strong>Music File, </strong>select <strong>
Properties </strong>from context Menu<strong>. </strong>Under <strong>General tab,
</strong>click <strong>Change </strong>then select the Media Player from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you not able to find the Media Player in the Programs list, then try to uninstall the Media Player complete and reinstall the Media Player to check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further please be informed that Windows 10 has a built in Media Player which will come by default. Use the task bar search to launch the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will address your query.</p>

            <p>Using file and folder permissions, you can set a person's user account to have or not have write access to a file.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example I could mark a file that "Shawn can edit" but "Ale can only read".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that wouldn't prompt for a password every time, it would just use whatever password you used to login to the computer (your user password).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want it to ask every time you open the file, you need to use a file format that allows passwords.&nbsp; This could be Word, Excel, PowerPoint or another Office file.&nbsp; To set a password on those, just click "Save As" and then the tools option in the save
 box will let you set passwords.&nbsp; You can set it so it's read-only for everyone unless they know the password and that makes it editable.</p>

    <title>Windows session crashes when the 64K limit for GDI handles are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenji shimizu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows session crashes when the 64K limit for GDI handles are reached.</h2>
                    <div>Hello.</div>
<div>I am experiencing Windows session crash when hit 64k limit of GDI handles.</div>
<div>After some investigation, I found steps of session crash.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. When hitting the theoretical limit of GDI handles, DWM crashes.</div>
<div>2. Windows 8 tries to restart DWM.(and fail, of course).</div>
<div>3. After some fail to restart DWM, Windows 8 terminates entire windows session.</div>
<div>4. Windows back to logon screen and I lost all work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Windows 7, Windows does not try to restart DWM so I can close some windows and then restart DWM.</div>
<div>But in Windows 8, as steps I posted above, I can't avoid session crash/lost work.</div>
<div>As a result, I cant use Windows 8 for work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't think increasing Windows global 64k GDI handle limit is possible,&nbsp;</div>
<div>despite it would be fundamental solution.</div>
<div>So, Is there any way Windows 8 to not try restart DWM when it crashes?</div>
<div>Or is there any other possible solution for this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sorry for my bad English.</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>

            <p>Geethu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you possibly suggest that the winforms group is a better place for this question? The winforms group is for developers with programming questions. This is not what the original poster is complaining about. This is clearly a Windows 8 problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong><br />
I can confirm what the original poster has stated. If you are running a lot of programs in Windows 8 and you start hitting GDI limits, the windows that are on-screen will stop rendering correctly. You will be unable to bring up the task manager to close programs.
 Eventually, the screen will change to your background color and will just stay like that for several minutes. Eventually, you will be presented with a new login screen.
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Windows 7 Behavior:</strong></p>
<p>This differs from how Windows 7 behaved. In Windows 7, when GDI limits were reached the display would become corrupted, but you can still find ways of closing applications to correct the problem, either through lucky clicking or using keyboard commands.
 This would allow a user to make the system usable again so that they could save their work.
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Windows 8 Behavior:</strong></p>
<p>In Windows 8, the system will not let you close things down. Once the display starts showing signs of drawing failures, the system prohibits any new input from the user until it has closed the session with a logoff and then asks the user to log in again.
<strong>This means that they user has NO opportunity to save their work prior to being forcibly logged off.</strong> As far as I know, this change of behavior is not publicly documented, and it seems that it may have been done to facilitate the handling of
 these situations on tablet-style devices. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a HUGE problem for me. I've been bitten by this repeatedly (at least&nbsp;3 times this week with intensive usage). There may be other scenarios that trigger similar outcomes as well. The only reason I'm not moving back to Windows 7 right now is because
 reinstalling everything back to how I like it is more time consuming that dealing with this problem. Whether a bug or by-design, it is certainly a problem with Windows 8.

            <p>This is happening to me on a regular basis (Windows 8). I tend to keep a lot of IE tabs/windows open for extended periods of time (days/weeks) and this seems to really tax my system (even with 8GB RAM).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am extremely frustrated&nbsp;due to all the lost work/research this has caused. Until&nbsp;I found this thread I had no idea what was causing this because the event logs never show anything and it's not a full system crash so no memory dumps are generated. It doesn't
 even show anything in the reliability history. I was thinking it was my graphics driver causing it (and maybe it is related? Nvidia.).</p>

            <p>I have to say, Microsoft did nothing about GDI Objects issues.</p>
<p>GDI Objects is the Big problem on Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, Windows 8's Explorer consumes too much GDI Objects resources and cause it easy to hit the per-process GDI Objects limit. For more detail, please visit my post:
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/explorerexe-reach-gdi-object-limits/b6ecd63a-4016-4e06-915d-dccd07479b5b?tm=1402075439978">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/explorerexe-reach-gdi-object-limits/b6ecd63a-4016-4e06-915d-dccd07479b5b?tm=1402075439978</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And, the 65536 total limit of Windows Session is not enough! I usually open many webpages using Google Chrome, you know, it is multi-process architecture, and the total GDI Objects usage of those Chrome.exe process could be huge! And then some time would
 hit the 65536 limit, as <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/07ffeb48-a234-49c2-ae1d-a12d9be44f1c" title="Kenji Shimizu">
Kenji Shimizu</a> said, DWM crash at this time. You guys must relax the limit!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem, I doubt DWM has GDI Objects leak problem. Just few days ago, I found DWM's GDI Objects consumes over 12000! You should curious about this number because the default process limit is 10000. Well, that is because I modified this limit up to
 20000 by editing Registry. But that's not the point. Over 12000 GDI Objects! That means DWM may has GDI Objects leak!</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fc6145e-c317-493b-aca5-5bc6dba642f1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to reproduce this problem, I just using 3 Web Browsers(IE, Firefox, Chrome) and opened many webpages especially by Chrome. And I usually Sleep the computer when I go to bed, In general, I won't shutdown the computer.</p>

            <p>That link you provided describes an unrelated issue because he says it always occurs 1-5 minutes of startup and only occurs once per session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2 year old unfixed bug in the Windows 8 OS is the one described in the 2012 link I provided above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if "there&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">has been many changes made to the operating system which has improved how the new version of Windows behaves and operates" then I should get those fixes via Windows Update and the problem

            <p>Chrome 37 now uses DirectWrite to render text instead of GDI. So, Chrome consumes less GDI Object Handles than ever before, because DirectWrite do not use GDI Handle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, this is a serious issue as you said. Microsoft should attach importance to this problem.</p>

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />My name is Edward, an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />If your battery icon in your systray is missing completely and you need to enable it, see our page dedicated to that subject. If you can see the icon, but it is grayed out, try the following steps to resolve the problem.
<br />
<br />
<br />1-Right-click on the clock by the notification area on the taskbar and select Customize Notification Icons.
<br />
<br />2-In the Notification Area Icons window, check the Power option and make sure it is set to Show icon and notifications.
<br />
<br />3-Click on Turn system icons on or off.
<br />
<br />4-Set the Power option to On if not already set.
<br />
<br />5-Click on OK to save the new settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />That didn't work, what should I do next?
<br />
<br />Scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />1-Open the Windows Device Manager.
<br />
<br />2-Click the Action menu at the top of the Device Manager window and select Scan for hardware changes.
<br />
<br />3-Expand the Batteries section in the Device Manager.
<br />
<br />4-Verify the Microsoft AC Adapter and Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery devices are displayed.
<br />
<br />5-Check the notification area on the Taskbar and see if the battery icon is now visible.
<br />
<br />6-If the battery icon is still greyed out, proceed to the next section.
<br />
<br />
<br />Disable and Re-enable Microsoft Drivers
<br />
<br />1-Open the Windows Device Manager.
<br />2-Expand the Batteries section.
<br />3-Right-click on the Microsoft AC Adapter and Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery devices and select the Disable option.
<br />4-Right-click on the two devices again and select Enable.
<br />5-Restart the laptop and see if the battery icon is now visible in the notification area on the taskbar.
<br />
<br />One possible fix for the battery icon missing issue is to update the BIOS on the laptop. You can check on the laptop manufacturer's website to see if there is an updated BIOS version available for your laptop. Follow the steps provided on the manufacturer website to download and install the BIOS update.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Kind Regards.

<br />This is a common problem in Windows. Right click the Taskbar&gt;Task Manager&gt;Processes tab&gt;Right click Windows Explorer and Restart.
<br />
<br />This should make the power icon show in the taskbar,

<h2>            Official Xbox Magazine Review</h2>
                    
<p>WORDS BY: Ryan McCaffrey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu14%2fcod4image147.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It certainly couldn’t have been easy for the check-signers at Activision to endorse the abandonment of Call of Duty’s World War II setting: the first-person-shooter series was synonymous with the Second Great War, and it’d been a multi-million seller since
 its PC debut in 2003. But ditch it they did, as developer Infinity Ward — who now tread on the same Elite Xbox Developer ground as Bungie and BioWare — has pressed the fast-forward button and brought gaming’s most popular Axis-versus-Allies experience into
 the present day, trading binoculars for laser sights and Hitler for a fictional Middle East president.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, what’s most surprising about Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is just how much better it is than the studio’s previous effort, Call of Duty 2. (Fellow Activision developer Treyarch handled Call of Duty 3.) The fact that Numero Dos was good enough
 to snap up an OXM Editors’ Choice award at the 360’s launch makes Modern Warfare’s evolution all the more amazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We liken the series’ switch to a hard-throwing baseball pitcher who learns to mix up his pitches. If you keep trying to throw as hard as you can, you can be successful for a while (CoD2), but eventually the hitters (gamers) will get wise and start to expect
 the same thing on the next pitch (CoD3). It’s when you learn to change speeds and upset the hitter’s timing that you transform from a one-year wunderkind into a superstar on your way to the Hall of Fame (CoD4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That stunning fastball variable at the pitcher’s mound is Infinity Ward’s crowning achievement: a “we-were-sick-of-WWII-too” breakthrough that delivers on every level and offers as much moment-to-moment, hour-to-hour, and week-to-week fun as anything the
 Xbox 360 has seen yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu11%2f10_10_21_58-image10_0.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SHIP SHAPE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call of Duty 4’s opening salvo can’t even be called a salvo — it’s simply not that loud — but it’s no less hard-hitting. Following a short training mission (which contains a timed obstacle course that should keep Achievement-mongers and
 leaderboard *** busy for some time), you’ll take up arms as British SAS recruit “Soap” MacTavish. You drop from a helicopter and onto the deck of a cargo ship listing at sea in the middle of a colossal rainstorm, ready for action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s on this see-sawing, seafaring vessel that Call of Duty 4 first serves notice of its graphical wow-factor. To say Modern Warfare’s visual fidelity is immediately apparent would be a criminal understatement. Torrid rainfall, rolling
 thunder, crackling lightning, and marvelously detailed textures and character models all combine to make you say “Whoa,” a word you’ll constantly repeat over the campaign’s 10-hour-or-so duration. But the impact of the amazing visuals is made all the more
 shocking by the constant 60-frames-per-second smoothness of the action, an irresistible combination previously claimed only by Team Ninja’s Ninja Gaiden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and a small team roll with your commanding officer, Captain Price, as you seek to disarm a stolen nuclear device that serves as the catalyst for the game’s plot. With Price constantly providing status updates and orders, you’ll move
 from room to room and hallway to hallway, stacking up at doors and clearing areas as if you’d accidentally slipped the Rainbow Six Vegas disc into your 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This inaugural mission is pulled off with a quiet intensity that belies the series’ “Loud, louder, loudest” mantra. You might even wonder if you’re really playing Call of Duty — a question that’s answered when the ship is struck by enemy
 MiG fighter planes and begins to severely list on its way to the bottom of the ocean. This event sets off a hurried escape where you’re almost literally running sideways, only to toss you into — and nearly out of — your extraction helicopter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As if it wasn’t all cinematic enough, credits scroll across the screen while you witness (from a first-person perspective, of course) a fictional President Al-Asad as he’s captured by radicals, shoved into a car, and taken through the
 civil war–torn streets of Azbereijan. Sure, having you control the opening cinematic is straight from the Half-Life and Riddick playbook, but it helps lend weight to the game’s story. It also foreshadows the variety you’ll experience, and sets up your actions
 for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu14%2fcod4image263.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTION JACKSON</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These first two segments alone trump any previous Call of Duty, but unlike some games that start strong but peter out, Modern Warfare manages to cram something awesome into each and every single-player mission. And somehow, each level
 seems to be more gorgeous than the last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In just the second mission, you’re introduced to night vision — another series first — as you move silently through a swamp before reaching a small village. There you’re given the go-ahead by Price to quietly execute bad guys using either
 your silenced weapon or a melee knife attack as you comb a pitchblack house in search of your captured informant — the same guy who tipped off your crew about the nuke on the cargo ship. Observant players will notice laptops scattered around each level; like
 Gears of War’s hidden Cogs, 30 of them are distributed throughout the game, and you’ll earn Achievements for collecting half of and then all of them. Furthermore, the more pieces of enemy intelligence you find, the more goofy cheats you unlock (see boxout).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout CoD4, you’ll split time playing as Soap and as U.S. soldier Sergeant Jackson. As Jackson, the capital city of Azad’s fictitious country in the bright afternoon sunshine is yours to travel and explore. Debris blows in the wind,
 smoke billows from burning buildings, low-flying jets scream directly overhead, rebels execute drive-by shootings from the flatbeds of beaten-up pickup trucks, and friendly helicopters circle in the sky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it comes to you amid all the noise and chaos — this is still a Call of Duty game, after all, giving you the signal that balls-to-the-wall action is not so much promised as 100-percent guaranteed. Again, though, the intensity doesn’t
 necessarily stem from a glut of trigger-happy enemies or the vehicles screaming by in Dolby surround sound. Instead, the Rainbow Six déjà vu rings loudly as you storm a television station thought to contain President Al-Asad. The shootout that takes place
 in the cubicle-cluttered newsroom has you dodging bullets and shards of glass, while hurling grenades straight back in enemies’ faces using the RB button. (Why you can only pick them up and throw them back instead of just kicking them, we’re not sure.) It’s
 all an absolute thrill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu14%2fcod4image28.jpg" /></p>


<p>THOROUGHLY MODERN GHILLIE</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don’t want to spoil all of the amazing moments you’ll experience during the campaign, but we’re compelled to share a few more highlights. Other notable spots include blowing up cars in urban shootouts; taking out enemy tanks with the
 high-arching Javelin missile launcher; saving teammates as they wrestle with enemies; being mauled by dogs; running through smoke grenades and planting C4 explosives on moving tanks; leveling buildings and squads of baddies from above in an AC-130 gunship
 (see image at right); peppering people with high-caliber explosive rounds from an attack helicopter’s gunner seat; and even a major catastrophe that’s bound to shock you as much as the end of the opening credits. And that’s to say nothing of the game’s end
 run, which mixes against-the-clock pressure, a high-speed car chase, a gratifying “*** you” payback, and a truly emotional moment with an ally before the final credits roll — after which you’d best not put down the controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we must give specific praise to “All Ghillied Up,” the final level of the second act. Armed with a silenced sniper rifle and decked out in a Ghillie suit (you’re basically a walking bush), you (in a flashback sequence as a young Captain
 Price) must make your way alongside Captain MacMillan to a distant building to try to snipe the game’s antagonist, Imran Zakhaev. Following your C.O., you can sneak by or silently shoot patrolling foes, all while avoiding detection. An Achievement awaits those
 who can make it through unnoticed, which requires you and MacMillan to snipe two chatty tangos simultaneously before the tensest moment in the game: having to lie still in a grassy field while a platoon of bad guys walking side-by-side — including a couple
 of tanks — stroll by just inches away from you. It’s not only a stellar stealth mission for a Call of Duty game and easily the best level in Modern Warfare; it’s also one of the finest stealth levels in any game we’ve ever played.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All told, the variety throughout Modern Warfare’s campaign brings the series back down to earth a bit. The ubiquitous chaos of the two previous iterations had grown a bit too comical and over-the-top. In Call of Duty 4, however, the wildly
 different flavors in pacing — and the fact that when characters die, you actually care — lend a welcome newfound narrative gravity to the franchise. The campaign is completely worthy of a 10 on its own, in fact; but it’s the multiplayer mode that solidifies
 the game’s instant-classic status and is one of the most compelling reasons you’ll be wired into Live for a long time to come.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WAR FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quality, quantity, and depth are the three primary and dominant reasons why Modern Warfare’s multiplayer mode stands toe-to-toe with anything else on the 360 — including Halo 3. The core gameplay is, as fans of Call of Duty 2 would expect,
 top-notch. Weapons are balanced, grenades are useful but not overpowered, and lag is nonexistent. But Call of Duty 4 takes a series-changing leap in the peripherals. Party system à la Halo? Check. An onslaught of quality game modes, including standard deathmatch,
 Search and Destroy, Domination, one-on-one duel, a one-shot/one-kill hardcore mode, a higher-jumping/weapons-via-pickup-only old-school mode, and old favorite Headquarters? Check. Matchmaking playlists? Check. Plenty of fun maps to game on? Try 16 of them
 out of the box! Four-player split-screen? Yep. How about RPG-like perks that give your character latent bonuses like the ability to reload faster, absorb more damage, or detect claymore mines through walls? Why, yes! Underpinning it all, however, is Modern
 Warfare’s fantastic online leveling system. Everything you do on the battlefield — get kills, make assists, complete objectives, and so on — earns you experience points that lead to new ranks. And earning promotions nets you rewards that are both instant (temporary
 radar, call in air strikes and choppers) and perpetually tangible (new weapons, attachments, matchmaking playlists, and create-a-class). You’re not simply unlocking just-for-show armor permutations à la Halo 3. You max out at level 55, but the goodies come
 well before and even after that point. At level 4 you unlock the aforementioned ability to create your own class. Choose your primary and secondary weapons, grenade type, and three of the aforementioned perks. You’ll have five slots to work with, plus the
 ability to give custom names to each. Believe it or not, that’s still not all. A wealth of challenges also await you — even at level 55. Complete tasks such as knifing five enemies or killing a near-dead foe with the melee damage of a grenade hitting them,
 and you’ll earn new weapon attachments such as laser sights and silencers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WE WIN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, Call of Duty 4 does everything right and nearly nothing wrong. But where it elevates itself above even the best 360 shooters is how all of the good stuff is ludicrously good. The campaign never lets up, while multiplayer is
 a triple-A affair in itself. Infinity Ward’s enthusiasm for being freed of World War II shines through in every moment of gameplay, and this swing for the fences has belted Call of Duty 4 way out of the park.</p>

    <title>WiFi Ethernet issues on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sergioterrazas  say:</h3>
<h2>            WiFi Ethernet issues on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone. Hope you can help me. After I've installed Windows 10 I' ve been experiencing issues with my wifi and ethernet connections. Both of them simply stopped working after I've upgraded. I've been forced to go back to Windows 8 and then upgrade again
 to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>I'm running a Laptop S855-S5382 Intel Core i7-3630QM CPU 2.40GHZ, 64Bits, 8GB RAM and a
<span>AMD Radeon(TM) HD 7680M Graphics 2GB DDR3</span>.</p>
<span>AMD Radeon(TM) HD 7680M Graphics 2GB DDR3</span>.</p>
<p>My Wifi connection is a Realtek RTL8723AE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC and my Ethernet connection is a Qualcomm Atheros AR8161 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.30)</p>
<p>I'v tried to use those USB wifi adapters but they don't seem to work either. I think is an issue related with drivers, but they don't seem to be available for windows 10 on the Toshiba Support web site, in fact NO DRIVERS for windows 10 seem to be available
 for the Toshiba S855-S5382, neverthelees it allows me to upgrade to windows 10 and this is the only problem I've had when I did it.</p>
<p>Right now I'm using Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi. Thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just receive news form Toshiba that they will not support my laptop model (S855-S5382) on Windows 10. In order to update to Windows 10 I surely must download the drivers from Qualcomm and Realtek (obviously both must be for Windows 10) but neither of
 them seem to have an update for my specific models: </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Realtek RTL8723AE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC</p>
<p>- Qualcomm Atheros AR8161 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.30)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what is worst none of those companies are replying to my mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If by any chance you guys have these updates or could tell me where I can get them it would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'll keep my fingers crossed and wait a little more, just in case Qualcomm and Realtek answer my mails. I've visited their websites and no luck, they don't offer an update for those drivers.(Yet)</p>
<p>Let's hope they do in a near future, if they don't then I'll try your suggestion.</p>

<p>I did try the termrec program at <a href="http://angband.pl/termrec.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://angband.pl/termrec.html</a>&nbsp;but I couldn't get it to quit, and when I force-quitted it from within task manager, the files it produced had no content.</p>

            Thanks for the reply!&nbsp; I am looking into Windows Media Encoder as a backup plan (in fact, it's the tab open just next to this one), but I'd prefer something less memory- and storage-intensive if possible since I'll be running and recording the game on
 an old laptop.&nbsp; From what I understand, since I am using a text-based terminal environment, there should be ways to record what's going on as text with timestamps, rather than pure video (and then there are programs which can play them back as if they were
 video).&nbsp; I've found plenty of such programs for unix environments, but I'm already committed to running the program I want to record through cmd.exe (and am not well-versed enough in the technical aspects of it to even know the proper name of what I'm looking
 for).

<p>Sorry but nothing can be done. lagging out of a game counts as quitting early. I know it's dumb because you aren't quitting early on purpose. best thing to do is see if you can fix your connection issues (open nat, wired connection, router issues, to many
 people online at the same time, etc.) should help the lag out issues. could try talking to your isp for help with connection issues.</p>

    <title>rear speakers not working with Forza 5 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            rear speakers not working with Forza 5</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>I have an Onkyo home theater (HT-S5600) which is 7.1, the sound with fifa 14 is brilliant and I get the full surround experience with 5 speakers working just fine and commentator sound from central speakers. It works fine whether settings is DTS, 5.1 uncompressed
 or 7.1 uncompressed.</p>

<p>My problem is with Forza 5, I can only get sound from the two front speaker and the center one, no sound from rear (or front high) what so ever. Its frustrating I didn't have this issue with Forza 4.</p>

<p>I tried changing settings in XBOX in sound settings but nothing worked, appreciate the help. I hooked xbox to home theater through HDMI and I have HDMI from home theater HDMI output to the TV.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the problem could be since you're getting audio when playing Fifa. I'm not having any problems with Forza 5 coming through all 5 speakers. Hope you can figure it out.

<p>Check if there is an in-game option for the speaker/audio configuration. It's possible that the game itself has defaulted to using only the front channels even though the Xbox One is set up to output 5.1 or 7.1.</p>

<p>Within Forza 5, at the top level menu go to FORZA PROFILE, then select AUDIO. &nbsp;Set the PLAYBACK SYSTEM to HOME THEATRE (not TV).</p>
<p>It took me a while to locate this, but it now works fine for me.</p>

                    Chrome Version:25.0.1364.68<br />
Operating System:Windows 7(home basic)<br />
<br />
<p>my chrome browser suddenly crashed and I certainly found that my system does not contain google chrome browser any more.there is no trace of chrome in windows program directory.<br />
after that i download the new chrome version 25+ &nbsp;and tried to install.but when I double click on the downloaded *.exe file the cursor shows system busy sign and then everything
<a href="http://quiet.no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">quiet.no</a> sign of <a href="http://installation.no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
installation.no</a> error msg.<br />
in this forum i found a suggestion that tells me to go to the windows registry and delete chrome related files.I tried that but no positive outcome i found.<br />
suggest me how i should get rid of that problem.</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

            this is not helpful. as chrome is just vanishes from my system and installation wizard is just came to screen and then vanishes.As I mentioned earlier no error msg displayed.so the given url has no value(as the url referred google's error msg containing
 page).<br />

            <p>Follow the info in the link to manually uninstall it, and any remnants, from the Registry and user folders.&nbsp; When your machine is clean of Chrome entries you can try installing it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you tried the System Restore it might put things back as they were before any problem occurred.</p>

    <title>Surface Book Dock and external monitors &#40;same problem many people - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nancy folsom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Dock and external monitors &#40;same problem many people have&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem from the beginning of having the Surface Book, though it was used to be fairly rare, and now it seems to be increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many other people have this problem it's absolutely maddening that we have no word on what to do about it. This is my business, not entertainment and it costs me hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Book connected via Surface dock to external monitors, two behaviors: screens occasionally flicker off-and-on a dozen or so times, then come back on steady.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more serious problem is the external monitors are sometimes not recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem happens overnight...I leave the computer on and everything connected, working fine, come back in the morning, wake the computer up, and the monitors aren't recognized. No Windows updates were applied overnight. The system hadn't rebooted over
 night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am almost certain the problem is in the laptop and not in the dock, cables, or monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two docks, when the problem occurs both docks will have the same (or almost the same) problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have replaced cables, I've swapped out monitors. The monitors are different brands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem doesn't occur when connected to the regular power adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the weird bit: when the problem happens, I can get a monitor to work if I plug it into the onboard mini-dvi port but not if the dock is connected. With nothing else attached, nothing hooked into the dock, connect the monitor, fine. Connect the dock,
 the monitor goes out. Disconnect the dock, the monitor is back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are events in the log about unrecognized USB device that is, I think, the dock. Hard to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "almost the same" is that the dock #1 can't be connected at all or the monitor doesn't work. However, today, with dock #2 I can connect it and have the ext. monitor connected directing in to the SB, but I cannot connect the monitor to the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't really matter which dock, because every time this thing happens, I swap around docks. Usually, eventually, the problem "goes away" and I can reconnect the ext. monitors to the dock. However, today, it's not resolving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Book running Windows 10 Pro -- yes all up-to-date since one doesn't actually have a say in the matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I've updated the docks' firmware.</p>
