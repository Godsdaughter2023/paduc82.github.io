<p>Perhaps the formula cells were pre-formatted as text. Format the cells with a suitable number format and then re-enter the formulas.</p>

    <title>No restore of a Windows 10 Mobile device backup on Onedrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _andyandy_  say:</h3>
<h2>            No restore of a Windows 10 Mobile device backup on Onedrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got stuck with a restore of Onedrive device backup which drives me crazy. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I owe two Lumias, both on the 10.0.14393.448 Windows 10 Mobile build. The first device is a 640XL (main) and the other one a 640 (secondary). The main device had been constantly backed up to Onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix some installation and memory issues on the main device, I decided one day to make a hard reset - but only if all my apps and settings can be restored afterwards automatically. To test it, I made a hard reset of the secondary device and advised the
 setup procedure to restore everything from the Onedrive main device backup. It was almost successful:&nbsp;the home screen wasn't restored but at least all the apps were automatically re-installed and all their settings were restored, too (among them lots of Opera
 Mini bookmarks which can't be synced in any other way). It was interesting to see that the restore procedure renamed the backup from its custom phone name to "Windows Phone" and later back to the custom phone name.<br />
</p>
<p>With good expectations I then made a hard reset on my main device and advised the setup procedure to restore from the same Onedrive backup. I was however embarrased by the fact that some app settings were not restored (and Opera Mini bookmarks among them).
 I repeated the hard reset several times with no (better) effect. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I decided to update the Onedrive device backup from the secondary phone and make another hard reset on my main device. No effect either, again only some app settings were restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I decided to delete the Onedrive backup (which was the only one in my account), create a new backup from the scratch from my secondary phone and to try to restore my main device from this new backup. And this is where much bigger troubles came
 true...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new backup didn't show in my Onedrive account in spite that the backup creation procedure on the phone was successful. I repeated the backup creation dozens of times, making soft resets, switching all backup options off an on. Suddenly, next day a backup
 finally showed in the Onedrive account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I made another hard reset on my main device and advised it to restore from that completely new backup. As a result, literally NOTHING was restored at all. The phone is signed in into my Microsoft account but its state is as if it is a completely new phone.
 And the Onedrive backup name remained changed from my custom one to "Windows Phone". Repeated this procedure several times with the same negative result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, Microsoft, anybody?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Phone Backup feature will only backup the settings of participating apps. This is the reason some of the restored apps in your phone is configured in its default state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern about the newly created back up that didn't show in your OneDrive account, it may have some delay for the complete back up to be available. Just wait for the back up to be available and once it is, you can restore from that back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>

</p><p>Hi Joe Men and thanks for your reply. I followed your recommendation and allowed about 10 hours between a full backup on the first device and a restore on the other device. Unfortunately no effect. I'm able to select a backup to restore, but in the end I'm
 getting a clean phone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that some apps don't support a settings backup (for Opera Mini, I'm sure that its settings can be backuped as their very first restore was successful). However at the moment not just the settings, but also the apps aren't re-installed automatically
 during the restore process. The restore is somehow ignorant about currently installed apps on the phone from which the backup was done. I waited for some hours but invain. I remember from a successful restore that a full app list appeared immediately after
 the restore, with apps in the installation queue greyed out. This is not the case anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andy</p>

            <p>Just to give a feedback. Indeed the Onedrive backup has a very very long latency, measured in days! In the end I managed to create a new backup after deleting all old ones and this new backup contains settings of all apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you delete an old backup, you have to wait 1-2 days until you can create a new backup from the same device again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you create a backup from one device and want to restore it on another device, you have again to wait 1-2 days between backup and restore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you make a backup for the first time and it says complete on the device, it is not compete in fact. You have to wait hours or days and repeat the backup if you want to be sure that it is really complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's incredibly inconvenient. Microsoft, I want an offline backup!</p>

<p>well if you bothered to read the screen of your computer it says on the updater while updating DONT PANIC if the screen turns black or if it says the phone is disconected so now your phone doesnt have any settings or anything so you will have to take it
 to where you brought and ask if it can be repaired if it is still under warranty alternatively you can ring up nokia customare care and see what they can do..</p>

    <title>Why do single Explorer windows cascade in Win 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madmax_1998  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do single Explorer windows cascade in Win 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Window cascading has been a part of the OS forever and makes sense if you have more than one window of the same application open. Example: one Explorer window is open and you open a second one, it's cascaded below the first one. I get why this happens, but:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Windows 10 (any build) cascade SINGLE Explorer windows every time I open one? It's like, I open Explorer, move it to the center, close it, reopen it and it moves downward. Why does this happen? It makes zero sense!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a huge issue, but I wanted to bring it to your attention, Microsoft. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Hyperlinks from Excel to .JPG files are opening in an explorer window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyhack22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlinks from Excel to .JPG files are opening in an explorer window instead of the default program</h2>
                    My default program to open .JPG files is set to windows picture and fax viewer<br />
I use excel a lot and have many hyperlinks to .JPG files and other excel workbooks. Since the upgrade to ie8 when clicking a hyperlink from excel to a .JPG file it opens in an internet explorer window instead of the default program. I have had this problem
 before using ie7 and it was cured with a registry entry in<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Common\Internet:<br />
DWORD ForceShellExecute = 1<br />
<br />
Adding this Dword does in fact cure the problem and hyperlinks to picture files now open in the default program. However it causes another more irratating problem in that hyperlinks from within excel to other excel workbooks do not open and in fact cause excel
 to hang, once a hyperlink to an excel workbook has been clicked I cannot even open excel workbooks directly. Removing the Dword from the registry and rebooting returns it back to the original state.<br />
<br />
I really need to be able to open both file types via hyperlinks and have searched for an answer without success&nbsp;so would be really grateful for an answer.<br />

            Varun J,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answer. I have tried your suggestions without success. In fact I have also tried this on a new clean installation of win XP with office as the only other program installed thereby eliminating third party problems.<br />
<br />
I have posted this on the office discussion group as you suggest though I suspect it will not be answered there as I think this is an ie8/windows problem.<br />
<br />
Incidently I have temporarily overcome the problem by uninstalling ie8, with ie7 both hyperlinks work.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time.<br />
<br />
Andy

<h2>            Lumia phone storage problem</h2>
                    Hi. I have a Lumia 640xl phone and cannot free up any storage on the device. I have moved every app possible to my sd card and deleted all apps that i can from the phone itself. But I still don't have enough memory to update to latest version of windows
 10. What can i do? I had this problem once before but can't&nbsp; remember&nbsp; the solution. Thanks!

<p>So it sounds to me that it is a memory issue. I'm not a believer in moving apps as a rule, it never frees up a lot of space. If it were me, I would Hard Reset.</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>So if it were my device I would hard reset a&nbsp;<span>so everything is wiped then set it up with the
<strong>SAME LIVE ID</strong> a</span>nd start fresh. It is the easiest and fastest way to accomplish what you need to do. I would
<strong>NOT restore from a backup</strong> but rather start fresh! Just make sure that you have saved any important docs and pictures to OneDrive or on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reset and before you install ANY new apps, install the updates then slowly add back the apps you must have keeping an eye on memory. When there is not a lot of memory on a device initially, it is easy to eat it all up. Be careful on how much you
 install to keep your device running smoothly.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you do a hard reset, I would also delete everything from the memory card (except pictures, Music and docs) before you reinstall and I would install applications to the main memory. I only
 use the memory card for storage of pictures, documents, and music. However, I do install a few apps (3-5 usually) that I rarely use to my memory card.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">BTW, turn off reset protection BEFORE you hard reset if it is enabled on your device.
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Just my thoughts....</span></p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get into my email account from most browsers. I get a page stating security info change.</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Did you request security info change?&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need help with my Hotmail email account. I can't get into my email account from most browsers because when I sign in...if it even allows me to, a page comes up that asks if<strong> I requested a security info change?
</strong>&nbsp;I really don't even know what that means to begin with, &nbsp;but I do have a Gmail account as my backup account. &nbsp; Whether I reply yes or no, it states that if I verify my email address correctly, that a code will be sent to me. &nbsp;Well although I follow
 the directions and verify my email address, and my phone number is on file with Hotmail/Outlook, I am not receiving a code either by phone and it would be of no use &nbsp;if it was sent to my email, &nbsp;so in my case, that solution is absolutely useless. Plus, it
 leaves no other option if the code is not received.&nbsp; I just keep going around in circles. &nbsp;I'm afraid of turning off my computer at home because I fear never again having access to my email once I log off. &nbsp;I cannot open it up on a different tab on the same
 browser and forget about trying on a different browser. &nbsp;I went to the help forum and found a similar problem, but it wouldn't let me reply... however, the solution given on that forum was pretty much the one I have already mentioned that does not appear to
 work in my case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been with Hotmail since 1999 and have all my accounts (bills,important notices, etc.) tied to this account and rely on my email more than you know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any response from your support team or anyone that can help me out will have to go to my
<strong>Gmail </strong>address: <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</strong>because I don't know how much longer I'll have Hotmail logged on before someone in my household accidentally turns off my computer and then there goes my last remaining access to my email. &nbsp; This is so disappointing...I never thought I would not have
 any way of accessing my account and just found out that there is NO phone support for customer issues. &nbsp;I also have another account with you: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** which all my junk mail goes to and I can't access that one for the same
 reason. &nbsp;I understand and appreciate the security provided, but it shouldn't be to the point that the user is completely shut out as well. &nbsp; PLEASE HELP!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and time.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I am having the same issue and Hotmail is using an old email security account from years ago and I cant figure how to change this. I have sent an email to support but like this thread have had no response. Some help or support would be nice but it may be

    <title>Lumia 640 signal strength fluctuating when data enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikhail st  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 640 signal strength fluctuating when data enabled</h2>
                    <p>Just want to share my experience with Lumia 640 experiencing signal strength fluctuations and cutting out&nbsp;audio in a middle of a phone call. The exact model is Lumia 640 Dual sim, running Windows Phone 8.1 update 2. &nbsp;Mobile service provider is TPG in Australia
 operating on the Vodafone network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been months since the audio started dropping in the middle of a call (mostly I cannot hear the other party). Observing the signal bars I could see that when the call audio drops out, signal strength drops from say, 4 down to 1 bar. Within 5-15 seconds,
 the signal would come back to 4 bars at which point the audio in the call would resume?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was clear that these random signal strength fluctuations were not due to strong electromagnetic noise and/or interference because they happened regardless of where the phone was used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried different things and could not figure out the problem until I inserted a second SIM which, same as the first one, operates on the Vodafone network. I could now see that although both SIM cards were on the same network, the signal strength on the
 first one continued to randomly fluctuate whereas the second one was sitting rock solid on 5 bars at all times!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fiddling with the settings, I discovered that WHICHEVER SIM CARD WAS SELECTED FOR DATA was the one show signal strength fluctuations (Settings &gt; mobile+SIM &gt; SIM for data connection). When I set SIM1 to be used for data, SIM1 starts showing signal strength
 fluctuations whereas SIM2 has a rock solid 5 bars! Change the setting so that SIM2 is used for data, the opposite happens. SIM2 signal starts playing up, whereas SIM1 works like a charm!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would DATA impact signal strength?!?!? Go figure....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to this DATA "interference", the phone was also unable to use 4G (although it was without a doubt in a strong 4G reception zone);
</p>
<p>As a compromise, I tried changing maximum data speed down to 2G, after which the internet didn't work, however signal strength was now more stable?! This leads me to believe that this is a software fault. I will try to roll back the OS to the previous version
 and see if anything changes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post my findings here and hopefully this will help someone out there and get Microsoft to fix this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>While troubleshooting, please keep in mind that the secondary SIM is always on 2G (GSM) in a Lumia Dual-SIM phone. (Either one can be on 3G/4G but the other is restricted to 2G).<br />
While troubleshooting the call drop-outs I suggest use a single SIM only, to avoid any potential dual-SIM issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you consult the mobile provider?<br />
4G/LTE is work in progress, and it may be advisable to replace the SIM cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also consider bring the phone for assessment while it is in warranty, if the issue persists regardless of location, and in a confirmed good coverage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Hi Cvitalo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the issue on 8.1 (as I stated in the first paragraph) and the issue continued after I upgraded the phone on Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one of the previous posts, @Hpholm suggested replacing the SIM card. I gave the phone to my partner and she experienced the same issue (same provider, but another SIM card, of course).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never tried the phone with a different service provider. Maybe with a super-strong signal the phone won't need to "roam" between transmitters and maintain the connection?!?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally gave up on this sad piece of technology and in anger went to the nearest shop and bought a Samsung Galaxy S6. SAME SIM CARD, SAME PROVIDER, SAME LOCATIONS OF USE - NO ISSUES WHATSOEVER!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I could not give you more optimistic news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            Thanks for the fast reply. I have a friend who has a single sim card lumia 640 (or uses only one card) and he has no problems. I just tried turning off the cellular option during the call and after a half hour conversation I didn't have any problems. So
 this is like some half-solution. Maybe if there is the app that turns off data traffic after receiving the call and turns on after ending the call, that could be a acceptable.

            <p>Yes, turning mobile data off does seem to alleviate the issue. If you have no other alternatives and you are still hopeful for a software fix, by all means try that. You can just swipe from the top down and turn mobile data on or off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not convinced that a 21st century telephone should need a hack to make a simple phone call, though.</p>
<p>Hence I am leaving the Lumia world indefinitely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck Cvitalo</p>

    <title>How to recover the archive mailbox after its Exchange Online mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deanchen- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to recover the archive mailbox after its Exchange Online mailbox is disabled&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>hope i can get some&nbsp;answers here after did some research but couldn't find the right answer. the question starts with our user separation process.</p>
<p>we have a hybrid environment that has on-premises exchange 2010. our users' mailboxes are in exchange online. we enable the archive mailbox for users' mailbox. during the user separation, we disabled on-premises user ad accounts for a few months, and&nbsp;we
 disabled its exchange online mailbox via emc on exchange 2010 by right-clicking the mailbox and choosing disable.
</p>
<p>here is the question. after disabling the exchange online mailbox, its archive mailbox's attribute value&nbsp;such as "achivedatabase" and "archiveguid" were wiped out. we can run "get-mailbox name | fl "*archive*" to confirm them. because of these values are
 wiped out, how can we&nbsp;recover the archive mailbox? we can restore its exchange online mailbox but i don't see there is a way to recover its archive mailbox.</p>
<p>therefore, my questions:</p>
<p>1) can we&nbsp;recover the archive mailbox after its archive attribute values are wiped out, and how? it is an evitable request from managers or co-workers to retrieve the emails from the separated user and we may have to recover the archive mailbox to get them</p>
<p>2) what is the appropriate way to reserve (backup)&nbsp;the data in the archive mailbox? if archive mailbox has hundreds gb or&nbsp;even more&nbsp;data (because its size is unlimited), it is not practical to save&nbsp;such huge data&nbsp;to an .pst file.</p>

<p>thanks,</p>
<p>dean</p>

<p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>The mailbox’s data will be kept during the in-place hold period, even if you remove the associated license. If the license is gone, the eDiscovery search will be the only tool that can find the held data.</p>

<h2>            Setting default lock screen images to Spotlight with only one user</h2>
                    <p>I'm the only user on this PC, but the lock screen image when I'm not logged in is a system default one. I understand there is a difference between a user-specified one and a system-wide one. Is there a way to show my lock screen (Windows Spotlight) even
 after logging out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do this because I really like these photos, but the only way I can see them is if I log in first and lock the PC, which I pretty much never do. I can't just turn the PC on and see the images.</p>

<p>Hi Peet,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The most important difference between them is that Office 365 Business premium has Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business and Yammer cloud services while Office 365 Business doesn't
 have. For the detailed comparison, see: </span><a href="https://products.office.com/en/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Get the most from Office with Office 365</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your situation that you have three employees, please consider the following:</p>
<p>1.If you only need cloud service online storage, consider Office 365 Business essentials.</p>
<p><span>2.If you only need Office client and online storage, consider
</span><span>Office 365 Business</span></p>
<p>3.If you need both client and online service plus storage, consider Office 365 Business premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before purchasing, you can try for free to see which meets your requirement best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sky </p>

<h2>            How do I get an Access 2010 combo box to place a selection in another table&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
<span>Okay—so I have beaten my brains out trying to figure out what seems to be a simple thing.</span></p>
<span>Okay—so I have beaten my brains out trying to figure out what seems to be a simple thing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The brief personal background: I am reasonably confident around computers and have written simple programs in various languages, but I am
 not a day-by-day IT professional. I can get all the other applications in Office to do what I need (and maybe a bit more), but Access refuses to be tamed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The work so far: I have created a database with four tables. The basic table structure and relevant fields are:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Item =&gt; itemID (AutoNumber), itemName</span></p>
<p><span>Area =&gt; areaID (AutoNumber), areaName</span></p>
<p><span>Description =&gt; descriptionID (Autonumber), descriptionNote</span></p>
<p><span>Link =&gt; linkID (AutoNumber), linkItemID, linkAreaID, linkDescriptionNoteID</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have created the following relationships:</span></p>
<p><span>itemID (one) to linkItemID (many)</span></p>
<p><span>areaID (one) to linkAreaID (many)</span></p>
<p><span>descriptionNoteID (one) to linkDescriptionNoteID (many)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I created a query with these fields: itemName, areaName, and descriptionNote. This allowed me to add test data. Since the ID data gets written
 to the Link table in this process I assume that my basic database structure is workable.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The test data goes something like:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>itemName =&gt; Pencil, Pen, Marker, Brush, Chalk</span></p>
<p><span>areaName =&gt; Desk, Office, Garage, Kitchen</span></p>
<p><span>descriptionNote =&gt; Red, Blue, Green, Yellow</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For record entry I have attempted to make a form with three combo boxes, one for each data item I am trying to enter. There seems to be
 no reason to duplicate such basic snippets of information over and over. I have made queries with two columns (ID and field) that remove any duplication (if they occurred). Using these queries I can get the combo boxes to display the selection lists I want
 (via RecordSource). I know that the ID code is within each combo box even though that column is hidden.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My problem is that I cannot figure out how to get the combo boxes to enter the appropriate ID’s into the 3 Link table ID fields. The form/combo
 box wizard mentions “saving” this for future use, but it does not indicate the steps to take after I hit “Finish.” Similarly, the posts and tutorials I have plowed through are overwhelmingly focused on how to get a combo box to display on a form—not how to
 make it work after it is there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So if some kind soul would comment on my database structure (if needed), explain the steps for getting the ID codes to write to the Link
 table, and (while I am at it) instruct me how to get new data entered in the combo box into the respective tables--I would greatly appreciate it. I have been around the ControlSource property and got nothing but error messages… The wizard produced combo boxes
 left this property blank. I have read that I will have to “requery” to produce the selection lists after adding new data—but there’s no reason to work on that if the rest of my approach is flawed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            The combo box gets its ROW SOURCE from that lookup table (for example AREAS).&nbsp; You then have a form which is bound (RECORD SOURCE set to the LINK table and the combo has its CONTROL SOURCE property set to the field in the form's Record Source.

            That's because you either chose the wrong option in the Wizard or you are using an Unbound form. The combobox Wizard should offer a choice to Save it to a field you select. If it doesn't offer that option, then the problem is that you are using an Unbound
 form with no Recordsource.
<div><br />
<div>Unbound forms have a place, but they require that you write the I/O between the form and the tables.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fact that you had to ask this question indicates that your knowledge level at this point is not up to the task of using Unbound forms.&nbsp;</div>

            Based on my understanding of your response:<br />
<br />
1) I set the Record Source property for the entire form to the Link table (it looks like this was the missing step I needed).<br />
2) The Row Source for each combo box is already set to the respective (Item, Area, Description) queries.<br />
3) The Control Source for the combo boxes is now set to respective ID field in the Link table.<br />
<br />
Entering more test data using the form now produces the results I was looking for.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your timely and to the point response.<br />

            Although you've reached a solution it might be helpful to review the issue in a little more detail as there are one or two points arising from your post which have not been addressed:<br />
<br />
The only real reason for basing the form on a query, as you seem to have done originally, would be if you wanted the rows (records)&nbsp; in the form ordered by some value.&nbsp; As columns (fields) in the Link table contain arbitrary numeric values, with no semantic
 significance whatsoever, then there would be little point in using a query on that table alone.&nbsp; You might as well make the RecordSource property of the form the name of the table itself.<br />
<br />
If you do want the rows ordered then you'd have to include at least one of the referenced tables in the query.&nbsp; Say you want the rows ordered by item name, the query for use as the form's RecordSource property would be:<br />
<br />
SELECT Link.*<br />
FROM Link INNER JOIN Item<br />
ON Link.linkItemID&nbsp; = Item.itemID<br />
ORDER BY itemName;<br />
<br />
The combo boxes in the form would, as you appear to understand, have the hidden key column as the bound column, so if we take the combo box for items as an example it would be set up as follows:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linkItemID &nbsp;<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT itemID, itemName FROM Item ORDER BY itemName ;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the last one.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.&nbsp; You do not need to include a value for the second column's dimension.&nbsp;
 It's only necessary to include further column width values if more than one column in addition to the key column is returned, in which case you also need to set the ListWidth property to the sum of the ColumnWidths dimensions, e.g. with a ColumnWidths property
 of 0cm;2cm;3cm the LisatWidth property would be 5cm.<br />
<br />
The other two combo boxes would be similarly set up.<br />
<br />
If you do use wizards for tasks like this you should try and understand just what the wizard is doing.&nbsp; Wizards should be used to cut out the drudgery, not as a substitute for understanding.&nbsp; Hand crafting combo boxes like this is such a&nbsp; simple procedure,
 however, that I can't see any need to use the wizard at all. <br />
<br />
One further point about the Link table is that there is almost certainly no good reason to have an autonumber primary key column. The other three columns constitute a candidate key, so can be made the composite primary key of the table.&nbsp; If you do have a separate
 'surrogate' key, however, then, it is imperative that the other three columns, as a candidate key, be included in a single unique index.&nbsp; Otherwise there is nothing to prevent invalid duplication of data.<br />
<br />
Finally, when using combo boxes like this you may need to enter a new value not yet represented by a row in the referenced table, e.g. a new item.&nbsp; For this you can put code in the combo box's NotInList event procedure which enables you to type the new item
 name directly into the combo box for a new row to be inserted into the Item table.&nbsp; You'll find a examples of the use of the NotInList event procedure in various contexts in the demo file NotInList.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

            I am trying something similar and am not having any luck... I have one table that has multiple columns in which I have entered the team members that will be assigned.
<div><br />
<div>Category / Brand / Line</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything starts with the Category selection. Once the Category is selected - the Brand drop down should then be populated with only the brands for that category. Once the Brand is selected, then the Lines for that Brand should be available in its drop
 down.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From the Line selection - the 8 assigned team members for that Category / Brand / Line combination should then show in their respective combo boxes. These 8 team members are also in the same table.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For category, I have the following in Row Source:</div>
<div>SELECT DISTINCT [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams].[Category] FROM [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams] ORDER BY [Category];&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>For Brand, I have the following in Row Source:</div>
<div>SELECT DISTINCT [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams].[Brand] FROM [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams] ORDER BY [Brand];&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>For Line, I have the following in Row Source:</div>
<div>SELECT [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams].[Line] FROM [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams] ORDER BY [Line];&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Currently, all three show the correct info in each - but as above, I need only the necessary Brands and Lines to appear as you move from one selection to the other.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for the 8 Team Members - I too have distinct selections - here is sample:</div>
<div><br />
<div>SELECT DISTINCT [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams].[SBM] FROM [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams] ORDER BY [SBM];&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Each drop down is pulling correct info when selected but needs to populate based on Category / Brand / Line selections above.</div>

            First, for future reference, please don't piggyback your question on another thread. This can cause confusion.
<div><br />
<div>Your Category RowSource is fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Brands should be:</div>
<div><br />
<div>SELECT DISTINCT [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams].[Brand] FROM [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams]&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>WHERE Category = Forms!formname!category</b></div>
<div>ORDER BY [Brand];&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Line should be:</div>
<div>SELECT [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams].[Line] FROM [tbl-List-BrandsandTeams]&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>WHERE Brand = Forms!formname!Brand</b></div>
<div>ORDER BY [Line];&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>in other words, you need to restrict each RowSource by the selection of the previous combo. You may also need to requery each combo after the previous value is selected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That being said, I think you have design issues with your tables. If you have a field for each of 8 Assigned team members, then you have a repeating group which violates normalization rules. Also, you should have a separate lookup table for the Category/Brand/Line
 and just have a foreign key for Line in your data table.</div>
<div><br />

            In the current all-in-one table, I have from left to right the columns for the selections - starting with:
<div><br />
<div>Category / Brand / Line - then each team role: Marketer / PM / Ops - etc. This table is fairly static as the role assignment changes rarely. Are you saying that I need a separate table for Category, Brand and Line - with the Line table holding the team
 assignments?</div>

            What I don't follow is how you get the Team members. Are Team Members restricted to a Line or can they work with multiple Lines? The team members table should look like this:
<div><br />
<div>tblTeammember</div>
<div>TeamMemberID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>LineID (FK)</div>
<div>RoleID (FK)</div>
<div>MemberID (FK)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should have lookup tables for Roles and Members.</div>

            And this table is not properly normalized. The way this should be done is with several other tables.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>tluCategory</div>
<div>CategoryID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>Category</div>
<div><br />
<div>tluBrand</div>
<div>BrandID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>Brand</div>
<div>CategoryID (FK)</div>
<div><br />
<div>tluLine</div>
<div>LineID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>Line</div>
<div>BrandID (FK)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You could combine the above into one table, But I wouldn't</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then you would need:</div>
<div>tluRole</div>
<div>RoleID</div>
<div>Role</div>
<div>RoleCode</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblStaff</div>
<div>StaffID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>FirstName</div>
<div>Lastname</div>
<div>other staff info</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, you have</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>tblTeammember</div>
<div>TeamMemberID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>LineID (FK)</div>
<div>RoleID (FK)</div>
<div>MemberID (FK)</div>
<div><br />
<div>And they way this works, is you have a main form and subform. The main form is unbound the subform is bound to tblTeamMember. On the main forum you have three unbound comboboxes where you select Category, Brand and Line. The Rowsources would look like
 this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>SELECT CategoryID, Category FROM tluCategory&nbsp;</div>
<div>ORDER BY Category;</div>
<div><br />
<div>SELECT BrandID, Brand FROM tluBrand</div>
<div>WHERE BrandID = Forms!formname!cboCategory</div>
<div>ORDER BY Brand;</div>
<div><br />
<div>SELECT LineID, Line FROM tluLine</div>
<div>WHERE LineID = Forms!formname!cboBrand</div>
<div>ORDER BY Line;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The control on the subform bound to LineID would have a default value of&nbsp;</div>
<div>Forms!mainform!cboLine</div>
<div><br />
<div>The RoleID would have a RowSource of:</div>
<div>SELECT RoleID, Role FROM tluRole ORDER BY Role;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And a combo for the member with a RowSource of</div>
<div><br />
<div>SELECT StaffID, Lastname &amp; ", " &amp; Firstname AS Fullname</div>
<div>FROM tblStafe</div>
<div>ORDER BY Lastname, Firstname;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you didn't answer as to how Staff would be restricted by Line, I can't tell you how that would work.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Hyperlink does not resolve correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nispio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlink does not resolve correctly</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to generate hyperlinks to a Mantis Bug Tracker issue on my company's server.&nbsp; My formula looks something like this:</p>
<p>=HYPERLINK(CONCATENATE("http://bugs.example.com/mantis/view.php?id=";A2);"View Issue")</p>
<p>The problem is that, for some reason, when I click the link, it first carries me to this URL: "http://bugs.example.com/mantis/login_page.php?return=%2Fmantis%2Fview.php%3Fid%3D3173", which then redirects me to the home page.</p>
<p>When I copy and paste the link into my browser, it goes directly to the correct page.&nbsp; When I try Start-&gt;Run and enter the link, it opens a new instance of my browser, and opens the page correctly.&nbsp; I have tried this with Internet Explorer and FireFox, both
 with the same results.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I saved my worksheet, opened it in OpenOffice.Org Calc, and clicked on the hyperlink, and it opened correctly.&nbsp; Only Excel is messing this up.</p>
<p>Is it possible that Excel is converting my slashes to %2F, and my question marks to %3F, etc. and that is the cause of the problems?&nbsp; If so, is there anything I can do to make sure that Excel opens the hyperlink,<em>exactly as I entered it?</em></p>
<p>Any tips would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; If anybody has any intimate knowledge of what Excel is doing under the hood when it opens it's hyperlinks, that also might be helpful in resolving this issue.</p>

<p>The issue has been resolved... by accident.</p>
<p>We updated our Mantis Bug Tracker version from 1.1.6 to 1.2.2, and changed the database address from "http://bugs.example.com/mantis/" to "http://bugs/" and it magically started working.&nbsp; I don't know if had something to do with address change or (more likely)
 the version update.</p>
<p>I still find it odd that it was working all along on OpenOffice.Org Calc, and not on Excel.&nbsp; There must be some fundamental difference in the way they handle hyperlinks, and I would still be interested to know what that difference is.</p>
<p>If anyone else should encounter a similar problem, my suggestion for a workaround would be to open the sheet in OpenOffice to make the links work properly.</p>

<p>You were slightly misinformed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPT does not export directly to a Word file type. To Export the <em>slide text</em> (no graphics) contained in Placeholders (not Text Boxes or Shapes) in Outline form you have to select
<strong>Rich Text Format (.rtf)</strong> which is compatible with Word. Once you open the file with Word you can use
<strong>Save As</strong> to create a new version in the .<em>docx</em> file type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no provision in the program to Export the Notes associated with slides in any sort of file. There may be a VBA method but I haven't seen it. It's also possible that a 3rd party product [such as Scripter] may do the job, but they aren't cheap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: The version you cited (15.24) is out of date by well over 2 years. In all probability your version of
<strong>Microsoft AutoUpdate</strong> [<strong>MAU</strong>] is obsolete as well. Use this link to retrieve the MAU 4.4 update. Once you install it
<em>Restart</em> your Mac then launch one of the Office programs. As long as you have an active internet connection you should be prompted to apply the appropriate most recent updates for Office 2016, or you can go directly to
<strong>Help&gt; Check for Updates</strong> if you aren't immediately prompted.</p>

<br />
You've tagged your post with Microsoft Project as a product and I'm guessing you are using Access for the ADP project, not Project.<br />
<br />
Edit your post and select "Microsoft Access"&nbsp; or consider posting to the forum for SQL Server 2008 at:<br />

    <title>is it possible to block update 9860&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulwallin  say:</h3>
<h2>            is it possible to block update 9860&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've installed build 9841 on a test machine (32-bit). I had a friend download the ISO because i only have a wifi internet connection (with a limited download cap). I use a 3G dongle on a router, and my client PC is wired to the router, so as far as the PC
 is concerned, it is LAN connected.<br />
<br />
Installing 9841 went very smoothly, but now that the new build (9860) is out, and since automatic updates are forced on, I'm stuck. Even though it would have been a big bite out of my limited data cap, I attempted to get the update (which i believe is about
 2+Gb).<br />
<br />
I force the update before bedding down, but the link must have dropped sometime through the night. The download process gave no indication of how far through it got, and I don't know if another attempt will continue off where it dropped out, or start a fresh
 download.<br />
<br />
Q1 how can I found out how much of the update was downloaded before hanging?<br />
Q2 is there a way to resume an interrupted download<br />
<br />
feature request: please provide more feedback during the download process (e.g. total data volume to be downloaded, progress amount downloaded)</p>

            <p>Win10TP wasn't meant as a path for people to just get a free new OS.&nbsp; It is to help test and report bugs.&nbsp; Part of that testing is everyone on the same page, same build level.&nbsp; You get the good with the bad.&nbsp; Yes, you have to (should want to) take the 9860,
 and whatever else comes along.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>in hindsight I chose a really poor subject for my question - I apologise for the confusion I caused :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DO</strong></span> want to get the update, but I'm having great trouble because of my poor internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping to find out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: how far through the download I got before it stopped, and</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: if it is possible to resume a partial download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if I leave my Win10TP PC on and connected, it will continue to attempt to download (and presumably fail), chewing up my limited internet cap, which is the only reason I want to block it for now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>my other alternative is to pick up my PC and travel from my regional area to a friends place to get access to more bandwidth. not very convenient ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; people to just get a free new OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;own about 8 machines all with valid paid-for licences, and I support about 30 family and friends, all on various versions of Windows, all with valid paid-for licences. I am definitely not just after a free OS. I've been on many Microsoft betas as far back
 as Chicago (yep, that was Win95), and I want to actively participate in the Win10 Technical Preview ....</p>

            <p>Hi Paul</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go to PC Settings and open the Preview Builds section, what do you see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see a Install Now button, then the download completed and you can use that button to install the 9860 Build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a drop down menu that you can use to delay the install for a number of hours. I believe it can be delayed for up to 12 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is still a Download Button, then the download did not complete for some reason. You should be able to resume the download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what you find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, I never did see the Install Now button. In hindsight I should have taken a screen dump before shutting down, but I'm pretty sure there was a message allow the lines of "download failed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; You should be able to resume the download</p>
<p>
</p><p>that's encouraging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>do you know if there's anyway to find out where the partially downloaded file might be hiding</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really like to get an idea of how far through the 2+Gb download it got before failing.</p>

            We use the Background Intelligent Transfer Service to download the .ESD file, so it will pick up wherever it leaves off rather than starting over. There's no easy way to determine how far along it is, but if you click the Download Now button in PC Settings,
 Update and Recovery, Preview Builds you can just use your system normally and check back periodically. When you see the button change to Install Now you know the .ESD has been downloaded.&nbsp;

            <p>Well one way to find out the amount downloaded is to use the explorer to go to
</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download</p>
<p>
</p><p>There you will find many folders, one of having a max. size of 2.58 GB (or less depending on how much you have downloaded.) Also the time and date gets updated periodically.</p>

            <p>Sayak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for that pointer ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are two subfolders in C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download that seem to have content downloaded when I try to update the preview build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>one has two copies of a BIT*.TMP file that has a size of 104,426,240 bytes, the other has two copies of a BIT*.TMP file that has a size of 2,245,292,302 bytes (note: I've been trying to update a 32-bit OS, not the 64-bit OS). date stamps suggest that these
 are in fact related to the update attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my last two attempts have resulted in the message "Failed to download the new preview build, please try again later. 0x8024402C". A bit off googling on that error message comes up with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0x8024402C -2145107924 WU_E_PT_WINHTTP_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED </p>
<p>
</p><p>that seems strange - DNS is clearly working OK, so DNS name resolution at least seems to be OK. I did try changing from the ISP assigned DNS addresses to OpenDNS addresses, but ended up with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you (or anyone else out there) tell me the file size of the 32-bit update. it is 2,245,292,302 bytes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, maybe the download itself has been completed, but what ever is meant to happen next is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            You're looking for "F4". &nbsp;This is special to Word: it repeats all keystrokes since the most recent mouse-click.
<div><br />
<div>So you can type a whole paragraph, cursor back, capitalise a word, bold a word, go to the end of the paragraph, hit Enter -- then hit F4 and you will get another paragraph just like it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As Bob says, it's keystrokes only: as soon as you touch the mouse you end the run. &nbsp;You cannot use it to repeat the result of a mouse action.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

            Why Phillip confused the issue by by interjecting the Undo command into the conversation I don't have any idea. What you're looking for isn't "different" at all except that you don't want [or need] to use Command+Z [Undo] before you use Command+Y :-) That
 would be pointless.<br />
<br />
What <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> differ is the circumstance at the time the Command+Y keystroke is used:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>If the last action taken was to <span style="font-weight: bold">Undo</span> [Command+Z]
ReDo</span> that action -- IOW, it <span style="font-style: italic">reverses</span> the Undo, however</li><li>If the last action taken was something <span style="font-style: italic">other than</span> Undo, Command+Y repeats that action [but I believe there are some actions which cannot be repeated using that keystroke].</li></ul>
<p>For many actions, though, you don't need a special <span style="font-weight: bold">
Repeat</span> keystroke. You can just use the same keystroke again. Eg., If you paste content then want to paste it again just use Command+V again. It will continue to paste the last content copied/cut.</p>
<p><br />
