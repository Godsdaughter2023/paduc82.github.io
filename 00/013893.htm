<h2>            syncing email to phone &#42;kind of&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking of buying a Windows Phone but haven't yet. When I do, I'll obviously want to sync my Outlook email to the phone HOWEVER what I DON'T want is to get pinged, or buzzed, or chirped at, or in any way told by my phone that I've received an email. I'm
 not Mr. Popularity but I'm subscribed to lots of stuff and so get emails all the time and don't want to be told about it all dang day. So my q is this: if and when I sync Outlook email to my Windows Phone, can I do so such that I'm not pinged when the emails
 show up? Is that something I can opt out of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise when you can. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Your primary Microsoft account cannot have syncing turned off, but subsequent email accounts can be set to sync manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have stuff auto-sorted into folders, then your phone doesn't go off because it only dings for the inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, in WP8.1, you can outright disable vibrations and tones on your email accounts, but leave a banner so emails would appear in the notification centre. Or just disable any kind of notification for the email account, leaving just the Live Tile to inform
 you of email.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 Rules - Random errors - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Rules - Random errors</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook 2013 and 2016 (as well as the Android App) to access my Work (Exchange Server 2013) and personal (Outlook.com) emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a lot of rules due to the ridiculous number of emails received.</p>
<p>All rules are server-side entered through Outlook 2013 (under windows 7), and they are basically all temporary filing, ie move messages to particular folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two problems:</p>
<p>1) Whenever I edit a rule, it will randomly decide to disable some rules. &nbsp;There is no consistency to which ones or how many.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;When running I get a box pop up telling me "Rules in Error" and the explanation for each is always "destination folder has exceeded its quota"</p>
<p>But they haven't.</p>
<p>There's actually not much in individual folders as I do work my way through them (eventually) and action/ delete/ file the messages. &nbsp;Plus I am well within my overall quota.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB: &nbsp;My work computer runs office 2013 under W7</p>
<p>my personal pc runs 2016 under W10</p>

<p>This is the same for all pictures.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The pictures are photographs of book pages.</p>
<p>I don't know of any updates installed&nbsp; between Saturday and Sunday.</p>

</p><p>I followed the link you gave and tried to follow the directions it gave. Unfortunately when I selected the Office item I did not get the 'change'&nbsp; option, just the repair option.&nbsp; This apparently did a quick repair, not a full repair.</p>

    <title>Outlook for Mac crashes when responding to emails that have Korean - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac crashes when responding to emails that have Korean characters.</h2>
                    <p>Hello Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping someone has a solution for a problem I have run into (and have experienced consistently for the past few months). I frequently work with people in Korea. When I respond to an email that I received from Korea that has Korean characters, Outlook
 2016 for Mac crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a Windows VM that has Outlook 2016 running in it. If I respond to the same email using Outlook 2016 client on the Windows VM, I see a slight freeze but Outlook continues working fine and I am able to send the email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else seen this issue? Does anyone have any suggestion on how to get this reported to Microsoft to get it fixed? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bala</p>

<h2>            Remove Bing from Firefox on a Mac</h2>
                    I have a mac and firefox and google was my default search engine.&nbsp; I downloaded a toolbar "download community" then deleted that toolbar and now I&nbsp;cannot remove&nbsp; bing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have researched online and none of the suggestions work.&nbsp; If need be, I will switch to safari which still uses google.&nbsp;
<br />

            Thanks but that is not the answer.&nbsp; I finally figured it out myself. <br />
<br />
The issue was so SIMPLE and that is why no one figures it out.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Google had been my HOME page in Firefox and the download changed my HOME page to one with bing as the search engine.<br />
<br />
All I needed to do to STOP bing was go to <br />
FIREFOX... <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PREFERENCES... <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GENERAL.... <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STARTUP... and reset my HOME page to google.<br />

<p>Well, I guess that's it then. </p>
<p>Thank you, Microsoft, for completely ignoring me. Whether via numerous online chat sessions, over the phone or here in the forum, your support is spectacularly pathetic.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking my money and failing to deliver a product, 61 times. That's how many of my music purchases are missing, in case you don't get it.</p>
<p>Being told to go pay for another service to download the music that you've already purchased is infuriating, especially when you point out that the advice on Microsoft's own FAQ says otherwise.</p>
<p>I don't even know if your support staff know the difference between the Music Pass and buying music outright.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I wanted was to download the music I had bought outright before Groove shut down, but no one would even acknowledge the problem.</p>
<p>I have been lied to and dismissed by your support section.</p>

            You are not alone. I have the exact same problem. Music, .mp3 songs that I bought through the Microsoft Store and downloaded to my PC are now missing. I first noticed the problem a couple of months ago in the Groove App. I would get the message that these
 songs have been removed from my catalogue as requested by the copyright holder. But wait a minute, I paid for these songs. It didn't occur to be to go check my Purchases folder until a couple of days ago where I see that my actual .mp3 files have been removed.
 I have been on the phone with Microsoft for several hours with finger pointing going on between the Microsoft Store and Groove Tech support who actually gave me a phone number for Microsoft Store support that turned out to be a number of a company in India
 selling magazine subscriptions and gift cards for, check this out $1.00. An obvious scam. What is really going Microsoft. &nbsp;

<p>Eventually I was able to save most of my collection, with no help from anyone at Microsoft Support. I had to go through my order history and search each individual purchase in the groove app and download the albums again. Sometimes I had to download several
 versions of the album to get the right one.</p>
<p>However, I am still missing 8 complete albums and half of two others. Since first contacting support at the end of November and multiple attempts, no one has helped me. The best I have gotten has been promises that the problem will be looked into and someone
 will get back to me, no one has, except to tell me to transfer to Spotify (which again is telling me that in order to access music, that I have already bought, in the way that I want I have to pay a subscription fee to a different company).</p>
<p>As best I can tell this problem with support is at best incompetence or, as I have come to believe, a deliberate ploy by Microsoft to avoid taking responsibility hoping that people with problems that can't be resolved go away so that it doesn't cost them
 anything.</p>
<p>At this point my opinion is that Microsoft is a company of liars and thieves who will not take responsibility for their own actions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Could not link equal sign &#34;&#61;&#34; to another workbook. Is this compatibility issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've encountered a case that we could not link a cell to another workbook by using "=" sign. When we try to enter "=", and&nbsp;select another cell from another workbook, it does not highlight or not being copied the value. But when we tried&nbsp;selecting from&nbsp;the
 same sheet, it is working properly and give us the value of the the selected cell. Is this due to a compatibility issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Check you only have a single instance of Excel running.&nbsp; Look in the Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) under the Processes tab and count how many EXCEL.EXE you see.</p>
<p>What you are doing wont work between separate instances of the application.</p>

<h2>            Hours and minutes displaying as &#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;&#35;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies if this has been posted before, but I've been trawling through the search results on here and search engines and nothing seems to fit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet with a formula set up to calculate the amount of total hours worked by my volunteers. For each volunteer I have their start time and finish time (format "hh:mm"), and then there's a column at the end that calculates the total hours worked
 by everyone ( the formula is "=(B1-A1)+(D1-C1)" etc, format is "[h]:mm" ) so as to display the result as hours and minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, for one row only, the total hours worked are displayed by hashmarks - "#######". I have tried widening the column in case it was too large to display - the hashmarks just continue to fill out the widened column. I've checked the formula
 dozens of times to see if somehow it's making the hours display as a negative times, but every thing looks as it should do, so the time should be positive like the others</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the formats of the cell compared to the other cells in the columns and everything seems to be the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried clearing the contents of the cells where I input the times, and then changing the format of the Total Hours Worked cell to General and it shows the number "-0.357638889" in the dialogue box even after clearing the contents. When I look at other
 cells in the column that are working fine, they show "0:00" like they should do</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss, any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated</p>
<p />

</p><p>Sorry for the incessant posting, but I just read the details better.&nbsp; Perhaps you simply have a typo in that one row, such that the finish date/time is less than (before) the start date/time.&nbsp; Again, posting the data would have helped us.&nbsp; But you could
 simply do a visual inspection to confirm.</p>

<p>My first thought was that I'd accidentally somehow been subtracting start time minus finish time (just for this row), but I've checked the formula I dunno how many times and can't see it anywhere. I suspect it's dead obvious but I can not see it for the
 life of me</p>
<p>
</p><p>B127 and C127 is the start time and finish time respectively for one volunteer, D127 and E127 is the start time and finish time respectively for the next volunteer, and so on. The problem row column's formula is</p>

</p><p>=(C127-B127)+(E127-D126)+(G127-F127)+(I127-H127)+(K127-J127)+(M127-L127)+(O127-N127)+(Q127-P127)+(S127-R127)+(U127-T127)+(W127-V127)+(Y127-X127)+(AA127-Z127)+(AC127-AB127)+(AE127-AD127)+(AG127-AF127)+(AI127-AH127)+(AK127-AJ127)+(AM127-AL127)+(AO127-AN127)+(AQ127-AP127)+(AS127-AR127)+(AU127-AT127)+(AW127-AV127)+(AY127-AX127)+(BA127-AZ127)</p>
<p>
</p><p>formatted to bring up the time as [h]:mm</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cells AM127, AL127, AS127 and AR127 have times in them (there was no other volunteers that day, so the other cells are blank). With the formula above and the times noted below, I'm expecting the total hours worked to be 07:05, but I'm getting the hashmarks
 instead</p>

<p>I excerpted the relevant part of your formula and data, and based on your assertions about the other cells, I have no problem with the arithmetic, as demonstrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ef892ea-8df1-4333-ba4b-60a00bf1b894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ef892ea-8df1-4333-ba4b-60a00bf1b894" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So obviously, there is something wrong with your interpretation of the data.&nbsp; For example, perhaps the other cells are not empty.&nbsp; Or perhaps the cells that display times also include (bogus?) dates.&nbsp; Be sure that
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, upload an example Excel file (redacted) that demonstrates the problem in row 127
<strong><em>to a file-sharing website and post the public/share URL in a response here</em></strong> so that we can inspect the data.&nbsp; Another pair of eyes might spot the "obvious" that you are overlooking unconciously.&nbsp;

<p>[....] Be sure that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>all</em></span> cells are formatted as [hh]:mm, just in case 09:47 is really 33:47 (1/1/1900 09:47)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Or 00:09(!).&nbsp; I might be onto something....&nbsp; What if some of those cells are actually formatted as mm:ss, and Excel interperted your data entry (or calculation) as mm:ss, both inadvertently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A weird theory, I know.&nbsp; I'm sure you would have noticed the difference in the Formula Bar.&nbsp; Well, not if the cells contain formulas instead of constants.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be that as it may, I tried all combinations, and the closest I come to -08:35 (-0.357638888888889) is -09:30 (-0.395925925925926; -09:30:08).&nbsp; That has mm:ss data in AM127, AR127 and AS127, but hh:mm data in AL127.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the difference....&nbsp; Perhaps you changed the data in the interim, or you have a typo in the posted data.</p>

<h2>            Excel Add-ins</h2>
                    I have a statistical add-in called MegaStat which runs in Excel.&nbsp; I have used this software for awhile with no issues.&nbsp; Recently when I click the Add-ins it is no longer listed.&nbsp; I have reinstalled it a number of times but no luck.&nbsp; When I run Excel at
 the beginning I see it loads and when I try the options in Excel and run the Add-ins it is listed under the active ad-ins (along with Data Solver , etc.) but when I go to the add-ins section it is blank.&nbsp; The Data analysis add-in is available under the Data
 section.&nbsp; I am wondering if it is a security issue since the software is a third party.&nbsp; If so how can I make Excel recognize it?

    <title>Windows Networking Problems &#40;Internet&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicklestrange  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Networking Problems &#40;Internet&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I have Windows 10 Tech Preview installed, all dandy like. Though I ran into an issue with getting it on the net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it installed on an old Dell Studio 1555, the Broadcom Netlink Gigabit Eternet Adapter driver is installed and working, and the Dell Wireless 1397 Mini-Card driver is installed and working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether I connect to my WiFi, or LAN cable, the issue remains the same. It gets the IP address via DHCP as well as all other relevant details such as DNS etc, it even resolves the DNS name which I gave to my Netgear router. Yet the connection comes up as
 Limited, No Internet Connection. I can't even get onto my routers landing page nor can I ping it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using my 3G dongle at the moment, and that works without any hiccoughs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Update to the latest drivers which worked on Windows 8 (this is Windows 7 drivers from the Dell website).</p>
<p>2. Reverted back to the MS WDM drivers for the connections.</p>
<p>3. Uninstalled, rebooted, and reinstalled the drivers.</p>
<p>4. IP Config /release and /renew (always gets the correct network settings, but still no internet connection).</p>
<p>5. Turned off the Firewall.</p>
<p>6. Ran Windows Update (it had some updates for me).</p>
<p>7. Tried an MS Fix It utility for Window 8/8.1.</p>
<p>8. Restarted the Wireless Auto Config service.</p>
<p>9. Saw quite a few network related errors in the logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ex:&nbsp;DHCPv4 client service is stopped. ShutDown Flag value is 1</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WLAN Extensibility Module has stopped.&nbsp;Module Path: C:\Windows\System32\bcmihvsrv64.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed a few other people having network issues too, and there hasn't been any advice on how to resolve it as yet, so perhaps one update in the future will fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,<br />
Nick</p>

            <p>Mine is now working, and it had nothing at all to do with Windows 10 it seems. My other WiFi router which I use as a repeater seemed to be interfering with other devices on the network too, and thus my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This explains why I would be getting an IP, but no throughput, it was just bad timing on my part, and adding in that my main PC had internet just added to the confusion.&nbsp;</p>

            That's farther than I've gotten.&nbsp; Mine keeps telling me that my computer profile is on a public network.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure when I set it up I said "home or business".&nbsp; So I'm not able to get onto the net at all.&nbsp; This is with a wired connection.&nbsp; It's offering
 me access to my wi-fi subnet, although the only wireless connector is for the keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; This is an HP Envy 70-074, with a realtek ethernet adapter.&nbsp; And the display is 480 x 320, which makes it a little difficult to maneuver.

            I am running Windows 10 on a quad core computer and the networking worked fine at first. However, frequently, IE claims there's no connection whilst Google Chrome just loads the same website. IE comes back with an offer to troubleshoot the network that
 is working fine.

            Well, even when I tried changing to a private network, it continued to claim I was on a public network, with limited network access.&nbsp; I reinstalled the technical preview, just in case I missed something setting it up.&nbsp; No deal.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; Without access
 to the internet, there's no way to update the software, and no way to tell Microsoft about problems.&nbsp; So I'm back to the original Windows 8, going to reinstall Windows 8 Pro, then 8.1.&nbsp; Unless there's an updated version of the preview that resolves this problem,
 I'm done.<br />

            <p>That's a shame. I feel this new Windows 10 is quite an improvement over Windows 8 - at least it runs Steam games! The networking is my only gripe, really. Speedtest shows my fibre connection as a download rate of around 56Mbs and yet it is still no enough
 to satisfy browsing the Internet or, in some cases, downloading software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone with better knowledge of how Microsoft networking works can come up with some ideas.</p>

            <p>I gave my&nbsp;RTL8111E&nbsp;LAN adapter manual IP and DNS settings and convinced it that its on a private network, but it hasn't helped it connect to the internet, it still comes up "Limited". &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, I an running Windows 10 on an Asus P8Z77-VLX motherboard. It has a Realtek network adaptor which Windows installed correctly. However, as it seems &nbsp;bit broken I also have a network card in the machine that also uses Realtek and that's the card I am
 running the network from and it works fine. I haven't installed any drivers from my drivers disk so am running solely on the ones Windows installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of my problems are associated with the inability of IE and Chrome and Firefox too sometimes to be able to connect and display pages. For example, to reply to this thread I had to copy the url into Chrome as IR refuses to bring up the page for me to
 type a reply. I have noticed that as the longer the &nbsp;machine &nbsp;has been running the worse this gets. I am starting to wonder if there is a buffer somewhere that fills up and can't be reset.&nbsp;</p>

<div><i><br />

<div>I am working on a presentation originally created in OpenOffice. The one problem I have though, is that a pilcrow (a crotchet of all things) appears after every paragraph. The pilcrow actually shows up on the printed &amp; exported version, which is a problem,
 esp. for the page numbers which renders them unreadable. I have searched the internet for a solution but have had no luck so far. Any ideas?
<div>Thanks!</div>

            What is the make and model of your smartphone?
<br />Which version of Android is installed?
<br />
<br />Try below steps and see if the issue still persists:
<br />
<br />Go to your Phone settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.
<br />
<br />Look for Skype and then select Force Stop &gt; Clear cache &gt; Clear Data &gt; Uninstall.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling, kindly do a reboot on your device.
<br />
<br />Once it pop-up, please install Skype using Google Play Store.
<br />
<br />After installing Skype, please do another restart before signing back in.

<p>I have an HTC 8525, recently upgraded to WM6.&nbsp; However, I have never been able to sync with my company server.&nbsp; My IT person says the server is setup to work for me.&nbsp; Can anyone offer any suggestions?&nbsp; I'm very frustrated
 because the ability to get company e-mail while out of the office was the main reason I purchased the phone.</p>

<p>I am experiencing the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;IT MS Exchange specialist tells me their side is set up properly and the issue must be on my side (e.g. others (with WM5, don't know about WM6) are able to sync wirelessly).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already spent time on the phone with the AT&amp;T support folks and the HiTech support folks - no progress and they appear to be pretty inexperienced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just replaced and AT&amp;T 8525 running WM5 with&nbsp;an 8525 with WM6.&nbsp; I have never been able to get the the new phone to sync correctly with Exchange.&nbsp; The old phone did wirelessly sync with Exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what I have done so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; I have deleted and reinstalled the Exchange connection on the mobile phone several times.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; I have verified the URL, UID and PW are correct via the OWA interface on my laptop (and the wireless Exchange sync&nbsp; worked on the old phone)</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; I have verified there are messages that should have down loaded&nbsp; (&lt;3 days old, any size) based on the sync properties</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; I am unable to send mail (stays in the outbox indefinitely)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you hit 'sync' from the&nbsp;Messaging-Outlook-Menu, the phone indicates that it has established a connection (it starts with 'connecting' and then changes to&nbsp;'synchronizing'), and after a minute or so indicates synchronization is complete -but
 no email messages are sent or received.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I go to ActiveSync on the phone, it gives me the support code mentioned earlier in this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>

            Try connecting your device to your laptop and inintiate a sync to your exchange server. If the sync is successfull, disconnect and do&nbsp; a wireless sync.

            We are having the same issue except it is with our CEO's T-Mobile MDA.<br />
<br />
ActiveSync connects, starts the synchronization with folders, about 30-45 seconds later it states "Server Could Not be Reached" with an error code 0x080072EE7<br />
<br />
I find this odd that it states it is synchronizing with the folders but then states it can not find the server.<br />
<br />
Is there a solutions to this issue yet?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />I have tried the suggested hide/show of Format Text -&gt; Paragraph but I still have the space dots in every email!
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />The answer to your question is outlined in the following article. Go to the section "Turn off the display of formatting marks" --&gt; select your version of Word and follow accordingly which requires going to FIle --&gt; Options --&gt; Display 
<br />
<br />Show or hide formatting marks

</span><strong>Paragraph</strong><span> group, choose </span><strong>Show/Hide

<br />The issue is only with MS Outlook, not Word, 
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />First my apologies - overlooked the app that this was in reference to.
<br />
<br />In terms of the settings in Outlook - there are two ways to toggle the paragraph settings 
<br />
<br />#1 - Is to highlight the the paragraph marker as shown in the attached screenshot - if it's highlighted, then all the paragraph marks will appear in the message
<br />
<br />#2 - the other way to toggle the setting ON or OFF is via the keyboard shortcut of
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+* (where asterisk must be selected above the 8 key) as described in the Help topic by clicking on &lt;Tell Me More&gt;
<br />
<br />If that doesn't change anything, please provide the following
<br />
<br />a) Version/Build # of Outlook in use (including the words after the version/build info that appears underneath &lt;About Outlook&gt; after going to File --&gt; Office Account 
<br />
<br />b) any 3rd party addins that are installed (if any)
<br />
<br />c) is this something that has gone from working to non-working or has never worked at all. If it's the former (used to work) - what changes have recently been made?

    <title>Outlook 2013 ribbon buttons with drop down menu not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 ribbon buttons with drop down menu not working</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a client with an outlook issue that appears to only affect ribbon buttons with the small triangle in the bottom left corner signifying a drop down menu. Initially my client was trying to send an email from within MS Word, attaching the document they
 were working on to a new email message. When attempted their e-mail signature did not automatically populate the bottom of the message. When the attempted to insert their signature using the button on the ribbon nothing happened. After investigating and attempting
 to create a new email from within outlook I tried to insert the signature again and this also was not successful. Brainstorming, I tried other buttons within outlook that had the small triangle for a drop down menu. None of these work, but all buttons without
 a drop menu do not have an issue and perform the way they are supposed to. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can assist with this issue it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further understand the problem, please answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this happen to both Outlook app and Outlook on the web?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried checking for updates?</li></ul>
<p>We suggest that you run Windows Update as this concern may be related to a previous issue that's already addressed with the new release of updates for Office.</p>
<p>You can also try the steps provided through this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thank you very much for your response, my apologies for just responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing all Windows updates I am still in the same situation. What I did find is that in addition to the original problem I am not able to get any "sub" or "context" menus to work. An example being right clicking on an open application on the task bar
 should result&nbsp;in a pop-up menu coming up. As well, hovering over an application in the task bar should result in a preview of the open application popping up. This does not occur. At times it appears it does pop up and in a split second closes down. Another
 observation I made while trying to figure this out is that this only occurs under a particular users profile. If I login under the administrator profile none of these issues occur.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very strange issue, but I appreciate the assistance. Any other ideas?</p>

    <title>Get my SharePoint sites to show a Link Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Get my SharePoint sites to show a Link Preview</h2>
                    
<p>It seems not everyone likes the Link Preview functionality of OWA (which adds a site preview box, when you include a URL in your email) but I do.</p>
<p>I'd like to get our SharePoint sites to display such a preview but haven't managed to work out what meta tags to include to get this working. I even tried copying a HEAD tag verbatim but this didn't work either. Does anyone know if I can get this to work
 and what I need to do?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Cortana - It keeps causing my games to crash as it switched application</h2>
                    <p>I think I have finally come to the end of my time with Windows and will be getting an Apple next time.&nbsp; Every time I play a game, the irritating Cortana box pops up and causes the game to crash.&nbsp; It has made using the computer unpleasant.&nbsp; I do not want
 Cortana on my computer, as I have established others don't, but Microsoft are so arrogant they think we must have it and have removed the facility to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to add insult to injury, they have increased the size of the damn box and made the experience even more irritating and more problematic.&nbsp; It is now like a constant interruption and reminder that Microsoft do not listen to their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We should have the option to turn it off and decide whether we want it using part of the computing power rather than some nerd in a box inside the Microsoft organisation deciding this for us like we don't have minds of our own.&nbsp; I DO AND IT'S GOODBYE MICROSOFT
 AND I WILL NOT BE RETURNING</p>

<p>Hello Marie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could go to Settings, System, Notifications &amp; Actions, scroll down the right side and turn off notifications for cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to the box on the taskbar, if you right click it, go to cortana, you can either hide it or just show an icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to let you know, we are not employed by MS, just volunteers as you posted this in the Insider Forum for the testing of future versions of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps with your concerns.</p>

    <title>File opening in read-only mode caused by hung winword.exe process - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kbrb  say:</h3>
<h2>            File opening in read-only mode caused by hung winword.exe process</h2>
                    My file opened in read-only so I saved it to another file name and attempted to delete the original. &nbsp;It would not allow me to delete it, telling me "The action can't be completed because the file is open in Microsoft Word". &nbsp;I closed all Word documents
 and attempted again to delete the file, with the same result. &nbsp;Aha! - a hung process. &nbsp;I went into Process Explorer, which I downloaded long ago from Microsoft and like much better than Task Manager, selected the "Winword.exe" process that was still running
 even though all Word documents were closed, and selected "Kill Process Tree". &nbsp;Mission accomplished - my document now behaves normally. &nbsp;Hope that helps someone.
