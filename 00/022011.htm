            Hello Director,
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />from the error message, it seems like you are using O365 Exchange online account which is synced with your organizations Active Directory account. So, it means that you need to change your laptop login account's password which will inturn change the password for your email as well.
<br />
<br />Please read this article for more explanation

    <title>Office 365 home page customsation by Admin - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 home page customsation by Admin</h2>
                    <p>I understand that you want individuals to customise their own Office 365 home pages.&nbsp; However, this is a major blocker for companies moving to Office365 where they want to use it to replace their on-premise intranet.&nbsp; Invariably, they want to control some
 of the content that is presented to the users when they log in.&nbsp; Normally it is corporate news they want to disseminate, and signposts to other content in SharePoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While SharePoint can build a great intranet home page, you can't make SharePoint the default landing page in Office 365.</p>
<p>And while the personal Newsfeed is great for low level messages about activity on O365, corporate messages need to be delivered more visibly than being mixed in with this activity, as they would be lost in the noise of the Newsfeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see a simple way to do deliver this functionality, and it is a frequent requirement.</p>
<p>At the moment the only way I can think of doing this is to create my own News App, based on a specific SharePoint site (where internal comms people can create articles) and the content from this site is displayed on the News App which is dropped onto everyone's
 landing page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the correct path to deliver corporate news on to the Office 365 page? Or is there a better way?</p>

<h2>            Text Suddenly Turned to Numbers and Random Characters - Mac Word 2011</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone can help with this as it is giving me so much stress and panic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was working on a 50,000-word document when all of a sudden the entire text turned to random numbers and letters. If I passed my cursor over the text, the English text would turn to random characters. I closed the file, then reopened it and the entire file
 consisted of numbers and letters. A whole two month's work gone in a second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried turning the file into Rich Text Format and some of the initial text turns back into English, but the rest does not. I did not have any kind of backup for the file (yes, this is my fault, and I realize how stupid it was of me not to have one) as this
 has never happened before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a sample of the garbled text, into which the regular English text turned into. I was using "Garamond" as the font. Please help. I don't know what else to do...</p>

<p>Thank you. I found a way to recover 99% of my document, and it didn't involve the Time Machine or anything that I had ever done before. I used a third party software (had to pay for it, but was well worth it), which allowed me to access RAW docx files and
 recover the file that was autosaved by Word ten minutes prior to the bug turning my document to gibberish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That version of the document was not affected by the bug. I was stunned that I actually was able to get it back after trying for two days. It was only missing a couple hundred words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew there <strong>HAD TO</strong> be a way!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond relieved! I've learned my lesson!</p>

            No it isn't possible to capture a screenshot through the phone.<br />
Can be captured on the pc using the Screen Dump but i suspect it won't work. I haven't tried that. I use the Nokia's service suite to get a screen dump but won't recommend you that being its a very advanced tool.

    <title>Microsoft Rewards Scam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> factsrule  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Rewards Scam</h2>
                    Bing Rewards was turned into Microsoft Rewards. The only difference is that Microsoft Rewards refuses to honor their agreement. I purchased Three months of Ad-free Outlook e-mail. Several times over several months I wasted my time trying to find out how
 to get the three free months. This last time I spent many hours trying to get what Microsoft promised me. The conclusion was that Microsoft added less than half of the points I spent on those vouchers.<br />
Microsoft is therefore clearly running a scam and should be investigated by the FTC for unfair trade practices.<br />
Shame on this disgusting company for wasting many hours of my time, insulting me, &amp; keeping me waiting months just to say that they refuse to honor the purchase I made or refund my points.<br />
Shame on this disgusting company.<br />
Here is one of their representatives warning me to be careful about which of the Microsoft Rewards I choose, as if Microsoft isn't the one offering the rewards!&nbsp;<br />

 can create a new event, but it is not seen by others.

            Hi Systems Administrator,<br />
<br />
May I how did you set up the shared calendar and contacts list for your organization?<br />
<br />
If user have permissions to a shared mailbox, the shared calendar and contacts folder associated with the shared mailbox is automatically added to<em> My Calendars</em> and
<em>My Contact</em> list in Outlook desktop client.<br />
<br />
However, you cannot access shared contacts list for a shared mailbox from Outlook Web App.<br />
<br />

            Do you get a prompt to enter the user name and password each time you login to outlook???<br />
<br />
Create a new identity and then configure the same exchange account to check if this takes cares of the issue.<br />

            Is this an issue with a particular account?<br />
Check if you are able to setup your account in any other machine. <br />
If its an account related issue, i would suggest you to post in exchange forum, but before doing so make sure that you can setup the exchange account in outlook in a different machine.

    <title>How to find and replace tab characters in Word 2007 headers with VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> undinerhapsody  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to find and replace tab characters in Word 2007 headers with VBA &#40;could be Word bug&#63;&#63;&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a need to extract a number from document headers that also contain text.</p>
<p>The number may be separated from text by a tab instead of a space.</p>
<p>However, I have found that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The Word GUI find function does not find tab characters in a header (but works OK in the document body)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When you access a header in Word 2007 via VBA, tab characters cannot be found and replaced;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example: 860868 vbTab Jones shows as 8068680Jones in a MsgBox (text returned from ...Range.Text)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Looping through a Words collection reveals that the tab is not treated as a separator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Looping through a characters collection reveals a surprise:&nbsp;the tab shows up&nbsp;as a chr(48) - i.e.a zero!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each oChr In ActiveDocument.Sections(1).Headers(wdHeaderFooterPrimary).Range.Characters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox oChr + "&nbsp; " + Str(Asc(oChr))</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next oChr</p>
<p>So any help on how to work around this bug(?) would be appreciated!!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not seeing that behaviour here.&nbsp; GUI find replace is working fine.&nbsp; Msgbox returns the header text with a gap where the tab it. In the loop the tab is returned as character 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried your tests in a new blank document where you have inserted you own tabs?<br />
<br />
Have you looked at headers with field codes displayed to see if the "gap" which appear to be tabs could be some carryover WordPerfect field or something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm all out of ideas.&nbsp; Sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Aha, thanks for that ... there is indeed something amiss with the documents I am dealing with (poss. some from mac and open office).<br />
<br />
However, this cannot be changed, so I have written code to extract the nine numeral number that can be anywhere in the header range.<br />

                    I need to take data about people in an access database and export them into Outlook contacts information. The Export to Outlook macro I have simply opens up a dialog box to export someone, but doesn't fill in any information. It even selects the wrong
 person to base it off of. I have basic knowledge of setting up macros, but I'm not sure of commands or possible functions that would allow this to work. Could someone please help me out?

<h2>            Sharepoint Device Channels not displaying master page associated with them</h2>
                    <p>The homepage of our intranet portal has a couple of third party applications that are not mobile compatible. &nbsp;So when the site has the Mobile Browser View feature turned on and the user accesses using a phone there is an error indicating that some applications
 will not work on mobile phone. &nbsp;At that point it is a little tricky for the user to figure out how to navigate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, we thought a good solution would be to turn off the Mobile Browser View feature and configure a device channel for mobile phones with a master page that does not contain the non-mobile applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were able to create the device channel, able to create and publish new master page, assign master page to the device channel. &nbsp;However, when navigating to the site with a phone we do not get the new master page, just the default master page same as if
 user was at a desktop. &nbsp;I've combed the internet looking for possible answers and have not found one. &nbsp;Looking for guidance from others that have used device channels.</p>

    <title>Granular License Assignment for Skype only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robinmk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Granular License Assignment for Skype only</h2>
                    
<p>I have a user who has an 'Office 365 Education for faculty' license, aka STANDARDWOFFPACK_FACULTY.<br />
<br />
This is the status of that license:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><code>ServicePlan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ProvisioningStatus<br />
-----------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ------------------<br />
INTUNE_O365&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PendingActivation<br />
YAMMER_EDU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PendingInput<br />
SHAREPOINTWAC_EDU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disabled<br />
MCOSTANDARD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disabled<br />
SHAREPOINTSTANDARD_EDU Disabled<br />
EXCHANGE_S_STANDARD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Success</code></p>
<p><br />
as you can see, he is licensed for the Exchange service plan only. Yammer_edu and intune_o365 I have no idea how to deal with, so I've ignored these.<br />
<br />
We wish to license on a granular level. I've had success with this, writing a function to do just that (I must say, it's been a very painful process having to programmatically determine which service plans to DISABLE in order to actually ENABLE specific components).
<br />
<br />
The problem is when it comes to licensing for Skype (aka MCOSTANDARD), it doesn't seem to work.<br />
<br />
This is a stripped down version of the commands I'm running:</p>
<p><code>$upn = '*** Email address is removed for privacy ***'<br />
$accountSku = 'tenancy:STANDARDWOFFPACK_FACULTY'<br />
$plansToDisableString = 'SHAREPOINTWAC_EDU,SHAREPOINTSTANDARD_EDU'<br />
$disabledServicePlans = New-MsolLicenseOptions -AccountSkuId $accountSku -DisabledPlans $plansToDisableString<br />
Set-MSOLUser -UserPrincipalName $upn -UsageLocation GB</code></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Now, as the user already has the STANDARDWOFFPACK_FACULTY license, I've tried this:</p>
<p><code>Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $upn -LicenseOptions $disabledServicePlans</code></p>
<p><br />
I get the error: Set-MsolUserLicense : Unable to assign this license because the license options are invalid.<br />
<br />
I tried with -AddLicenses (which by my understanding I shouldn't have to do):</p>
<p><code>Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $upn -AddLicenses $accountSku -LicenseOptions $disabledServicePlans</code></p>
<p><br />
I get the error: Set-MsolUserLicense : Unable to assign this license because it is invalid. Use the Get-MsolAccountSku cmdlet to retrieve a list of valid licenses.<br />
<br />
How do I keep SharePoint (SHAREPOINTSTANDARD_ED), and Office Online (SHAREPOINTWAC_EDU) disabled, whilst enabling Skype, and keeping Exchange enabled?<br />
<br />
The "Command Logging" feature within the Exchange Admin centre that lets you see executed PowerShell commands would be incredibly, INCREDIBLY useful for many if it were made available in the licensing section. I've seen endless queries about licensing as it's
 not straight forward at all (imho).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Robin</p>

<p>$plansToDisable = 'SHAREPOINTWAC_EDU','SHAREPOINTSTANDARD_EDU'</p>
<p>Whilst -LicenseOptions will accept a comma separated list directly, if it's passed an object, it should be an array object. Makes sense, as passing a comma separated list directly will be treated like an array too.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Badge App Icon shows mail but there is no new mail</h2>
                    <p>Hey</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present the Badge App Icon shows 2 messages but there are no new messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cleaned out my inbox via PC for both my Hotmail address and the 2 GMail accounts but the icon won't update to show no new mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned off the Badge App icon in Settings for Outlook on the iPhone and then rebooted and turned the badge app icon back on but STILL it shows 2 when there is NO NEW MAIL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the hell is going here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help for this very annoying little problem would be appreciated (and I'm hoping not to have to uninstall the App -&gt; Reinstall -&gt; Reconfigure accounts if at all possible).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are in a frustrating situation because the&nbsp;Outlook Badge&nbsp;App icon shows incorrect information. We will help you to resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>Which version of iOS installed on the iPhone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately you have to uninstall and reinstall the Mail app in your iPhone since the issue is occurring even after turning off the Badge App icon. I also suggest you to make sure that you don't have any old unread messages in your inbox. This is not an
 issue related to Outlook.com. This must be occurring due to a corrupt or defective Mail app on your iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue after reinstalling the app and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet explorer assigns all websites to one of four security zones: Internet, Local intranet, Trusted sites, or Restricted sites. The zone to which a website is assigned specifies the security settings that are used for that site. You can choose which
 websites to assign to the Intranet, Trusted, or Restricted zones. By adding a website to a specific zone, you can control the level of security used on that site. For example, if you have a list of websites that you visit and you completely trust those sites,
 add those sites to the Trusted zone.</p>

    <title>Nokia 301 review - Shortcomings, problems, issues and suggestions&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sammypos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 301 review - Shortcomings, problems, issues and suggestions&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>What a wonderful phone that is missing so much potential! We are very surprised how you take off basic features that nearly all phone have had until now! Why would Nokia do such a foolish thing?? I would like to see all these options back on, in a
 software upgrade very soon! These missing items drive us mad! Maybe we can work together to improve your phones, to make them more popular, and not the other way round, where you remove basic useful features, which, no-doubt, turns off customers!</span></p>
<p><span>The missing features are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Texting:</span></span></p>
<p><span>1) The ability to insert contact details whilst composing a text message. This is one feature which is seriously surprising that it was taken away. It is very bothersome not to be able to insert required info, like a name or number etc into a text.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Where has the ‘My Folders’ option gone to? We used to be able to sort archived messages into folders, which is very useful, why now has this option disappeared?? There are many other areas on the phone where one can make a folder, but surprisingly,
 not here where it is most needed!!?</span></p>
<p><span>3) Automatic dictionary have changed word order from previous phones, like &lt;mr&gt; instead of &lt;or&gt;, &lt;box&gt; instead of &lt;any&gt;; obviously &lt;any&gt; is more frequent use than &lt;box&gt;! And who uses Mr anymore? Plus it doesn't seem to learn from your selection! &lt;STOP
 PRESS&gt; Have since found out that this *is* possible by typing that word four or more times, correcting it each time to desired word, it will eventually learn!!!</span></p>
<p><span>4) A very important feature that surprisingly has been changed, is the time stamp for an incoming text. Every previous Nokia phone has shown the time the sender *sent* the text. This is useful if it was while the receiving phone was switched off, to
 be able to tell when it was dispatched. Now, it only displays the time it has been received, which is pretty useless and annoying! This issue has actually been raised elsewhere on the community board with no resolution!</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Counters:</span></span></p>
<p><span>5) Why doesn't the phone data log count gigabytes too? Most people have gigabytes allowance, and need to check with the log for this, but I’ve discovered to my great surprise that the data count resets at 1 GB! This is very sad!!</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Making &amp; Receiving Calls:</span></span></p>
<p><span>6) When alerting for incoming call, the backlight flashes on and off. But in daylight, it is hard to see who is calling during the time the backlight is off! It should either stay on, or flash with &lt;off&gt; being *very* short!</span></p>
<p><span>7) When a headset is inserted, there is an option for auto answer, but it should also include an option for how many rings before it answers!</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Camera:</span></span></p>
<p><span>8) Camera shutter sound can be set on and off, but surely it should follow the global app sound setting! This has already been set in profiles.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Contacts:</span></span></p>
<p><span>9) There are two views for contacts, the initial view which is a bit useless, then if you choose Options, Contact Details, you get to the real deal, where contact details can be changed and postal address can be seen etc. This, I think, should be the
 initial view! So at least give us the option for this!</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Main Menu:</span></span></p>
<p><span>10) Why can't we delete, or at least hide, useless icons of apps?! The main menu features More Apps, and Store, which are exactly the same! And both of them I don't want on main menu! What about Youtube on the main menu? How much do Google pay Nokia
 for this? Why can't we hide unused icons, to tidy up the main menu, like every other OS offers!? Especially when a menu is already assigned to a shortcut, we should be able to remove or hide this menu from the main menu!</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Calendar:</span></span></p>
<p><span>11) Why are there two types of notes, reminders and memo? And now that we do have two, one should be default &lt;no tone&gt;! That way we could easily make a reminder or memo, according to our needs, with or without a tone alarm!</span></p>
<p><span>12) Also, when going back to edit a previous reminder, the cursor position is placed at the beginning, which is a bit useless most times. Why is it not at the *end* of the reminder, like it is in fact when you come to edit Notes!!</span></p>
<p><span>13) Why is there no shortcut for Making a Reminder? There is one for Making a To Do, but I’m sure many users would also require a shortcut to make a reminder?</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Music:</span></span></p>
<p><span>14) Why doesn’t it vibrate during playback of music? This is very annoying!</span></p>
<p><span>15) When a music track is playing, there is no way of knowing which track number it is!!? Surely the track number should be displayed on the main playback screen. Also &lt;Details&gt; option of the track should also be accessible from the playback screen.</span></p>
<p><span>16) Actually, on the subject of the Music player, when Music is selected from the main menu, it should enter the music player, not the playlist!</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Timer:</span></span></p>
<p><span>17) When the timer is running, it is not easy to see the time remaining! Also, a clock icon should show on the main screen, like in the old phones, when a timer or stopwatch is running! And what on earth is interval timer????</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Charging:</span></span></p>
<p><span>18) It seems Nokia have implemented a feature that when charging from a computer etc, it should only draw little power. This sounds nice, but it makes problems with a USB wall charger! I once had it in for about three hours only to find it minimally
 charged!! Plus, I once had the real Nokia charger plugged in overnight, only to find in the morning it hadn’t fully charged, because of this same issue! It was displaying a USB symbol on top, thinking it was a USB charger from a laptop etc, therefore not fully
 charging!! So, while this may be a good idea, it should be chosen by the user, not automatically chosen!</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Suggestions:</span></span></p>
<p><span>A few suggestions, which would make this phone much better and more useful.</span></p>
<p><span>19) Voice commands! We used to have this feature in older Nokia phones, either to dial a number, i.e. Voice tags, or to carry out a function such as radio.</span></p>
<p><span>20) Ability to choose what the headset button should do, e.g. pause music instead me jumping to next track etc.</span></p>
<p><span>21) The ability to send a text later than now, i.e. To compose a text and set the phone to send it later. This is supported by some older Nokia phones!</span></p>
<p><span>22) When a reminder rings, option to delete it too, besides snooze and exit. This is quite useful, as many times after a reminder rings, you'll have no need for it anymore!</span></p>
<p><span>23) A shortcut to the backlight! It is common to change the backlight strength periodically, and there should be a shortcut to it!</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Bug:</span></span></p>
<p><span>23) I have discovered an interesting bug. When the headset (with a button on it) is plugged in and music is playing, the pause button pauses and resumes playback. But when the music is paused, and meanwhile the screen has gone off, when the play button
 is pressed, instead me resuming playback it jumps to the next song, very annoying! I think it is simulating the headset button which does that!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, any interest from Nokia R&amp;D? Any comments from the rest of you? Thanks and lets together make a change!!</span></p>

            Right, few more very annoying bugs!<br />
24) Firstly, in the native Mail app, when choosing an address from the phone's contacts list, only the first few contacts appear!! This is so surprising and annoying!? I've found, however, when trying to add a received mail address to the contacts. the entire
 the list comes up! So why the problem when finding a send to address???<br />
25) Secondly, a very weird phenomenon!! In the phone log, the "All Received data" amount is different to the "Received" amount showing in the "Data Alert" function! It is about half a MB out! How can this be?<br />
26) Thirdly, I've found that the vibrating is too soft! Anybody else out there found this an issue?? The old phones would vibrate stronger, and I suppose Nokia didn't want their new phones sounding like washing machines, but I find I cannot always feel the
 vibrating, even after buying a special belt case from Germany for about £8!! So maybe give the option to the user to set how strong it should vibrate??!

            Ok guys, two more annoying bugs!!<br />
One, which is very surprising, considering all Nokia phones until now had it as a basic calling feature. Namely, when a contact phones you, it does not display which number of that contact is calling you, e.g. the work number, mobile number etc!!!??? The previous
 phones all displayed, at the very least, a icon of which number it is!<br />
<br />
Another annoying bug, is when sending a text to many recipients, you have to verify each and every contact added, i.e. choose from every contact which number of it you wish to send to. It should really just send the text to the default number of every contact
 chosen!! Imagine you are sending to your entire phonebook!<br />
<br />
Any feedback from Nokia???

            Hi folks, some more bugs spotted. Again, simple features that all previous phones would have, but not these modern ones??<br />
Firstly, on the calls log, you cannot see multiple call times for the same number. We used to be able to choose Details under a number in the log list, and see about five entries for it! Now, unless two different numbers for the same contact name phone you,
 you cannot retrieve multiple times!<br />
An annoying missing function is a volume up/down button which I see they have indeed incorporated in the 515. This can be quite annoying when in the middle of a call and a app is runing... etc

            <p>Perhaps you're not aware of this, but Series 40 devices (including the 301) have been discontinued. Now that Nokia sold their mobile part to Microsoft, only S30+ devices (which are even dumber than S40) have been released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am disappointed with the last Series 40 phones. I bought a 208 and realised lots of features are missing compared to older phones, such as C2-01 and X2-00. If Microsoft could release an update to bring back Flash Lite support, equaliser or folder music
 player, I'd be very happy. But I'm afraid your and my complaints are falling on deaf ears.</p>

            <p>Just for the record, one last point:</p>
<p>When sending a text, it offers you Contact, Recently Used etc, it should also offer Recently Received From, cos sometimes you receive a text requesting info, so you cancel the text dialog, get the info, start a new text, and you want to send it to the recent
 recipient, but this does not come up on the list!</p>

            Hi all, I've just spotted another missing feature, quite a basic one at that! They've removed the option to lock the phone with a password!! Even my old 6510 had that! You can set the SIM pin request on, but that won't help for the actual phone when the
 sim is removed! Very strange?!!?? How are we to secure our info from prying eyes? You can activate the passworded keyguard, but that is not the same thing. What we need is the option that whenever the phone is switched on it asks for a password!<br />

<p>This asks for the code even at startup. It works even without a SIM inserted. Does your Nokia 301 offer that feature?</p>

            hi, thanks for that but that asks for the password every time I unlock the keyguard, that's a bit heavy, I don't work for MI5!? What we need is a password only when the phone is switched on! that way, if it gets lost or stolen, the guy has limited access
 till it goes off or till he switches it off (when sim card is cancelled by me!)

    <title>Sharing pst file between 2 home group computers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich dickeson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing pst file between 2 home group computers</h2>
                    <p>I have a home group that has only 2 PC connected&nbsp;and each PC can see each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to set up a shared/common pst file for MS Outlook 2013 (part of Office 2013 365) so that each PC can see and answers emails from that common pst file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that when one PC opens Outlook first, the other PC gets a message that it can not open the pst file because it is in use.&nbsp; I was hoping to have the pst file shared&nbsp;by both PCs at the same time,,,, and with both PCs ALWAYS having MS Outlook
 open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible with our having MS Exchange configured?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally when one PC answers an email I want to the other PC to know that the email has been opened and answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance..</p>

            <p>You cannot share a pst data file, Outlook requires full read/write access to the data file.</p>
<p>Nor can you share, or use, a pst over a network, or use OneDrive for the same purpose.</p>

            <p>As Palcouk has already said, you cannot open a single PST file in 2 computers at the same time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a legacy of Outlook's origins back in the 1980's and 90's as a "single computer" DOS program. The underlying design assumptions, so deeply underlying that they weren't even thought about at that time, is that files, like PST, existed on a single
 computer and would only be opened by one computer at the same time.&nbsp; That underlying assumption in Outlook has never been changed or updated, even though many programs like Word, Excel and Sharepoint now do allow multiple people/computers to open and edit
 the same file at the same time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is the reason that when you are installing more than version of Office, ie trials of new versions prior to Office 365 you could not install more than one version of Outlook at the same time.&nbsp; Office 365 changes the paradyme a little by isolating
 the 365 PST file inside of a "virtual computer". </p>

            <p>The issue stems from having had a Zune Free Music Pass at some point in the distant past. Since the record still exists in the backend database, Groove/Xbox Music think you are ineligible for a free pass - and therefor you are unable to sign in with the
 free pass. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS Rep I spoke to online (via chat) had to cancel my Groove / Xbox free pass trial AND then he credited my acct with enough to cover a month's worth&nbsp;of subscription.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went and signed up for month to month subscription - NOT Clicking on the Free Music Pass offer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes sense and helps.</p>

</div>
<div>I have been trying to purchase office 365 home premium from office.microsoft.com in the UK. &nbsp;When I click on purchase I get a pink banner with error message "Sorry, something went wrong. &nbsp;Sorry, we couldn't complete your purchase. &nbsp;Please try again later'.
 &nbsp; Have tried many times over 24 hours.</div>

</div>
<div>Have spent 2.5 hours with 3 different Microsoft support people this morning trying to resolve this without success. &nbsp;I think it must be a server issue (e.g. have tried 4 different browsers, 2 different PCs, 2 different hotmail accounts, 3 different payment
 methods etc).</div>

            <p>Thanks, yes we went through all that with the various Microsoft staff I was on chats/phone calls with for much of yesterday.&nbsp; And I also used different laptops, browsers, networks&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; It's clear this is a server-side issue, nothing to do with my setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the only group that can resolve this is the technical development/support team that is responsible for the Office 365 'purchase experience' page.&nbsp; Only they can say for sure what is causing this error.&nbsp; Unfortunately no-one has been able to locate
 that group!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have given up and purchased this from another vendor.&nbsp; Hopefully that will get me past this block and I'll be able to download the s/w.</p>

            @NickBirke - in my case, payment did not go through, however many times I tried, which is good I guess. &nbsp;But obviously still frustrating as you can't buy the software.
<div><br />
<div>And it is not a browser issue, with the Microsoft engineer we tried 3 different browsers, even different PCs, user ids and networks, &nbsp;without success.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No this is some sort of bug on Microsoft's website, that even after several hours of trying, the MS support desk weren't able to resolve for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The workaround in my case was to buy the software on the Internet (it's actually cheaper too!) &nbsp;You get a card with a license key on it, which you type in, bypassing this problem. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only problem with this is I suspect I won't be able to automatically renew the license next year,so will be in the same situation again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have this problem, please click me too on the original post, so that MS may take note and fix the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>thanks Matt.</div>

            I think I finally have the answer. Here is what I did.
<div>1. Download the file called "O15CTRRemove.exe" (You can search from Google)</div>
<div>2. Run O15CTRRemove.exe to clear all failures from previous installation.</div>
<div>3. Restart your computer</div>
<div>4. Disable antivirus software</div>
<div>5. Turnoff windows firewall</div>
<div>6. Open Internet Explorer. Then press Ctrl+Shift+P</div>
<div>7. It will pop up "InPrivate" window</div>
<div>8. Open www.office.com</div>
<div>9. Sign in using your username/password</div>
<div>10. Go to "My Apps", "View my account details"</div>
<div>11. Choose the type of OS, download, then follow the instruction.</div>

            how are you trying to convert the document to PDF, are you using the Microsoft XPS/PDF converter, Try using the Print to PDF by downloading the tool called PDF 995 or primo PDF which should give you better results

            Was personally having this issue in Word 2007 where the Print Preview displayed the background image correctly, centering and filling the entire background, yet printing to a PDF or printer results in the background image being tiled repeatedly on the
 entire page ==&gt; &nbsp;finally figured it out!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since the Header formatting option presented by others typically is not an appropriate option for most encountering this issue, and the background printing/spooling options don't work, the resolution to prevent the background image from tiling when printing
 to a PDF or a printer is as follows:<br />
<br />
• Open the document in Word 2007<br />
• Click on the 'Page Layout' tab<br />
• 'Page Background' section &gt; click 'Page Color' &gt; click 'Fill Effects...'<br />
• 'Fill Effects' window opens &gt; click 'Texture' tab &gt; click 'Other Texture...' button&nbsp;<br />
• 'Select Texture' window opens &gt; navigate to and click on the desired background image &gt; click 'Insert' button<br />
• 'Fill Effects' window opens &gt; click 'OK' button<br />
<br />
Since there is a known issue between MS Word and some print drivers resulting in pictures in the background being tiled instead of centered and filled, the trick is to insert the background image as a 'Texture' instead of a 'Picture'. Save your Word document
 and then edit as needed for any content to be displayed on top of the background image.<br />

<h2>            Features missing from macOS version vs. Windows version&#63;</h2>
                    I have been watching the training videos for OneNote and noticed that there are features on the Windows version in the videos (such as Ink to Text) that aren't in the macOS version. Is the macOS version missing many other features that the Windows version
 has?

            Short answer: Yes. 
<br />In addition: There is not one "Windows version" any more. There is OneNote 2013/2016 from MS Office for Windows, which has the most features, but will not get new features or improvements any more, as Microsoft stated on different occasions.
<br />Then there is the OneNote app that comes with Windows 10. It has much less features, but is constantly being improved by the dev team.
<br />The MacOS version is somewhat in between those two, but much closer to the feature-poor Windows 10 app. 
<br />Good news is: The OneNote team is still working on the MacOS and iOS versions, so features like ink to text may well come to OneNote for Mac in the future.
<br />For now you could try to "heat it up" a bit by voting for the feature here:
