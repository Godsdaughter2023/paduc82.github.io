    <title>Translation error when importing contacts from windows live to Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Translation error when importing contacts from windows live to Outlook 2010.</h2>
                    I'm following the process outlined here <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/import-contacts-from-windows-live-hotmail-to-outlook-HA010224411.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/import-contacts-from-windows-live-hotmail-to-outlook-HA010224411.aspx</a>&nbsp;but then seeing the 'translation error' message when attempting the import from excel.&nbsp; The forums all describe changing the column&nbsp;headers
 in excel but I don't see how to do that and it seems way to complicated.&nbsp; Really need some help on this one...&nbsp; thanks

            <p>#1 - There is absolutely no requirement to change column names in order to import any data using the Outlook import wizard regardless of how many articles/posts/suggestions you see to that effect. That's a&nbsp;very common suggestion by those who are not in the
 least familiar&nbsp;with the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you should also not depend&nbsp;on Outlook's "auto-mapping" function but rather click on the &lt;Map Custom Fields&gt; when that appears in the&nbsp;import process to ensure that every field in&nbsp;your input data file is mapped correctly to the corresponding Outlook
 field</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2 - The above aside for a moment, did a quick test&nbsp;using the WLM 2012&nbsp;contact export process checking all fields to be exported to a CSV file and this is what I ran across which may or may not be contributing to&nbsp;the problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- found that the file is not being exported as a pure CSV file but rather as a Unicode text file. A pure&nbsp;CSV file will open in Excel without&nbsp;any prompts. When Excel doesn't immediately recognize the file, it will ask you to identify the delimiter etc
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- when opening the&nbsp;original CSV file and clicking on the Map Custom Fields button as noted above, noticed that there strange characters at the beginning of the FirstName field (this may differ on your system based on what fields were selected for export).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open your WLM CSV file in Excel, if it prompts you to identify the delimitor etc - follow the steps and respond accordingly. Once the file is read in by Excel and appears normal, re-save the worksheet as a CSV file with a different name (just to retain your
 original file) and then try importing this new csv file in Outlook as noted above. You could alternatively save this is an Excel file and import that into Outlook but you would need to make sure that you have a named range covering all of your data (all comes
 down to familiarity with things and comfort levels - staying with CSV is the path of "least resistance")</p>

<p>We have a user who has same name that isn't showing up in O365 portal. We have onprem ADFS and DirSync and syncing all directory objects.</p>
<p>Our Service Desk noticed name conflict and for example it was bob bingo and his email address was

<p>User has never shown up in O365 portal</p>
<p>Troubleshooting i'm finding that this users login name is bbingo and with the conflicting user the proxy addresses show

<p>Check the dirsync error reports, if the user is still listed there you have to fix any other duplicate parameters and issues with his attributes. Other than that, check if the user is present in the Metaverse by opening the MIISClient ("C:\Program Files\Microsoft

<p>Hi Chad,</p>
<p>As Vasil mentioned, please fix the duplicate parameters so that the user can be synced.</p>
<p>Normally, you should remove the conflicting user's alias (proxy addresses) or change it. And please notice that if this alias is using the domain.onmicrosoft.com suffix, it cannot be removed or changed via DirSync.</p>

                    <p>I updated to the technical preview a while back and it wiped my C: Drive which is fine but that means it wiped windows 8.1 it means the Technical Preview is my main and only OS! So when windows 10 comes out with its finished form will I get the update or
 will I be stuck with the last version of the Technical Preview.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As it currently stands, the license for the Technical Preview (TP) expires in April, 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been many warnings, including those in the TP documentation, about not installing the preview software on your 'main' PC or using it in production or personal environments for more than 'test' purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be best for you take advantage of any reset/recovery capabilities and support from your PC provider to restore operation to 'factory specifications'.</p>

            Hi, as new builds come out, you will most likely be wiping out your drive a few more times. To do this, it's best to select the Advanced install option during installation. You will need to do this with the Release To Market version of Windows 10 when
 it gets released. Technical previews and Beta versions will eventually expire and one day when you go to start up your computer, you will get a message telling you just that. You will not be able to do too much more with your computer beyond that. On the day
 when that day happens, you can either restore your computer back to it's original operating system if you have your original restore media or you can replace the operating system all together with a new one.

    <title>Indentation not working properly in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Indentation not working properly in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>My frustration with Microsoft Company has boiled over to this writing regarding Microsoft Word and I know that Microsoft could care less.&nbsp; Otherwise they would have changed things so that it is simpler to use instead of harder.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Now that I am calmed
 down a little... here is my question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is it when I have my cursor <u>on the line I want to indent</u> (I know that I am not stupid) , all of the other text moves</strong>
<strong>on the page except for the line <u>that I have my cursor on</u>???????????&nbsp;
</strong>This is so freaking frustrating I cannot even begin to tell you.&nbsp; I have fought... and I have fought over the years with this same exact problem and I am simply tired of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ONLY credit MS gets is that this is text copied from a blog and not an original
<strong>"New</strong>" document.&nbsp; However, I still have the <strong><u>same</u></strong> problems when trying to indent.&nbsp; Sometimes the indentations are different, but sometimes not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOWEVER,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did select <strong>"Merge Formatting"</strong>&nbsp;as my choice for the text being pasted.&nbsp;
<strong>Sooo....</strong> wouldn't that take care of the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks community... you keep me from doing something I would rather regret...lol</p>

<p><span>Before you do anything else, though, click on the Show/Hide

 than a paragraph mark (<span>¶), then all the text is a single paragraph, and any formatting changes you make will apply to the whole thing. You'll need to replace the line breaks (or two line breaks, as
 the case may be) with paragraph breaks. Then you can change the indent for a single paragraph without affecting others.</span></font></span></span></p>

<h2>            scam results</h2>
                    A scammer got access to my computer and some financial info.&nbsp; Microsoft support helped me and pronounced computer safe.&nbsp; But then I got 4 identical emails purportedly from my bank.&nbsp; Each shook on the screen.&nbsp; Does this indicate that he scammer still has
 some access?

<p>The issue of the emails is completely separate from both the initial breach and the question of whether someone still has access to any individual personal accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bruce has mentioned the potential that the PC itself may not be secure, which in part depends upon the original attack profile as he is asking, so I'll leave that question to him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of the emails themselves, the only thing required is that they have your email address and in your specific case the information relating to where you have your bank accounts.&nbsp; If you've already secured these accounts by changing any passwords and
 insured that your PC is safe and secure as well, then the only way the scammers can regain control is to attempt to get you to give up this current information yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where phishing messages come in and there are many tricks to try to convince (con) you into believing these are both real and something is truly wrong.&nbsp; For example, using both the logo and other cues like formatting of the message to look as much
 like the actual bank or other entity is a common method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other common trick is to use annoying or strange visual or audible displays in order to intimidate the target into believing that something is drastically wrong and needs to immediately be dealt with.&nbsp; This is the same as the classic "act now" technique&nbsp;used
 in advertising, but more blatantly displayed in ways that purposefully aggravate and scare you into inappropriate action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the difficult, but highly important thing you need to do is to stop, think and determine whether any individual situation makes sense, since the hope of the scammers is that you'll add each of these individual instances within your mind, allowing them
 to confuse and fluster you into providing them exactly the types of new information that you shouldn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other most effective method to counter these types of attack is to only use communication methods that you are comfortable with as insuring you are truly in contact with the correct people.&nbsp; For example, if for your bank this is by phone, then only
 trust that method when you've personally called them using a known accurate number to verify any such questionable email or other contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key concept you should see here is "divide and conquer", since it's your potential confusion from&nbsp;information overload&nbsp;that the scammers depend upon.</p>

            Thanks so much.&nbsp; What I'm getting from your response is that anyone who has my email address can send me a phishing message and doctor that message with shaking activity or similar to scare me.&nbsp; I thought I had successfully changed my Gmail password but
 I don't have to log in for Gmail so maybe not.&nbsp; At any rate, as far as the past goes, I think the scammers had access to all my saved emails and could glean information from them.&nbsp; I'm wondering if they can gain access to new Gmails.&nbsp; I have to log in to my
 Earthlink web mail and know that that password change was successful.&nbsp; The scammers have my home phone number; is it safe to give a bank my account info over the phone?&nbsp; I still need to change the password for one online bank and am afraid to do it online
 because the scammers could have gotten the bank name and last 4 digits of account from Gmail.

<p>I am embarrassed to say that early Feb. 21 a.m. sleepy me clicked on an email touting a widely known brain health formula.&nbsp; When I tried to reach the order page the screen was filled with a very professional looking page purporting to be from Microsoft stating
 that my computer was at high risk and putting others at risk and to call the # on the screen.&nbsp; Alas I did and the scammers convinced me that they were Microsoft techs with a microsoft address and that they would fix the problem if I would allow their affiliate
 remote access to my computer.&nbsp; I questioned the affiliate bit but they convinced me.&nbsp; After lengthy computer access for the "free" fix they offered continuing service in exchange for a subscription which I foolishly agreed to and paid for with an echeck on
 a bank where I keep only a small balance.&nbsp; Then I got a receipt from Gradient Systems.&nbsp; That started a worry that I followed up on after my morning meeting.&nbsp; I found that they had been identified as scammers.&nbsp; I figured out how to reach the real Microsoft
 help and answer tech Maylyn Santiago accessed my computer and pronounced it safe.&nbsp; I purchased a 1-year Assure subscription.&nbsp; Then I .stopped payment on the echeck to Gradient Systems.&nbsp; Worried that night that I hadn't made sure authentic Windows Defender
 was still on, I checked with the Answer Desk and they said it was and I was safe.&nbsp; However that evening while alerting a financial institution to my problems a yellow light strip containing the message "Are you sure you want to cancel?" flashed on the screen.&nbsp;
 So the next morning I contacted answer desk with this info and again gave a tech access to hunt for Malware, etc.&nbsp; Again computer was pronounced safe..&nbsp; Do you think I still need to reload Windows?&nbsp; My problems started after the computer crashed when Windows
 10 was trying to install updates.&nbsp; A reputable local tech recovered most of my data and put it on a new Windows 10 that had the updates.&nbsp; I trust and would have contacted him first off if the risk message hadn't come in so early in the morning.&nbsp; As you can
 tell, I am a computer illiterate.</p>

<p>At the very least, I would do a Reset. See it in these Recovery Options.</p>

</p><p>You must consider everything on your computer has been compromised. Passwords, PIN numbers, financial account information. A clean install of Windows is the best option and what I would do myself. See the following and decide if you want to tempt fate not
 knowing what they may have installed on your computer. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Or if you reverted to a previous build then;</p>
<p>Right click Start, click on Run and enter regedit and hit enter.&nbsp; This takes you to the registry.<br />
<br />
Navigate to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability<br />
<br />
Under EnablePreviewBuild change the Dword to 2<br />
<br />
Also if under Applicability there is RecoveredFrom.&nbsp; You will find a build number.&nbsp; Change the Dword to 0<br />

Then get out, reboot, and go to Settings, Updates, Check for updates.</p>

<h2>            Installation problems</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to install the insider platform, but have had to give up, so I guess no one will be interested in this.&nbsp; I just wanted to provide the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed it yesterday and again today but it is totally un-usable, so I cannot provide any further feedback.&nbsp; The laptop was running windows 7 and then had an upgrade on line to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the install today one account seemed to work okay, the other primary did nothing, it did another update and the laptop would not re-start so I had to force it to close and then roll back to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies that I cannot help further.&nbsp; </p>

Doing so gives such participants access to an early preview of a product still in development and the possibility to help shape its release with early feedback. Over the years, the methodologies available to do pre-release testing of Microsoft code has opened the door to a new set of early adopters who are more willing to take such products for a early spin without hesitation. Microsoft has responded to the rapid changes since the early days of Windows 95 and in more recent times Windows XP which were only available to a select technical group of private testers. Since the release of Windows 7 in 2009, Microsoft has started making future releas

            MS has not offered the 2007 free trial for a couple of years now. You can get a 2010 free trial instead. It is very similar to 2007.<br />

<p>This did not work. &nbsp;While signed into the effected account the status will show in the account is offline but to other contacts the status is reflected as away. When I select invisible status in the affected account the status to other contacts is reflected
 invisible/offline until I sign out of the account then the status reverts to away. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Claire,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is that you want to share a calendar for all users of your organization? There are several scenarios could get your goal:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create an <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-group-in-Outlook-04d0c9cf-6864-423c-a380-4fa858f27102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 group</a>&gt; set the Privacy as “Public”&gt; thus, all the internal members could access this group, and you may create calendar in the group.</li><li>Create a new calendar of yours&gt; go to share permission setting&gt; add the members who you want to share the calendar with them.</li><li>If you are the admin, you may <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-shared-mailbox-871a246d-3acd-4bba-948e-5de8be0544c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a shared mailbox in admin center</a>&gt; add the members of the shared mailbox permission setting&gt; create the calendar in the shared mailbox.

    <title>Zune Does Not Add All Songs To Collection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Zune Does Not Add All Songs To Collection</h2>
                    I just reinstalled Zune after some months since I had to reinstall windows on a new hard drive.&nbsp; I'm currently trying to add everything I can to the collection and rearrange what I've got on my phone.&nbsp; However, many songs are simply not showing up.&nbsp; I'm
 getting incomplete albums and some are completely mislabeled.&nbsp; I've tried letting it ignore duplicates as some song names in my game music collection may duplicate despite being different folders/albums, no help.&nbsp; I've tried adding album folders individually
 and it may get some of the missing songs but not all.&nbsp; I've got one video game album in particular that has 72 tracks yet Zune only thinks it has two, but if I add the individual album folder to the monitored folders list it gives me 18 songs so it's still
 missing about 75% of the music.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />

<p>Hi Nathan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the information in your post, you are configuring an Office 365 account in your Outlook for Mac. Please make sure the network connectivity is OK on your Mac first. Then have a check if you set your Outlook for Mac as Offline mode: Click Outlook
 and check if you checked the option Work Offline. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have checked all the settings I mentioned above, and the issue persists. The issue probably is related to your Office 365 account, please try to sign in your account via the following link to see how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, would you please help confirm if you can sign into your account in the Mac Mail application successfully? And if the other people in your organization encountered the same issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Coldwell</p>

    <title>Excel won&#39;t open in Office 365 Home Premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clarwa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel won&#39;t open in Office 365 Home Premium</h2>
                    <p>I have a windows 8 laptop for which I purchased Office 365 Home premium. Although the programmes worked fine initially it has since stopped opening Excel and gives the message "We're sorry, but Excel has run into an error that is preventing it from working
 correctly. Excel will&nbsp;need to be closed as a result. Would you like us to repair now?" If I choose 'Repair Now'&nbsp;it then gives the option to run a quick repair or an online repair. Running quick repair takes about&nbsp;7 minutes before telling me that it is done
 repairing and I can use my programme now. However, the same message appears as previously and Excel still won't open. Choosing the online repair&nbsp;takes about 15 minutes but ends up with the same result. I've tried to open Excel in safe mode and it still doesn't
 open so the problem is not with add-ins. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can you please help as this is really&nbsp;causing me severe problems as I use spreadsheets all the time.&nbsp;By the way, all other office applications open correctly so the problem is only with Excel.&nbsp;I've also just updated to Windows 8.1 and the problem is the
 same.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I've managed to sort this by going into the file location and running the troubleshooter. I entered that the program worked previously but wasn't working now. This led me to the current settings&nbsp;and it showed them set to&nbsp;Windows 7. Once I changed this&nbsp;to
 Windows 8 Excel opened and I then set this as the default settings. Everything now works fine. Not sure how this was changed previously but very happy now that I have fixed the problem.</p>

    <title>Excel Overtime Spreadsheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jc0311  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Overtime Spreadsheet</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>This is a predecessors generic table in excel with no calculations.&nbsp; It represents a picking order for overtime available and/or shifts available to cover vacations/call in etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The order to offer is obviously: who it is offered to first</p>
<p>Response to offer is basically: accepted w/date, refused w/date and unavailable (no answer basically)</p>
<p>Hours Accum:&nbsp; how many hours worked that day on overtime</p>
<p>Order to assign (tricky bit I think): once accepted, they drop to the lowest pecking order (4 in this case) and everyone else move up one, refused, they move to the top of the pecking order for next time, unavailable is no change except if bumped by others.</p>
<p># of assign: how many times in this time frame he/she has had overtime assigned</p>
<p>Fill: blacked out area for separation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This usually runs weekly currently, but could be bi-weekly or monthly also.&nbsp; As you can see, not much information here, and its usually just printed our and filled it with ink etc.&nbsp; He now wants to 'automate' this as much as possible, and although I am OK
 with formulas etc, I believe this to be out of my bounds so any suggestions/samples would be appreciated.&nbsp; My hard part is the pecking order changing automatically and thinking about a code system for annotate accepted, refused or unavailable such as (simply)&nbsp;
 A, R, U?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any input or suggestions the community might have.&nbsp; If you desire more information, feel free to ask and I will post what I can.</p>

            Hello
<br />
<br />If an Office application such as Word or Excel isn’t working correctly, sometimes restarting it will fix the problem. If that doesn’t work, you can try repairing it. When you’re done, you might need to restart your computer.
<br />
<br />The steps to access the repair tool vary depending on your operating system. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />
<br />If there's anything else that I can help you with, please do not hesitate to reply here and we will further assist you. We'd love to hear from you again. 
<br />
<br />Thanks!

            Do you have the same problem if you start in safe mode? 
<br />
<br />Is this a problem with one document or all documents or something in between?

<br />
<br />Does it happen if you open Word in Safe mode?

<br />Safe mode is not a way to regularly use Word, but it is a valuable diagnostic step. If your problem goes away when you use Safe mode, we can walk you through other steps that may help eliminate the problem. Please write back.

<br />If it works in Safe mode, you may want to look at the following while waiting for more information from me or here on the forum.

 email account.&nbsp; Not a huge problem, except this; I'm going through a divorce right now and when my phone crashed, i lost all the text messages from my wife.....i need to get into the old account to print some of these texts.&nbsp; Is there any way to retreive a

<h3> hb68  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I import eml docs to Outlook 2007&#63;</h2>
                    In the last few days I have had a clean instalation of Windows 7 and Office 2007. Prior to this all files were copied to a secondary storage hard disc.&nbsp; Windows 7 started up fine and everything is running well. On opening Office Outlook the system reconnected
 automatically and set up outlook. In the past I had created a file structure in Outlook to store old emails for future referance. So far I have been able to transfer all "contacts" but I am unable to open the old stored emails. I can get to my old files and
 can see that they contain all the stored emails. I have so far tried all the import options within Mail but I am unable to open the old emails. they are eml docs and it just says use the web but nothing opens them and I am nervous about downloading some random
 program.&nbsp;&nbsp; any suggestion to what should I try next?<br />
thank you<br />
