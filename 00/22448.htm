    <title>Excel external links not updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mw613  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel external links not updating</h2>
                    <p>I have created a (target) spreadsheet that gathers totals from 50+ other (source) spreadsheeets. A typical target cell would count the number of blank cells in a given source range. The target cell contains the full path (including the drive letter) to the
 source data, to which I have full access.</p>
<p>If the source spreadsheets are open, then the target spreadsheet is correctly populated, therefore proving that the links are valid.</p>
<p>However, if I open the target spreadsheet and the sources are closed, then #VALUE! is shown for every occurence of a link.</p>
<p>Excel Options&nbsp;are set as follows:</p>
<p>Workbook Calculation = Automatic</p>
<p>Trust Center External Content = Enable all Data Connections</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I select 'Data | Edit Links' in the target spreadsheet then all of the sources are visible, with&nbsp;Update = A and Status = Unknown.</p>
<p>If I&nbsp;'Update Value' then #VALUE! remains, but if&nbsp;I 'Open Source' then the cells&nbsp;in the target spreadsheet are populated correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have painstakingly opened all of the source&nbsp;spreadsheets to gather the target data, which was successful.&nbsp;I then&nbsp;selected all of the target data and applied sub-totals to it. Presumably this performs a re-calculation and all of the data has disappeared
 to be replaced by #VALUE!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I retain the source data?</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just bought the new Palm Treo Pro, which works with Windows mobile system. Before, I had the Palm 680 which worked with Palm system.</p>
<p>I have tried to synchronise the information of my PC with the smartphone, but I can just&nbsp;synchronise hte information from Outlook from my PC to the Treo Pro, but I don't know how to do it with the information I have in my Palm Calendar I use
 to use before.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with this? It really will help me. I need to introduce the information I have in the old Palm system to the new Windows mobile one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>There are only very brief instructions on page 44, in section 'Mobile email'.<br />
It should have an 'other' option if the guided Windows Live Hotmail setup fails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technically speaking and from the looks of it, it is probably a proxy mail client which could be configured differently by the carrier, so the AT&amp;T support may be a better option, if you are on a contract with them?</p>

<p>Not much there regarding Microsoft or Hotmail setup that I could find, so I suggest visit your mobile operator/carrier or give them a call, if it still does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you get it sorted out.</p>

            Good call. Yes, when I went to "other" in the email options it was the same as Hotmail, ~"no longer available". So, yes again, I think the best thing is to take it by the AT&amp;T guys at the mall. They've helped me with other things.&nbsp;

    <title>Erratic scrolling on Word 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miketsmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Erratic scrolling on Word 365</h2>
                    <p>In some of my documents, I am unable to scroll down without the programme 'taking over', and scrolling immediately through the document and onto a grey blank canvas.</p>
<p>I am then unable to scroll up without it forcing the screen back down to the grey 'page' (i.e. no editable work page). I can only return up by pressing CTRL Home, and the same happens as I try to scroll down.</p>
<p>This has happened on many, but not all, formatted documents.</p>
<p>I have had to resolve it by copying text from the document and replacing it in a new doc.</p>
<p>I use three different Mouses in different locations, so it isn't that (also, scrolling to an uneditable screen would point to this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you assist!</p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In order to resolve this issue let us try the following steps.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>We shall first try opening Word 2013 (part of Office 365) in the Safe Mode and check if the erratic scrolling issue resolves in the Safe Mode. Let us follow these steps to open Word 2013 in the Safe Mode:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hold the <strong>Windows</strong> key down and press <strong>R,</strong> In the
<strong>Run</strong> box that opens type <strong>winword /safe</strong> (note there is a space between
<strong>winword </strong>and <strong>/</strong>) and click on <strong>Ok</strong>. If you are not able to open the Run box then follow this step. Click on
<strong>Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Run </strong>and type in the command
<strong>winword /safe</strong> and click on <strong>Ok</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This action will open Word 2013 in the Safe Mode. Check if you are able to scroll normally in some of the Word documents. If yes, then follow the next set of steps as under:
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the application works fine in safe mode, disable the Add-Ins for the application and check the result.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click the <strong>File</strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Go to <strong>Options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Add-ins</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>COM Add-Ins</strong> from the drop down window at the bottom of the box</span></li><li><span>Try disabling the Add-ins – clear all the options and click on <strong>
OK</strong> to save the changes made. Note: In case you see some Add-ins getting checked again after applying OK it is still fine. Ignore and proceed further.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>After completing COM Add-Ins follow the same steps as above and check under
<strong>Word Add-Ins</strong> to see if there are any Add-in there which you can disable. If yes, proceed with the same steps as mentioned above.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check if the above step works and you are able to scroll normally in the Word documents. If yes, then you may follow the steps in the following Microsoft article:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541</span></a><span> to troubleshoot the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>

            <p>Harlan Groove's pull function did not work????</p>
<p>Well, I don't which version you found, but we can reduce it to a very small one to get just one value, as you asked for.</p>
<p>The basic of the function is the call to ExecuteExcel4Macro with the cell reference as argument, this opens a DDE channel to the file and reads the value.</p>
<p>But ExecuteExcel4Macro needs the reference in R1C1 absolut style and can only read one value at a time. (That's why Harlan's function has much more code.)</p>
<p>If we assume that you pass the reference always in A1 style to the function we can use ConvertFormula to build the R1C1 style.</p>
<p>This works fine inside any macro, but not in a UDF, because many parts of the application are locked if the worksheet is calculated, means ExecuteExcel4Macro did not work inside a UDF.</p>
<p>The trick to get it to work anyway is to open Excel twice and call the ExecuteExcel4Macro of the other (invisible) instance.</p>
<p>Copy the UDF below into a normal module and the formula</p>
<p>=DDE("'\Daily Sales Sheets\Year Ending 2012\[Daily Sales&nbsp; 11-10-3.xlsx]Table'!E$15")</p>
<p>into a cell to get the value from the closed file. After you see that this works, build the string for DDE in the same way as for INDIRECT.</p>
<p>Andreas.</p>
<p><br />
Function DDE(ByVal Reference As String) As Variant<br />
&nbsp; Static XL As Application<br />
&nbsp; On Error Resume Next<br />
&nbsp; If XL Is Nothing Then Set XL = CreateObject("Excel.Application")<br />
&nbsp; DDE = XL.ExecuteExcel4Macro(Application.ConvertFormula(Reference, xlA1, xlR1C1, True))<br />
End Function<br />

<h2>            Call audio quality using Skype phone</h2>
                    <p>I am using the Skype handset with a phone number to use as my main phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when I make calls, it works fine with no problems. Other times, when the person on the other end answers my call, all they can hear is static, although I can hear them fine. When I hang up and call back, it usually works fine then. Periodically,
 during a call that is working fine, suddenly the other person complains that I am starting to break up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any input on how to resolve these issues would be much appreciated. Thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you checked if&nbsp;there's an update with your device firmware? If the latest firmware is installed, apparently, you have to contact RTX support directly to check this for you. You can try resetting your phone but I recommend to email RTX support&nbsp;first
 to confirm this (support may vary depending on your location). </p>

            Hello, how are you, thanks for posting your concerns in the microsoft community, I found this information useful, I hope it helps you 
<br />
<br />One way to have a backup and restore WhatsApp messages between Android phones is to use Google Drive, since it is a free application available for all Android phones. You can also use an SD card if one is installed in your phone, but do so only if that SD card can also be inserted into your new phone.
<br />
<br />You should make sure you have Google Drive installed (and signed in to the same Google account) on new and old Android phones.
<br />
<br />Now open WhatsApp on the old Android phone, touch the three points in the upper right corner and choose Settings.
<br />
<br />Select Chats, then chat backup. Select Backup to back up your WhatsApp chat history in Google Drive.
<br />
<br />Now, on the new phone, check your WhatsApp account with your phone number. You will be automatically asked to restore your WhatsApp messages from a Google Drive backup. Select the most recent backup and your messages will be restored in the background

    <title>Unreliable connection opening files from Sharepoint Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unreliable connection opening files from Sharepoint Online</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>My company has Office 365 and I've started putting documents onto the SharePoint Online service but opening these documents from Word and Excel is very unreliable. Sometimes it just works but at least half of the time, it just errors when I try to access
 the SharePoint. Even trying to browse the server from Word or Excel produces an error instead of letting me see the documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common error is:<br />
"You'll need the Internet for this.</p>
<p>We couldn't connect to one of the services we needed to sign you in. Please check you connection and try again.</p>
<p>0xCAA70004"</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my Internet connection is working perfectly, there's no company filter or anything in the way and if I browse SharePoint in my web browser or via Teams, I can open the documents in Word and Excel Online, just not the local installs (Office 2016,
 installed from Office 365 and fully patched - currently Excel v1709 (Build 8528.2139 Click-to-run)).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I start getting this error the only thing that ever helps is to restart my PC (Windows 10 1709 but problem occurs on other machines with Windows 10 1703).</p>
<p>Problems occur on multiple machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody provide any suggestions?</p>

<p><span>Hi Scott IP,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that you encounter the issue when you open the Word or Excel file and then browse the online address.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, to move forward, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. As the issue happens on multiple computers in the company network environment, I suggest you install the same version of the Office applications on your computer in another network environment to
 do a test and let us know the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does the issue happen in other Office applications’ files like PowerPoint 2016 files?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the Word 2016 application you are using. You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If no, list the detailed reproducing steps of the issue you are experiencing for our troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, as the Office applications you are using may not have the latest version, I suggest you check the updates to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<p>This is another example of the flawed authentication process Msft seems unwilling to fix. Accessing SPO files from any local program requires passing authentication and senior Msft engineers have told me the archaic webDav protocol they are using is much
 less sophisticated than modern browser technology, which is why it works in the browser but not reliably directly with a local program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the same reason, mapped drives and network locations don't work properly. Unfortunately there's not much we can do.</p>

<p>The problem is intermittent so I can't always reproduce it but when it is happening, to reproduce the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Excel (or Word)</li><li>Click "Open Other Workbooks"</li><li>Select the sharepoint location in the first column</li><li>Click on the folder in the second column</li></ul>
<p>It will then prompt me to login, I enter my company account login and then after about 30 seconds, it displays the error dialog without asking for my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally after booting up my PC, it works but after some period of time (I don't know how long) it will stop working.</p>
<p>Rebooting my machine seems to fix it.</p>
<p>If I don't reboot, it never seems to recover.</p>
<p>Colleagues have the same issue on their PCs.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like a network issue as the problems don't appear at the same time, i.e. one person will be able to access the sharepoint at the same time as someone else can't.</p>
<p>I've not been able to reproduce the problem on a machine outside our network but it's not something that I can reproduce on demand. It just happens after an indeterminate period of time.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to test with Powerpoint yet, as it is currently connecting to SharePoint as I rebooted my PC this morning. I will test when it stops working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hi Scott,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, the issue only happens in the Excel and Word files. As the issue happens intermittently and it seems that the Office applications you are using don’t have the latest version, I
 suggest you check if you can update them. If yes, update them to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have the latest version now, I suggest you navigate to Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;the Office applications’ icon&gt;Repair and then do a test again to check the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, </span><span>upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the Word 2016 application you are using.
 You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<p>Hi Cliff</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powerpoint is the same, I hadn't previously tested it because I haven't needed to use it since I finished University 16 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word / Excel are running the latest version; if I click update on the account screen it says that I'm already on the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair doesn't have any effect.</p>

<h2>            How to clear multiple checkboxes &#40;on a continuous form&#41; with one click</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,<br />
</p>
<p>I need help clearing 61 check boxes with one click.&nbsp; The form is a continuous form that exist only to remind users to complete the “required” steps on the form to the left of it. The checkbox is bound but there is no data collected.&nbsp; I tried the unbound
 checkbox but it just ticked all boxes at the same time.&nbsp; I want the checkbox to tick individually but untick simultaneously.&nbsp; They are strictly visual. &nbsp;I have found several codes however; they all clear only the “last” checkbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I have now. &nbsp;I appreciate any suggestions. - Thank you</p>

            Your question is a little ambiguous.&nbsp; You refer to <em>'multiple check boxes'</em> which would mean 61 check boxes for each record.&nbsp; This is how John interpreted your request.<br />
<br />
I suspect that you are really mean multiple <em>instances </em>of a single check box, one instance per row in a form in continuous forms view. If so you need to update the value of the Boolean (Yes/No) column to which the check box is bound in every row of
 the table:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const conSQL = "UPDATE [YourTableName] SET [YourColumnName] = FALSE"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' ensure current record is saved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Dirty = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' update column in all rows of the table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute conSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
<br />
The form should refresh automatically, but if not add the following line to the above:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Refresh<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Firstly the method is Requery, not Requiry.&nbsp; This reloads the form's recordset, so it will have the effect of saving the current record before the SQL statement is executed.&nbsp; Setting the form's Dirty property to False is a more efficient solution.&nbsp; Moving
 focus to the Verified control is unnecessary.<br />
<br />
The most important issue, however, is that the Verified column is apparently not a Boolean (Yes/No) data type, as a Boolean column has only two possible values TRUE or FALSE, implemented in Access as -1 or 0.&nbsp; It cannot be NULL.&nbsp; A bound check box is nearly
 always bound to a Boolean column.&nbsp; Occasionally it will be bound to a column of integer number data type which allows Nulls, i.e. its Required property is False (No).&nbsp; This will only be the case where it is necessary to use 3-way logic, with values of TRUE,
 FALSE or MAYBE, implemented as -1. 0 or NULL, to which the column should be constrained by its ValidationRule property.&nbsp; I doubt that is the case here, so you should be using a column of Boolean data type, which is what the code I gave you assumes, although
 it would work with a column of integer number data type, which suggests that your column is of text data type.

<p>I interpreted your request like Ken, that you have a table of 61 records that indicate steps in a process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However what is not clear is what these steps are related to. Do you have single tblChecklist&nbsp; or does it have a FK field for the process you are checking?</p>

<p>Good Morning all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken, Requiry was an typo and yes Verified is a (yes/no) Boolean field. &nbsp;I was trying to update this incident via iphone and by memory. &nbsp;Thank you for the definition description behind behind the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I duplicated a table which list 60 things to verify while reviewing a file. &nbsp;(I remove the NoErrors field so now it's 60 instead of 61 items in the list) From this table I Go into Design View mode, set the Continuous Form property to continuous form and
 add two (2) fields; the <strong>Verified checkbox </strong>and the <strong>Description</strong> field to the continuous form. &nbsp; So now, still in Design View you will see two (2) fields a
<strong>Verified</strong>&nbsp;<strong>checkbox</strong> &nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Description</strong>&nbsp;<strong>text box
</strong>field. &nbsp;I removed the labels from both fields | added a command button labelled ClearAll. &nbsp;Behind the OnClick event, I placed the following code:</p>
<p>
<em>Private Sub CmdClearAll_Click()</em><br />
</p><p><em>Dim strSQL AS String</em><br />
</p>
<p><em>Me.Verified.SetFocus</em></p>
<p><em>Me.Requery</em></p>
<p><em>strSQL="Update tblChecklist SET Verified = Null;"</em></p>
<p><em>CurrentDb.Execute strSQL, dbFailonError</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>End Sub</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Scott, it is a single table with a primary key. Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>This checklist is ONLY visual. &nbsp;It will not collect and store data true/false, yes/no or 0/1. &nbsp;As we read through the 1st record via the main form - the user can check off the steps completed. &nbsp;At the end and before the user click submit (on the main form)
 he/she will Click ClearAll to clear the check boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for your diligence.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The code will do what you want, but not what it says.&nbsp; A Boolean column cannot be NULL, only TRUE or FALSE.&nbsp; NULL is not a value, it's the absence of a value.&nbsp; So the SQL statement<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UPDATE tblChecklist SET Verified = NULL;<br />
<br />
doesn't make any sense.&nbsp; However, it works because Access is sufficiently indulgent to correct the error and&nbsp; update the Verified column to FALSE.&nbsp; The statement should really be:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UPDATE tblChecklist SET Verified = FALSE;<br />
<br />
Other lines in the code are unnecessary:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; As the statement is a fixed string expression, why declare a variable, and then assign a value to the variable,&nbsp; when you can simply assign the string expression to a constant?<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Why move focus to the Verified control? That has no effect on the UPDATE operation.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; As regards calling the Requery method, as I said earlier, that reloads the form's recordset, which has the effect of moving the record pointer to the first row in the sort order.&nbsp; If you particularly want to do that, then you can leave it in, but again
 it has no effect on the UPDATE operation.<br />
<br />
In short, you've accidentally achieved the main object, but would it not be better to understand how to do it correctly?<br />
<br />
Finally, your statement directed to Scott, <em>"This checklist is ONLY visual.&nbsp; It will not collect and store data…."</em> isn't true.&nbsp; I know what you mean, but any value at any column position in any table in the database is a datum.&nbsp; The fact that the values
 are not what we might term <em>'operational data'</em> does not mean that no data is being stored.<br />
<br />
You might feel I'm nit-picking, but to me it's axiomatic that an understanding of what is being done is as essential to relational database development, as it is to the fundamental physics to which Richard Feynman was referring in his words to his students
 quoted below my signature.</p>

<h2>            Secure Email Certificate Not Available in Trust Center Settings</h2>
                    <p>I tried Googling this, but have not found an answer.&nbsp; The following information is taken from this article:&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2482059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2482059</a>.</p>

<ol>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my test on OneNote 16.20 (18120801), after I setting the default font, the font does changes when I type in a new page, so to confirm your situation, please provide the following information
 to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Whether the font still change to Calibri when you type in a new page.</p>
<p>2. Please provide the version of the OneNote for Mac, you can check it in
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

<p>When you change the default font in Preferences to something else, like Helvetica, new notes will be Helvetica for a while but at some point the default font changes back to Calibri on its own.</p>

            <p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you would like to Auto hide the Task Bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which Build are you using on your Computer?</li><li>Do you get any error message?</li></ol>
<p>I would like to inform you that, latest build which is available is 10130, are you using the same build?</p>
<p>We tried reproducing the issue on the same build and found that it is not a bug, the auto hide feature does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Right click on taskbar&gt; properties &gt;check the box saying "auto hide taskbar".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Note:</strong> Make sure "lock the Taskbar” is unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Click <strong>"OK".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to create a new user account and check.</p>
<p>For Windows 10, the easiest way is to follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start.</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>“add delete and manage other user accounts”</strong> in search box.</li><li>Add someone else to this PC.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Please provide us the information in brief. We will be happy to assist you further.</p>

<p>Build 10130 I have the same problem with taskbar on the right. You have got to be kidding that a person has to create a new user account to fix anything. The idea is that Microsoft&nbsp;is supposed to fix the problems with good programing not the customer. Got
 it to work on my desktop by doing a restart after&nbsp;check marking&nbsp;the auto hide. The auto hide would not work before I did the Restart.</p>

<p>after looking at a lot of other forum posts about problems, in my opinion a common answer from Microsoft seems to be "create another user account" which i must say has solved a lot my problems with the latest and previous builds.</p>
<p>

<p>create new user B with admin rights ( another microsoft account ) check problems are fixed</p>
<p>delete user A account</p>
<p>sign into user B account and create user A account with the original microsoft account details which are still stored with microsoft.</p>

<p>
</p><p>you will now be back to your original A account hopefully with everything working, this has worked for me on several occasions, although i have not done it on this pc to fix the auto hide feature because I'm hoping the next build which is not far away will
 fix a lot of problems. </p>

            I found that by simply hovering the cursor over the Task View icon, it allowed the taskbar to auto-hide. Not sure what that issue is, but that's how I "fixed" mine.

<p>I started a new cutover migration yesterday and all mailboxes were stuck on "Provision Updating". &nbsp;I found the thread on the problems that you were having with migrations (EX31677) and&nbsp;I left it hoping it may finish overnight but when I got in this morning
 it was still like I left it. &nbsp;I clicked the "Stop" button to stop it and it is now stuck on "Stopping".</p>

<p>hi chadtrahan,</p>
<p>to know more clearly about this issue, could you please capture a screenshot of your migration dashboard? for example:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=86610c51-05e2-406e-82b3-63fb750f82b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d86610c51-05e2-406e-82b3-63fb750f82b2" /></a></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>meantime, i’d like to collect some information:<br />
1. is there any other error message shown after you click stop?<br />
2. does the deleted button show grey out?<br />
3. have you tried the powershell cmdlts to stop the migration batch? here are the steps:</p>
<p>(1) <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to exchange online using remote powershell.</a><br />

            I have spent hours trying to figure out this issue and am fed up with so many big changes with the newer versions of Office and how it doesn't do this or that. I can't work like this anymore. I am now downloading and trying out Libre Office and Open Office
 to see if they work better with exporting slides to jpgs without the hassle of picture viewer and distortion and will they be able to export 300dpi without problems. Recently with another computer I contacted MS support and both guys made a mess of my computer
 and one wanted me to review them before the reboot to see if it worked. OMG! I will never use their support again since it can really make a mess of things. I may migrate away from MS entirely if open source has more reliable office suite.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            For reasons beyond me if I change the dpi to 299 it works and I don't get the distortion with the orange part that I do with 300dpi in the DWORD file. I am thinking MS is getting even more sloppy with the coding and it is little stuff like this that drives
 us all crazy. I don't want other improvements if I have to give up better viewer or have to deal with all the buggy coding. I have wasted days on this and had to reformat a computer due to the mess or f****** by MS support (from India from the sounds of it.)
 In my spare time I will learn how to use Libre Impress so when the next big change occurs and I can't find where the buggy coding is I can make the migration without hurting work flow. I think you have to have a back up plan with MS the way it just arbitrarily
 pushes these new OS systems and Office on us. I can't believe these things are not really vetted but just dumped on consumers. Having the old viewer option would have been a no brainer and so many complained but nothing was done. Only when they get a certain
 ratio of complaints do they even bother and most folks don't have any idea of where they need to lodge those complaints officially. Certainly not here!

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>96dpi is the default export resolution of a PowerPoint slide. Before we proceed, we need additional details. This way we will be on the same page. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you experiencing the issue when saving all types of files, or is it only when saving the a .jpg file?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages? If yes, kindly provide us a screenshot.</li><li>Did you make any changes before this issue happened?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven’t tried it yet, you can configure the PowerPoint settings to make sure that the image will remain at high resolution. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click File.</li><li>Choose <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Image Size and Quality</strong>, check the box beside <strong>Do not compress images in file</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>Yes I know the default is 96dpi.</p>
<p>Yes I tried pngs, tiffs, jpgs and all with the same poor results.</p>
<p>No error messages at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had followed your site's directions on how to up the dpi to 300. I had done this very same thing with Win7 and Office 2007 and had no problems. It worked for me for years this way. So when I moved to the new computer with Win10 and office 2013 I first
 saved everything at 96dpi and then realized I had to change the settings with newer Win10 machine. After that change I noticed the exporting was off with the images.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried many things and nothing helped except when I changed the dpi back to 96 it was ok. So I realized that the value data is driving this problem. So that is when I decided to just change the dpi by 1 to 299 and voila it now works and not distortion to
 the image. So there is something really wrong. But the dpi does change on the images when I look at their properties to what I put in the ExportBitmapResolution file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had the problem recently with my Win7 machine that I had to reformat since the bozos in India with Microsoft had me do stuff that messed things up. With that clean install with Win7 I installed Office 13 to it instead and then I began getting the
 bad exporting there too. I will say that the common denominators here are: <strong>
Office 2013 and the value data and both had updates done</strong>. The Win7 machine was a clean install. The newer machine with Win10 is used very lightly by my husband who didn't do much on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last year when Win 10 was free to install I tried it on my older Win 7 computer where I do all my work and well the viewer was a disaster. I could not tell where the image began and ended and the background was dark as I recall. I could not line up the borders
 I added. I tried to work with it but it was impossible. Also everything was organized differently and now my ability to get much done was impacted and&nbsp; my of my productivity declined. I do think you can expand on a new OS and Office abilities but to change
 the way it is all organized is really a bad strategy for those of us who use it to work with. Everything takes ten times longer just trying to figure out where to find things. So many changes meant so many things we had to remember on top of doing the graphics
 work.&nbsp; I finally just made short cuts to save some time for common things since not only were things moved to a different location but they were named differently too. Not to mention the morning boot up was S L O W and I retreated back to Win 7 so I could
 get my work done.&nbsp; Many complained about the viewer and I even posted to that special place about the viewer but was told it all depended on how many people complain, only then will MS bother to put people on it to fix it. I can see fixing only the important
 things but a viewer is pretty important when dealing with PowerPoint and graphics. From what I have read this viewer was absent in Office 2013. I wonder if when they removed it they left some holes in it and this causes problems with the exporting. I thought
 well maybe it is just the viewer that sees the distortion but when I print it up, the distortion is on the printable. I also make sure to check in PP do not compress graphics since these are printables and I want the best print possible.</p>

<p>Office 2013, as originally released, had some fairly bad bugs in the image export portion of its code, bugs that bit especially hard when you wanted higher resolution images.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I recall, SP2 fixed most if not all of the bugs I was aware of.&nbsp; Please make sure your copy of Office is fully updated.&nbsp; That might be all that's needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the bugs caused odd things to happen when the export limit was right at the maximum number of pixels that PPT supported, 3072 if memory serves.&nbsp; If your slide's maximum dimension is 10", then 300 dpi should keep you in the clear but if your slide
 size is larger than that, it'd probably put you over the max and might trigger bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember offhand whether they fixed this one or not, but it's worth testing with 10" wide slides.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well in the past when I did a clean install I would get all the SP1 and SP2 updates etc no problem. But this time around it was a problem. They went on about how they don't support Win7 and well I thought MS had made a statement long ago that they would
 support it till 2021 but they have renigged on it apparently. It have noticed it will do updates on it's own and haven't bothered to check which ones they are doing and which ones they are not doing now since they are not letting me select the updates like
 SP1 or SP2. All conveniently vague. When I did the clean install MS wanted to handle it compared to when I do it from the disk entirely. It was very different this time around. So I have no idea if I can even get SP2 or when they decide to update it at 3:00am
 in the morning etc. But I have moved on to the Win10 machine since I do feel that Win7 is getting buggier by the lack of their committed support. They clearly are pushing customers to 10 this way. Hey I remember how MS dealt with my favorite browser many years
 ago by putting buggy code in Windows to push folks away from it and put it out of business and there was a lawsuit about that one. Do I trust MS? Not entirely sure with some of their practices in the past. Not sure what to believe from them anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to create on a 8.5 x 11" slide for printables so moving to a 10" presentation slide size is not going to work. But it does appear to be working if I use 299dpi which is close enough. I don't have time to play their games via India support
 which is just terrible. When I talked to the two guys from MS India support they made it sound like I won the lottery since my problem was one that they don't charge for. What resulted is they both hadn't a clue of how to fix it and made things much worse
 and caused me to just do a clean install. Yeah I got free help alright but it cost me more in time and trouble. That was not helping that was wasting my time which means money.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get how HP and Dell really don't think much of individual consumers and more focused on selling their throw away boxes to big business. HP sold me an inherently defective top of the line tower a few years back. I upgraded it to the max. When I bought they
 new the motherboard was bad but they sold it to me anyway. They sent me and thousands like me to their crummy India support as a stall tactic to get Asus to build an provide replacement Mobos. If you had googled inherently defective HP owned that term and
 there was a class action suit. There were so many models affected and laptops. Total screw up. But it was insult to injury to not be honest and to send us on a wild goose chase for weeks with India support. I bought directly from HP but if I had bought it
 at Costco they would have taken it back. HP at the time only had a 17 return policy believe it or not. That includes the time your order it, then ship it and they try to figure out what is wrong and get it back to them. Unbelievable what this sector does to
 consumers. Then when the technician showed up to install new Mobo it turns out he installed the power supply upside down pushing the heat to the inside of the cover and heating up. Here I thought it was all the upgrades I did to it. I took one of the side
 panels off to let heat out otherwise it would have fried years ago. Recently the power supply died and it is then that I realized that they had messed up and they would not accept responsibility. I spent 2K on that machine and I would never buy another HP
 anything again. I also wouldn't buy another Dell either they had no support in the U.S at all. It is either in India or South America and it is dismal. Will have someone build me a unit next time around. But that mindset in this sector is just astonishing.
 When I looked inside the HP box it was so crammed you couldn't get at much and they do it on the super cheap. I paid them for figuring it all out and well they hadn't.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think that same mindset is true with these software companies as well. Right now support is a joke and you are on your own to figure out work arounds with the poorly designed boxes and programs. Right now my work around is going to 299dpi with Win10 and
 Office 2013. I hope others will find this and will be able to adjust it accordingly if they get stuck. After what these two guys in India messed up my computer and they did a remote thing too I would never allow them to do a remote anything again since they
 have no idea of what they are doing and I wouldn't trust them again. When support is done in other parts of the world you know you are not a priority with the company. I am a small business and more agile and can provide and WANT to provide good customer support.
 I don't have stockholders or a board of directors to appease to get the job done and overly paid executives to coddle either and I don't need to have my headquarters in over priced CA.</p>

<p>Since compressing images is developing at a break necking pace you would think that MS would be more on top of this compression thing. Here is an interesting podcast that explains how audio and video (images) are being developed and some of it is positively
 scary. So keeping up with this compression thing <strong>is</strong> important. </p>

<p>I don't work for MS and even the MS employees here can't do anything about the support or corporate direction MS has or will take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how aggravating it can be to deal with them when things don't work right, and how good it feels to let off steam but it's best here to stick to the problem at hand and leave the other stuff out.&nbsp; It distracts from the immediate problem and makes it
 harder for us to focus on helping you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you've got the immediate problem solved, but if you want to try to address the updating issue, let us know.</p>

<p>Thank you Steve but if all customers just kept it to themselves about the problems and their frustrations that would be worse in my opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Office 2013 is buggy and yesterday I was making a list of all the problems I get with this program aside from not being able to export at 300dpi. I have had to adapt to all the bugs and this is ridiculous. Perhaps they should just get rid of them? It
 doesn't bode well for the next generation of PP. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I do think some employees at MS can change things and the more people cite examples of the poor coding the better since they seem to depend on most being helpless on it all or clueless. Yesterday I downloaded both Open Office and Libre Office to practice
 with just in case PP is unusable for making digital products. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked with you before Steve and well it has been hit and miss. You never really used PP the way I do and had no idea about my issues and I am sure MS doesn't either. Many do what I am doing. If I kept silent and super polite about it what incentive
 does it give them fix it? They get their money without any hassles. These last two support guys in India were the worst and that is why I am here since those bozos need to be called out since they really didn't do much and wanted good review before the reboot.
 I am calling them out on that. Plus they wasted my time with clean install. I think most businesses hate to have their time wasted by this technology sector and this silicon valley mindset is disturbing in so many ways. I am older and worked with dumb terminals
 in the beginning and I know you can work without being digital everything and have better security and with better copyright protection. HBO is rethinking their digital approach right now. We have comprised a lot with all this and not getting better but new
 generations with window dressings and we shouldn't have to be going around trying to figure a way around the sloppy coding. These programs are dumped before being vetted properly. These were the ones that quickly came to mind:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have learned that I can't export all the images in one PP if the name has a space just before .pptx. When I remove the space it works. OMG! This happened in both Office 7 and Office 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When you make changes to the first slide it won't reflex on the desk top icon after you save it. So you have to fiddle with it. Sometimes if you copy the file and paste a new one it does in 2013. On Office 2007 this also happened and I had to switch the
 first slide with the second slide save and switch it back and save. Buggy buggy buggy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Can save to 300 dpi in Office 2007 but can't do that with Office 2013 but if you change the dpi to 299 it works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you work with these PP programs enough you will learn how buggy they are and the support for them is useless thus this forum. Basically fix it yourself because we don't care.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously they spend more time renaming things and making the interface different but they have yet to get the nuts and bolts right first. I think most businesses would prefer better coding to the nuts and bolts for productivity and this sector really caters
 to business than personal computer users. The 5th largest school district in my state was going to buy a bunch of Surface Pros for 1:1 but backed out and went with Ipads and Chrome Books and Dell due to all the problems with the Surface Pros. That had to cost
 a lot of money for them not to fix things. People will migrate to better if you don't take it seriously and fix the basics. Sure MS dominates now but when Ipads came out the axis tilted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a pattern with the way MS approaches new generations and it is subpar and based on past experiences the next version will have the same problems too. They have the same problems because they don't listen and they don't fix them. So I guess we all
 should just be quite about it and let them be? Or is this a bonanza for those who sell program fixes?</p>

<p>I think you have two ways:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ask person who add these stencils to workspace, close all or unrelated stencils and save document.</p>
<p>2. Remove to temp folder all these stencils, open document, save workspace, save document. And after this steps restore stencils.</p>

<p>One trick:</p>
<p>Open the 4:3 presentation</p>
<p>Save it as a new file.</p>
<p>Change the slide setup of the new file to 16:9.&nbsp; Everything will get distorted as you've noted.&nbsp; Dont' worry about it.</p>
<p>Now open the two presentations side by side.</p>
<p>Go page by page through each and do this:</p>
<p>Click a slide in the 16:9 pressie, press Ctrl+A then Del to remove all the content from the slide</p>
<p>Go to the same page on the 4:3 pressie, Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C to copy everything.</p>
<p>Now back to the 16:9 and Ctrl+V to paste.</p>

<h3> madelaide  say:</h3>
<h2>            E72 photo editor not working anymore &#40;blank &#38;quot&#59;apply effect&#38;quot&#59; icons&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I tried to edit a couple of photos shot in my E72, but the editor is no longer working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As usual, I select the photo in the Image Gallery, then select Options &gt; Edit. The editor opens, and I select Options &gt; Apply Effect. The grid with the effect icons (brightness, contrast, crop, etc) appears just as an empty frame, no icons. I try to use
 the navigator to "move" blindly, as I know where the icons should be, but that doesn't work either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One editor choice that I don't use - Show full screen - returns a blank screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already turned the phone off and on, removed thebattery for a few inutes as well, nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, does anyone know a solution?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<h2>            User unable to view some Outlook Contacts but delegate can view &#38; ammend</h2>
                    This problem has me truly stumped. As stated in title the mailbox owner on Outlook 2010 (Exchange 2010) is unable to view some of his contacts. The user's personal assistant who is also a delegate can view his missing contacts. This problem has also affected
 his groups which have missing contacts.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Here's everything I have tried so far:</b></div>
<div>Removing his address book - Able to remove but unable to add, have to create new profile</div>
<div>Ensuring check mark "Show this folder as an e-mail Address Book" - greyed out but checked</div>
<div>Creating new outlook profile - no change</div>
<div>Running repair on exchange account via PS - Repair reports successfull, no change</div>
<div>Moving account to a new database - no change</div>
<div>Resetting permissions via PS - no change</div>
<div>Login on a new PC - no change</div>
<div>Scanpst/ost - found some errors, repaired but no change</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I could simply write this off as being corrupted and those entries need to be recreated but everything appears fine while viewing through delegate. Delegate can forward contact and when attempting to add, we are asked if we want to update current contact.
 The contacts are there and I need to re-sync somehow but not an offline file.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you</div>

<h2>            Need Excel formula to return unique ROW NUMBER where multiple criteria are met</h2>
                    <p>I can use SUMPRODUCT to get the Qty value where Product = Apple and Size = M, in this case it returns 15. What I'd like is a formula that returns the ROW NUMBER (or cell address) for the matching data. Any suggestions appreciated...

<h3> melissazy  say:</h3>
<h2>            powerpoint audio distortion</h2>
                    I don't know much about powerpoint and my son is online with school this year and his teacher sent him a powerpoint presentation to watch and it has audio. The audio is slow and distorted. How can I fix this? He has a Toshiba laptop. I am not sure how
 to fix the audio so that we can understand what they are saying. The audio voice is very deep and slow, distorted. Thanks for any help that you can give me. Also, I have tried to bring this up on my desk top as well. The audio sounds the very same as it does
 on his.

            Girish's suggestions are very good. &nbsp;In addition, if it's a PPTX file rather than a PPT, you might want to try extracting the audio to play it in some other program.
<div><br />
<div>Make a copy of the PPTX</div>
<div>Rename the copy to give it a .ZIP extension</div>
<div>Doubleclick the renamed file; it should open as though it were a file folder, containing other files/folders.</div>
<div>Navigate to the Media folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div>There you'll find any images/sound/movies that have been added to the presentation.</div>
<div>Drag the sound file out of the Media folder and onto your desktop.</div>
<div>Doubleclick it.</div>
<div>If it still sounds bad, it seems likely that whoever authored or recorded the presentation simply did a bad job of it.</div>
