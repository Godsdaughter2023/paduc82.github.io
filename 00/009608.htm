<h2>            how to get the skin temperature from microsoft band 2</h2>
                    <p>hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm surprised that Microsoft band 2 doesn't read the skin temperature on the screen, even though the skin temperature&nbsp;was one of the band features before&nbsp;I&nbsp;bought it.&nbsp; so I have searched and found an application called " Band sensor monitor ' to let me get
 the skin temperature, but this application doesn't work on windows, iPhone or galaxy. so could any one help me to find any way to get the skin temperature data from Microsoft band 2??</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're here to help. There isn't a built-in tile that provides your skin temperature. There are third party tiles or apps available that can show you this information. The closest tile you can use is the UV Tile which you can use to get a snapshot of the
 current UV level and set an exposure reminder to help protect yourself. You can check this

link</a> for more information. </p>

            <p>Thank you for answering.</p>
<p>I downloaded sensor monitor application that can read the skin temperature from the microsoft band , but I couldn't get the data as a file. So do you know if there is any way to upload the skin temperature data to the dashboard with other data??</p>

            Hello. No phone is banned from Windows Live (email, forum logins, etc). You may have log in problems, though. If you are talking about the MyPhone service (that is the forum to which you have posted), it has been discontinued by Microsoft. Noone can use
 this service anymore. You should have got an email from them explaining this.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It depends what you mean by 'search' 2 sheets. If your using the FIND/REPLACE wizard then if you 'group' the 2 sheets it will look in both.</p>
<p>To group sheets, select one of them and hold down the CTRL key and click on the sheet tab of the other sheet. To ungroup click on any other sheet tab</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to Wi-Fi connection using WPA2 PSK authentication and encryption type TKIP</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: TKIP selection in WiFi network settings</p>
<p>I have a workplace WiFi connection using WPA2 PSK authentication and encryption type TKIP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the machine I used to test Windows 10, I had a previous installation of Windows 7 which connected to my workplace WiFi using the above settings. After installing Windows 10, my workplace wifi settings were imported and worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 had a system crash, and since I had deleted my previous windows installation, required a complete reinstall of the previous windows 7 installation. However, when I went to install Windows 10 again, I had not taken the time to set up my workplace
 Wifi on Windows 7 before installing Windows 10. As a result, I had to set up my workplace wifi as a new connection in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When going to set up the wifi connection, the encryption type was grayed out, but appeared to default to AES. Searching the internet suggested that Windows 8.1 and newer do not need a encryption type selected, because Windows could automatically determine
 if it was TKIP or AES, hence why the option to select encryption type was grayed out. However, after completing the setup of my workplace wifi, Windows 10 could not connect to my workplace wifi. After restoring Windows 7 with a factory reset, and setting up
 the workplace wifi (during which I selected TKIP encryption), my workplace wifi was working again.</p>

<h2>            Where are .pst files in Windows 7 Professional</h2>
                    I am moving from an old Windows 7 pc to a new one also running Windows 7. I have been using Office 365 and wish to move Outlook's pst files to the new Windows on which I have installed Office 365, but have not used it as yet.

<p>On re-reading my &nbsp;posting I can see how it could be misunderstood as, apparently, you have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I &nbsp; &nbsp; know exactly what pst files I need to move to my new Windows 7 pc, and where they are presently located on the old system. My problem is
<strong>where to put the pst files in the new Windows 7</strong>. This is because&nbsp;<span>users/&lt;name&gt;/appdata/local/microsoft &nbsp;does not lead me to /outlook/outlook.pst, as it did on the old Windows 7 pc (and as it has on all
 previous installations). &nbsp;In fact a full search does not reveal the new pst file that must have been created when Office 365 was installed on the new Windows pc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am not sufficiently savvy to know whether there are alternative locations for the pst files. Thank you for your patience.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If you're using Win7 on both old and new machines, the locations of any files would also be the same on both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: #1 - what I suspect is that on the new machine, you have configured your email account using IMAP via &lt;Auto-Discover&gt; (entering email address/password) which uses an .ost file as opposed to manually configuring the account to use POP3 which uses a PST
 file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: #2 - as for where PST files can be located, correct answer is "anywhere on your hard drive" with the exception of the &lt;Root&gt; of "C:" drive - the default location used by Outlook being &nbsp; windrive\users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook&gt;"&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you configure you're POP3 account, be sure to &lt;browse&gt; to wherever the PST files are located whether default location or anywhere else on your local hard drive.</p>

            I found the problem! I assumed that, once Office is installed, the sub folder /outlook would be automatically generated. However, it turns out that it is only generated once Outlook is actually activated. That's all. Sorry for having taken the time of
 all the good people who offered advice.

<h2>            BSD on reboot</h2>
                    <p>Long time Win 10 Preview Program user (since around the second week it was in operation).&nbsp; Always using two machines, one with newest build and one a couple of (stable) builds old "just in case."&nbsp; My secondary machine today gave me a BSD with a message that
 one of the boot files had expired and to use recovery.&nbsp; I did that, but same message.&nbsp; I did it again, but this time changed&nbsp;BIOS to before the July 29 free upgrade date and this time it worked, but since I probably never cycled through the formal retail version
 Win 10 on that machine prior to July 29, I'm sure it will BSD again when I correct the BIOS.&nbsp; MS customer service just refers me to this board as the only way to get help (seems strange!!!)</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender - Handled By Another AV &#38; Constant Error Message &#40;0x8050800c&#41; &#42;Post Anniversary Update&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>So I had Spybot installed, which I had removed. I ran CCleaner couple of times to remove any excess files and restarted bunch of times but every time I start Windows Defender, 'Real Time Protection' is always saying it's being handled by another AV and Virus
 &amp; SW definitions usually says up to date about half the time, the other half it says 'turn on to download'.</p>
<p>But then there now another issue where occassionally, about 1 in 5 times, both will go green for about 5 seconds before I get this error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/7aT5Nzn.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/7aT5Nzn.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code is 0x8050800c</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the image, where it says 'Turn on' – Clicking it simply takes me to settings to uninstall the other AV, which doesn't exist.</p>
<br />
<p>At this point I don't have any other AV installed and am going absolutely nuts trying to get Defender to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has only been an issue since I installed the Anniversary update for Windows 10 last night.. was working perfectly prior.</p>
<p>Anyone encountered this issue or know of a fix. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent some time googling but nothing I find helps.</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for writing back and really appreciate for providing the detail information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, the problem doesn’t lie with link in the email, as you can normally access the documents in Word Online and not in the Word application. There should be the problem with Word application. So, we suggest you try the
<strong>Online repairing</strong> the Office applications for affected users and check the outcome:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To repair an Office application, you can refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair an Office application</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still problem persists after repairing Office applications, can you please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Screenshot of the Office Account page. (Open any Office application&gt; Account)</p>
<p>2. Does the problem occurs to all the users (with the link in email)?</p>
<p>3. Can the problematic users open the other Word documents without any problem? (we means documents that are not present in SharePoint Online)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Chitrahaas</p>

            <p>Here's another work-around: Get OpenOffice which is great, free, available for Mac, etc. Import your file. Save as Excel format. Bob's your uncle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More details: The TextWrangler option also worked for me. What did NOT work was using the command line "iconv" tool. It converted the file just fine, but did not create the BOM (byte order mark), which, apparently, excel on the mac must have. There is apparently
 no way to get iconv to create the BOM.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of knowledge, if the code is to attach with button(writing) then why do we have to write "openworddoc()". This I think we write when we have to declare a general syntax.

Hi,</p>

<p>I don't understand that question, attached to a button on the worksheet the code would simply be:-</p>

<p>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
&nbsp;Dim wrdApp As Word.Application<br />

    <title>how can I send a printjob to a specific printer under automation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how can I send a printjob to a specific printer under automation without changing the Windows Default in Word 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for a way to send print jobs to specific printers <strong>on-the-fly under Word automation
</strong>using Office 2010.&nbsp; I have always done the task this way up to and including Word 2007.&nbsp; This same code runs on more than 150 workstations at multiple companies, all running older&nbsp;versions of&nbsp;Microsoft Office:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WITH .Dialogs(wdDialogFilePrintSetup)<br />
&nbsp; .Printer=oApp.AppDefaultPrinter<br />
&nbsp; .DoNotSetAsSysDefault = .t.<br />
&nbsp; .Execute<br />
ENDWITH</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this code runs with Word 2010, though, the Execute command throws an error each and every time.&nbsp; I've spent&nbsp;4 days&nbsp;researching the problem and it would&nbsp;appear that&nbsp;this functionality has been removed from Word 2010--intentionally or accidentally.&nbsp; The
 problem has been replicated in 4 locations across the country, twice by Word MVPs (who I must thank profusely for confirming that I"m not crazy!) and twice by application developers.&nbsp; Since the problem isn't in my code, I can't make it go away.&nbsp; I could sure
 use some help finding another way to do the task though since I've run out&nbsp;of ideas.&nbsp; I'll explain how we got to this point, and what we've already tried.</p>
<p>After reading how 'transparent' the upgrade to 2010 was supposed to be (at least on 32-bit systems) one of my clients decided to purchase the upgrade licenses.&nbsp; Of course I advised them to test&nbsp;2010 with their custom sofware but, due to some&nbsp;rather complicated
 architecture&nbsp;meaningful testing&nbsp;was not done.&nbsp;&nbsp; The upgrade was an&nbsp;instant show stopper!&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday morning no&nbsp;one could print any Word document from the company's custom software application.&nbsp;&nbsp;It took&nbsp;a day and a half&nbsp;for&nbsp;IT to roll the server back to a&nbsp;previoius
 version of Office so people could get back to work.&nbsp; However, they still want to upgrade so I need a work around.</p>
<p>I know the printer can be changed using&nbsp;.ActivePrinter but this has been very problematic for them in the past because it&nbsp;changes the Windows Default printer.&nbsp; This is a&nbsp;fast-paced, dynamic work environment and changing the Windows Default printer through
 Word is&nbsp;painfully slow.&nbsp; When we used this method previously, the workload was much lighter.&nbsp; Now, becuse 85% of the documents are automated, a user might&nbsp;print upwards of 100 documents each&nbsp;day.&nbsp; At that rate, a user could&nbsp;expect to spend up to 2 hours of
 each shift&nbsp;just waiting for Word to change the printer.&nbsp; And&nbsp;while waiting, users&nbsp;got impatient, so they&nbsp;switched to another app, say Outlook,&nbsp;to do other tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they accidentally sent something to the printer while Word was busy changing the Windows Default,
 the job&nbsp;could be sent&nbsp;to an inappropriate device.&nbsp; This could&nbsp;(and often did) hang the workstation.&nbsp; Sometimes it even&nbsp;hung the print server.&nbsp; Boy was that popular with IT!
</p>
<p>Dialogs are not the answer for this company either.&nbsp; The application manages sensitive data and must strictly control how and where&nbsp;each document is printed.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, of course,&nbsp;dialogs&nbsp;interrupt the flow of the automation process and really slow things down!</p>
<p>So I'm looking for a&nbsp;another way to change the printer <strong>on-the-fly under automation</strong> while leaving the Windows Default printer setting intact.&nbsp; Any and all suggestions will be most welcome.&nbsp; It's been a heck of a week around here!</p>

            <p>Very interesting!&nbsp; Of course my client isn't running Windows 7--none of my clients are.&nbsp; All are frugal and very conservative.&nbsp; Are&nbsp;you running in a 32-bit or 64-bit enviroment?&nbsp; I&nbsp;need to duplicate your results running my client's application before I can
 get too excited.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>This client runs server 2003 and Terminal Server with Windows XP SP2 on his workstations.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;strictly a 32-bit environment.&nbsp; It would be a major expense for him to convert&nbsp;to Win 7 and/or&nbsp;to move to a 64-bit OS.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could sell that though if&nbsp;I can prove&nbsp;it

Strictly 32 bit here.&nbsp; The code that you and I are both using has been around since Windows XP if not even before that (Probably Windows 95, but my memory is a bit hazy on that)</p>
<p>Feel free to pass on my details to the Word MVPs whom you say confirmed the behavior. We all know one another (on-line if not in person) and together we may be able to overcome the issue.</p>
<p>That code by the way is on the Word MVP site in the article:</p>

            <p>I know :-)&nbsp; I've been using the code about that long.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's in dozens of my apps so I'm rather upset to have it fail so spectacularly and so consistently in so many locations the minute Word 2010 is installed.&nbsp;

<p>Perhaps Windows 7 works differently than XP in this regard.&nbsp; I wish I had a Win7 workstation here to test this theory.&nbsp; My only client with Windows&nbsp;7 uses Office 2007.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The client has asked whether it might be possible to keep Word 2003 to use with the app that runs the automation process and still have Office 2010 for use interactively.&nbsp; I am not an expert on that and have no idea how the licensing and cost might work
 out.&nbsp; I'm finding it terribly annnoying to have both Word 2007 and 2010 installed on this system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I switch from one to the other, there is a&nbsp;"Configuring..."&nbsp; screen that runs for a couple of minutes before Word actually appears.&nbsp; It is especially
 tedious&nbsp;if you clicked on the wrong version accidentally!</p>

            The following tip takes a slightly different approach. It saves the current printer name, defines a new printer then resets back to original printer<br />

********************<br />
<br />
<br />
The code you are working with is "VBA", it is part of Office, not Windows, but it can interact with Windows.&nbsp; Various generations of WordBasic / VB / VBA have been part of Office since well before Office '97.
<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
32 / 64 bit Office are functionally the same for the user. The 64 bit part is just how the underlying code has been "compiled" to allow it to run on 64 bit Windows. The main difference is that 64 bit can handle more memory and larger file sizes.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
*********************<br />
<br />
You will have to buy the appropriate number of copies of Office 2010, there no longer is a discounted "upgrade" version.
<br />
<br />
Note: if your clients need more than 5 licenses, look into volume licensing. It can be significantly cheaper than retail.<br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span>In most firms with more than a couple of computers the best solution is actually Microsoft’s Volume License program.&nbsp; Their Per Device licensing has the same advantages of the Retail license – the license CAN be reassigned
 to a different device later if you choose to replace your computer and you can install a copy on a portable device that is used by the same primary user as the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>The pricing tends to be favorable on Volume Licensing compared to the retail boxes you get at Best Buy, though perhaps not as favorable as you might expect.</span></p>
<p><span>The other big advantage is in management of the licenses.&nbsp; With Retail Licenses every box comes with a product key – a series of numbers and letters that looks like this:</span></p>
<p><span>A1B2C-D3E4F-G5H6I-7J8K9-0L1M2 <span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span>(obviously that one’s fake)</span></em></span></p>
<p><span>The thing is you have to keep track of which product key goes to which machine.&nbsp; And when you install the software on multiple machines you have to enter the product key for each machine manually.&nbsp; OEM versions these tends
 tend to print the product key on a sticker, attached to the system.&nbsp; Makes sense, the license goes with the system so the key might as well too.</span></p>
<p><span>With volume licensing, however, you get ONE product key, which you’re allowed to install on as many devices as you bought licenses for (plus additional portables if applicable; see above).</span></p>
<p><span>“But I don’t have hundreds of machines!” you may say.&nbsp; You don’t have to.&nbsp; Volume licensing agreements start at just 5 (yes FIVE) licenses.&nbsp; And they don’t have to be 5 licenses of the same thing.&nbsp; If you only have 3 machines
 you can buy 3 licenses of Microsoft Office Professional 2010 and 2 licenses of something else…maybe Microsoft Streets and Trips or “Microsoft Math 3.0”.&nbsp; Something cheap.&nbsp; Ask your software dealer they can probably find you something.</span></p>
<p><span>Adding additional licenses later is easy – once you have the initial five licenses you have a Volume License Agreement and you can purchase additional licenses as needed.&nbsp; You add another member of staff?&nbsp; Buy one more
 license of Office 2010 for them.&nbsp; No problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Most firms with 3 or more computers should be using Volume Licensing in my opinion, if for no other reason than the simplicity of management.&nbsp; No need to track a bunch of product keys – just use one and your licenses are
 NOT handcuffed to the physical computer.</span></p>

Yes you can have more than one version of Office. I have 2003, 2007, and 2010 on this machine.&nbsp; MS assumes that you have only one version (why would anyone want more than one version, inconceivable! &lt;grin&gt; ). So there are a few minor issues you have to deal
 with. That configuring one is a biggie, but it has a simple registry hack fix (in following tip). The other issues is Windows File Associations. Windows is stupid, so it only allows you to point Windows at a file type to start one app when you double click
 on file in explorer. <br />

<p><span>This tip describes the specific steps and choices during the 2010 custom install. After you have the multiple versions installed you still have some additional steps to do. They are described in this tip:</span></p>

<p><b><u>Multiple versions of Outlook</u></b></p>
<p>Microsoft Office Outlook 2010 cannot coexist with any earlier version of Microsoft Outlook. When you install Outlook 2010, the Setup program removes Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, Microsoft Office Outlook 2003, and Microsoft Outlook 2002.
<span>The Setup program removes these versions of Outlook even if you click to select the Keep these programs check box in the Removing Previous Versions dialog box</span>.</p>
<p>The only way I know of to have 2 vesion of Outlook installed at the same time is to use a virtual machine for one or both. They will not be able to share email sources</p>

<b>This is a comment by another user that I haven't been able to get to work for myself:</b><b>
</b></p>
<p>Getting Defaults to work properly can be very difficult and require a lot of trial and error, but I have finally managed to get the result that .doc attachments always open in Word 2003. If Word 2010 is open, .docx attachments will open
 in that version (which I would prefer); otherwise they open in Word 2003, using the Compatibility Pack, which sometimes suffices for just viewing, though I'd prefer to edit them in Word 2010.</p>
<p>Achieving this result does require a Registry edit, however. For the details, see

            <p>Thanks for your response, but I'm not sure you&nbsp;understood the earlier messages in this thread.&nbsp; I am well aware that&nbsp;I am using VBA.&nbsp; It is the language used to automate&nbsp;Word from Visual FoxPro.&nbsp; Unfotunately, the documentation for VBA 7 is&nbsp;pretty well hidden
 in Office 2010.&nbsp; Even when you find it, the&nbsp;useful information&nbsp;is minimal, particularly as compared to previous versions of VBA.&nbsp;

<p>uses .ActivePrinter which does not work in this client's environment for the reasons explained above.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Obviously the client already has&nbsp;licenses for Office (as explained above) or we would not have this problem.&nbsp;I do not know how long they have had them or under which program they were purchased (it is not a volume license.)&nbsp; The question was whether they
 can legally&nbsp;continue to use Word 2003.&nbsp; I'll leave that to their IT department to figure out.&nbsp; My job is to find a way for them to print!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;why would anyone want more than one version, inconceivable!&nbsp; &lt;&lt; Umm, possibly because the&nbsp;newer version does not have&nbsp;functionality that is essential to the entity's&nbsp;business???&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will definitely check out the configuration tips though.&nbsp; We (my staff and all of our clients)&nbsp;have standardized on the .doc file extension (compatibility mode in 2007 and 2010) to insure that document distributions can be read by everyone,&nbsp;regardless
 of Office version they&nbsp;have available for&nbsp;viewing and editing. The delay when moving from one version to another is very annoying.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;wish the Outlook issues were new to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;errors in Outlook 2007 every day since&nbsp;I uninstalled Office&nbsp;2010.&nbsp; But at least the data files were not deleted as I feared they might be!</p>
<p>Off to check out those tips!&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<br />
Whether you can continue using 2003 when installing 2010 depends ENTIRELY on the type of licensing you are working under.<br />
<br />
If they have strictly retail licenses, then there is no problem. Starting with 2010 there is no price discounted "upgrade" license that REQUIRES you to remove the older version, so you can continue to use both versions.<br />
<br />
If they have a "site" license, a type of volume license, they may not have the right to use more than one version of Office at a time. Each Office installation would require a separate license "count" on the total number of licenses being used
<br />
<br />
You'll love the registry hack. It is simple to do and it really makes using 2 versions a LOT more 'user friendly'.<br />
<br />
You obviously missed the sarcasm, aka &lt;grin&gt;, on my rhetorical question "why would anyone want more than ...".&nbsp; No problem, it's easy to miss nuances.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Doc vs DOCX format is a choice that can go either way depending on your specific circumstances.&nbsp; Are you aware of the "Office compatibilty pack" that can be installed to give Office 2003 edit access to the new 2007/2010&nbsp; "X" file formats.&nbsp; In theory the new
 formats are supposed to be less susceptible to the file corruption problems we had in the old "binary" formats.&nbsp; And since they are compressed, they often use somewhat less space than the same DOC file.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the update.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think the licenses are retail so it may work&nbsp;to keep both versions around until we find a fix for this problem.</p>
<p>I didn't miss the sarcasm, I just responded in kind!&nbsp; My British humor is often missed by others&nbsp;I'm told.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; In any case, I'm glad there is a way to have one's cake and eat it too (as in 2 versions of Word installed.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I wasn't&nbsp;aware of the compatibility pack.&nbsp; It could become useful at some point so I will look into it.&nbsp; This is an atypical application I suspect.&nbsp; Although it produces hundreds of Word documents each day, very few of them are are ever&nbsp;saved.&nbsp; They are
 immediately merged into a 'batch' for printing,&nbsp;sent directly to a physical printer, or printed to pdf for attaching to an email. The template is typically closed without saving the merged data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks for the additonal information .&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;off to learn about the registry hack.&nbsp; That configuration screen is tedious to say the least and getting rid of it would be a big bonus.</p>
<p>I appreciate your help.</p>

            I'm really not sure what you're referring to, but my best guess is that this occurs in Print Layout View when the mouse pointer is near the top or bottom edge of the hypothetical 'page'. The pointer appears as a small document page with a rectangular box
 at its top or at the bottom, respectively.<br />
<br />
The appearance of the pointer is to give visual feedback that the pointer is hovering over the Header or Footer area rather than the body of the document. That is a design aspect which has existed in every version of Word I've ever used. AFAIK, there is no
 way to prevent it from occurring. The only suggestions I can offer are that you either:<br />
<ul>
<li>Move the pointer away from the Header/Footer area [i.e., up/down a little or toward the left/right margin], or</li><li>Use Draft View rather than Print Layout View - Headers/Footers do not display in Draft View so the pointer appearance doesn't make that change.<br />
</li></ul>

            <p>Hello HassaanKhan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having when charging your phone.&nbsp; When a phone turns off on it's own this is most often a hardware related issue.&nbsp; There are a couple of things we can suggest before you settle on this phone
 needing a repair or replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to soft reset the phone.&nbsp; The best way to do this is to pull the battery for about 2 minutes and then replace the battery and restart the phone.&nbsp; Once the phone has been restarted, try charging the battery again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you continue to have the issue, you may want to try another battery.&nbsp; There are two ways you can test the battery.&nbsp; If you know someone else with a Windows phone 7, have them try your battery in their phone.&nbsp; You can also try another's battery in your
 phone or simply purchase a replacement battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final thing you can try before contacting the phone manufacturer is preform a
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hard reset.</a>&nbsp; Before you hard reset this phone, back up all of your media content.&nbsp; The process of backing this up is outlined here,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media</a>.&nbsp; Contacts and calendars are backed up to the cloud.&nbsp; You can verify this by going to
<a href="http://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://contacts.live.com</a> and <a href="http://calendars.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://calendars.live.com</a>.&nbsp; All the entries from your phone should be listed here.&nbsp; Text message history and game progress will be reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

            Have you just left it for a while on charge? It is normal for a Windows Phone to turn on when plugged into a charger. That is, if you turn a reasonably charged phone totally off, and plug it in, or even lay it on a wireless charger, it will turn on. That
 is normal. If the battery is very depleted, it could cause the system to shut down, so you may for a time be in a limbo state where the system is both trying to turn on to manage charging, and turn off because of insufficient battery.&nbsp; have seen this myself
 on occaision and usually if I just let it be, on charge, it will sort itself out.

<p>Hi JamieVaters,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm glad to help you.</p>
<p>There are many potential reasons may cause Word crash. Could you give me more information about your condition so that we can have a right direction:
</p>
<p>1.What OS you are using, MAC or Windows?
</p>
<p>2.Have you updated to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office365-proplus-by-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest version</a>?</p>
<p>3.If all Word document have same issue or it only happen in a specific document?</p>
<p>4.What about other Office application like Excel/PowerPoint? Does the same issue happen?</p>
<p>5.Create a new document, does the issue happen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can repro this issue, it's better to post a screenshot of error message which is very helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eric</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using the new OVI Maps now. When I Start the navigation , after about 30sec it is showing the license expired and the navigation stops.&nbsp;I was using the Nokia Maps earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can&nbsp;I get rid of this&nbsp;old license info from my phone.</p>
<p>I am using Nokia N95 8gb.</p>

<p>Hi Ztech,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You CANT get rid of the old license, Nokia is too greedy to let your old phone have the free navigation functions, i just called support and got the message...</p>
<p>If you had a phone thats in the list for "free navigaion" you'd be able to DL Maps 3.03, and get the free navi "forever"...&nbsp;&nbsp;With your phone you have to pay...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, i got "a little upset" when i heard about their policy regarding this subject...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows 10 technical preview downgrade</h2>
                    I installed win 10tp on a separate partition thinking I could flip back and forth between this and win 8.1.&nbsp; Didn't work that way and now and going nuts trying to downgrade back to win 8.1.&nbsp; I have recovery disks for win 8 that I made and tried using these
 as a option to boot.&nbsp; Didn't work, put the disc in, selected DVD drive for the recovery, and nothing happens.&nbsp; Help.

            <p>I realize it's a bit late, but the way to install 10 and keep your 8 or 7 partitions is to burn the iso, restart the computer, go to bios, set it to boot with a DVD before HDD...Save and boot, hitting any key when prompted, choose clean install, choose partition
 to run setup.</p>
<p>I have one XP, 3 7's, 3 8's, and now 3 10's all on one rig...(Each partition has 1 main function)...</p>
<p>You may be able to recover using your 8 disk. It does save the old setup when installing on a&nbsp;currently running partition...</p>

            That sounds like the mother of all multiboots. Now I can appreciate why it is essential to have a system that has a huge disk space. And I am sure from that perspective, windows based systems will continue to grow.<br />

            <p>Boot to the recovery dvd instead of selecting it in Windows. Reboot and tap F12 until you see the boot menu to select the drive. Don't wait for any screen. Keep tapping F12 as soon as you reboot. If you've already tried this, the recovery disk is not bootable
 and cannot be used. [After making a recovery disk, it must be checked to see if it works as a boot disk.] Check with your computer maker for more help on reinstalling windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Older computers might have a diff method of booting to the dvd drive.&nbsp;<br />
