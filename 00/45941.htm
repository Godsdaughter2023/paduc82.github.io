            Hi Weeklong,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!<br />
<br />
Did you recently make any changes to the computer like installing a new hardware or software updates?<br />
<br />
If you’re getting a choppy video, then follow the steps below in the link. Trying to run too many programs at the same time can cause display problems such as jittery or choppy video.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ways to improve display quality<br />
</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Ways-to-improve-display-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Ways-to-improve-display-quality
<br />
</a><br />
I would also suggest you to perform a clean boot.<br />
<br />
<strong>Perform a clean boot</strong> <br />
<br />
Clean boot uses minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps in eliminating software conflicts.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start &gt;&gt; in the Start Search, type in msconfig and hit Enter.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Services Tab, check on Hide all Microsoft Services.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Startup tab, click on disable all and then click Ok.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you get a prompt to restart the computer, click on Restart now.<br />
<br />
When the computer is in a clean boot, the third party services and applications are disabled. Once the computer is restarted, check if the issue occurs at this time.
<br />
<br />
Check out this link which talks about how to perform a clean boot<br />
Note: Follow all the steps given in the link to figure out which software is conflicting. If this resolves the issue, do not forget to put the computer back to the normal startup.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135
</a><br />
<br />
You can also follow the steps below to reduce the CPU usage.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press "Ctrl+Alt+Del" and select "Start Task Manager. " Click on the "Processes" tab where you can get an idea of processes currently running and how much
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; memory they consume. End ones you don't really need like the Sidebar to decrease CPU usage.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Control Panel and select the "Power Options." If the Preferred Plan is not "Power Saver" chose this setting. Fine tune these settings by selecting "Change
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan Settings" and then "Change Advanced Power Settings."<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click "Start" and then "Run" and type "msconfig" in the command box. Click the "Startup" tab and remove the check mark from every program you do not need to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start automatically.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the "Services" tab and put a check mark in the "Hide all Microsoft services" box. Remove the check marks from the remaining services that you do not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to run all the time.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn off the Vista Aero display by right-clicking on the Desktop. Select "Personalize" and then the "Window Color and Appearance" link. Choose "Windows Classic"
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or "Windows Standard" from the Appearance Settings screen.<br />
<br />
If none of the above steps are of any help, then follow the steps below.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start; in the Start search type services.msc and hit Enter.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the following Services in "Automatic" mode. <br />
<br />
Application Information, Base Filtering Engine, CNG Key Isolation, COM+Event System, COM+ System Application, DCOM Server Process Launcher, DHCP Client, Diagnostic Policy Service, Diagnostic System Host, DNS Client, Extensible Authentication Protocol, Group
 Policy Client, IP Helper, IPsec Policy Agent, Multimedia Class Scheduler, Network Access Protection Agent, Network Connections, Network List Service, Network Location Awareness, Network Store Interface, Plug and Play, Remote Access Auto Connection, Remote
 Access Connection Manager, Remote Procedure Call, Remote Procedure Call Locator, Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol, Software Licensing, System Event Notification Service, Task Scheduler, Telephony, Themes, User Profile Services, Windows Audio, Windows Audio
 Endpoint Builder, Windows Error Reporting Service, Windows Event Log, Windows Management Instrumentation, Windows Search, Wired AutoConfig, WLAN AutoConfig, Workstation.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All other services should be set to disabled.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reboot the computer and check if your programs are responding normally and your CPU usage is normal.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />
Post your results back to let me know if the steps are of helpful to you.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 has broken my PC. &#40;Non-core Edition&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alden fischer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 has broken my PC. &#40;Non-core Edition&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So I've been using Windows 10 for a few months now, and aside from making my computer super laggy I haven't had too many issues until last week. Suddenly my computer has told me that my version that I have been using of windows isn't activated and that I
 need to activate it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, fair enough. I don't remember activating it when I first downloaded it, so I'll bite. But oh wait, I can't activate it because somewhere along the line, windows has a) deleted my administrator privileges, (more on that in a second) and b) turned into
 a brick. I think an arthritic snail could move faster than this thing. Anyway it keeps showing up an error message saying in red letters "Windows can't activate. Try again later." So I've tried again later, and later and later and later oh and for good measure
 I also tried again later. It still won't update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So finally at wits' end I decided to try giving tech support a call. So after going through the wonderful joys of trying to get through all the automated systems that we've decided to replace customer support with I reach Hasran (sp?). After talking to Hasran
 for several minutes he says he'll need to remote access my computer to figure out the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several minutes he tells me that I have a non-core edition of Windows 10 and I'll need to reinstall it which means I'll have to format my hard drive. Unfortunate, but I'll deal with it. So after some technical wizardry in command prompt, he begins
 a download of a new ISO file for windows 10. After waiting for a couple hours the file installs, and Hasran has magically disappeared. So I try to open the file but instead it's been corrupted. Irritated at both the broken download and the fact that the tech
 support guy who said he was going to fix it has vanished and just disconnected himself without so much as a warning. I try to redownload the file myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time after a few more hours 0f finally getting the download to work I set about reinstalling windows 10. Everything seems to working out just great and hopefully my beloved gaming rig will work like it did during the days of Windows 7......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope. Silly me. Some file error pops up and its now 2 am with no tech support guy to ask about what to do, and I forgot to put down what message error it was. But either way I'm now stuck with an unactivated windows 10 version that won't allow anything to
 work and a PC that moves about as fast as.....Mt Everest? I'm too irritated to come up with anymore metaphors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't know what to do now aside from buying a copy of Windows 7 and installing that on my PC, and this time when I called tech support I was told I needed to pay for it, because "We broke your pc for free, so pay us to clean up our mistake!" seems to
 be the microsoft motto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm gonna try reinstalling Windows 10 again to see what the error code was, but any help that could be provided would be greatly appreciated, before I rip my hair out and go bald at the ripe old age of 26. Either that or throw my desktop out the window....</p>

    <title>First ban in 6 years of playing &#61; Permanent &#40;Please read first - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sightsofdic3  say:</h3>
<h2>            First ban in 6 years of playing &#61; Permanent &#40;Please read first tho&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Xbox Community I've just wanted to share some things that have happened in the last couple of days and maybe try to find a solution to this. So on October 17th my account was banned because my friend thought it would be funny to sign on to my account
 while I was away and change my gamer pic to a inappropriate and disgusting Image. Now I know that I am responsible for the things that happen on my account I read that in the terms So of course when I saw this image I immediately went to change it which I
 did but someone must of seen it before I changed it and reported it. Now I love Xbox which is why I want to continue using it because I've been with them playing on this account for 6 years. With that 6 years on this account I bought all my games through the
 Microsoft store because I don't really have a store close by that sells Games and as soon as my account got banned I tried to play these games to see if they would work on another profile however I cannot cause I need to sign into the account that bought them
 which is my account that got banned. Now I am not even really able to use my Xbox because I was also console banned until the 16th of November along with my permanently banned account. I just want to try and figure this out and try to come to some sort of
 solution to this problem because I really want to be able to keep playing Xbox because I love it. I made a case to the enforcement team but the case was upheld which saddened me even more. I also contacted support a couple of times after the incident to see
 what I could try and do. They told me that after the initial case I can make another one after 24 hours&nbsp;however it's been 24 hours and I still can't make another case or I just can't find the right way to. I really am typing all&nbsp;this to see if I can find some
 sort of help or solution to this problem because all those games I had are unplayable now because of a dumb mistake that led to a permanent ban and it was also my very first ban in all the 6 years I've been with Xbox. I had also pre-ordered&nbsp;Fallout 76 and
 was waiting for&nbsp;it to come out which it does next month and I had also just purchased Black ops 4.&nbsp;Of course I am not trying to bash Xbox because again I love Xbox and that's why I want to figure this out so I can continue to keep using a great product that's
 been apart of my life for a long time. I need answers to what I can possibly do now or how I can make another case.</p>
<p>Cheers, Todd</p>

<p>Hello Sights!</p>
<p>Unfortunately the process regarding enforcement actions has to go through the Enforcement website :
<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Policy Enforcement Team</a>. There you will see any options or information that may be available regarding your Suspension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out</p>

            Most likely there was some other issue that resulted in your ban, not just an inappropriate picture. The enforcement team would be the only ones with that information and the only ones who could uplift your ban. However, if you already submitted a case
 review and they upheld their decision, there is nothing else you can do. There is no way to get another case review.&nbsp;

            Thank you for replying George and I appreciate you giving that link. Its just that with that link Ive been given it before and I still can't find anyone or anything to help me and now Im lost because it looks pretty grim for me getting this account back.
 All the enforcement told me to do was read how I can stay safe on Xbox. The only real reason I'm upset about this is because I cant think of anything else I might have done to get me perm banned. My friend did change my gamer pic and that's all I can think
 of me doing any sort of wrong and I've had friends who have been banned because their gamer tags and Pictures were inappropriate and they didn't get perm banned. The reason I know its referring to the picture is because in my ban summary from enforcement was
 because I displayed inappropriate material and when they said that I immediately thought of the gamer pic that was displayed. But that's why I'm confused like I understand a ban for maybe a week 2 weeks or even a month but this is kind of

            To add to what Smwutches has said As long as that console was your profiles HOME console and it is connected to the internet and able to connect to live (so after your console suspension) all of your other profiles on that console will still be able to
 play the digitally owned games on the perma suspended account.

            Thank you Steelwand for replying to me. So if I was game sharing with someone on my account that got banned and they still can play, can they switch their profile back to their home Xbox and then will that automatically make my account switch back to my
 Xbox as its home Xbox? I'm sorry I just gotta know because I don't really see me getting my account back from all this. Thank you again for the info I appreciate it&nbsp;: )

<p>The only way that you WOULD have been able to get your console back as your home xbox is you would have to of been able to sign in with your account (which you can not do with a perma ban) and make your console your home xbox again</p>

<h3> roccondil18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana and tracking a package shipment</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was trying to find a way to get to the list of the various packages I have being shipped to me IN ONE PLACE. However, I can't find the option in either Bing or Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I CAN STILL SEARCH THE TRACKING NUMBER AND IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEARCH RESULTS WITH THE TRACKING INFO.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it's not convenient to search every tracking number every time, especially when the numbers come from different sources- emails, websites, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I search for the solution, all the comes up are old threads from two or more years ago that have either no answer (and a lot of people complaining), or references this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028013/windows-10-cortana-package-tracking</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is a year out-of-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I had to specifically search for whether Cortana's tracking skills had been nuked. Is that true? we can't use Cortana to track packages? What else is not available? seems like she's become a POS software freeloading on our Win10 installations...</p>

            Hi  Roccondil18 
<br />
<br />The ability to track packages was removed in Fall 2018 and moved to Outlook.com. If you have a Microsoft Account, you can sign into <a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.outlook.com</a> and enable it:
<br />
<br />In Outlook, click Settings &gt; Options &gt; Calendar &gt; Automatic processing then enable events from email/automatically add in is enabled along with the correct categories.

<p>This answer is not helpful for two reasons:</p>
<p>1. It restricts a useful feature to ONLY Outlook.com users</p>
<p>2. Many tracking numbers don't arrive via e-mail, so automatic processing is extremely limited use</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing when the feature was removed isn't actionable information.</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the error message you get when you plug in the security camera to the computer?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue specific to this hardware device?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you installed the software for the security camera?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you say “I cant see the camera on network at all”, is the computer connected to a Domain Network?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to several reasons like incompatible drivers, missing updates etc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Plug in the device into another computer and check if the device gets detected on that computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Plug in another usb device into this computer and check if that device gets detected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After installing the software related to the security camera, the computer will start to receive the signals from the camera. Some software will allow you to record and
 store video over the Internet. Motion detectors can also be installed so that video is recorded only when motion is detected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The model number “CM-I11123BK” of the security camera is related to a company called Zmodo. You may contact Zmodo support here:
<a href="http://www.zmodo.com/service_support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zmodo.com/service_support/</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further let us follow these methods and check the device status on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Plug in the device and run the hardware troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:<br />
a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + W</strong>’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and then press <strong>
enter</strong>.<br />
c) Click <strong>hardware and sound </strong>and run the <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
d) Follow the On screen instructions. Once this is done, restart the computer and check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>USB (universal serial bus) devices are among the easiest devices to connect to your PC. You can connect a wide variety of devices, such as keyboards, printers, and external
 drives. Windows is looking for the usb a device driver that is connected to the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to these articles and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Install USB 3.0 and other USB devices</span></strong><span>:

<p>
</p><p><span>When you connect a wired device to your PC, such as a printer, mouse, or keyboard, Windows automatically tries to install the correct driver for your device. A driver is
 software that every device needs to work with your PC.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for taking time to help. My understanding is that I should plug the camera into the router first and it would be availble from plug and play software to IP camera viewers then s0mehow set up wifi o&nbsp; it and detach the Ethernet cable.&nbsp; &nbsp;IPconfig doesn't
 show an ip address fir it nor can I find it in network or anywhere. I dint know if there should be a cd but P&amp;P would I thought &nbsp;mean cd not necessary&nbsp;or other softwar nt needed\\</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I off track completely? Should I still try plugging it direct to a pc?</p>

            you need to bridge the network&nbsp;connection&nbsp;if you do this as the camera needs to be in the same ip subnet as the computer that you are trying to&nbsp;access&nbsp;it from.

<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the delay in replying.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may have to contact the camera manufacturer website to download the latest software required for the device and install it on the computer to check if this helps. If the device manufacturer has provided the disc then it should contain the software.
 For some reason if the disc is bad then you need to get in touch with the manufacturer for a disc replacement.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us informed to help you further.</span></p>

            This has been going on for too long now. I've tried different browsers, tinkered with configuration files but all to no avail. This is the only site that throws this error. I need online access to OneDrive as a matter of urgency. Has anyone from Microsoft
 got a clue why this should suddenly be happening? If so, would they mind sharing it with us.

<p>Thankyou friend, I'd been encountering this issue for the last couple of weeks too. Couldn't access OneDrive at all, also had been getting it intermittently with amazon, some other sites just wouldn't load at all with the SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Encountered across IE, FireFox, Chrome and Brave on two different Windows 7x64 machines, patched with TLS 1.1 and 1.2 enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off BT Web protect instantly resolved the problem and now I can access these sites just fine. I have reported it to BT for escalation.</p>

            I'm getting the exact same problem using either Safari or Firefox on a mac, and I don't use BT Web Protect. I use Bitdefender. I've tried disabling various settings to no avail and I'm getting tired of seeing the same message, SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP,
 and having no online access to One Drive when I need it. The odd thing is it that out of the blue it can suddenly work, so I don't know if it's a cache thing as well. Totally frustrating.<br />

<p>(Mrs btw)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the heads up - I was sure I'd switched that off but apparently not. I have now done so - must check the other settings too next time I log in to BT. I'm currently logged in ok to OneDrive online, though it took several attempts. When I use it
 again tomorrow I'll be interested to see if the problem has gone away.</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
1. What is the exact error message?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to your computer after which the issue started?<br />
3. Have you followed the steps suggested by Naman R in your <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/windows-7-msvcr71dll-where-can-i-find-to-reinstall/1dd29b38-b262-47ce-9601-1bbcd9287eaf">
earlier thread</a>?<br />
<br />
You may also (along with Naman's suggestion) update the drivers for hardware devices that might be related to msvcr71.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file msvcr71.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the drivers for
 your video card.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I've done the three times shut down to go into automatic repair but it was not able to automatically repair and gave me two options of shutting down or going to advanced settings.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to roll back to the previous version of windows.</p>

            Hi Kevin,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If and when you can get into your PC, to permanently stop Automatic Updates in the future:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find Windows Update Service
<br />
<br />If it is Started, double click it and stop that service
<br />
<br />CLose the services App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />sc delete wuauserv
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If you also have the Update Assistant installed on your system:
<br />
<br />The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter 
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater 
<br />Right Pane double click 'Update Assistant' 
<br />Click on Triggers Tab 
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled' 
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun' 
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event 
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!
<br />
<br />When finished and after a system restart, open the services app and make sure the Windows Update Service is now gone . . .

<p>Unfortunately I had to resort to downloading the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft and saving it to a USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then had to go into the bios to boot from the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the USB loads choose to repair Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>and then I think I opted for reinstall windows but keep files and apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That got me going again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then followed Daves advice to stop Windows from auto updating by removing the registry entry for Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather have usable computer with an out of date Windows 10 than a crashed system caused by incompetent programming by Microsoft engineers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least having a working version of windows will keep me going until I finally bite the bullet and move to Chrome operating system and leave Microsoft completely.</p>

<h2>            How to uninstall Active Development Co., Ltd. - Streaming Media and Broadcast - USB TV Tuner&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
Last month I installed <span>"Active Development Co., Ltd. - Streaming Media and Broadcast - USB TV Tuner" from MS Update and this driver "crashed" my Not Only TV. I saw on your page Azam K. suggesting someone else to go to system restore point, but I don't
 have a restore point before I installed the new driver. <br />
How could I remove it, it doesn't appear in remove updates windows???<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Currently is your TV tuner card working properly or are you getting a prompt to install this update?</span></p>

            Here is one method:<br />
1) a) To take a screenshot of the currently open window press 'Alt+Prt Scr<em>[stands for 'print screen']</em>'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;b) To take a screenshot of the entire screen, press 'Prt Scr'<br />
2) Open&nbsp;paint&nbsp;and press Ctrl+V to paste the image into paint<br />
3) save as what ever you wish.<br />
I hope this helps.

            Just press "Print Screen" to capture the full screen, forward to "Paint" and paste the image to editing board. After that you can edit and save the screenshot. You may also forward to "Accessories - Snipping" and use this default tool to deal with screenshot
 more conveniently.&nbsp;&lt;removed&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> leelord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Windows 8 64-bit &#40;Full Version&#41; - OEM Question</h2>
                    I'd like to install the full version, (a clean install) of Windows 8, not RT nor Pro in a newly created partition and have a dual boot, win7/Win8.&nbsp; The software is available at Newegg, as well as from Amazon.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't have a full version as yet
 or so I'm told my Microsoft. <br />
<br />
Newegg's site http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16832416550&amp;Tpk=32-416-550
<br />
<br />
Under "Details" on that site it states:<br />
<br />
Use of this OEM System Builder Channel software is subject to the terms of the Microsoft OEM System Builder License. This software is intended for pre-installation on a new personal computer for resale. This OEM System Builder Channel software requires the
 assembler to provide end user support for the Windows software and cannot be transferred to another computer once it is installed. To acquire Windows software with support provided by Microsoft please see our full package "Retail" product offerings.<br />
<br />
I'd like to ask if anyone knows...<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; It states the software can be installed only on one machine.&nbsp; But if something were to happen on that machine can I reinstall using that software?<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Does Windows 8 have a backup feature like Windows 7?&nbsp; I personally use Macrium Reflect which is a great free backup program to create an image of my drive.&nbsp; In addition I also use Window's 7 backup.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Will Microsoft have a full version anytime in the near future and....&nbsp; Can one buy a new Windows 8 computer with Windows 8 software, instead of Windows Pro or RT?<br />
<br />
I had a site that gave me the option of accessing Microsoft Live Chat for Windows8 which I accessed last night and asked a few questions about the installation.&nbsp; I can no longer find this site.&nbsp; Does anyone know the url?&nbsp; Thanks so much!<br />

<p><strong>No, it tied to the 1st computer / motherboard you install the OEM version on.<br />

<h2>            REGISTRY REPAIR&#58; After update - Program locations in Registry are WRONG. Pointing to C&#58; rather than F&#58; How can the registry be fixed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a tool? An easier editor where I can easily search/replace? Then Overwrite the Registry? Is Microsoft going to FIX this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Received the Fall Creator update on Monday12/10/17. Today I needed to run a vector graphics program and received a missing dll error and shutdown. Noticed the path was calling for the .dll to be in C: Checked and it was in F:</p>
<p>Opened regedit as admin a quick check and sure enough, every single program and all it's associated everything (CLSID) are listed as C:\program.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last registry backup is from June and the programs et al are listed correctly</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the registry changing the C to F for the specific program location only. It took 8 hours as there is only a Find and F3 Next function. There is no Find/Replace. It worked. However I have way too many programs to continue to manually change
 the drive letter one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, as I pursued fixing another, smaller program the registry editor deleted the entire key where I had only changed the drive letter. 3 more times to verify. I don't know if it was "tired" or broken?</p>
<p>
</p><p>These programs can't even uninstall/reinstall because </p>
<p>&nbsp; 1. the location is wrong uninstall doesn't see the program</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2. installation disk sees the existing program and won't overwrite (internet updates/newer versions/out of business)</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3. That is an enormous amount of time.</p>

<h2>            Event ID  1033--  BlueScreen error-- Stop 0x19</h2>
                    <p><strong><u><em>Original Title</em></u>: BlueScreen error 1033 - Even in Safe mode</strong></p>
<p>Hi everyone, After trying to install an updated firewall associated with my antivirus and maintenance program, I had a system crash that described itself as a BlueScreen event. Now, my system crashes with a similar event every time I try to open a file associated
 with an installed application - even in Safe mode. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Problem event name: Bluescreen</p>
<p>OS version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.48</p>
<p>Locale ID: 1033</p>
<p>BC Code: 19</p>
<p>BCP1: 20</p>
<p>BCP2: C06B8340</p>
<p>BCP3: C06B8390</p>
<p>BCP4: 25050034</p>
<p>OS Version: 6_1_7600</p>
<p>Service Pack: 0_0</p>
<p>Product: 256_1</p>
<p>Files that help describe the problem:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\Minidump\011312-22932-01.dmp</p>
<p>C:\Users\Me\AppData\Local\Temp\WER-51339-0.Sysdata.xml</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked at many of the responses and solutions in the community here, and have tried several ideas that have been posted. I have updated my video driver from the computer manufacturer, and I have removed the software that originally created the crash.
 The big problem I have is that my&nbsp;system is not always displaying words on buttons or details in panes when a support or recovery window is displayed (they just do not appear as they once did). Also, many of the recovery windows that&nbsp;I want to use are elongated
 so that the bottoms of them (the bits that contain the 'Back', 'Next', 'Apply', 'Cancel' buttons, etc.) are not accessible, and hence, I cannot gain access to the required buttons, check boxes, or details. This was evident when I went to try a clean boot to
 help me eliminate possible causes - I could not get access to the 'Disbable All' or 'OK' buttons. They were at the bottom of a very elongated window. I tried to adjust my resolution to compensate, but it made no difference.</p>
<p>If it helps, one of the common phrases that appears when my system crashes is 'Bad_Pool_Header'. This is particularly frequent when I try to open a file from an application. I also often see 'Page_Fault_in_Nonpaged_Area'.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help or advice that you can offer.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            UMB and DOS applications not working after installing KB2724197</h2>
                    <p><br />
<strong>Original Title:</strong> KB2724197 UMB no longer working, DOS apps failing.</p>
<p>This update has a bug in it, according to me. </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem lies in the fact that UMB no longer is working and all drivers/apps/dos loads in conventional memory.</div>
<div>There is not enough memory left for some dos apps and so they fail.<br />
<br />
check with mem /c&nbsp;</div>
<div>U should see a lis tof apps in conventional memory AND a list of apps in Upper Memory.</div>
<div>If u only have conventional memory apps, then u have this update installed causing the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
uninstall and hiding update is only solution for now.</div>

    <title>How Do I stop network files from being synced with sync center&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How Do I stop network files from being synced with sync center&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have synced a network folder from our NAS on my computer and it has caused nothing but problems.&nbsp; It doesn't sync all the files and now when I open the network folder, only the files that have been synced are visible.&nbsp; So many of the sub-folders and files
 are no longer accessible to me.&nbsp; If I disable the offline files, I don't have access to any files on the network drive at all.&nbsp; This is local to my computer, as all the other computers on the network aren't having this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is... Is there a way to sever the link between sync center and the network folder.&nbsp; I don't want the network folder to be synced with my computer anymore.&nbsp; Disabling offline folders creates more problems, so that is not an option.&nbsp; Can I delete
 sync center from windows?&nbsp; Before I synced the network folder, I didn't have any of these problems, So I've got to assume that it is the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be sincerely appreciated,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Josh</p>

            Hi Graham1_016,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There is no specific type of CD required for this. It all depends upon the CD burner which you have and almost all CD burners support all type of CDs - CR+R, CD+RW, CD-R, CD-RW. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<br />
<br />For greatest compatibility with most systems, you should purchase CD-R or DVD-R

<p>When looking at CDs, two abbreviations are important:</p>
<p>
</p><p>R means recordable - you can burn files</p>
<p>RW means re-writable - you can burn files, erase them, and burn other files</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you're looking for CDs that say CD-R and CD-RW on the label. As a practical matter, re-writeable CDs have not proved to be reliable, so if you can limit yourself to CD-R that would be better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an FYI: Most people have abandoned CDs because a USB flash drive is: 1) easier to use - no additional software or technical knowledge necessary; 2) less expensive; 3) more portable; and 4) works everywhere.</p>
