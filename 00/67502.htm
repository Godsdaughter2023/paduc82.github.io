<h2>            driver install corrupts disk.sys</h2>
                    I recently bought a solid state drive, which connects to the computer via USB (fitted in an enclosure) or directly to a SATA port on the motherboard.&nbsp; Which ever way I connect it, on starting Windows a message tells me that it it is searching for a driver,
 whch it finds and installs and tells me that I need to restart the computer.&nbsp; But on restart Windows opens (as though in Safe mode) with a window entitled 'Your computer was unable to start'; it searches for and finds a solution, the information from which
 is<br />
Boot critical file d:\Windows\system32\drivers\disk.sys is corrupt<br />
Repair action: System restore<br />
(my system drive is normally C:).<br />
<br />
So, unless I disconnect the device, on restarting again successfully, Windows re-loads the driver and the whole cycle is repeated.<br />
<br />
I have been in contact with the manufacturer of the SSD but haven't got anywhere with them.&nbsp; They suggested that the system might be trying to use the SSD as the boot disk.&nbsp; So after Windows had loaded the driver, I shut the system down, and on starting up
 again, checked the BIOS to ensure the boot disk was indeed my normal system disc.&nbsp; The error still occured. I repeated this, but also removed the SSD before starting up again.&nbsp; Still the same error.<br />
<br />
Out of interest I plugged in a 'normal' USB hard drive that I used to use with a previous computer.&nbsp; Again Windows loaded a driver, but did not ask for a restart.&nbsp; The HDD appeared in Windows Explorer and I was able to view its contents.&nbsp; However, when I did
 restart Windows, I got the same error and the system was restored.&nbsp; Thus I believe the problem is not with the SSD but with the driver installation process, which I assume is provided by Windows.<br />
<br />
After this I checked the 'normal' USB hard drive by plugging it into a USB port of my laptop, to which it had not previously been connected; the laptop (same version of Windows as the problem machine) loaded a driver and the disk and its contents were viewable
 in Windows Explorer. The laptop restarted with no problem.<br />

            Hi Shenan,<br />
<br />
Thanks for replying...<br />
<br />
I have now.&nbsp; I plugged the (USB enclosure version) SSD into my laptop (also Windows 7 Professional, Sevice pack 1); it installed a driver, but did NOT require a re-start.&nbsp; Then Disk Manager showed the disk and gave me the option of formatting it, which I didn't
 do. I tried restarting the laptop, no problems.<br />
<br />
By the way, the driver install on the laptop took about 5 seconds, as opposed to over a minute on the desktop machine.<br />
<br />
My desktop and laptop computers are both set to install Windows updates, so the two operating systems are at the same levels.<br />

            A further piece of info - I tried the (USB) SSD again on the desktop machine, but before plugging it in I noted the date created and date modified of disk.sys from Windows Explorer.&nbsp; After the drivers had been loaded but before restarting the system, I
 checked these again - they had not changed.&nbsp; So I guess that Windows is just looking in the wrong place (wrong disk?) when it starts and just not finding disk.sys.&nbsp; I do check the BIOS and tell it which disk to boot from, and I'm sure it is my system drive.<br />

            Still struggling to solve this. Perhaps the following info might enable some kind person to spot what could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Firstly, because the SSD device connected with no problems via USB to my laptop, I formatted it there, disconnected it and attached it as a SATA device to my desktop machine.&nbsp; When the driver had been installed, despite it saying it required a computer restart,
 it showed in Windows explorer. So before restarting, I used the Acronis software supplied with the SSD Upgrade kit to clone my system drive (which, by the way, is a PATA drive - my other two hard drives are SATA. My intention is to replace the PATA drive with
 the SSD).<br />
<br />
But on restarting the computer, exactly the same problem occured as in my original post and Windows performed a system restore.<br />
<br />
After starting the computer cleanly (after a system restore) without the SSD connected, in Device Properties I see...<br />

Windows starts up cleanly.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I then shut down and power off the machine, connect the SSD (as a SATA device to the motherboard) and restart the machine.<br />
<br />
In the BIOS set-up I see...<br />
<br />
In Hard Disk Boot Priority -<br />
1. SCSI-0:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ST380011A<br />
2. Ch0 M.:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;WDC WD5000AAKS-00UU3A0<br />

5. Bootable Add-in Cards<br />
<br />
First, second and third Boot Devices - same as before<br />
<br />
In the Boot Menu I see the same as before<br />
<br />
After exiting the Boot Menu and before Windows starts, the two devices are listed briefly:<br />
HDD0: ST380011A<br />
HDD1: OCZ-VERTEX PLUS R2<br />
<br />
Windows starts and the driver for the SSD is automatically installed, with a message that the system must be restarted.&nbsp; But BEFORE restarting,...<br />
<br />
Looking in Device Manager / Disk Drives, the first device listed is OCZ-VERTEX PLUS R2 ATA Device. In its Properties a message says 'You need to restart your computer before changes you made to this device will take effect.' &nbsp;<br />
Location 0 (Channel 0, Target 0, Lun 0)<br />
Disk:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disk 3<br />

Unallocated space:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 MB<br />
Reserved space:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0 MB<br />
Volume: System (G:)<br />
<br />
The other disks' properties remain the same as before.<br />
<br />
In Computer Management / Disk Management I see the same as before with the following appended:<br />
Disc 3 - System (G:)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;115.21 GB NTFS (Active, Primary Partition)<br />
<br />
If I open two Windows Explorer windows and compare the contents of C: with G:, at a quick-ish glance they appear to be identical, so the cloning process seems to have worked OK.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I restart the computer with the SSD still connected. The BIOS and Boot Menus look exactly as they did when the SSD was connected but the driver had not yet been loaded (i.e. as the step described above).&nbsp; Again, just before Windows starts to load, the same
 two devices are listed...<br />
HDD0: ST380011A<br />
HDD1: OCZ-VERTEX PLUS R2<br />
<br />
Windows fails to start and the 'Your computer was unable to restart' window opens and after searching for a solution a system restore is performed, as described in my initial post.<br />
<br />
Sometimes at this stage the problem information is slightly different; usually it reports as described, but once or twice it has reported<br />
Boot critical file e:\Windows\system32\drivers\disk.sys is corrupt<br />
i.e. drive E: instead of D:<br />
<br />
and occasionally it reports<br />
Root cause found:<br />
A recent driver installation or upgrade may be preventing the system from starting.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I have tried changing the Hard Disk Boot Priority in the BIOS to various orders (but with the system drive always at the top), to no avail.<br />
<br />
So it appears that the driver installation has somehow caused Windows to try to boot from the wrong disk on restart, despite the BIOS having the correct disk listed as the first boot device.<br />
<br />
I have also tried uninstalling the driver (before trying to restart the computer), shutting down, diconnecting the SSD then restarting - the same problem occurs and a system restore is done.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any idea what could be going wrong and how it can be fixed, I shall be eternally grateful to them.

            This Works ! I fixed mine with this!

If windows 7 hangs after disk.sys just take out your RAMs and put it one by one. Make sure you are putting balanced RAM eg: 2+2 / and not 4+2 combination. It is basically RAM error.

            <p>Hi Antony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main issue is that i am unable to login into the account which i created using hotmail account. Please let me know a valid solution. Not some irrelevant answers you get from a random search.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you gave is in no way related to my problem. I am reporting the error which i got when i log in into my admin account and you are giving a link about how to create a admin account using hotmail. Please be relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>I did all the things which was given in the link. But none worked. So i had to reset my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am feeling sorry for upgrading Windows 10. Please don`t upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if i report the problem with exact error details, all you guys provide is a random Google search. I can do that myself. Why would i ask a dedicated forum if all i get is google search result links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely dissatisfied with windows OS, with its pathetic support and hopeless error solving forums. I should have installed pirated Windows version instead of buying this OS.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            c&#58;&#92;windows&#92;system32&#92;cmd.exe  Pops up for no apparent reason - &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop computer, it's a&nbsp;HP, 64bit&nbsp;and I just upgraded from Windows7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know for how long it has been happening ... could be&nbsp;a year, months or weeks ... just been too busy to recall ... but,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every single time I start up the laptop from it having been totally shutdown (not from sleep or hibernate), I get a popup box that says the following...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows cannot find c:\program files (x86)\user extensions\client.exe make sure you typed the name correctly and then try again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all I have NO idea whatsoever a cmd..exe file is used for nor do I imagine that I have ever used it for anything whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the last year and to the best of my knowledge I have not added or deleted any software whatsoever other than upgrading to Win 10 from Win 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me to&nbsp;resolve this issue?&nbsp;I sure would appreciate it as&nbsp;I am very concerned that it may cause a fatal error at some point down the road.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so very much in advance for your time and effort to help me with this matter as I have been unable to find anything that directly relates to this happening on startup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be well,</p>
<p>Kara</p>

            It would seem that these programs aren't compatible with Vista. Have you tried running the installer executable as administrator? If not, please try that first. Open Computer and then locate the icon for your optical drive. You should see the name of the
 Edmark CD in it. Now right-click the icon and choose "Open". Locate the installer, which is usually called something like Setup.exe. Right-click on it and choose "Run as administrator". Provide the password or OK to the UAC prompt and see if the installation
 works now.<br />
<br />
Otherwise contact Edmark tech support for help with their product.

    <title>PC freezes randomly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> table guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC freezes randomly</h2>
                    Okay so i've been working on a java project while in an AnyDesk call with my friend when the pc froze. The hdd indicator wasn't blinking either only the fans were working. I unplugged it and next morning when i turned it on a 'Bad checksum error' popped
 up. I had to reconfigure some settings in the bios and it was good to go. After i entered my password the pc froze again and a black screen. As the hdd activity led was still blinking i decided to let it do its thing. After 5-6 minutes the desktop showed up
 but nothing was on it only the taskbar without the chrome and file explorer on it. I waited 1 minute then a pink screen appeared for a second then black screen. Usually when i get black screens the monitor turns off but this time it didn't. I restarted and
 now it's working fine. I don't know what could be causing this.

            Hi Table 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. Exact reasons we will come to know through Event log if log has captured this event. Do two things -
<br />
<br />1. Take actions related to Display Driver as the first level of troubleshooting
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it

            <p>Hi Pidok,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the problem description, you have an issue with the&nbsp;Control Panel&nbsp;not displaying the installed programs in the Programs and Features. The issue&nbsp;may arise due to&nbsp;some system file corruption or a misconfigured windows setting.</span></p>
<p><span>So, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press Windows logo key and X key together.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>Command Prompt (admin)</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Run the following commands, restart the computer&nbsp;and check the issue status</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Regsvr32 jscript.dll</em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Regsvr32 vbscript.dll</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>Rename the Repository folder and check the issue status.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press Windows Key and W key together.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type in “View Local Services” and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Stop the “Windows Management Instrumentation” service and close the service Window</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Go to C:\Windows\System32\Wbem</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Rename the “Repository” to “Repository.old”</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Go back to <span>View Local Services and start the</span> “Windows Management Instrumentation” service.</p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Restart the computer and check the issue status.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, try the next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press Windows logo key and X key together.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>Command Prompt (admin)</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the left pane, right click on the “Command Prompt” option and select “Run as Administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type “<strong>sfc /scannow”</strong> without quotes and hit enter (There should be space between sfc and /).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Weird high pitched noise from xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericschmeling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird high pitched noise from xbox 360</h2>
                    This has been an ongoing issue my xbox 360 has been having. When I'm connected to xbox live and my xbox 360 is on, either playing a video game movie or at the dashboard. It makes a high pitched noise, a whiny noise and I'm not sure what is causing this.
 When I mute my TV the sound goes away, I assure you it's not the TV itself because I've tried to use multiple TV sets, also have used several HDMI cables and that's not the issue. I'm not sure why I post on the forum, I guess I hope someone will have an answer,
 calling xbox support never helps I always feel like I'm more knowledgable then the support I'm getting. I bet someone will even reply telling me that's it's probly an issue with my TV or HDMI cable. Obviously the xbox is sending some type of signal to my TV
 making that sound but it's only when I'm connected to xbox live. No I'm not on drugs or drunk, other ppl can concur of the ongoing issue that is a high pitched squeak. Please don't reply suggesting anything having to do with my

<p>G'day Schmelz! Thanks for trying and describing the troubleshooting you've done so far.<br />
<br />
If the sound is occurring on multiple TVs, with multiple HDMI cables, and the result of muting the TV is consistent, then let's try something else. Do you have the console's component A/V cable handy? If so, use that instead of HDMI and see if the noise continues.
 If you have any accessories plugged into the console like a 3rd party headset or capture card, unplug those as well.<br />
<br />
Let us know the result!</p>

<h2>            Stop receiving emails to old email address</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I created a microsoft account with a gmail address some years ago. Then i added an outlook mail and put it as the determinated one.</p>
<p>i deleted the gmail address from my account. Everything seems to be ok, but i'm still receiving the microsoft notifications (from the store for example) to my gmail address, not the outlook one which is the only mail i have in my account.
</p>
<p>Any idea how to fix this?</p>

<h2>            Controller stick&#47;dpad skipping on dashboard&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello so the problem I have is when I am on the dashboard for example going to close out an app or game and when I bring up menu and I press down twice it skips and goes three down. It happens with both my controllers from launch and I just figured it would
 be something patched out maybe is anyone else have this issue?</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista on Toshiba laptop won&#39;t accept my password to open computer. Password is corrrect.</h2>
                    <p>Have kept my&nbsp;Toshiba laptop with older files on it. Can usually access this computer with no problem. Today it is not accepting my password - have tried many versions of password with caps and without, but simple version has always worked before. Now it
 is telling me the password is wrong and asking me to reset by using a password reset&nbsp;disc or flashdrive. I don't have these and have never needed one before.</p>
<p>

<p>I understand Microsoft's policy to protect privacy but I have lots of proof that I own this computer, even the receipt from when I bought it in 2008. I can't make a reset disc because my new laptop does not have a disc port. If there was phone support I
 could prove this is my computer. Seems a lot of people have the same problem but none of the solutions work for me. Unfortunately I have Windows Vista on my old laptop.</p>

<p>Congrats to Vixboyz18 for the trade of Avos Lamentation for Tannars Glory.</p>
<p>My revised list of weapons I need and that I have spare are listed below. Please note that the weapons I have to offer list from before may have been slightly wrong. The weapons below should now be the accurate list.</p>
<p>The way this works with me is that I have me and 3 other family members all with the game at vvarious stages.</p>
<p>This lists below are across all 4 gamertags that are playing the game. </p>
<p>This may mean that when you deal with us, you may be dealing with one of 4 different profiles, depending on who has the weapon.</p>
<p>A GOOD TIME TO CATCH ALL OF US IS DURING THE WEEKS COMMENCING THE 8TH AND 15TH AUGUST.</p>
<p>Just msg my gamertag, and I will get back to you and arrange the trade. </p>
<p>Vixboyz18 was a pleasure to deal with, so lets hope I can do the same with anyone else interested in the offer.</p>

<p>Just to close this thread. I am happy to announce that I no have all the weapons. I cant trade anything back, as I got the the weapons by playing the game with my bro-in-law and my kids. Over the 4 profiles we got all the weapons and we have now redistributed
 them back to their original owners within our little group.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who traded with me, and especially En Viscid who gave me the final weapon withouth asking for anything in return.

<p>Hi Teeman</p>
<p>I was only on Xbox Live to get them, sorry. I have 5 gold accounts between myself, my 3 kids and bro-in-law and so we had plenty to choose from, so I only needed to get around 8 weapons and the chefs hat once everyone had finished the game.
</p>
<p>I now have everything I need and all the &nbsp;achievements as a result..</p>
<p>We are still arranging to swap the chefs hat between the profiles ourselves at the moment due to our differing schedules and so on, but if you manage to get a free one month intro to live with one of the games, then just msg me on the xbix, and I will see
 what I can do for you at that time.</p>
<p>The chefs hat is liable to be unavailable for a while as my bro-in-law is back at work now but good luck anyway in your hunt for stuff.</p>
<p>Sorry I cant be more help at the moment.</p>
        </p>

<p>No worries bud. Once I saw that there is like 52 weapons I kind of gave up on it. All that work for a 20 Gamer score not worth it IMO. I have Live BTW. It's just my sons that don't.</p>
<p>Oh yeah the Chet's hat is so easy to get. You just make friends with one of the cooks in the Bowerstone Castle</p>

<h2>            Dividing a screen into 4 smaller screens__</h2>
                    I'm 100% sure I was able to change the screen layout within Win7 when I first got it. There where other options i.e. dividing the screen into 3 or 2 and within each window/screen I could have a different prog running within each.&nbsp; Please tell me it is
 real and if so HOW to get it back?? Many Thx

<p>If they are Windowed programs just resize the the Window to the correct size and rectangular shape and drag them to the position you want. Only one Window can be active at any given time but the other programs can be running and visible.</p>
<p>Hope this is what you were after.</p>

            Hi Fourie
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

                    <p>The screen brightness adjustment keys of my HP Pavilion laptop are not recognized by Windows 10. It is so bright that it is harming our eyes. Also, I followed the suggested alternate steps from many websites and none of them worked as the brightness adjustment
 option is not at all available even not inside Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that before installing Windows 10, I got notification that my laptop is compatible for the upgrade. Can you please help?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Please be informed that I tried searching and downloading the updated drivers from HP and Intel (for graphics) both, but they could not find any driver for my HP Pavilion DV6 laptop and I am still unable to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>1. Adjust screen brightness - it is so bright that it is now hurting eyes to work on Windows 10 for long time.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>2. Adjust screen display sizes (resolution) - most of the web pages which earlier loaded into IE is not showing properly and these pages and also some of the app windows are not actually fitting within the entire laptop screen (17")&nbsp;after the upload.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>3. Touchpad scrolling on many apps including Edge.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Note - Device Manager shows that all the drivers are up to date. Still facing the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Can you please help me in this regard? Do I need to go back to WIndows 7 (the one I had before upgrade)? Is it technical possible? Or do I need to buy a new laptop which is a very costly option.</p>

            <div>SOLUTION:</div>
<div><strong>Preliminary remarks:</strong><br />
As we all know Windows OS always bring problems.<br />
The boys of Redmond, since upgrading to W7, have failed to resolve how to adapt drivers on updating.<br />
Ie we moving from XP to W7, W8, W8.1, and W10, and always the same problems: drivers.<br />
It seems that is user problem, when it is not.<br />
The problem is always Windows.</div>
<div><br />
Happily, any MVP, or any employee of the Technical Service will tell identical answers:<br />
1. Update<br />
2. Uninstall<br />
3. Reinstall<br />
4. Update again<br />
5. If this problem is not resolved, they will blame the manufacturer of your PC.</div>
<div>But again, the problem is always Windows.</div>
<div>How to troubleshoot drivers?<br />
Unless you're a NASA college, you can not do it without a guide.<br />
When will you ask for help, they will make you reinstall everything again, at the risk of collateral losing, or directly, your computer.<br />
Some drivers could fry your computer completely forever.<br />
For example, the BIOS drivers.</div>
<div>As I've already broken a couple of PC's by the MVP's advices, I learned to force ignoring them.<br />
1 Never mind them.<br />
2nd Investigate on your own.<br />
3rd If in doubt, read the item 1 again.</div>
<div>Let's think about, using logic.<br />
A driver is a program, that tells Windows what type of components has your PC.<br />
For example: what video card, what sound card, etc.<br />
When updating Windows, the video card IS THE SAME (as other components of your PC).<br />
This means Windows changed, no computer.<br />
Therefore, you do not need new drivers, because your PC IS THE SAME.</div>
<div><br />
What does Windows with drivers when upgrading?<br />
It copy without reinstalling.</div>
<div>For that reason, some work, some do not. Depending on the type of driver.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>SOLUTION:</strong><br />
On update (for Windows 10), your former drivers are in the folder:<br />
C: \ SWSetup \ Drivers<br />
(I recommend that you copy into another PC, or DVD and keep)<br />
All have their installer "setup.exe", and you can use them, in case of formatting your PC in the future.</div>
<div>This time, (because it is an upgrade Win 7 or 8, 10) we will from the "Device Manager".<br />
(Right click on the Start button of Windows 10. It's at the top of the list)<br />
In the case of the video card, it is among the first in the Device Manager.<br />
It's called "Display Adapter" (click).<br />
Then right&nbsp; click, at the driver (Intel or AMD).<br />
Choose "Update Driver Software".<br />
Choose "Search for driver software on your computer".<br />
Here you have to put the folder on your DRIVER (which is dependent).<br />
Example: C: \ SWSetup \ Drivers \ VGA_PH \ Graphics<br />
OK.<br />
Restart.</div>
<div><br />
The driver is updated, and before restart, could operate normally control brightness.</div>
<div>I repeat, that you can also update the drivers with the "setup" of the driver concerned.<br />
Anyway I do not recommend using the "setup", except in the case of a clean installation (not an upgrade).</div>
<div>That is all.<br />
Your brightness control problem and will be solved.</div>
<div>

            I have an HP Pavillion upgraded from Windows 8 to 10. What technical idiot decided the brightness is not good for the eyes!! I could not even see my cursor.&nbsp; I updated the AMD graphics driver and now it is bright but still cannot find where I adjust it.
 This should not take several hours of my valuable to time to search for the setting. Afraid to reboot and have to go through this all over again. Windows 10 s***ks.

<p>I have a HP Pavilion x2 Detachable</p>
<p>
</p><p>When all the MS updates pushed through - my brightness setting and keys stopped working. I tried all the usual options listed on sites - update drivers etc but non of them worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I dended up doing was actually going to the HP site and downloading the origonal drivers that came with my laptop and reinstalling them - the process prompts you to say that the current drivers are newer than the ones your about to install - I simply
 accepted that and went through with the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as it was completed - my brightness key worked again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you first open the HP Support Assistant tool that is with your laptop and copy paste the serial number so that you can paste it into the HP support site search area - so that it will give you the correct drivers that are for your system...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me the system was: HP Pavilion x2 - 12-b020nr (ENERGY STAR)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver I reverted back to was: Intel High-Definition (HD) Graphics Driver 20.19.15.4390 Rev.B 196.7 MB Mar 14, 2016</p>

<p>I too have an HP Pavilion dv6 and am having this same problem. It seems that Windows 10 does not support this video card and HP does not support this laptop anymore. When I contacted HP for the driver, they told me to buy a new laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows 10 updates your system and you have unsupported hardware it installs a generic driver. I tried to roll back the old driver back through the device manager and that didn't work. The old drivers for Windows Vista and 7 are on the HP website, but
 I can't download them because I am viewing the site from a Windows 10 machine. I tried to go into SWsetup like another user said, but Windows is saying I have the best driver installed and will not install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating. I cannot control my brightness, nor can I connect to an external display.</p>

    <title>Color Management in Windows 7 making photo viewer very very slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kc_tech_2016  say:</h3>
<h2>            Color Management in Windows 7 making photo viewer very very slow</h2>
                    <p>We have Windows 7 64-bit computers running on a windows domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks ago the users could open up a directory on the network and view their photos there in Windows Photo Viewer and they could move from one picture to the next with no delay in opening up the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After what I am guessing was a windows update that occurred a few weeks ago, now when the user opens a image, it takes 5 to 10 seconds to open the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read all of the fixes for color management and applied them ( 1) delete any calibrated or default profiles, 2) edit the registry to set cache to "0" for photo viewer, 3) uncheck "Use Windows display calibration, 4) reinstall the video driver, 5) added
 the user to the local admin group. ) Those are what I remember off the top of my head and other things I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a workaround, but it only works if the user does not logoff or restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Workaround, &nbsp;Step 1) while the user is logged in and viewing images is painfully slow, switch users and login as a domain administrator (or someone with domain admin rights). &nbsp;Step 2) verify browsing the images in Photo viewer is not slow and running
 correctly, Step 3) open color management, goto the "Advanded" tab, click on "Change system defaults", Step 4) I click on each of the tabs without changing a single setting on any of them, click "Close" on the last tab. &nbsp;Step 5) I switch users, go back to the
 account that was having the problem and miraculously the images load in no time and load as fast as you can press the arrow button to browse to the next image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround works great until the user logs off, the computer is restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried saving the color profile from the account that can view the images with no issue and then loading that profile in the user account that is slow viewing images but this has not worked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** If the user that is logged in is having issues and I switch users to an admin account, verify viewing images is working normally and then switch back to the user account that is slow and open Color Management and select "Change system defaults", then
 switch back to the admin account that was working, now the images are slow to view for the admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if the images are copied to the local drive or read from a usb drive, there is no delay in loading the images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have not been able to find a solution as of yet and was hoping for any feedback regarding this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

<h2>            Laptop and desktop network, can only communicate one way</h2>
                    I have a desktop with windows vista 64x service pack 1, and a laptop with windows vista.&nbsp; I set up networks on both pc's.&nbsp; One on laptop is called Ricksnet and one on PC is called Network2.&nbsp; Both Pc's have same user id account name for administrator of
 Rick, and same password.&nbsp; Both are workgroups.&nbsp; I have enabled file sharing, etc on both.&nbsp; When networks display they DO show the proper content of DEsktop, Laptop, Router, modem, on both Pc's.&nbsp; Using the laptop I can click on the desktop name in network and
 it links me properly, doesn't ask for anything, just links.&nbsp; When using the desktop, I click on the laptop name in network (to link) and it asks me for name and password.&nbsp; I enter Rick and password but it comes back with error "unable to log on....".&nbsp; HELP!

<h2>            Camera error code&#58; 0xA00F244&#40;0xC00D36D5&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello&nbsp;community, I am hoping someone can help me. The code above is the error code I am receiving off my camera, apparently my camera driver has&nbsp;an issue. Problem for me is I have searched and searched and cannot find the camera driver ANYWHERE. Which means
 I cannot update it, I cannot do a rollback. nor can I uninstall it because it just isn't there. If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.

<p>If your camera isn't showing up in Device Manager under "Cameras", "Imaging devices", or "Sound, video, and game controllers" or when you show hidden devices, it may be installed as part of a chipset driver. I suggest you go to your PC manufacturers website
 and reinstall any chipset, camera, or graphics drivers they have available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have my camera drivers back but now when I try using it on skype it just says close other programs that may be using it<br />
I believe what I did was scroll down to in my device driver menu into my universal serial bus controller and played around with one that came up as unknown I trouble shooted it and restarted my computer not sure if I uninstalled and reinstalled if the previous
 didn't work try uninstalling reinstalling and restarting or uninstall reinstall trouble shoot restart<br />
but I have a new problem now my internal camera will not work with skype it's on the skype menu like it recognizes the camera is there it just wont use it because it says it is being used by another application and there is nothing wrong with the drivers and
 nothing is using it so I'm stumped there</p>

            If your problem is the same as mine be prepared to feel really silly hit function+f6 and if it isn't the same as mine, do some serious looking around I have been trying to figure this out for over a month now and finally decided that I had had enough and
 went through my computer manufacturer's wed forum and found it...hope this help...going to go crawl under the carpet and hide for sheer embarassment :-)

<h2>            ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>OK, so I just got off the phone to Customer Services, I bought a day one edition of the xb1 and since plugging it in &nbsp;I have had nothing but problems with the display, a black flicker would appear on screen for 1 or 2 seconds no matter what I was doing on
 the machine, playing a game, on the dashboard or watching live TV via the Sky HD box.</p>
<p>After going through all the troubleshooting steps, changing resolution and the like, it was determined that the console was faulty and I would need a replacement one sending out," great I thought at least I'll get a replacement......", little did I know
 that Microsoft want a credit card to withhold £400 until they get the faulty one back, ARE THEY SERIOUS ?????</p>
<p>Did they do this when the 360 had faults, no, they sent out the console via courier and you handed the faulty one over upon delivery, would they let me do this, no they would not, would they let me send my faulty one first then get the replacement sent out
 afterwards, no they would not budge.</p>
<p>Im sorry but I've just spent £429 on your "next gen" console, there's no way I'm shelling out another £400 to get a replacement one when there is no security or guarantee that Microsoft, or the courier service will "accidentally" misplace my faulty console,
 therefore leaving me another £400 out of pocket.</p>
<p>No apologies for my inconvenience, no compensation, no middle ground to work from, just £400 or *** off please.</p>
<p>Disgusting</p>
<p>This is from a customer that has been with Xbox for ten years, ten years of loyalty counts for nothing these days I suppose.</p>
<p>This blog will be posted on ALL Xbox related forums to show that Xbox do not care about you, offer a shoddy service and just want to milk you for every penny that you have, CONSUMERS BEWARE !!!!</p>

<p>This is not at all unusual. &nbsp;Companies aren't in the habit of sending out expensive hardware without some sort of guarantee you'll send it back. &nbsp;And you have nothing to worry about if it was to get lost or something. &nbsp;The products are tracked and since
 its on a credit card, you could always dispute it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Having read other topics though, it seems like others were given the option to ship theirs back. &nbsp;Might want to try and speak to a different rep. In addition, you may look at bringing it back to where you bought it - stores are likely going to have stock
 soon.</p>

<p>Isn't this the advance replacement? Where they send out the replacement unit before they get yours back? It's terrible your new unit is broken but this is how they make sure your aren't just calling and attempting to get a free XBOX One.</p>

<p>I appreciate that Microsoft dont want to send out units willy-nilly to every tom, *** and harry who are after a free console, but for them not even to consider my faulty console to be sent FIRST before I receive anything is beyond me, surely this is proof
 enough that im not a scammer, &nbsp;its like "nope, give me £400 or im not doing anything", when my 360 pranged on me all I had to do was call them wait for the delivery, then hand over my faulty unit at the same time as recieving the new one, why this sudden change
 on returns policy, then again its not the first time.</p>
<p>As regards to handing it back to the retailer, I work for the retailer and I know for a fact that stock between now and the new year is going to be non existent, &nbsp;so I can kiss getting an instant replacement goodbye, then again there could be a massive surge
 of stock be for then.....i think not.</p>
<p>Thanks for your constuctive replies everyone and I guess im just gonna have to bend over and take it like a man.......</p>

<p>It doesn't matter whether you are a scammer or not, it ensures you'll ship back the faulty unit and do so in a timely manner. &nbsp;I see this all the time, for equipment that costs far more ($15k and up) and the part may only be $250 but they still will get
 CC info to ensure the faulty part is returned.</p>
<p>Retailer may get some. &nbsp;I'm sure MS is prioritizing their stores, but I know some MS stores have already received stock. &nbsp;Not sure about other stores, but it will likely happen. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you mean that 'ping localhost' returns no reply?</p>
<p>If so, you need to add the line&nbsp;</p>
<p>127.0.0.1 localhost</p>
<p>to your HOSTS file. This is located in c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc - and note that the filename has NO extension.</p>
<p>Either that, or use the real IP address of your computer in the URL bar.</p>
