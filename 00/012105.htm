            <p>Hello parida,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you cannot play Youtube videos on your phone as well as some videos from news web sites. Can you play some videos anyway?</p>
<p>What did you try so far to solve the issue?</p>
<p>Are you experiencing this problem since the very beginning?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Are you having the problem with one file or with any Excel file? Can you open Excel directly (i.e., without double-clicking on a workbook file)?<br />

<h2>            Office 2016 Install - 30180-4 Error</h2>
                    <p>I have a new HP Envy 13t laptop with Windows 10 Home. &nbsp;I am attempting to install Office 2016 Professional and am getting the error code 30180-4. &nbsp;Despite what the error message says, I am connected to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through the forums and have tried the various suggestions</p>
<p>* I have disable the firewall</p>
<p>* Proxies are not enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>What may or may not be relevant, the system came with a "free" version of Office 2016 (not sure what version), which I never actually ran nor activated, but did uninstall from Programs and Features prior to installing my own copy of Office 2016. &nbsp;After getting
 these errors, I also tried the Microsoft Fixit utility, but it didn't find any issues to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?</p>

            <p>The problem is solved. &nbsp;Don't want to call it a dumb user error, but it borders on that along with a very bad error message from MS. &nbsp;The install files (2.4GB) were on my desktop machine. &nbsp;Every night, my desktop get's backed up to a shared USB drive. &nbsp;So,
 for my new laptop, I went to the shared drive and copied the install files to the laptop. &nbsp;And then began my problems as documented above. &nbsp;What I discovered last night (following my own comment that the install files totaled over 2GB, that there were only
 240MB worth of files on my laptop. &nbsp;I went backed and looked at the files on the shared drive, and there were only 240MB worth of files there. &nbsp;So, went back to desktop, and there I had the 2.4GB worth of files. &nbsp;Did a file copy to the USB and then to the
 laptop. &nbsp;Then did the install - and installation went fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do think MS could give a bit clearer error message than check your internet connection. &nbsp;But all is well now.</p>
<p>

<p>They always perform a software update after a repair, but it sounds like in your case something went wrong here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't say what kind of phone you have. If it is an S60 "Symbian" model, you can reformat it with the code *#7370#; if the phone is compatible with NSU (<a href="http://www.nokia.com/softwareupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com/softwareupdate</a>) you
 could reinstall the latest software yourself using your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failing both of those, you would have to go back to the repairer and tell them a new problem has been caused by the work they did.</p>

<h3> mattw112  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote not syncing every page&#63; And other sync issues.</h2>
                    <p>I have basically three computers and my cell phone syncing to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a heavy user of OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>one of my PCs crashes a lot (Still trying to figure that out) lets call this PC1</p>
<p>
</p><p>one of my computers also died recently (driver issue) and I ended up having to wipe it.&nbsp; PC2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also just bought a new surface pro 3 a couple days ago. PC3</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before PC2 died I noticed it was giving a sync issue for a tab in one of my notebooks.&nbsp; I could see it fine on OneDrive and on PC1.&nbsp; So I tried getting it to sync, no errors but just wouldn't sync.&nbsp; then it died.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On OneDrive a few pages wouldn't show up, said it was waiting to be updated for some PC?&nbsp; My guess is it was PC2 that died.&nbsp; So I deleted these pages and figured I'd restore them from backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On PC1 I thought maybe the tabs were too full of pages so I decided to add more tabs and spread the pages out among them.&nbsp; So I did this.&nbsp; However like I said PC1 crashses unexpectedly all the time and this may have happened during this time??</p>
<p>
</p><p>On OneDrive though none of these changes appeared?&nbsp; And no errors on PC1?&nbsp; Seems like it just isn't synchronizing??</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I created a new Notebook and tried moving some of the pages to that to see if those would show up on OneDrive.&nbsp; Which 90% of them did.&nbsp; but I've been syncing, etc for a couple days now and I can't get a few of the pages to snyc?&nbsp; Not sure why I'm clicking
 on them, they just say waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be nice if OneNote would give better details on exactly what it is doing, allow forced syncs of specific pages, for example would be nice if I could say, hey I know you don't think this page is the latest and you're waiting on another pc, but I want
 to force this to be authoritative because that other PC doesn't exist any more....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway right now I'm just stuck and not sure how to get these pages to sync with OneDrive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any tools out there people have made that can be used to help with synchronization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Terry</p>

            <p>Hi thanks but I've tried those and more plus those are not all relevant.&nbsp; Let me add some more detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main problems that I see are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a OneNote notebook that if I go into OneDrive there are some PAGES that wont load and it says that it is still waiting for updates from some PC.&nbsp; Likely the PC that no longer exists.&nbsp; So how do I get it to stop waiting for updates from that PC and
 use a different authoritative source?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I have some PAGES in OneNote on my PC that is working that don't seem to sync with OneDrive anymore.&nbsp; I have sat for days now waiting and I can't get those pages to update to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I didn't mention this but I am getting no sync issues being reported.&nbsp; No explanation marks, or otherwise.&nbsp; trust me I know what those look like where it needs a password, or says will be put in misplaced sections, or some other annoying error.&nbsp; I've
 seen them all.&nbsp; I am a long time and heavy user of OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So would be great if there was some log file or some more detailed place I could look to see exactly what OneNote/OneDrive was doing with the syncing.&nbsp; or if there's some third party tool that could help.&nbsp; Or some other trick so I can resolve the two issues
 above?&nbsp; I've wasted so many hours on this over the last few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Terry</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your response.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since those steps and others have not worked, I request you to try the following step:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Create a new OneNote Notebook.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Copy and paste all information from one of your notebooks which is not syncing. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Test if the new notebook syncs normally.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Try the above step and let us know the result.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.

            <p>I already did that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of everything I copied over synced.. but there are some pages that won't sync.&nbsp; I've let it sit for days.&nbsp; I have a very fast internet connection too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny thing is some of the pages that aren't syncing are super small.&nbsp; Like a few lines of text.&nbsp; compared to some pages I have that have recordings in them.&nbsp; So not sure why large pages would sync and some small ones wouldn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I'm getting very frustrated I've wasted so much time on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>like I said I've always been a OneNote user I have my entire life in there.&nbsp; home, family, business... you name it.&nbsp; Some of my many note books are very large too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I just 'closed' these notebooks that are giving me issues on all my systems.&nbsp; I may try just wiping out everything and trying to restore from backups.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main thing that is annoying me is this error about OneDrive waiting for some computer to finish syncing.&nbsp; I know that must be from the PC that no longer exists.&nbsp; How do I get OneNote to stop waiing for that sync and either go with what it has or let
 me tell it what to make authoritative????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a log file anywhere around syncing so I can see what is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried the OneDrive Troubleshooter too if that is going to be a suggestion from someone.</p>

            <p>So I've waste a bunch more days trying to get this working again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I closed all OneNote notebooks on all PCs.&nbsp; Then deleted all OneNotes from OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored the OneNotes from Backups to a single computer in OneNote on premise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave it ample time to make sure everything was up and working again locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I broke one of the large OneNote notebooks up into two smaller Notebooks and again gave it plenty of time to make sure things got copied around and were happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created two new folders on OneDrive.&nbsp; one for each of the two Notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I shared the OneNotes to OneDrive and let the Sync magic happen... lol...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Days going by and barely anything is getting uploaded.&nbsp; in fact things seem to have just stopped.??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I did finally find some articles about the ini files that control throttling.&nbsp; So I made some adjustments to try to get those working again.&nbsp; But still seems to be going slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT I DONT GET IS THE STUPID MISLEADING ERROR MESSAGES..ARRG...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So OneDrive seems happy, service is running fine, I can click on the tray icon and tell it to Sync now and it reports everything is synced?@?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In OneNOte the Sync view... it is saying that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We can't sync the notebook because you're offline or because the network location is unavailable. (Error code: 0xE4010641)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I can click on the links within OneNote and it takes me directly to the OneDrive sections.&nbsp; So the location is fine.&nbsp; And I'm definitely not offline... stupid OneNote...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at this point it doesn't seem to be syncing at all???&nbsp; Days and days have gone by and barely anything has uploaded??&nbsp; Is it possible that if it runs into an error of some sorts it just stalls the upload/sync process???</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get this going again?&nbsp; These are important notebooks that I use all the time across machines.&nbsp; I'd prefer to have them in OneDrive but it is starting to seem like I should just keep them local?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure on what to do for next steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft again I'm a very long time user of OneNote and a heavy user... but I am seriously considering finding alternatives this experience has been horrible and has wasted so much of my time.&nbsp; It is ridiculous if you guys want people to use your online
 services they need to work.</p>

            <p>It isn't network related it is Microsoft related.&nbsp; Go out to Bing and search on things like OneNote slow sync or OneNote stopped sync, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have very large notebooks and getting them from my system to the cloud seems to be something Microsoft is having issues with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error messages also must be updated by Microsoft they are ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously network is fine if I can click within OneNote on the location and it takes me right to them in OneDrive.&nbsp; Also I have 20 notebooks... and the others that are already up there&nbsp;aren't having these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the sync thresholds Microsoft has set are too low and not intelligent enough to handle different situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The funny thing is that the pages here and there that weren't synced aren't huge they are sometimes just a little bit of text?&nbsp; So it seems randomish on what syncs and what doesn't.&nbsp; My guess is there is some other sort of sync issue going on and then that
 holds up everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, after working on this and leaving my PC on 24 hours a day for over a week they have finally finished syncing.&nbsp; At least I hope so.&nbsp; It says it is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh also that link you suggested is horrible.&nbsp; None of those things is true and is very limited thinking on Microsoft's part.</p>

 again.&nbsp; And when I click on the onenote link to go to the notebook on line, my files are up to date.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Please help me out!</p>

            I'm having the same issues - notebooks and sections with large pdfs are not syncing. I am so frustrated with this and do not have time to deal with it as I'm in the middle of anatomy in med school. My take on it is that Onenote can't handle large files.
 I'm abandoning it and switching to powerpoint / word documents. It's really a big loss - I have invested a lot of my study strategy around Onenote.

<p>Ok I have been having issues syncing notebooks since I went Business premium 365. &nbsp;I have my notebooks on the Business 365 account space and can access them without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is frustrating is this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just syncing from my PC and my SP4 Pro I can see text within tabs sync without issue. &nbsp;Reasonably quick but Creating new tabs on either PC is problematic as the Online one note sees the new tab but the PC where it was not created on dosen't get it at all.
 &nbsp;Not until I delete any old tabs in the notebook recycle bin or just delete all the docs in the recycle bin of the effected PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the missing tabs appear without issue. &nbsp;Anyone seen this before? and does anyone have a solution as this is really a pain to use one note in this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had any issue when I was using my personal one drive. &nbsp;I am running Latest Windows 10 pro and latest One Note 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

 why.

 item in the dialog, don't worry about it.</li><li>If you save the file in a folder that you've set in Word as a Trusted Location, you won't get a warning banner.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Word behave very strange, it just stops allow me to format text or even save the file after switching from Word to another app and coming back to Word. I can open or create a document, work on it without any iossue, save it etc. and it works perfectly.
 But every time I switch to the other app, for example Safari or Mail, whatever, after coming to back to Word I just can not format text (but I still can type) and Word denies to save the document. It is always the same, no matter the file is open from OneDrive
 or iCloud or just created by me. I tried reinstaling Word, reinstaling OneDrive, rebooting, upgrading to iOS 10.2, nothing worked. There are two ways to overcome this issue: to clean RAM, which is annoying, or to enable in Preferences =&gt; Word =&gt; Reset Word
 =&gt; Clear All Documents which is annoying as well `cos for some reason it needs to be enabled every time I close the Word app. Please help, it makes Word unusable on iPad, I have a paid subscription!</p>

    <title>1&#41; What is max number of contacts I can import into Outlook 365 at - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            1&#41; What is max number of contacts I can import into Outlook 365 at one time, and 2&#41; What is the max number of contacts I can have in Outlook 365&#63;</h2>
                    <p>1) What is max number of contacts I can import into Outlook 365 at one time, and 2) What is the max number of contacts I can have in Outlook 365 overall?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask is because I am trying to import ALL 3,523 of my contacts into Outlook 365 at one time and it keeps failing with the SPECTACULARLY USELESS error message "...something went wrong...". SERIOUSLY??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now going to try breaking up my contacts into four ~1,000-contact files, and then importing them one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, then I will abandon Outlook and use Google email, much as I think Outlook is a superior product in most other respects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully</p>

<p>I've seen limits of 1,000 imports at a time and a practical limit of 1,500 total in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>Since it sounds like you are trying to run a business out of your email account, Outlook.com is likely not the best solution. Office 365 Business could be a better fit (as long as you don't send bulk emails). However, there are many for-pay email providers
 out there.</p>
<p>If you intend to send out bulk email then using a specialized service would be preferred. One such example is MailChimp, but there are many.</p>

<p>Hi again Solar-Eclipse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now I took your advice and tried importing only 1,000 of my ~3,500+ contacts into my
<em><strong>paid-subscription</strong></em> Outlook 365 account and it failed again (with the same spectacularly unhelpful "...something went wrong..." error message).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will now try again but this time with a 500-contact file and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you telling me definitively that a paid-subscription Outlook 365 account can only handle 1,500 contacts TOTAL?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, then many of my 3,500 contacts will definitely want to know that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry if anything I wrote stated or implied that I am running a business; to be clear, I am not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm sorry if anything I wrote stated or implied that I had intentions of sending out bulk email; to be clear, I am not.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
As of April 20, 2018, using Outlook 365 beta, I successfully imported all 3,523 of my contacts by breaking my one (1) large file of 3,523 contacts down into eight (8) smaller files of 500 (or less) contacts each.</p>

</p>
Therefore the operational answers to the two questions are as follows:</p>
<span>Q1) What is max number of contacts I can import into Outlook 365 at one time?</span></p>
Answer 1: You can import at least 500 contacts (and quite possibly more) into Outlook 365 at one time, providing the contacts are in a .csv file.</p>
</p>
<span>Q2) What is the max number of contacts I can have in Outlook 365? </span>
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Answer 2: You can have at least 3,500 contacts (and quite possibly more) in Outlook 365 at one time.</span></p>

            <p>This is not a fix! So your solution is to send all my email to spam until I build a safe sender list - so I have to sift thru all the spam any way. But the important thing here is as an outsourced resource you got to close a ticket. How about escalating
 for a real solution.</p>

            We shouldn't have to mark everything exclusive. &nbsp;We often get emails that may be important that aren't coming from contacts. &nbsp;And we shouldn't have to sift through the junk folder looking for what may not be junk. &nbsp;I'm getting slammed with spam, all of
 a sudden and it's ONLY a problem with my hotmail. &nbsp;Getting ready to just bite the bullet and abandon this 18 year old email account and stick with gmail. &nbsp;How about fixing the problem?

            <p>I've been having the same problem since they "abandoned" the smart screen filter in November (see link). It's been insane, and I finally thought I had a fix with Spark until that program also set all of my emails to go to spam, and I've been having to check
 that every day. I honestly think I might just have to switch to gmail at this point. It just isn't worth worrying that I might miss a graduate school acceptance because it's marked as spam.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I am learning Access 2007 at the moment and have started creating reports by wizard. &nbsp;The example I am following uses three fields from a table. &nbsp;When I get to the choose layout options panel I select Tabular and Landscape. &nbsp;I also ensure that the
 Adjust the field width so all fields fit on a page is checked. &nbsp;When I finish the report and preview it all the fields are on the first page, but there is a second page that is blank apart from a footing: Page 1 of 1, which spreads over the two pages. &nbsp;If
 I had more fields selected then I would need the second page.</strong></p>

            There are two possibilities here. One is that some design element has been placed outside the margins forcing a second page. The other is that you have a Report footer, which, by default, sits alone on the last page.

            It sounds like the page design width, plus whatever the right and left margins are set at, is wider than the paper size in use.&nbsp; Open the report in design view and&nbsp; first make sure that it is set to landscape format in the Page Setup ribbon.&nbsp; If so select
 Page Setup in the same ribbon to see what the margin settings are.&nbsp; Then in the report design window see what the design area extends to on the ruler bar at the top and add the two margin dimensions to that.&nbsp; If the total is above the width of the paper then
 you need to either reduce the margins or reduce the width of the design area.<br />
<br />
Reducing the margins is done in the Page Setup dialogue which you opened to check the margin settings.<br />
<br />
To reduce the page design area you'll first have to resize any controls which extend beyond the limit to which you want to reduce the design area.&nbsp; To do this click in the top ruler bar beyond the point you want to reduce the area to.&nbsp; This will select all
 controls which extend to that point.&nbsp; The control in the footer which shows the 'Page of Pages' will be one of these but there could be others such as dividing lines which the wizard has inserted.&nbsp; You can resize them all together by resizing one while all
 are still selected.&nbsp; To do this grab the handle on the centre of the right side of any of the control.&nbsp; The mouse pointer will turn to a horizontal double-headed arrow.&nbsp; You can then drag the right edge of the controls to the left so they all are within the
 new area.&nbsp; Having done this you can then drag the right edge of the design area itself (it's the white gridded part of the window) to the left to its new position.&nbsp; Unlike a control the design area doesn't have handles; you just position the mouse pointer
 over the edge of the area until you get the double-headed arrow.<br />
<br />
If any for the control's you resized are now too small for their contents you can select them individually by clicking on them and dragging the control's left edge to the left to enlarge it.<br />
<br />
Even after many years of creating Access databases I still find the report wizard useful as a starting point when creating a report, but invariably then make changes to its layout manually in design view.&nbsp; These are usually customizations, however, rather than
 correcting something like the problem you've encountered, so I'm not sure just how it's arisen in your case.<br />

<p>I'm having a look at a report I have just created through the wizard.&nbsp; The report has only two fields and just a few records and is in Tabular-Landscape view.&nbsp; The report is still going onto a second page even though there are no fields there.&nbsp; I am looking
 at the report in design view and it has set the width of the report to 28.423cm.&nbsp; The total width of the fields does not extend beyond 9cm.&nbsp; In the report footing the page count is over on the right-hand side (up to the 28.423cm mark).&nbsp; I can move the page
 count to towards the left and decrease the width of the page to within A4 landscape width which fixes the problem.&nbsp; At 28.423cm this would&nbsp;require very narrow margins for A4 landscape and would be over the limit for US letter size.&nbsp; US legal size would be
 fine.</p>
<p>If I create a blank report in design view and open page setup / columns tab, the width is only 12.335cm and the Same as Detail is checked.</p>
<p>I would have expected a report wizard to set the&nbsp;width of the page&nbsp;dependant upon the total widths of the fields and also taking into account the default page size you have selected plus margins.&nbsp; Is there any way to change the default value of 28.423cm
 as I cannot find anything in Access Options ?</p>

            I don't know of any way of changing the default width of the design area used by the wizard.&nbsp; Having just tried it myself there does seem to be an inconsistency in its operation; on the one hand the labels and bound controls are placed within the available
 page area less the margins, but the control in the page footer showing the page count is offset to the right.&nbsp; I can only assume this is defaulting to US Legal page width.&nbsp; Like you, the page number control is flowing onto a second otherwise blank page with
 an A4 page, which is of course the usual standard throughout Yurp.&nbsp; It's very simple to remedy of course by moving the control in the footer to the left and resizing the design area.&nbsp; It shouldn't happen, but it's not the end of the world.<br />

That's basically a generic error...wish it told us more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's try the generic fix for install/update problems - this will usually resolve such issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Prior Security Software?&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>What about a trial version of an antivirus program that was pre-installed when the computer was purchased? McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro?</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes remnants of prior security software will suddenly cause issues with your current antimalware program.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>A <b>
possible</b> reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Be sure you have removed <span>&nbsp;</span>all other security software from the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</span></p>

<div>If all the text vanishes, immediately press Command Z to get it back. &nbsp;Then use the Reject button to "Reject all changes in document".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am thinking that all of the text in the document is actually marked as "Deleted Text". &nbsp;If it is, it won't print.</div>

<div>If that's not it, come back and we'll try a few more things.</div>

            What is wrong with my settings. I want to print an article that is saved when I go to PRINT or PRINT PREWVIEW The item I want disappears and just a blank page shows.This is only happening on one particular saved item. All other items saved print without
 a problem. I have tried saving in a different format but still the problem persists.

            Where do I find the Review Tab ? I have clicked on everything and that doesn't show up anywhere.
<div>&nbsp;I have sent this particular page &nbsp;by email to someone else who has a MAC Computer and they were able to print this page for me.I have printed from this before without any problems. When it comes to fixing things I am computer illiterate.I need step by

<div><br />
<div>It is saved in Format WORD 97-2004 DOCUMENT (.doc)&nbsp;</div>
<div>Everything else I have saved is saved exactly the same way and they will all print without any problem?</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I am also having a similar issue as described above. &nbsp;I am using a MacBook Air and MSWord 2011 v.14.1.4.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am able to create documents and I frequently need to create newsletters so I use the templates in MSWord. &nbsp;I can see them while working on them. &nbsp;However, when I go to print, nothing is there. &nbsp;This is also the case when working on a simple MS Word document
 and I want to include a photograph. &nbsp;The photograph, or added file in a text box, always disappear.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>Kara Clayton</div>

            Hi. &nbsp;I am having the same issue as others are having. &nbsp;I went into the review and accepted all changes as John suggested above. &nbsp;When I went into the print preview, nothing showed up even though my written document was still there.
<div><br />
<div>Because I seldom create documents from a template, if someone could refresh my memory on the procedure in saving a document for printing and actual printing in a sort of list format, may be I can identify where I went wrong.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could my trying to print from the design layout view be the cause of this problem?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help.</div>

            Please do yourself a favor &amp; avoid splashing down into another user's question. If the information provided to that user doesn't help you your issue must be different in some way. It's better that you submit your own new question so it can get the attention
 &amp; focus you deserve. Mixing in with another user's situation leads to confusion.<br />
<br />
Please be sure to specify your current update level of Office as well a your version of OS X. Clearly &amp; accurately describe your particular problem in detail. I'm afraid your 2nd paragraph is not at all clear &amp; Word does not have a view known as "design layout".<br />
<br />
I'll take a wild guess that this is a document created in <b><i>Publishing Layout</i> View</b> where everything is contained in bounding boxes. If so, check in
<b>Word&gt; Preferences&gt; Print</b> to make sure that you do have a check in the boxes for
<i>Drawing Objects</i> &amp; for <i>Print background colors and images</i>. If that doesn't do the trick please do as requested above.<br />

                    <p>As mentioned, the tab key moves down one cell as opposed to horizontally when data validation is being used in that cell in Excel Online. &nbsp;Any idea if it's possible to still have it move horizontally?</p>

            <p>1. &nbsp;This happens with all Excel files that I've used online.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The data validation was created by setting three possible text entries as a dropdown menu.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;I do not use macros or VBA code in the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the three options are "x" &nbsp;"Remote" or "Not working". &nbsp;I'll type in an "x", and then press tab to go to the next column. &nbsp;Instead, I am moved down one cell in the same row. &nbsp;I am able to move horizontally after typing an entry by pressing the
 right arrow but I'd prefer the consistency of the tab key since I'm used to using it.</p>

<h2>            Windows Antimalware using up all my computer&#39;s resources</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Good Day</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently experiencing an issue with the Windows Defender's Antimalware Program since I upgraded to windows 10, every now and then it just decides to&nbsp;start working, but to a point that&nbsp;it eats up my system resources, mainly my hard drive, and as a&nbsp;result
 it slows down everything else I'm currently working on. I&nbsp;heard that if you install another anti-virus program it will take priority and&nbsp;Defender will fall away possibly sorting out the issue, however before I upgraded to windows 10 I already had Kaspersky
 Internet Security installed&nbsp;with just under a years subscription left, and now its gone! I don't mind if the Windows Defender does the same job if not better, its just this antimalware program that needs to calm down and work in the background as apposed to
 it taking over my entire&nbsp;hard drive usage. Any suggestions? Is there a way I can allocate a certain percentage of resources to it?</p>

            <p>You probably still have remnants of Kaspersky installed that may be conflicting with Windows Defender (WD). If you wish to continue using Kaspersky suggest contact Kaspersky Support and reinstall/upgrade to their latest version.&nbsp; Doing so should disable
 WD but you can manually disable WD if you wish to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            The worksheet that is to receive the data needs a formula in the appropriate cell to reference the data in the source sheet. There are many ways to do this depending on how the data is organized. You'll have to provide a more complete example, including
 worksheet names, ranges and data contents of both the original data and rthe desired result so we can offer some specific help.<br />

            A majority of the questions that involve sumproducts and sumif's only search through one column and once found, it sums the corresponding value. I want the corresponding value multiplied by another corresponding cell.&nbsp;

                    <p>I spent over 3 hours with Microsoft over the phone in two days trying to fix this problem. I got the message that my software it is unlicensed........but I installed last year and it is suppose to be running for 4 years, plus I&nbsp; put a card on file for automatically&nbsp;

<p>When I try to open any of my files, it says "Couldn't verify the Subscription" and ask me to check the internet connection which is fine ( I guess).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone went to the same problem before???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost hope calling Microsoft, because it takes FOREVER and in the end&nbsp; they didn't solve the problem, not kidding, I spent almost 3 hours for nothing....</p>

            <p>Hello Ren,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to know that your issue was not resolved by the Technical Support.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First check what type of internet connection do you use (Wired or Wireless)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are using a wireless connection then you may try to hardwire the connection. Once this is done continue with these steps as mentioned below.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Login to your Microsoft Account with your Microsoft Account Credentials and check if your Office 365 edition reflects on the My Account page. The URL for the Microsoft Account webpage is:
<a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.com/myaccount</a>. Microsoft account credentials would be your Outlook.com or Hotmail.com or Live.com email account which you have used to register for the Office 365 purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your My Account page reflects your version of Office 365 - then follow these steps to remove the remnants of Office and install Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to un-install Office remnants from your computer, you will have to install and run the Office 365 FIXIT tool. Please run the tool even if you do not have Office 365 showing in your list of programs at present ‚Äì as there may be remnants of a previous
 installation of Office on your computer. </li><li>Download / Install and run the Office 365 FIXIT tool from the following link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Once you have completed running the FIXIT follow these steps to delete the
<strong>Office 15</strong> folders.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>From Windows Explorer please navigate to the following location: <strong>C:\Propgram Files\</strong> or
<strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\ </strong></li><li>Make sure to delete the <strong>Microsoft Office 15</strong> folder. In case you are able to delete the folder then right-click on it and click on
<strong>Rename</strong>. Rename the folder as <strong>Microsoft Office 15 old. </strong>
Ignore these steps in case you are not able to find the Microsoft Office 15 folder in the above mentioned location.
</li><li>Once you have completed running the FIXIT and deleted/renamed the Office 15 folder be sure to restart your computer.
</li><li>Now try logging into the My Account page and install Office 365.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Check if you were able to download and install Office 365 successfully. Once this is completed check if Office 365 prompts you for activation. If yes, proceed with the steps on screen and activate Office 365.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, try opening your Office files and check if your issue is resolved or still persists.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the above steps and let us know if you need further assistance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

                    <span>I have this problem with WMDC and vista and my X7501 unit.&nbsp; It refuses to sync.&nbsp; No sync occurs when I attempt to do so.<br />
<br />
Here are the symptoms.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; When I connect my device to the computer via USB, I have to manually start the WMDC<br />
2.&nbsp; When I open the Mobile Device Settings, the "Change Content Sync Settings" is greyed out<br />
3.&nbsp; Pressing the sync button on the WMDC right below the status that says its connected does nothing, no error, but does nothing all the same.<br />
4.&nbsp; When I go to activesync on the device it says Attention Required, but when I tap that It brings up a window that says<br />
Result:<br />
None<br />
<br />
Last Synchronised:<br />
None<br />
<br />
Last Attempt:<br />
None<br />
<br />
When I go to the Sync Center in windows all it says is "Ready for First Sync", with a progress indicator that never starts with any progress.<br />
<br />
I have deleted the partnerships both sides and reset them up, same issue.&nbsp; If anyone has any ideas I would be most greatful. I did search the forum before posting and only found a single thread on this issue, and it had to do with the vida fitness software
 and it turns out it was not a microsoft issue.&nbsp; I am thinking that this one IS a microsoft issue so I am posting here for assistance.<br />
<br />
Further Info:&nbsp; I am using WMDC 6.1.6965<br />
My device:&nbsp; HTC Advantage X7501 with the latest updates (the update to include One Note as part of the Mobile Office)<br />
Device OS: WM6.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
