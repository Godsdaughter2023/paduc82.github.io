            <p>Sounds like a graphics driver or chipset driver. Maybe its the RAM, graphics card or the power supply. If your driver hasn't been updated since the issue update. If it has roll it back to see if it works. To do so windows plus X, select device manager, double
 click the device, select the driver tab, select driver details. You may have to check the manufactures web site as it doesn't always get the very newest right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can look in Event Viewer to see if the system has any power events with errors. On the middle top pane look for error, warning, info with a power event and double click it to see more details and</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;right click it to get to the copy as text so you can paste it here. Let me know if you see when it shuts down and if the is an error</p>

            <p>Older netbooks can only manage 1024 x 600,, and while the new Windows 8.1 update can accommodate 1024 x 600, there are no graphics drivers available for the older machines and consequently will not run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later&nbsp;netbooks will do 1366 x 768, but it is not a 'given' that some of these will have Windows 8.1 graphics drivers either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1024 x 768 resolution is a throw-back to CRT monitor days, and is good for 4:3 aspect ratio monitors, but not 16:9 or 16:10 stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your Netbook?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>SOURCE IS Kernel PnP&nbsp;basically means the error is&nbsp;being reported by the system&nbsp;plug and play. Are you projecting the display to a different display then the one attached to the netbook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you aren't using an external display try connecting one and projecting to it. Then check to see if you get the same issue.

            <p>When you try to open those apps they will get the screen resolution capabilities not the setting. So it looks like they are crashing the system which I find a little odd that it doesn't just close them. You can connect a monitor to the VGA port on the side
 of your netbook then right click the desktop choose screen resolution and select detect if the monitor isn't showing&nbsp;and finally select the option to display desktop on display 2.&nbsp; Since you are using the basic display driver you probably can't use windows
 key plus P to change the monitor but if you want to try it may be easier.</p>
<p>Since your computer comes with 1gb of ram if you didn't add any extra RAM. Your computer can only take 2GB which is enough to run W8.1 32 bit</p>

            <p>As suspected, your Samsung NC110 is one of the first generation netbooks, with support extending only as far as Windows 7 32-bit. The Intel GMA3150 graphics chip in combination with the low resolution display is not suitable for Windows 8.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want best overall performance from your machine, my advice would be to re-install Windows 7 Starter as you will get nowhere trying to get Windows 8 apps running properly..

                    I'm trying to install (reinstall actually) Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2010.

<br />
I have tried almost every installer available (from the microsoft site) that I could find:<br />
dotNetFx40_Client_setup.exe, dotNetFx40_Client_x86.exe, dotNetFx40_Client_x86_x64.exe, and dotNetFx40_Fulle_setup.exe<br />
<br />
I have also tried mounting the dvd version of the VS2010SP1 installer and using that, but no luck.<br />
<br />
I also just tried installing it via Windows Update, but that fails as well with error: Code 13EC Windows Update encountered and unkown error.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I read that this may be caused by a virus, but I have run McAfee's Stinger tool and MBAM and they didn't find anything.<br />
<br />
I've looked everywhere and tried just about everything. I can still run Visual Studio 2008, but the programs I have made with 2010 will no longer run.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />

            <p>Hi Ghilli,</p>
<p>If you have a Windows 7 DVD and can acces the Windows Recovery options, complete the following steps to cancel the pending installation:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD, select your keyboard and language options, select Repair your computer, then select the Command Prompt.&nbsp; From the Command Prompt run the following
 command:<br />
Dism /image:c:\ /get-packages</p>
<p>This will produce a list of installed updates and packages.&nbsp; They will look like this:</p>
<p>Package Identity : Package_for_KB978262~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~6.1.1.0<br />
State : Installed<br />
Release Type : Security Update<br />
Install Time : 2/11/2010 1:01 PM</p>
<p>Find the most recent one and then make a note of the package identity.</p>
<p>Then run:
</p>
<p>dism /image:c:\ /remove-package /PackageName:Package_for_KB978262~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~6.1.1.0<i> (name of update from previous step)</i></p>
<p>You will get a status of the removal until it is complete.&nbsp; Then reboot your PC.</p>
<p>If you have more than one update pending, start with the most recent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Workgroup administration</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to administer user passwords in a Windows 10 workgroup. I mean instead of changing passwords on individual computers, is it possible to make a new password, which then will be distributed to all relevant clients.</p>

            No, it is not possible. For that, you would need to implement a Windows Server domain controller with Active Directory. 
<br />
<br />Or you could setup Azure Active Directory using Office 365 and use it to manage users through the Office 365 portal.
<br />
<br />Due to the scope of your issue which relates to Windows 10 enterprise deployment, you would be best served redirecting this question to the dedicated Windows 10 forums on Technet. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itprogeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-...</a>
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience of having to suggest the re-route, but Technet has a lot of experts there that know the ins and outs of enterprise issues; especially domain/workgroup configurations for clients. So, they will be better able to provide more expert advice.

<br />AndreJA is correct from the standpoint that you would probably be best served with a Server Domain. 
<br />
<br />As a local administrator to the computers you can always log in to every machine and change the passwords and distribute accordingly.
<br />
<br />Not knowing how many computers you are supporting, this could be time consuming and lots of upkeep.

                    So I have downloaded the game Sanatorium (Slender game) and It's downloaded and installed but whenever I try to open it, it says this "The program can't start because d3dx9_31.dll is missing from your computer." I'm using Windows XP. So I tried messing
 with compatibility and changed it to Windows 98/ Windows Me and it says "Runtime error 217 at 0041B209" I don't know what to do and it's very frustrating.

<h2>            Windows 8.1&#58; Sims 3, &#34;Unable to Connect to EA Download Manager&#34;</h2>
                    <p>According to EA/Origin, it is a compatibility issue. I do not know what else to do. I was forced into 8.1 because I had to purchase a new laptop. However, I cannot get Sims 3 to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I have ran compatibility mode - nothing</li><li>I have uninstalled and reinstalled everything (Origin and games) - nothing</li><li>I have cleared cache/cookies - nothing</li><li>I have contacted EA/Origin several times - many trouble shooting methods and did nothing</li><li>Did it work on previous versions of Windows - Yes, it worked on Windows 8</li></ol>
<p>Now, one thing that boggles me is this. I was told to go to my __Install folder and find the directx folder. There is not one available. There is for the other games, but not Sims 3 or any of the expansions. Could THIS be the problem? Is there a way to fix
 this? I am at a loss and grasping straws here. This laptop is 9 days old. Thank you for your time.</p>

1. What is the exact and complete error message you get when you try to download SIMS3?<br />

There could be several reasons like EA Download Manager corrupted or some third party program causing the issue. &nbsp;According to Microsoft compatibility center SIMS3 game is compatible with Windows 8.1. So first I would suggest you to uninstall the game completely
 using this fixit so that if there is any traces of the program will get uninstalled completely.<br />

Once the program is uninstalled completely, I would suggest you to download and install the program in clean boot.

<br />
EA provided me with a few troubleshooting possibilities, then concluded it was a compatibility issue. They also said last night, "no one can help you" and that really set me off :( Others are playing Sims 3 with 8.1 so I am unsure as to what the exact issue
 is.<br />
<br />
I will attempt this clean install and update my question as to whether it works or not. Thank you for your time, very much.<br />

<br />
I would suggest you to try the following steps and see if you are able to fix the issue.<br />
a. M</span><span>ake sure sims 3 is in your disk drive.<br />
b. Go to the location where SIMS3 is installed on This PC.<br />
c. Right click the sims 3 icon and click explore<br />
d. Go to support<br />
e. Click EADM (EA Download Manager)<br />
f. Click the only thing in the folder, which is an installer for the Download Manager.<br />
g. You should be able to connect to the download manager.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</span>

</p><p>Hello Again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot and download did nothing. It also is not on a disk, as stated in my first reply it is downloaded from Origin. Still nothing on the Origin forums 6 days later, and I grow anxious as well as upset that it may come down to never playing Sims 3 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a possible compatibility issue with Origin? I don't know what to do....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:<br />
<br />
After JUST trying to start Sims 3 without the Expansions installed, I got this error (below). It must be an Origin issue. Any solutions on how to fix this?<br />

<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link suggested by <span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Kulthero777
</strong>dated <span>&nbsp;</span><strong>11/12/2010 </strong>from the following link:<br />
<a href="http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/8022219.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/8022219.page</a><br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to post in origin forums.<br />

            <p>As stated, I have posted in the Origin forums, spoken to numerous "advisors" via live chat, and NONE of them are of any help. My Origin forum post as of the 15th till now has zero responses, but my own. I am about fed up with it all. This is becoming ludicrous.
 I will try the steps you gave me from Kulthero777 and see if it works... I will update if it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, the base game works. The stuff packs and expansion packs do not. I appreciate your time very much in all this as you are way more helpful than they are for sure.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm having a very similar issue with my Windows 8.1 Laptop and The Sims 2 (with expansion packs). It keeps telling me however that the "Sims 2 Launcher has stopped working" and then makes me close out of the launcher so I can't actually get in to start playing
 the game. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is super frustrating and I have tried to use backwards compatibility multiple times as well. The game and expansions worked wonderfully on my Windows 7 laptop. But now even when I run it with Windows 7 via the compatibility settings, it has the error
 stated above. Same thing happens with Vista, Vista (service pack 2), etc. The only one i have not tried is XP but i would guess it would have the same problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried contacting EA or Origin because it seems like the issue lays in Windows.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sort-of figured out what the issue was. My computer did not have enough gHz to run the game. However, I still get the script error and multiple memory errors while playing the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that it's because Windows 8.1 is such a HUGE program I certainly hope you get your situation figured out because Origin did finally fess up that there is a comparability issue with Origin and Windows 8.1<br />
<br />
What was suggested to me, and you might try it, is bypassing the download manager and Origin by logging into it manually through the download folder. Much luck to you.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to old hard drive as slave - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bradleyberken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to old hard drive as slave</h2>
                    My hard drive failed recently in my HP laptop. I ordered a new hard drive, installed it and got it running without issue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now i am attempting to save any data i can off of my old hard drive. I have put into an enclosure and am now attempting to connect it to my laptop as a slave. This is where I hit a roadblock. The computer recognizes that i have connected the drive, but
 it will not allow me to view the files. It says the drive needs to be formatted to be used. I am pretty sure I don't want to format the drive, because I think that will erase anything i have on the drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there is a simple step I am missing to access the files? I just want to save the data i have on there if possible. (I know, i should have backed it up)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello Bradley,</p>
<p>Windows 7 often has trouble recognizing / accessing external hard drives. I solution that I and others have found to get around this problem is Aomei Partition Assistant, download from here:
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/AOMEI-Partition-Assistant-Standard-Edition/3000-18512_4-75118871.html?tag=mncol;1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/AOMEI-Partition-Assistant-Standard-Edition/3000-18512_4-75118871.html?tag=mncol;1</a>&nbsp; (use the Direct Download Link only).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once installed, open the application and navigate to the drive in question. Select the drive and then select Properties from the Partition menu. That's it. No formatting needed. Just selecting the drive and seeking its properties is enough to get the drive
 recognized by Windows 7. After viewing properties, exit the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post back here with your results and let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            Well, that didn't work. It still asks if i would like to format the drive.
<div><br />
<div>Is it because the hard drive failed? That is why it won't open? Does it have something to do with the fact that it used to be the main drive for the laptop and now it is an external slave.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hello Bradley,</p>
<p>The fact that it failed could be the reason it won't open. Even a reformat might not work. Is it a SATA drive or an IDE drive, and did you change jumpers / cable positions (IDE drive)? If its a SATA drive it doesn't matter, there are no jumpers to change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming its a SATA or correctly jumpered IDE drive, I'd urge you to perform a low-level format and 1) hope the drive comes back to life, and 2) don't count on it for anything critical, as in it would make a great swapfile drive for Windows, Photoshop, etc.
 .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to recovering your files, there are programs that will do so even from a formatted drive, but in your case I wouldn't count on much. In point of fact they may already be damaged from the hard drive failure.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's my best advice to you. Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h3> rjs_888  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t import photos from a sony cybershot camera into computer with windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have two cybershot cameras models DSC-H5 and DSC W55.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have plugged the camera into the USB port and the computer does not recognise that a camera is connected.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have read the posts dated&nbsp;29 October "connecting to Sony Cyber shot camera on acer laptop"</p>
<p>and have tried to install in-built drivers from device manager</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have selected the device manager</p>
<p>There is no Camera USB device but under USB controllers there is a Sony DSC with an explanation mark</p>
<p>I have done a right click on the yellow exclamation mark and there are two options</p>
<p>1) to browse computer for the driver - If I select this it installs it then gives and error message which says "This device can't start code 10"</p>
<p>2) search the internet for updated drivers - if I select this it says device is already installed on my machine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have also read the post on 11th December (Can't import photos from camera)'s
</p>
<p>I have followed the link for http//eusupport.sony.com/us/p/os8upgatde.pl but it doesn't allow you to put cameras in the drop down list.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also had a similar problem with my computer not recognising IPAD but apple have now fixed this by re-installing the device driver for each device and these now work - so I know the USB ports are working.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sony have reset my camera and say they think it is a windows 8.1 problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please can you help.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Sony DSC devices not working&nbsp; is indeed a Windows 8.1 problem. A fix for this will&nbsp;roll out early next year. Until then Sony devices have an option to set the device in PTP mode and access the storage. Please try that.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the Xbox is re-booted, follow the steps listed by Brad and select Restore to default in the button mapping page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, try going into your apps and launch the Xbox Accessories app directly and then select Configure. Create a profile and then test the buttons. Select Restore to default from that menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists I recommend trying a second controller or try connecting that same controller to another Xbox to the narrow the issue down.</p>

            Install "Xbox Accessories" app on your console or PC. Connect the controller and open the app. The app will let you modify button mappings. Confirm whether button mappings are correct there.

<p><span>Hi, just a quick one for a little help please….</span></p>
<p><span>I utilise the Windows My Pictures facility. I took a batch of six photographs, the size of which is indicated as18.9 MB and stored them in My Pictures.
 I selected the whole group of six and used the option to ‘send to a mail recipient’. The group appeared as an attachment and I forwarded them per email. On receipt there size was ‘huge’ and the recipient was unable to ‘receive’ them.
</span></p>
<p><span>I subsequently selected the photos individually, noted as 3.12 MB, utilised the option to reduce the size and sent it to a mail recipient where it arrived
 as 33.8 KB. I then sent all six in separate emails. </span></p>
<p><span>Could you please advise how I select a group of photos and reduce the size of the batch for transmission as an attachment to an email in smaller format.</span></p>
<p><span>Many thanks in advance,</span></p>

<p>======================================<br />
This is a Windows&nbsp;XP forum so I'm guessing you are running <br />
Windows XP?</p>
<p>When you right click a selected group of photos and choose...<br />
Send to / Mail Recipient...you should see a dialog that allows <br />
you to resize the photos.</p>
<p>If this is&nbsp;not happening...try the following steps, maybe it <br />
will restore the option:<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Run and type<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (or copy/paste):<br />
<br />
"REGSVR32 SHIMGVW.DLL"<br />
(without the quotes)(Yes, there's<br />
a space between 2 and S)<br />
<br />
Click...OK.<br />
<br />
A dialog box should report the following:<br />
<br />
"DllRegisterServer in SHIMGVW.DLL succeeded"<br />
<br />
Also there is a free Windows XP Powertoy that can be useful:</p>
<p>Go to the following link and download and<br />
install:&nbsp;&nbsp; ImageResizer.exe<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx</a><br />
(will not run on Vista)<br />
<br />
Then you can open any folder that contains<br />
images and you will have an option to resize.<br />
Just right click the selected image files and<br />
choose Resize Pictures from the menu. You<br />
can select one image or a whole group.<br />
<br />
The program will place the resized copies in<br />
the folder with your originals.<br />
(Tip: *Never* overwrite your originals)<br />
<br />
To insure that images in both portrait and<br />
landscape orientation are resized to the<br />
same dimensions...go to...Advanced...<br />
and enter the largest number in both fields.<br />
IOW...for 600x800...enter 800 in both fields.<br />
<br />
(Tip: even if you resize the Photos to the same<br />
(original) dimensions...the file size will be greatly<br />
reduced.)<br />

<h2>            Cannot run any Windows 10 troubleshooters via system settings in Update and Recovery.</h2>
                    <p>I am not able to run any of the troubleshooters in system settings.&nbsp; I get a message box that says windows cannot accessed specified path and I may not have permission to do so.&nbsp; I have never had this problem before but I am thinking the reason is because
 I end task Explorer.exe in task manager and the reason I did this was to fix all my icons on desktop not showing up pictures or correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this fix which involved a couple short command prompt codes and it worked great and it was suggested by a MS tech.&nbsp; I dont like doing this stuff and I have a VIP support package with Microsoft and I guess I will have to contact them.&nbsp; I am quite certain
 I am administrator.&nbsp; I never had a problem doing troubleshooters before.&nbsp; I looked at permissions for the file in C:\windows\system32\msdt.exe but I dont see the file at all.&nbsp; I see msdtc.exe but its not the same and while idle hovering it says its empty.&nbsp;
 I cant get into these files because I dont have permission and never could actually.&nbsp; I know how to add permission but it is always greyed out and never lets me add myself which by the way I see two of my names one is admin and one is user. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont see or notice any other problems except maybe some missing tray icons in the taskbar tray.&nbsp; I ran sfc scannow and found no errors.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; It seems I have always had a administrator or permission problem but never really noticeable
 until now while trying to do a windows store apps troubleshooter to clear cache for live tiles.</p>

<p>Ironically enough the fix for me was to just restart my system.&nbsp; I do not know the exact cause but it just seem to be a minor glitch of some sort.&nbsp; I was about to contact Microsoft support through my VIP premium support service for help but I just followed
 some basic steps and ultimately just restarted my system.&nbsp; I do not restart my system a lot I guess because I use it pretty much for 18 hours a day even when I am sleeping.&nbsp; I tend to just use sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply and concern though.&nbsp; much appreciated.</p>

<p>My privacy settings are set to BLOCK my friends list from being viewable. I have discovered that even though it says BLOCKED in the settings, my friends list is viewable. All of my other friends who BLOCK their friends list from being viewable are having
 the same issue. Why is our privacy being compromised?</p>
<p>Why can't requesting a friend be an accept/decline issue like it was on the 360? The "followers" thing is ridiculous and needs to be an option in the privacy settings. Not everyone wants thier xbox live gaming experience to be a social media platform!!!!</p>

<p>PLEASE FIX THE PRIVACY ISSUES! I have confirmed that my friends list is BLOCKED in settings, but still viewable by several of my friends. This is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Hey there, Onyx</p>
<p>I had taken a look at your friends list on your profile, but could not see any of your friends. So I am a little puzzled with this one. Maybe you have set it so only your friends can see your friends list, but it is blocked for other people that are not
 on your friends list. </p>
<p>The people who follow you add you to their friends list, however you will need to add them back in order for them to be on your friends. For example, if your not my friend, then you can not see my friends list. If you add me, you class me as a friend. So
 I will be able to see your friends list etc (Or anything you have set to friends only). You still won't be able to see my friends list, because I have not added you.
</p>
<p>If you did not want others to follow you, or a particular person, then you could always do what I do. Which is block them. Mainly do that to, who I think, are students from Schools I work/volunteer in while in University. However, if you are wanting to make
 any suggestions to Xbox/Microsoft, you can make suggestions through their Xbox <a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
User Voice website.</a> This is where the developers/product team are always looking though the suggestions submitted by the Xbox community.
</p>
<p>I have also had a look at one of my friend's friends list, who has blocked their list from everyone, and I can not see his friends at all. So I can only think that this could be a setting that you may have changed.
</p>
<p>When you changed your settings, did you click on the option&nbsp;for friends to see your friends list?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope some of this information helps, <br />
Regards, </p>
        </p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. My setting has always been to completely block my friends list from being viewable to anyone. I have double checked it multiple times, and it is still set to blocked. I had 3 friends in a party last night, and we all knew we had
 our friends list set to blocked, but we were able to view each others friends list. I even had one of them completely unfriend me, and I completely unfriended them, and we were still able to see who the other was friends/following. It is blocked on the 360,
 still, but not on the One. I will definitely check out the website you suggested. Thank you for your response.</p>

<p>Just an FYI, SunkNath, since we are not connected on xbox live as friends or followers, I pulled up your profile and your friends list WAS viewable to me. It shows the 242 Friends and Games you are following.</p>
<p>So I think something is up and this needs to be fixed asap. I am very picky about my privacy and I hope Xbox can resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Hey there, Onyx</p>
<p>I have tried to view your friends list, but had no luck with it. It keeps displaying "They are not following any people or games" to me when I view your friends list on your Xbox One.
</p>
<p>I will pass this on though, but please remember that I am not a Microsoft/Xbox employee. Only a community member like you.

    <title>Sticky Keys on Surface Book 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pranav.uchil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sticky Keys on Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>So I spilled&nbsp;soda on my surface book 2 and I immediately&nbsp;started tow ipe the keyboard to get rid of any soda on top.</p>
<p>After a few hours of not using the keyboard I switched it on and all the keys work fine...but a few are quite sticky such that it's harder to press down and doesn't&nbsp;'click' like the rest of the keys.</p>
<p>It's getting really annoying and I was wondering if there are anyways to safely remove any stickiness from the keys so it goes back to how it was before.</p>

<p>You would have to remove the keys and clean them. There are special tools for doing that.</p>
<p>This company sells replacement keys and has installation videos so you can see how the keys are assembled. https://www.quikfixlaptopkeys.com/</p>
<p>I don't think Microsoft will service your keyboard. You can check with them. If you have the extended warranty they would probably offer you a refurbished replacement.</p>
<p>Your best bet if the keys don't improve might be to visit a local PC repair and see if they can help. Be prepared to buy replacement keys if any are damaged when removing them.</p>

<p><span>Two suggestions:</span></p>
<p>https://www.tenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/109012-1803-issue-hybrid-laptop-discrete-gpu-connected-display-3.html</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>download the windows media creation tool</span><br />
<br />
<span>execute and it will update</span><br />
<br />
<span>when it proceeds to 'creating media', disconnect from the internet and should prevent issue with trying to update drivers and will advance past the 49% mark where it gets stuck</span><br />
<span>============</span></p>
<p><span>I had the same issue. I have an Alienware 15 R3. Failing with the same error as all of you at 49%.</span><br />
<span>But... my husband also has the same model and his update went through fine.</span><br />
<br />
<span>So it led me to wonder why?! the answer - He took "all the Alienware junk" off his and I hadn't!!</span><br />
<br />
<span>So I uninstalled </span><strong>Alienware </strong><strong>update</strong><span> and
</span><strong>digital delivery</strong><span> utility and just left Alienware command centre and Alienware onscreen display installed.
</span><br />
<br />
<span>I also uninstalled the latest Nvidia driver, put my laptop into airplane mode and restarted. I let Nvidia put its basic driver back on and waited for everything else to load on my system (leaving airplane mode on). I don't personally feel this
 step is necessary, but if the above fails for you, then you can try it.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I then re-ran the windows update and it worked!!</span><br />
<br />
<span>So, personally I don't feel this is a microsoft fail, I think the common denominator of all the people with problems is Alienware, and those of us who have that
</span><strong>Alienware update</strong><span> and </span><strong>digital delivery</strong><span> installed.

    <title>Adding a wireless speaker to homegroup network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodlewis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding a wireless speaker to homegroup network</h2>
                    <p>I have a Panasonic NE3 wireless speaker. I get it to paired to the router. When I look at "devices and printers" it is shown with a green circle and a white triangle in it. The basic network map is ok. If I look at "full network map", sometimes it is shown
 as "not able to be connected"&nbsp; with the other network elements above. Sometimes the message is "cannot discover any computer or device" and nothing is shown.</p>
<p>What does the green circle mean? Why&nbsp;does the full&nbsp;network map not always show the devices?</p>
<p>I have tried Network Discovery and tried disabling the firewall.</p>
<p>What am not doing correctly?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query to Microsoft Community. We are glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is the speaker directly connected to the router?
</span></li><li><span>Have you tried connecting the speakers to a single computer and then sharing the speakers on HomeGroup?
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the speaker is connected to a computer directly, I would suggest you to try running the troubleshooter, as it will detect and diagnose the actual cause of the problem.

            <p>Hello Anshul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re question 1, The speaker is wirelessly connected to the router. It links to the router successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re 2, I only have the one computer. It is possible to connect directly to the laptop but then, of course, that connection replaces the normal one to the internet so is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already&nbsp;run all the troubleshooting utilities to no effect.</p>
<p>When I select "full map" in ..\Network and Sharing Centre, sometimes I see the speaker with its green circle etc. and sometimes I don't. At present It is not there so I can't send you a screen shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that does bother me and might be the problem is that the router and computer security is WPA2-Personal but the speaker security is only WEP. I have just&nbsp;seen on the web a site which says this cannot work.

            <p><span>Hello Rod, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated with this information.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a diagnostic step, I would just suggest you to try connecting the speakers to another computer/network with WPA2-Personal security and check if it is compatible on another network or not. But, if the problem
 still persists, then the&nbsp;issue clearly lies with the security difference between these devices.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, if you are comfortable, you may try changing the security of the router and the computer from WPA2-Personal to WEP. Although, we being technicians would not suggest you to change these settings, as
 this may result as a breach in security. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do get back and let us know if this information helps you, if not, we will be glad to help you further. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you. </span></p>

            <p>Hello Anshul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered the reason for my problem and I will give some information in case it helps others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speaker uses WEP security as standard and as a receiving only device this level seems reasonable. When I was having trouble connecting I read on the web that one cannot mix security types. Even when I changed the security type it did not help.</p>
<p>The problem turned out to be that an Apple software element relating to iTunes called "Bonjour" was disabled on my system. I discovered this when I went into "preferences", "sharing" and got a message to that effect. I then enabled that software and immediately
 the speaker appeared as available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've no idea how Bonjour was disabled in the first place. For reasons I don't understand, the speakers (I now have a second one which installed in minutes) do not appear on the network map. I previiously&nbsp;saw evidence of the first one intermittently but never
 properly connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does show that in certain circumstances, security types can be mixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thread can end now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards </p>
<p>
</p><p>Rod</p>

<p>This isn't a simple question to answer unfortunately, the company who makes these games has to go through your region's laws and make sure everything is by the book. Sometimes the content they make is denied by whatever sort of laws you have in your country
 and they don't release it. There's literally 100's of things they'd need to do before releasing content in another region. It's not as simple as flipping a switch.</p>

<p>This is not the case. The Kinect Party game is available for all scenes, but most of the scenes included in the "Try me" mode for a few seconds and then invited to unlock the full game. But the DLS is not available. Also, when the game came out, the DLS
 were available for 2-3 days, then were removed and are no longer available.</p>
