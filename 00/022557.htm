<h2>            Abbreviations after date&#47;day numbers </h2>
                    
<p>When I type a date, I like the st, nd, rd or th after the day number to be normal size, not reduced type raised above the line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I turn off the facility which automatically shows those abbreviations in small type above the line?</p>

<h2>            How do I get colored themes in the Skype desktop app&#63;</h2>
                    I have the Skype desktop app and I can choose a theme easily, but there's no option anywhere to change the color that I can find, even though I'm quite sure that's supposed to be a current feature. Is it, and if so, where can I find it?

            <p>Hello harmon_cantillan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having using the Zune software.&nbsp; We understand how important the software is to maximizing your phone and would be happy to help you resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description it sounds like there is something on the computer that is blocking the software from opening.&nbsp; I would like to first verify that this issues occurs when the phone is both connected to the computer and when you try to open it without
 the phone connected.&nbsp; If you get an error message or code of any kind, please let us know the exact error you see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a couple of things you can try that may resolve the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please check you computer for updates, <a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate</a>.&nbsp; Please install any updates found.&nbsp; If you are notified that the PC is up to date, look for a link that reads "check online for updates from Microsoft update".&nbsp; Run and install any updates found and then restart
 your computer and try launching again.</li><li>If you still have the software crashing issue, try installing the following <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718</a>.&nbsp; This .Net framework is a required component to run the Zune software and issues with this can prevent use of the software.&nbsp; Once you have installed this, try to start the software again.</li><li>If you still cannot get the software to launch the next thing to try is disabling any anti-virus, malware, spyware or adware software running on your computer.&nbsp; We have seen this type of software conflict with Zune's ability to launch and run.</li><li>The final thing I would suggest at this time is to create a new Windows user profile on your computer,
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a>.&nbsp; After you have created this new profile, restart your computer and sign into the new profile.&nbsp; Try to launch the software via this new profile.</li></ul>
<p>Let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<h3> jim_282  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Is Microsoft Going to &#34;Force&#34; New Features On Customers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In this article "Here's how Microsoft plans to push new features to Windows 10 business users" which is here:<br />
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-microsoft-plans-to-push-new-features-to-windows-10-business-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-microsoft-plans-to-push-new-features-to-windows-10-business-users/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The most straightforward piece: Consumers running Windows 10 Home will be on the Consumer Branch (CB) and get all Windows 10 security updates and new features installed via Windows Update as soon as Microsoft greenlights them."</p>
<p>
</p><p>and this</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Contacts of mine previously revealed that Microsoft would not allow Windows 10 users on the CBB to delay taking new features indefinitely. The way Microsoft plans to enforce this, my contacts said, was to prevent CBB users from getting new security updates
 if they tried to delay feature deployment past a set period of time."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this true? Is Microsoft actually going to "force" new features down the throats of customers, whether they want them or not? I'm hoping this information is just lies written by a Microsoft hater. Companies can't force their vision on their customers.
 The customers have to choose it, or they won't support the company by buying their products. Companies that don't "serve" the customers what the customers want, don't survive long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of the above is true, I hope those at Microsoft wake up soon and fix it. Please tell me it's not true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>It's true. &nbsp;Microsoft is trying to avoid the problem where different people have Windows in different states of update - ideally every Windows is the same - all updates applied, all features present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Microsoft's update system is far from perfect and each update brings with it a small risk of causing problems. &nbsp;Traditionally, IT staff validate each change against test systems to represent the hardware and software they've deployed,
 and see if it all functions as intended before releasing it to the enterprise. &nbsp;IT staff can still do this, but, they can't delay forever these updates, so whether it works with their hardware and software or not, eventually, they will need to apply it to
 continue to get future updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly there will be some back and forth and any show-stopper issues should be resolved. &nbsp;This is the whole reason why Consumer/Home versions will have no choice in the matter. &nbsp;They are the ones who will be the first to validate the updates before corporate
 ever sees it.</p>

            <p>Let's All Be Reasonable People,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, MS has to cut its continual support of all things in all varieties for all the myriad groups and the news hawks are tweaking the hot spots for the sensationalism value that geeks will raise about things that are coming. MS is just coming off a bad
 trip down the road of trying to go with its own lead and then trying to change courses so drastically that it over corrected. The success of the Apple business&nbsp;model has changed the way the game is played, If you go Apple, you go Apple Way. Period, end of
 story. You pay continuously going the Apple Way in a lot of dollars every week. That far surpass the amounts MS gets for Windows and the once in a while trickle from all us users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I truly hate what is being forced down the throat of consumers but no surviving company can avoid it. You can stand up to the Apple model if you wish but Apple has $190B cash to beat you down with, if it so choose so MS and all others had to change. The
 model of Amazon and Apple is the ship that will take us into the inferno so thank all those who paid all that premium to have the Apple logo on their way overpriced item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some ways, the market will correct itself as the consumers revolt enough against some items and as the East with its voracious size shift the economic paradigm far away from the west. Meaning: Change is coming and it will stop for no one.</p>

            <p>The other issue that makes Microsoft force updates to Windows 10 is that they've changed to a rolling release model, which is why Microsoft says "this is the last version of Windows". &nbsp;Windows 10 will evolve over time, changing in small steps, instead of
 releasing a separate Windows 11, or Windows 12. &nbsp;It will always be Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Check your attitude at the door, please.&nbsp; During the testing cycle this is not just typical, but expected--new features that they want to include aren't going to get tested if they don't "nudge" people to do it.&nbsp; When we joined the Windows Insider Program,
 we all agreed to provide certain statistics and telemetry to Microsoft in support of the testing and validation process.&nbsp; I actually read the license agreement, and nothing about what they collect is out of bounds for a group of beta testers as far as I'm
 concerned.&nbsp; If you can't handle that, then that's tough on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for post-RTM?&nbsp; That makes sense to me too.&nbsp; We, as the beta testers, have gotten certain things before they would've been greenlit for public consumption--in fact, the whole of Windows 10 fits that description!&nbsp; I can only imagine that before they
 release other new features for the public, they'll go through the same processes, only it'll be invisible to the consumer.&nbsp; (I'd actually be interested to know if the Windows Insider Program, with advance copies of things, will continue past RTM.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also makes sense that for the world of the average consumer, these would install automatically.&nbsp; Most of the folks testing out Windows 10 represent your more technical crowd, not your average consumer, some of whom still interpret the word "byte" as a
 verb, meaning "to cut with one's teeth."&nbsp; It makes sense to me that there should be a single, standard version of Windows, with the same features and functions, to make it easier to provide support to the masses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't like Windows 10, stick with Windows 7.</p>

            <p>As Brandon says, there are two distinct issues here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, as Insiders we signed up to automatic updates on our test machines - and some of the features we've seen, we won't like.&nbsp;
<strong>Tough</strong>!&nbsp; If you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.&nbsp; By all means comment civilly to MS about it but rant?&nbsp; Let's be adult about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a separate matter, Windows as it has evolved is a far cry from the DOS of the 1980s that arrived on a couple of 5.25" floppy discs.&nbsp; Supporting it on the many different hardware set ups out in the world now must be a nightmare and version control is the
 only hope they have of the whole thing not crashing round their ears.&nbsp; So, if you've got, for example, the Home version, it'll be exactly the same as the guy next door other than things driven by specific hardware.&nbsp; The same effectively applies to the other
 structures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider myself a competent user - but no more than that.&nbsp; I find it tiresome when an update turns up at just the wrong moment and wants to reboot my machine so I generally try to anticipate updates and trigger the install myself rather than waiting for
 the automatic action.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the odd occasion that I get caught out, I live with it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say that I dislike the "big brother" cloud based philosophy that we seem to be moving to.&nbsp; I don't need my data synced over several machines, so things like OneDrive will be largely ornamental on my machine, and yes, I'd rather they were not present
 - but I accept that I'm stuck with it.&nbsp; I normally find it too difficult to dig out exactly what is being changed by updates but I don't consider myself important enough that anyone would be that interested in what I'm doing, so most updates go through on
 the nod.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And as for post-RTM?&nbsp; That makes sense to me too.&nbsp; We, as the beta testers, have gotten certain things before they would've been greenlit for public consumption--in fact, the whole of Windows 10 fits that description!&nbsp; I can only imagine that before they
 release other new features for the public, they'll go through the same processes, only it'll be invisible to the consumer.&nbsp; (I'd actually be interested to know if the Windows Insider Program, with advance copies of things, will continue past RTM.)<br />

<p>The forced updates won't be just the normal "windows update" we're all used to. &nbsp;It's going to be NEW BUILDS every 4 months, called "Current Branch". &nbsp;Each new build will be the equivalent of a service pack, but not just an update rollup. &nbsp;Because there
 will be no Windows 11, 12, etc., Windows will be incrementally changed via these builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the Insider Program will continue past RTM.</p>

            <p>To all those who have Shown REASONABLE Concern on this Topic, I say,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are all adults here, right? We should have more than elementary school knowledge that MS cannot keep a fresh string of beta testers in-house so, speaking personally, I like the idea of being a guinea pig who can get in or get out at my own choosing. I
 LOVE innovation and new knowledge. Yes, I saw Dos on a couple of disks (and we loved it because it was great progress over C/PM) and even challenged the big mainframes that I was working on at the time(IBM 370/168 and such). I did like even Vista a bit at
 first but I have to admit to hating 8.0 and 8.1 did not do it for me either but I did pop for it so I could test out touch as well as tiles. That stated, I do recognize it all as PROGRESS! MS learned from the 8 mistakes, ha ha ha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we are at the revolutionary stage, no more major overhauls and that is a good thing, in fact, GREAT! MS can concentrate on making sure a few good features get out there that are needed and have been&nbsp;fully tested by a good (and cooperative/willing) Beta
 team and the world of computing is all the better for it. If you want the big budget add-ons, pay as you go, that is what is the success of the Apple Store and the Google Play. Pay for what you want, don't make me pay for it also. I do not want the games,
 et al&nbsp;and do not want to pay for it to be included in the basic Windows budget that raise my price.</p>
<p>
</p><p>General Motors brought out the concept of obsoleting prior editions to force people to buy the new year's models and look at the messes that have come to past. Ford came out with a Mustang that was initially a fantastic thing but rather than make some fine
 tuning changes, they took it to the dogs year after year. Sadly some US auto companies today still use that tactic as they lose market share like crazy. Toyota came out with a Camry, Corolla and others that they tweaked and now those are outstanding works
 of automotive success, Jony Ives be danged. I wish MS the same Toyota type success, that is, build something good and then tweak it as the innovations and needs arise leaving the parts that are not broken and loved by the user public alone except for minor
 tweaks, even those tweaks should be almost transparent except for a nice little note to all that additional goodies are now available for their choosing if they so desire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To MS, I say, make this pony run, continue to let me do some of your test rides and give me an ear to my seasoned concerns so that we can all have an OS worthy of all this effort. MS, I appreciate that you have allowed the ranters to have their say, thanks.
 It is all for the better but, at the end of the day, the good and reasonable voices should win out and the rant only crew can take their rants elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck and keep me in.</p>

            <p>By all means, I don't mind being a guinea pig on the computers I don't need to do important work on. &nbsp;The laptop I have Windows 10 on would not be used at all if it were not testing Windows 10, but my experience with Windows 10 on that one device makes me
 sure that I don't want it on any of the computers I rely on, but I will continue to stay in the insider program - may not participate in the forum much though, after release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a willing guinea pig - that's what we all agreed to be as part of the insider thing. &nbsp;Informed consent. &nbsp;We understand that it will be broken/unfinished, lose data, have telemetry, etc. &nbsp;My concerns are for the regular mom and pop types who are going
 to be <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unwittingly </span>guinea pigs. &nbsp;The Windows 10 advertising pop-ups on Windows 7 and 8.1 computers don't say "Be an early adopter and help us iron out the bugs" - it implies that Windows 10 will be ready for reliable
 use, and I just don't see that as being possible in 6 short weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after release, Microsoft will have internal alpha testing, Insiders will do beta testing, and Home users will be the equivalent of RC testers, and Enterprise will be getting the fully vetted updates.</p>
<p>As for ranters - Microsoft can benefit from reading rants, even if rants don't dictate their design choices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;At the very least it gives them a heads-up for the potential harsh criticism the OS may receive at release, so that they are either prepared to respond to the criticisms (e.g. clear up misconceptions, or explain the benefits of the design choice they made).</p>
<p>
</p><p>People are becoming much more concerned about privacy and how their data are used, expect things to "just work", and actually, there is a trend where the average computer user is less technically savvy than they were in the last generation. &nbsp;It used to be
 that we learned and grew with the computers, but now people are born immersed in computers and they have no comprehension of what is under the hood. &nbsp;Someone like you, who worked under the hood knows and understands things that someone playing with a smartphone
 16 hours a day would have no clue about - and they don't really need to know that stuff. &nbsp;How a microwave works, why the sky is blue, etc - all these things are just taken for granted, and that's ok. &nbsp;The only downside is that when things go wrong, this type
 of person who has been purely a user and never a programmer or tinkered with the insides of a computer, or did troubleshooting, editing config.sys and autoexec.bat, system.ini, the registry, or make batch files, or know any dos commands - those people just
 expect it to work, and it's those people that I don't think Windows 10 is ready for.</p>

<h2>            The letter &#34;z&#34; randomly gets typed into the file I am working on.</h2>
                    <p>I have the weirdest occurrence in Microsoft Office 2010. Every so often, the letter "z" randomly gets typed into the file I am working on. Sometimes even when the file is in the background. I switch over, and there is a letter "z" that I don't remember typing
 in 30 seconds ago before switching over to browser or whatever else I might be doing simultaneously as working on my word or excel files. And no, the letter z is not stuck in my keyboard. Has anybody ever come across this problem? Do you have any clue what
 could be going on? Any help is appreciated, thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we proceed, I would require more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Is the issue specific to Word/ Excel documents? What happens with other Office and non- Office applications?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do you frequently use Control button + Z to undo changes in the documents you’re working on?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try opening the issue caused Word/Excel files in other computer and verify how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, you may refer to the suggestions from the below Microsoft article to repair Office 2010 installation and check if it helps resolve the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac Calendar loses categories sync</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">second</span> time in the past few months I've had my calendar lose sync to its categories.</p>
<p>This is expressed by:</p>
<p>1. Categories window (Edit Categories) no longer shows my personally created categories</p>
<p>2. Categories pane on the left <strong>does</strong> show the old categories, but
<strong>without</strong> any colour to them</p>
<p>3. Calendar events with the previous categories lost their colour and are displayed in white</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check the OWA client, the categories are actually <strong>still there</strong> with their correct colours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the latest Outlook for Mac version - ver. 15.31 (170216)</p>
<p>Also, to be clear - I only use 2 Outlook clients: Outlook for Mac, Outlook on Android. (Categories management is only done through the Mac)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did it happen to anyone else?</p>
<p>Is there any way to recover from this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Eran</p>

            Hi Eran,<br />
<br />
To better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm the following details:<br />
1. Based on my experience, the issue might be related to the corrupted Outlook for Mac profile. Thus, I suggest you
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new profile</a> so all the emails along with categories can be synced again from OWA to the Outlook for Mac client.
<strong>Note:</strong> please don’t delete the old profile in case of data loss.<br />
2. Did the issue occur right after upgrading to Outlook for Mac 15.31(170216)?<br />
3. May I confirm how you fixed the issue when it occurred for the first time?<br />
4. Does the issue occur to other users who are using the same version of Outlook for Mac client?<br />
5. Could you upload some relevant screenshots about the symptoms you described for our further analysis?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your updates.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sam<br />

<p>gartorcode,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't mention if the query is the report's record source or not. If it is, you can use a simple control source like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Sum([Your Numeric Field Here])</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the record source and query are different, you can use:</p>
<p>=DSum("[Your Numeric Field Here]", "[Your Query Name Here]")</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also use a subreport that is based on your query. The subreport would only have the Report Footer section with a Sum of the required field.</p>

<h2>            Word 2003 with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have browsed through what others have to say on using Word 2003 with Windows 8 and 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 8.1, Home edition (definitely <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> the Professional edition), 64 bit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Word and Access from the MS Office Professional 2003 suite.&nbsp; Access works beautifully.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2003, however, did not work well at all, and after trying the available compatibility options, I still had no success and it behaved so badly that I had to uninstall it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see others saying that their Word 2003 works fine in Windows 8 and 8.1&nbsp; Can anyone help me with suggestions or a way to fix whatever is causing my Word 2003 to behave so badly?&nbsp; I sorely miss it.&nbsp; (I do have Office 2013, but it can't compare to the functionality
 of Word 2003).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone, any suggestions?&nbsp; Please?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I will try this, hopefully, within the next week (and after I set a Restore Point.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I recall (it was over a year ago that I tried my install as described above), not only did Word not work properly, the whole system seemed to become unstable - shutting down, display becoming weird, and other strange disturbances.&nbsp; After uninstalling
 Word, things stabilized, thank heavens.&nbsp; If you have any thoughts on what I just described, I'd be happy to hear them, especially before I go forward with trying to install again.</p>
<p>

            <p>Another possible cause of problems with Word might be a third-party addin. Some third-party addins, especially certain Bluetooth ones, are known to interfere with Word. If you run Word in safe mode and there are no problems, try disabling any third-party
 addins, then re-enabling them one at a time and using Word for a while before re-enabling the next one until you find the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that, we'd need to know more about the particular circumstances that give rise to the problems and what error messages or errant behaviour you might see.</p>

<p>In all that&nbsp;cases, the&nbsp;hardware (USB-OTG&nbsp;port) was either dirty (short circuiting) or broken.

    <title>N86 GPS problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newandre  say:</h3>
<h2>            N86 GPS problem</h2>
                    I have a problem with GPS on Nokia N86:<br />
<br />
It has a huge problem to get a connection with sattelities. It is not a Ovi Maps fault because I&nbsp; have checked it with other applications. Even if it connect with sattelites, it works inaccurately and keeps breaking the conection. The software is up to date.
 It made a test with Nokia LD-3W via bluetooth and it works perfect. Is it possible that integrated GPS is broken? Does anybody knows the solution?

<p>The N86 8MP is a great phone that is let down by it's poor GPS performance. It sometimes engages whilst indoors but&nbsp;I have just been out in the back garden twice and the GPS just refuses to engage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GPS location stamp worked very well for some photos that I took yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hoping that this is not a hardware problem that can be fixed by firmware.</p>

<p>I have same problem with my N86. Seems it started when I did the latest firmware update, before this the GPS function was working fine (but other functions didn't, like realplayer). Hope they will fix in the next Firmware update.</p>

<p>Because if it is an international problem i cant believe that nokia doesnt know about it.</p>

    <title>How can I disable&#47;workaround the &#34;64-bit version of Office - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I disable&#47;workaround the &#34;64-bit version of Office 2010 installed with 32-bit version of Office&#34; installer error&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have office 2010 64-bit already installed, I installed Office 2007 32-bit at a later date along side Office 2010, and I also installed Sharepoint 2007 Designer.&nbsp; I just uninstalled 2007, but I need to keep Sharepoint 2007 Designer.&nbsp; Unfortunately I just
 ran the Office 2010 installer to add a few features, but it doesn't work anymore.&nbsp; It gives the error that it can't start the installer because i can't install 64-bit versions of office 2010 with 32-bit versions of office (I have had 64-bit and 32-bit products
 running on my computer for some time now).</p>
<p>How do I disable this warning, is there a quick workaround?&nbsp; I just want to add in a few developer features.</p>
<p>Looks like one workaround is to uninstall all 2007 products, install 2010 products, then reinstall 2007 products.&nbsp; That's alot of work to do every time i want to modify the 2010 install.. can this warning just be disabled?</p>

    <title>N97 lifesaver or NOT&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> towelie375  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 lifesaver or NOT&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>People...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I was driving on the highway as I became witness to a heavy carcrash happening in front of me. The car was a total loss, the engine was burning (we managed to extinguish it) and the four occupants were injured of which two severely. Those two went
 into shock and were bleeding quite profusely. As we were giving first aid, I also tried to call the emergency services with my N97....&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me OVER TWO MINUTES to be able to initiate a call. I even had to reboot the phone. Can you imagine that? And no, I kept the phone clean from the previous upgrade to firmware 11. I'm still awaiting the firmware 12.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can't even rely on this phone in emergency situations. Two minutes can mean life or death in certain situations, luckily not this time, but what if they had life-threatening injuries?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sucks if you can't rely on a smartphone, which is still really first of all still a phone, used to make -calls-. The N97 even struggles in performing the simplest of tasks... dialling a three-digit number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOKIA: RELEASE THE FIRMWARE FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST FOR A HAPPY FEW. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I agree...the N97 is a huge disappointment in terms of functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GPS that won't get a fix for minutes, loses itself and thinks it's minutes behind where you actually are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Autorotation that resets the internal compass and is SO sensitive that when you pick up the phone it takes so long for it to figure out to display portrait or landscape that the call rolls over to voicemail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-existent transition effects (maybe they'll be in v40 firmware!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buggy software (Facebook!) that gets stuck in an error loop in Offline mode or forces you to have to reboot the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having to remove the battery to end a call if you use the "swipe to answer call" feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flash errors on running programs due to the homescreen widget interrupts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The totally moronic behavior of switching your email to C: drive when you run a back-up or connect to a PC for any reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of C: drive memory in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The very slow menu system if you add more than 11 applications in a folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not having native mode HTML language in the Messaging application.&nbsp; Only being able to pull TWO (2) email accounts on a timed basis in Messaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ovi Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps...I'm describing behavior AFTER doing a FACTORY reset and installing v12 firmware!!</p>

<p>I wonder what could be causing the phone to take so long to initiate a call? Can you detail exactly where and why it takes so long, for example does it freeze up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has it been like this since day one or did it happen sometime later?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm on v11 and had no issues like that at all, it behaves like any other phone.</p>

<p>It is funny.. but I think many Nokia products have a peril sensor.. I have regularly had Nokia phones fail to make calls or connect to the internet JUST when I needed them to.. once whilst trying to call the police too when a fight broke out around me (at
 a bus stop!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Damn.. is this train the fastest one to catch, or should I wait for the one 5 minutes later? I know I'll check online, open browser, open bookmark.. hang HAAANG.. hang hang hang.. try again.. haaaang.. got a minute to go, try a reboot.. no not working..
 haaang.. train leaves.. try again whilst sitting on the other train.. "the train you are on is the slow one, dum dum" GAAAGH!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was at a train station night before last when something very odd happened.. about 20-30 photographers suddenly appeared (this about 12:30 in the morning on the way home from work).. they started taking pictures of a freight train that was slowing pulling
 into the station.. Huh, funny, yet dedicated train spotters I laughed.. but then I saw what was on the freight train.. hmm.. interesting.. I'll take a photo..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pulled out the N97, opened the cover.. it popped up some dialog box telling me it just needed to do something and it could take a few minutes.. I missed what the box actually said it was going to be doing.. needless to say although the freight train parked
 for about 1.5 mins.. I still missed taking a photo!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever tech Nokia have that is able to sense urgency, they MUST patent it soon. Their urgency driver must have a bug that causes it to eat idle CPU... in the correct hands however, that technology could lifesaving.. sadly, not on some Nokias :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the photographers thought I was a bit odd muttering and swearing at my phone.. he's probably right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd always put it down to network issues.. but the fact that the device usually starts to work the moment the urgency has passed has always made me wonder!</p>

<p>Cpitchford: that all sounds so very familiar...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as for the calls hanging... there are times where this phone works really good, but they're very rare. I don't know what causes this fluctuation but it's really really annoying me.</p>

<p>Is the phone running slow in general, if so whatever is causing that is probably causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love to find a common cause as to why some peoples N97's are running poor and others (such as mine) are running well.&nbsp; I suspect that connected widgets like accuweather or facebook may be part of the cause for some people.</p>

            Sometimes the phone runs fast, albeit most of the time it does not. I gave up on widgets long time ago.. the only widget that's running is an RSS feed. That's it.&nbsp;

<p>Very odd, so there's nothing else running in the background?&nbsp; The RSS widget is fine, use that myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corrupted mass memory or memory cards have been known to make phones perform slowly.&nbsp; This happened to my 5800 and I had to format the card to sort it out.</p>

<h2>            Screen flicker n hangups.</h2>
                    
<p>i had my phone left for charge overnight. When I woke up the Green indicator was on. I disconnected and tried to start and phone and I couldn't. I held the on/off for sometime and phone rebooted.</p>
<p>Evening: when I clicked on any icon to start the programme it didn't start. Then I tried again and screen started flickering. All icons on home screen also.</p>
<p>Then I tried launching another software n it kinda started&nbsp;and then flickered between main screen and the software.</p>
<p>Has anyone faced this? Is this a hardware or software related?</p>

    <title>Outlook Sync Calendar and Contacts across Windows and Android Devices - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook Sync Calendar and Contacts across Windows and Android Devices</h2>
                    <p>Devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 laptop</li><li>Android phone (Samaung Galaxy)</li><li>android tablet (Samaung Galaxy)</li></ul>
<p>Software/apps</p>
<ul>
<li>Outlook 365 on laptop (standalone, not part of an Enterprise Network)</li><li>Gmail for email</li><li>CompanionLink and Deja Office to sync calendar, contacts, and notes</li></ul>
<p>I am a long-time Outlook user, and I like having contacts, calendar, email, and notes all in one place. For the past few years, I have been using Companionlink and Deja Office to synchronize my calendar, contacts, and notes. While that works well most of
 the time, there are some limitations and occasionally there is a flaming failure. I have been wondering about installing Outlook for Android on my phone and tablet. Would that synchronize seamlessly with Outlook 365 on my laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folders I'm concerned about in Outlook 365 are labeled as being for this computer only, which is why I need the Companionlink link software to create the bridge between the devices&nbsp; if I had outlook for Android on my phone and tablet, would that synchronization
 happen within Outlook? Or would I still need an external piece of software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have also considered using the Google contacts, Google Calendar, and Google keep notes apps to create that bridge between devices. I'd like to have a setup that takes up the lowest amount of space on my devices and still reliably maintains data across
 all three devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What advice do you have for me? I will appreciate any help or insights you can offer.</p>

<p>If using an IMAP mail account only mail will sync</p>
<p>For true, seemless sync of all data, mail/Calander/tasks/contacts, you require an exchange mail account, outlook.com is one such mail account</p>

            Thanks for this reply. That's not an unexpected answer, though I was hoping it might be even more streamlined. I'll have to do a little research about shifting everything over.
