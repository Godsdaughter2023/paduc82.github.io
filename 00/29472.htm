<h2>            Windows Defender deleted&#63;</h2>
                    Hello guys recently I believe 1 of my programs accidentally deleted my windows defender completely out of my computer. I do not believe that is still exists. the error I'm getting when I start windows defender is ::{26EE0668-A00A-44D7-9371-BEB06...:{D8559EB9-20C0-410E-BEDA-7ED416AECC2A}
 , they it says cannot find program. I'm currently using windows vista 32-bit on a laptop, can this be fixed? If so can someone teach me? Thanks

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Windows Defender is part of the Vista&nbsp;Operating System and you do not uninstall and reinstall it.</p>
<p>If, by some unknown&nbsp;method that you have used, you have deleted it, you would have to do a Repair Upgrade Install to fix the problem:</p>
<p>"<b>How To Perform a Repair Installation For Vista"</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>But before you do that, read this information about Windows Defender:</em></strong></p>
<p>If you are using Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using one of the above AntiVirus Programs, this Information from
<strong><em>David O - Support Engineer</em></strong>&nbsp;shows you how to&nbsp;manually enable&nbsp;Windows Defender (<strong><em>disregard Uninstall Information; not possible in Vista</em></strong>):</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b</a></p>
<p><span>"Go to Start, <strong>Control Panel</strong>, <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>,
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Services</strong>. Locate Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right click and select <strong>Properties</strong> and ensure that the Start-Up Type is
<strong>Automatic. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once changed, click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Exit and Restart your computer. Check back taking the same route to confirm Windows Defender has started"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>If you wish to have extra protection against&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;use the FREE version of Malwarebytes AntiMalware:</p>

    <title>The digital to physical disc swap rules need to change&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iriksta  say:</h3>
<h2>            The digital to physical disc swap rules need to change&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I paid £400 for the Limited console edition of Halo 5, and even spent an extra £50 on the master chief controller. The console edition comes with the Limited edition of the game inside, but it is digital. I only like physical games, so decided to do the
 disc swap. Talked to someone on the support team, sent them the code, my gamertag, email. they then asked for pictures of everything.</p>
<p>I then got refused the swap, because I didn't buy the Limited "Collectors" edition. In the UK on the Microsoft store, the&nbsp;Limited "Collectors" edition is £200, and the edition I paid for is £400. So how come someone who has paid half of what I have gets
 this privilege? They both have identical DLC bundled with the games code, the Warzone REQ pack and Fall of Reach. So its not like I am trying to scam Collectors DLC, because the DLC bundled is identical anyway! The support guy even told me to return my console
 edition and swap it for a collectors edition so I would be eligible!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an absolute joke Microsoft! You should be giving customers who pay more this privilege too! Maybe I should return my console and just buy a PS4 instead! Please sort these rules out so console edtion customers have the privilege too!&nbsp;</p>

<p>You bought the console bundle.</p>
<p>The collectors edition is not a console bundle. &nbsp;That's a particular edition of the game that basically should have come with a disc to begin with as a collectors would want the disc.</p>
<p>Official console bundles always come with download codes for some reason. I personally think they should come with discs though because not everyone has a fast internet connection.</p>

<p>I bought the console edition and they swapped it out without issue. I made them aware I had the console edition right from the start, so perhaps it depends on who you talk to. Also I did it right away on the 20th so perhaps they changed the rules after getting
 more requests then they thought they would. I did the exchange through live chat and the first person who came on immediately transfered me to a supervisor as she said she was not authorized to process the transaction. Try asking for a supervisor if you're
 still trying to exchange, and havnt already used the code.</p>

<p><span>Hi Thatgirlwiththeface,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>A.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Are you getting any error while trying to import videos or pictures to movie maker?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>B.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>What is the file format of the pictures and videos?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>C.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>From when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>D.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Did you make any recent changes on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the following methods.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try to run an online scan on the computer.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 2</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the file format is supported by movie maker. Some audio and video file formats are not supported in Windows Movie Maker and cannot be imported. However, if you
 have a video or audio file that is not supported, you may be able to use a non-Microsoft video editing program to convert the file into a format that Windows Movie Maker supports, and then import the resulting audio or video file into Windows Movie Maker.
 Some files also require you to install a codec before you can use the files in Windows Movie Maker.

<h2>            Skype for Business slow to load</h2>
                    We are running Office 365 and would like to implement Skype for Business across our company (offices in UK &amp; USA). However, the start-up time seems excessive. Are there any fixes to improve this? The loading screen can stay visible for upwards of four
 minutes, and intrudes on starting to use the PC. I would be grateful for any suggestions. We require the integration with Lifesize for conferencing, and two-way screen-sharing. Otherwise, the standard Skype option would suffice! Many thanks.&nbsp;

    <title>Sudden bad performance from old games on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeusnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sudden bad performance from old games on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I would like to comment an issue I'm having. After several troubleshootings, I'm running out of answers and maybe someone here can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a decent desktop pc (AMD Ryzen 5, GTX 1050, 8gbs RAM). It works pretty well, and it can handle modern games with no issue. As a matter of fact, I've just played with FIFA 18 with no issues at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started a few days ago. There is an old game I'm playing which was working correctly on windows 10. A few days ago, out from nowhere (or at least, I didn´t installed anything), the game started to drop fps after some minutes of use. With the
 days passing by, the problem started to increase, and now even in the beginning the game is performing really bad. It's not only a FPS question. For example, loading an old game took me 30secs a few days ago. Now, it takes 3 to 5 minutes to load the same game
 (and after that, the game is almost unplayable because how slow it is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said before, a few hints and things I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* An uninstall and reinstall of the game does nothing.</p>
<p>* It's not a temperature / dust issue on the GPU. I've tried modern games and they work perfectly. But just to be sure, I've checked both things and no issue found there.</p>
<p>* GPU's drivers are updated, Windows 10 it's also updated.</p>
<p>* I've tried to run the game with different compatibily mode (or even without). No results.</p>
<p>* It's a game that runs directx 9. I've heard that disabling full screen optimization or playing it in windows mode could help. Nothing.</p>
<p>* I'm not seeing anything weird on the taskbar, no unknown process, etc. (just to be sure, I've scanned it for virus / malware and nothing, it's a relatively new pc and I didn´t messed around too much).</p>
<p>* I've disabled Game Bar, Game DVR, xBox mode or the Geforce Experience (I even uninstalled this).</p>
<p>* I've tried to make some custom configurations for the game in the GPU's option page (disabling vsync, antialiasing, etc).</p>
<p>* I've tried to raise the .exe priority in the task bar with no good results. I've also tried to use only one processor via affinity.</p>
<p>* I've uninstalled any software or driver that I've installed after the issue started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running out of ideas about what can be done to fix the issue. Since it seems to be isolated to this specific game (no new patches, no info from EA Sports, etc) I'm just having to try and fail until I hit the nail. As I've said, the game did indeed work
 perfectly with Windows 10 until a few days ago. Now it's unplayable. The rest of the system works great, and I can player newer games with no issues at all. I'm lost at what can be creating problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Hello and thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game is FIFA Manager 08. My version of windows is 1709, I do remember updating it the past thursday (and when it was updating the system at the moment of "please don´t turn off your pc" the energy in my house went out). It may be a cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This pc has been bought in december, so I assume everything that was released prior to that date was already installed when it came home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully we'll find an answer!</p>

<p>just to be sure, run the system file checker: ( "sfc /scannow" in command prompt as admin, without the quotes) to check for system errors caused by the energy going out. when you're done, run check disk on each of your drives. then try the game again. if
 it doesn't work try to install all necessary redistributables and reinstall direct x 9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps. run the game as admin and add it to the exclusions of your antivirus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello and thanks for your reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just did a scannow, with no errors returned. Check disk also went straight. I've also just reinstalled DirectX 9. Still having the performance issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running out of ideas on what can be causing troubles, evidently something was installed / added / changed and I didn´t noticed and that is affecting the performance, but I'm running out of ideas on what it could be.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons as to why you're unable to play your game after it drops its FPS. Based on the information that you've provided, there's a possibility that a corrupted file on your computer affects the functionality of the game. Does the issue occur
 after the power interruption? If so, we recommend that you run the Windows Update troubleshooter to scan and repair the corrupted files. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> for the steps.<br />

<h2>            MAC address issue or glitch&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I cant seem to connect to the wifi I'm using (not mine) and its the same thing every time this is the third time this has happened and last few times it solved itself with the same problem saying something about my MAC address I cant connect to anything.
 When I try to connect to the wifi it wont ask for the password like&nbsp;it usually does and go straight to checking connection. Plus cant seem to do anything I cant connected to a different network it wont give me the option to...need help???&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi. When I input the alternate MAC address it asks me to restart but after restarting it has kept the original MAC address. I posted on reddit (
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/519q00/tech_my_new_xbox_one_s_wont_take_alternate_mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.reddit.com/.../tech_my_new_xbox_one_s_wont_take_alternate_mac</a> ) and official xbox support replied that it is a issue pending to be solved. Any idea when we get an update? If it takes too long I will want to return my xbox before my chance to return
 it expires. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Defragment and Optimise drives</h2>
                    I started up the Defragment and Optimise drives utility yesterday and I noticed that both my D: drive and Z: drive were not present there. Both these drives happen to be partitions on the same disk. All other drives (including removable drives) were visible.
 I tried running chkdsk with /r parameter and it returned no errors/bad sectors. How should I solve this issue?

</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Unfortunately, there is no way to move content from one account to another. In this case you could either let him keep using that account, or play on his account. Then he would be where he left off on his own account.</p>

<p>you cannot transfer games/DLC or save from one account to another but you can change the account email address.&nbsp; It can be a multi-step process however I do not know that you can make an account a child account once validated as an adult, if that's what
 you want to do.</p>

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>

<strong>They can not be deleted from the account totally if you use them for anything. If they are removed from the account totally in essence it deletes the email</strong>. So for example, if you use a Hotmail for work and remove it, that email you can no
 longer use for work. Leave the Microsoft email on the account as a secondary email.</p>

    <title>Digital Download Refunds being denied&#47; defrauding me of &#36;500 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walkerhouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Digital Download Refunds being denied&#47; defrauding me of &#36;500</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well for 3 or going on 4 days I've been given the run-around by Microsoft over a refund I requested. I believe this is due to the fact that it is a complicated ticket and someone will actually have to work on it. $500 on about 24 purchase orders for
 a single title game from about the end of August thru November. One digital game download and all of the add-ons.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When filling out the refund request form I get a pretty fast rejected email siting the 14 day BS rule but clearly the employee is not reading my actual dispute or is hiding behind that frail disclaimer trying to avoid having to work because I have a legitimate
 claim. Not to mention if you actually read your own terms of service DIRECTLY in the phrasing of that rule, it reads
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>"Some items are not eligible for return; unless
<strong>otherwise provided by law</strong> or by a particular product offer, all purchases of these types of products are final and non-refundable:</em></p>
<p><em>digital apps, games, in-app content and subscriptions, music, movies, TV shows, and associated content;"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the law provides that I am receiving actual working goods for my hard earned money and that's not the case. The game developers deceive people and the very nature of the game keeps you blind to whether or not the game is actually going to work
 online because you have to grind&nbsp; your characters for so long offline, you wouldn't know if the online game modes even work until after your return time limit is up. In many cases that is. Players like myself do not buy games to play offline AT ALL. EVER.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I play online very competitively and have been playing this game for 20 years since Dreamcast.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; I play NBA 2k19. I have 7 players. Each take countless hours and lots of money to build. Apparently this year, when you have so many players, and if you got hit with a glitch in the system like I did, because of a patch or server malfunction, WHATEVER
 happened-&nbsp;&nbsp; when I switch players, the game does not recognize the switch. It will show me the player I switched to&nbsp; but he will have all the attributes of some brand new low level player I used to have and can not play his position at all. This makes the
 game complete unplayable garbage for me. And there was absolutely no way to see this happening in the first 14 days. Again, I would play the game if it worked. I can not. I've contacted NBA 2K support and have emailed back and forth with them and though they
 admit I have serious issues here, they suggest I put certain players away for a few days, try this, try that, we're sorry, our developers are working on these issues, lies, lies, stringing me along. I'm done. I want the money back that I've been swindled out
 of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to speak to 4 different people on chat support. Two of which (including a manager who was too busy to actually even read what I wrote on the chat screen and literately asked after reading all that you just have, "So you're tired of the game
 or something?" JEEEZUS!!!) were completely indifferent. Two of which agreed with my plight and really wanted to help me but they cannot issue me the refund because it's not their department. A fifth I spoke to on the phone when I called was honestly ANGRY
 for me and said he was attaching comments to my refund request for billing but again he was just support, not billing so he could not give me the refund he agreed I deserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The billing department should be ashamed. My second refund ticket, when filled out I ask in CAPS for a manager. GET ME A SUPERVISOR. ESCALATE THIS TICKET. DO NOT AUTO REJECT WITHOUT GETTING TO A MANAGER. What do you think happened?&nbsp; Denied. Does not meet
 Microsoft terms of service. I'm absolutely disgusted with the lack of any real customer service or accountability.

<p>Hello Walker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the refund. There are multiple things that they account for when giving refunds. One is the 14 day which if this has been bought back in august that way over. Also if you have had other refunds in past. The best thing to do is reply
 to the email where it says you got denied, explain your case there. That is the only way you can do this as support will direct you to reply to the email also. Unfortunately, that is the new way Microsoft has put in place to make it faster for the consumers.
 There is nothing we are able to do here on the forums but provide assistance by directing you to where you need to go. If they continue to deny the refund, you can dispute the charges with the bank. Also what you are experiencing is in game issues which that
 would be 2k. You can also get with them about refunding due to it is their game. Xbox helps with&nbsp; the launch of the game once that is done game server takes over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>My account is 10 years old and I have never asked for a refund. I am happy to spend hundreds on this game every year IF IT WORKS. Also, the "we have a 14 day rule" is no legal defense to help swindle customers out of money. It's a cop out and I'm not accepting
 it. Anyone with an ounce of integrity would help rectify this issue.<br />
And by the way, 2k is putting it off on Microsoft. We all know how this works. @k is a client and Microsoft store is the vendor. You give the refund and charge 2k's account because it is their product. Not that difficult.</p>

<p>Hello Walker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue isn't with Microsoft though. The issue is with the game glitching inside the game. You clearly been playing it and due to the glitch it has become an issue. Like I stated earlier that is a 2k issue. We only help with the launch of the game. And
 the 14 day rule has always been a factor. Which in this case its way over it. You been playing the game for over 2 months.&nbsp; At this point to get all the money you spent refunded you would have to contact 2k for the refund due to most is in game purchases also.</p>
<p>

            Again, 2k is putting it off on Microsoft. I purchased it through Microsoft store. You have all the purchase proofs and credit card numbers attached to those sales. If you've read the entire gripe, it's not like I "played" it for two months. I worked on
 players for two months which can't be used online now due to programming faults. I'm not charging for my work. Just my money. Microsoft can refund it and charge the 2k account. That's really how easy it is.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>A while ago i entered my creditcard for XBL Gold, so i could play AvP online with some friends. I do however not afford paying for Gold every month as i'm unemployed. So, i have used XBL Gold two months. One i paid for, and one that Xbox drew from my bank
 account through the creditcard.</p>
<p>Now however wheever i boot up my Xbox and it tries to connect to xbox live, it tells me my account is suspended and forces me to remain offline. I have no access to the market or otherwise. I noticed this as i was about to download hitman, which i have purchased
 through the game market earlier this year. to summarize: I Can only play things directly from a CD. I Can't even download games i've purchased on the past.</p>
<p>Now, would someone please tell me what the -f is going on here? I'm pretty sure i wasn't suspended becuase i didn't pay for another month of XBL Gold in advance. So, could someone help me out here and help me make sense of this?</p>

<p>Hi! When you purchase an Xbox LIVE subscription through the console, automacic billing is enabled for the account. Unless you call Xbox support to turn it off, you will be billed every month for the service. What has most likely happened here is that the
 system was unable to charge your card for the renewal of the subscription, which caused the account to become suspended. When a credit card is declined, the subscription is not immediately suspended. We actually wait 2-3 weeks before suspending the acct to
 give you the chance to update your info. In order to regain access to LIVE, you will need to pay the past due balance on the account. Based on the info you've provided, it's likely either $9.99 or $19.98. You can give us a call at 800-4MY-XBOX to find out
 the exact balance. Once the balance is paid off, we can turn off the auto-renewal option for you as well if you request that we do so.</p>

<p>Always remember to turn off auto-renew when ordering a gold subscription on the console. You have to call !-800-4MY-XBOX like Lloyd Irving said and pay the over due balance before you have access to your account again.</p>

<p>Since you were doing several different things on your account in a short period of time, it may just take a bit of time for the system to update everything. I would try waiting for awhile then try logging back in with the new tag. If you still have problems
 just post again and we will try to get it worked out for you.</p>

<p>Good news is the website is showing you have a Gold subscription... It's showing the original tag, though. That could be a server disconnect, but that usually only takes 2 hours to refresh. &nbsp;Since I'm seeing your post several hours later, I'm guessing that's
 not the case.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I'd suggest checking your Xbox Live connection. We want to make sure the console is fully connected to the Live system. You can do this in the System menu, under Network Settings. Select Wired if you're using an Ethernet and your network name (SSID) if wireless.
 On this new page, you'll see an option to Test Xbox Live Connection. Run through that test and verify you're good. If you get an error, check out this page for some help solutions:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../connection-error-solution</a></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Once the network connection has been validated, but you're still having problems, you might need to check for a corrupted profile. Since you can log in online, you should be able to delete and redownload your profile successfully. If you're not familiar
 with the steps, you can find them here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Please note: it's important you choose Delete Profile Only. Do NOT delete profile and items. This may not be relevant for a new account, but deleting profile and items deletes everything for that account off the console.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Once you've deleted the profile (but before redownloading it), clear the System Cache. This is your consoles temporary files and does need to be cleared from time to time. Steps to clear the cache:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>After you've cleared the cache, try downloading your profile again. If it was corrupted, it should be good to go.</p>

            Hi utsav911, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Has this problem started since upgrading to Windows 10 1803?
<br />How recent was your upgrade? 
<br />Can you rollback to your previous version?
<br />
<br />If you can, do the following:
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.

            Hi FrostChilde,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using the Answers forum,<br />
<br />
Do you want to turn the touchpad off completely or just the click sound?<br />
If you want to turn it off completely, go to Device Manager &gt; locate the touchpad in the list &gt; right click and select Disable device.<br />
If you want to turn on the click sound, check in Control Panel &gt; Mouse and Sound option to see if there is one for Gateway touchpad.&nbsp; Each computer might have a different wait to turn of the sound effect.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any other questions,

<p><span>Hi quikemolina,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d suggest you to turn off Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 temporarily and check if you can access other computers on your
 Network; ensure you enable it post troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>If you are able to access the network after turning off the security software, then your firewall or the security software
 is the cause for this issue. Please contact Kaspersky support for more assistance on how to configure or change settings to allow access to other computers in the Network.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important: -
</span></strong><span>Turning off security software can infect your system with virus or malware, for safety disconnect your computer from Internet before turning off firewall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above method fails, please make sure that Network discovery is turned on for computers running Windows 7. To enable
 or disable Network discovery, please refer to the link below,</span></p>

<h2>            Skype on Android 4.0.4 &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have installed the latest Skype 8 on an old Samsung I577 ("Exhilarate"), Android 4.0.4, and cannot seem to set up</p>
<p>video calls either to Skype on my W10 machine, or to Skype on my Android 8.0 mobile.&nbsp; The accounts are different people.&nbsp; It appears that a connection has been set up, but no video at all&nbsp; on the Android 4.0.4 mobile.&nbsp; The front facing camera on the Android
 4.0.4 mobile seems to work fine by itself.&nbsp; Also Chrome is installed on it as well, though I cannot tell if Chrome is the default browser on the older device.</p>

            Sorry but Microsoft does not give access to old versions unfortunately. You need to keep this version when you downloaded it. 
<br />Very sad but there are no any other legal way AFAIK. 
<br />You may ask Skype support in chat, may be they will help you.

<h2>            Disk check stopped running</h2>
                    
<p>I scheduled a disk check to run on my computer after start up. It stopped at 41% complete and seemed to be frozen. I turned off the computer and when I turned it on again it went to disk check automatically and is stuck at 41% again. I would really just
 like to get out of this disk check. I am sorry I tried to do some "maintenance".</p>

            If memory serves, you can cancel the disk check if you press any key within 10 seconds after the message indicating that the disk check is scheduled appears on the screen. However, the fact that the system freezes on check the disk may be alarming.<br />
Check if there is any hard drive activity while the disk check is stuck at 41% (check the hard disk LED or any visual indicator on your PC case), check if you can hear the disk working. Finally, give it time (even an hour or so). Depending on the amount of

<h2>            PC doesnt work after being turned off &#40;No video displayed&#41;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">When I turn my computer off after using it (for a normal use or sometimes mid game the screen could just cut out) then I
 need to wait at least eight hours (I'm guessing because normally it doesn't work until I wake up next day) before I can use it again because it will turn back on as the lights come on and the fans can be heard but the video signal isn't being sent to my monitor.
 I tried it through another DVI as well as an HDMI and VGA also on my tv and it still doesn't work. On my monitor, it says no video signal so I took to a guy to get fixed and first he told me that was the CPU I was able to get a replacement, and it still didn't
 work then I was told it was the motherboard. So I got a new motherboard along with the new graphics card and more and better RAM. He told me he wiped the computer and reinstalled Windows 10 on it and was able to keep some files. I've done countless virus scans
 through multiple means though I still don't know what the problem is. <br />
Now also, when I shut down my computer it also would flash as if it's been put to sleep, after checking the event viewer apparently it is even though I have held the button and taken the plug out at the back.&nbsp;<br />

            <p><span>Hi Chris,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may occur due to incompatible Graphics&nbsp;Card driver. Therefore, I would suggest you to go to the Safe Mode, follow the steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Reboot the PC, and when you reach the sign-in screen, hold the Shift key down while you click the Power button and select
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>When the system reboots, you will enter the Windows Recovery Environment. Select
<strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>, and then
<strong><span>Advanced options</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Startup Settings</span></strong>, and
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.&nbsp; When it restarts, you should see a number of options.&nbsp; Press 5 or F5 for
<strong><span>Safe Mode with networking.&nbsp;</span></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Once you’ve entered Safe Mode, right-click the Start icon and select
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Expand <strong>
<span>Display Adapter</span></strong>. Right-click your display adapter and select
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>.&nbsp; Then reboot your PC.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the information helps. Please keep us posted on the issue. We will be happy to assist you accordingly.</span></p>

            Thanks for the quick reply sorry I only able to try this now as it wasn't turning on. I was able to boot it in safe mode and found the device manager, there was only the gtx 970 on it but I did as you said and uninstalled it. After rebooting into normal
 now going to redownload the latest driver for it, hopefully it will be fine tomorrow.&nbsp;

            <p>Yes it's when I turn it on after. I explained myself in my post giving more detail than the title saying that, sometimes mid game the screen could just cut out and I don't know if the PCs is working or when I'm done using it and turn off should I turn it
 back on later it would start (with no display) fans can be heard lights are on and after a second it restarts. Then it keeps going but no display so I have to turn it off by holding the button take the plug out and leave it hours before I can use it again.&nbsp;</p>
