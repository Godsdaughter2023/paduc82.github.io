<h2>            Disk is at 100&#37; On Startup and Random Times &#40;Widows Performance Recorder files attached&#41;</h2>
                    <p>We have a laptop that was upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7, Disk is now at 100% most of the time.&nbsp; Without any programs running except Task Manager, it eventually goes down to the 0%-26% range, but then spikes to 100% at random times.&nbsp; I did a reset
 of Windows 10, kept all personal files but removed all programs.&nbsp; That didn't help.&nbsp; I read that it could be hard drive failure and there were some items in Event Viewer that suggested the hard drive could be having problems, things were taking longer than
 expected to write to the hard drive, so I ran several diagnostics on the hard drive and other hardware.&nbsp; All diagnostic tests passed (except battery is not charging at full capacity).&nbsp; I read it could possibly be Windows Defender, but the fixes didn't help.&nbsp;
 I watched Resource Monitor for a while and nothing jumped out at me as the culprit.&nbsp; All "system" files, it usually shows NTFS Volume Log, ntuser.dat.LOG2, Internet Explorer related stuff, nothing I can just uninstall, a lot of stuff that doesn't mean anything
 to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I came across the post from the person who just got a new computer and this was happening (but there was no solution posted), so I tried the linked Widows Performance Recorder in the hopes that someone could point out the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is a OneDrive link to my zipped .etl files: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArVugMZS9lGjuWfc0G8Q26aCAwBZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArVugMZS9lGjuWfc0G8Q26aCAwBZ</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The laptop is a Dell Inspiron 17R 5720 64-bit<br />
RAM: 8GB<br />
Processor: Intel i7-3212QM 2.10 GHz<br />
1TB HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions or .etl file analysis, I'd sure appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>I only looked at trace "SUSIE-PC.12-29-2016.15-33-15.Boot_3.etl" and "SUSIE-PC.12-29-2016.15-33-15.Boot_1.etl":</p>
<p>Yes, your disk usage is nearly the whole time above 99%.</p>
<p>Following observations:<br />
</p>
<p>1. you might look at the content of: "C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\", as on each start the old .NET 2.0 compiler is called with files from "C:\WINDOWS\TEMP", f.e.:</p>
<p>"C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\csc.exe" /noconfig /fullpaths @"C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\j366px-t.cmdline".</p>
<p>The file names change, but perhaps you can find one of the .cmdline files to see what might causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. there is a lot of Dell and Intel processes and services starting: I would disable all of them then test which functionality you are missing.</p>
<p>from Intel:<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\igfxCUIService.exe<br />
C:\Program Files\Intel\iCLS Client\HeciServer.exe<br />

"C:\Program Files\IDT\WDM\STacSV64.exe"<br />
"C:\Program Files\IDT\WDM\sttray64.exe"&nbsp;<br />
<br />
from Dell, some of these might be needed for the Trackpad and Keyboards, but I doubt that all of these are really useful:<br />

<p>Thanks, I did actually try this already.&nbsp; The laptop doesn't show StorAHCI.sys though it shows iaStorA.sys.&nbsp; So I assume it doesn't apply then.</p>

            <p>Just an update, I tried disabling everything that started up with windows, this is before reinstalling all the software, like Office, that was removed when I did the Windows refresh.&nbsp; It then appeared to be something that was set to "Automatic (Delayed Start)"
 because&nbsp;it took maybe 20 seconds for the disk to start increasing to 100%.&nbsp; I then decided to do a fresh install of windows in case it was bloatware, but no luck, still at 100% on startup.&nbsp; So I finally concluded a new hard drive was our best bet.&nbsp; We're waiting
 on it to come, then we can confirm if that's the solution.&nbsp; :-(</p>

<h2>            Wired Xbox 360 controller for PC, keep disconnecting from USB slot.</h2>
                    I have an Xbox 360 controller that I am trying to use for my PC. When I plugged it into the USB slot on my Windows 7 64 bit machine, it installs the drivers automatically and works fine for a little while, but about once every 3-5 minutes I get the sound
 on my computer like I disconnected the USB. And, if I have the device manager open at the same time, that screen refreshes, So it's like it is being disconnected for a half of a second or so. I thought it was a short since that would be the obvious issue,
 but when connected to a 360 it works perfectly and never disconnects. <br />
<br />
I made sure that it was plugged into the back USB port on my PC, and I checked in power management that is was a high powered 500mah USB back there (I actually tried each port on the back and uninstalled from each, once it did it.) Another thing I wanted to
 note, not sure if it will pertain to this at all or if it's just random, but once the controller shuts off and on for a brief second, it switches the quadrant from 1 to 2, and the next time it does it, it will switch back.
<br />
<br />
I am using the driver from http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The specific driver number is: 2.1.0.1349.<br />
<br />
One last thing that I did, was went into Device Manager and uninstalled everything under "Universal Serial Bus controller" and restarted the computer, after it restarted and installed all of my USB drivers again, including the controller, I was able to play
 for around 15-20 minutes before it started doing it again. <br />
<br />
<br />
I have spoken to Xbox 360 support help desk and they stated this was a Windows issue, so I thought I would ask here.&nbsp;

            Not too sure if you read anything that I wrote beyond the fact that it's an Xbox 360 controller, but I am using it on a Windows 7 PC,&nbsp; and I stated that "I have spoken to Xbox 360 support help desk and they stated this was a Windows issue, so I thought

            <p>Hi Christina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem you're having isn't with drivers or anything like that. I had 3 xbox360 controllers do this to me, whether I was using it on my xbox360 console or my windows pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually returned a controller back to Best Buy before figuring out this simple neat little trick that will keep you using your controller for a very, very long time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, just before I began writing this reply, as of right now, my wired xbox360 controller was having serious disconnect issues. I did this same trick to my wireless xbox360 controller connected to my xbox360!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Find a twisty tie from a loaf of bread bag or for garbage bags.</p>
<p>2. The beginning of the controller wire, with the big circular piece that is around the wire, which is attached to the base of the controller, not the end with the USB connector, make a half loop and tie it with the twisty tie nice and tight so that the
 big circular piece remains elevated. See submitted picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that big plastic piece is causing the disconnection problem and if you keep it elevated it won't weigh down on the inner wiring. Give it a go! :)</p>

            This solved the problem for me, thank you for asking the question... and thank YOU for figuring out the solution.&nbsp; As eye sore as it may be, it is a small price to pay for functionality. *cheers*

            <p>See, here's the thing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't going to help Christine. &nbsp;She left a long time ago after giving up on asking the question because reading comprehension was at a bit of a lull that week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tying twisty-ties around the controller wire to fix a physical connection issue with the hardware might work for people whose physical connection and hardware is the issue, but Christine explained, and then repeated, that the issue only surfaces on her Windows
 PC. &nbsp;The controller works fine on her console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Google sees this as one of the more popular threads regarding this issue, I'm going to hijack it a bit and describe my particular issue. &nbsp;Hopefully we can all work together to discover what is happening and resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wired 360 controller is repeatedly disconnecting and reconnecting in a rapid-fire fashion...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...But only during certain in-game sequences. &nbsp;In Grand Theft Auto V PC, the controller works fine until I enter a vehicle and try to press the accelerator (right trigger), or when I'm shooting/fighting a character. &nbsp;In Skyrim, the issue can occur randomly
 and I haven't been able to pinpoint the in-game event that triggers it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will disconnect and reconnect over and over again, switching itself to Player 2, Player 3, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a suspicion that the disconnects are occurring when the vibration/rumble engages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may also be a problem with lack of voltage...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont knlw, but I'd love some help trying to figure it out. &nbsp;If I can provide any more info, please don't hesitate to ask!</p>

            <p>Make sure if its asking to be plugged into a USB 3 slot, that it is NOT being plugged into a USB 2 slot OR VICE VERSA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two USB powers profiles are DIFFERENT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in use, at particular points, you get OMG.</p>

</p><p>GLITCH.</p>

            <p>Being late to the game, I want to mention another solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Ultranothing: As Mr.CGoto said, one of the method is make sure you use the correct port: gray, black and other dark color means USB 2.0 and blue, red and other funny color means USB 3.0 usually and for more specifics read the product specs and connect em
 properly. Preferably always 2.0, 3.0 in some systems like mine are really funny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for those who sees their controllers disconnect in an interval like 2 to 3 mins, go to control panel, power options under your selected power options click more settings, and then advanced settings. Once the dialog opens goto USB settings and disable
 USB selective suspension. This thing is most frequent culprit that put the USB devices to sleep after a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone and yeah the OP Christina too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks guys.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth not being discovered on the computer.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have a bluetooth dongle from Kinivo (<span>BTD-400 Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter) and a Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Keyboard 5000. The devises were paired this morning and working fine. The battery died on the keyboard. I replaced
 them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since replacing the batteries on the keyboard the bluetooth system on the computer can't discover the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have paired the keyboard to other bluetooth devises I own so I don't think that is the problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I uninstalled the bluetooth driver and reinstalled.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The keyboard is in discovery mode. I right click on the bluetooth icon in the bottom right of my screen and click on "add a device." It says it is "searching for devises... Make sure your device is discoverable." but
 nothing happens. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any suggestions? &nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            One PC can&#39;t detect Wireless Printer&#59; All other devices on SOHO network CAN&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Canon MX860 directly connected to my wireless switch/router. My computer used to be able to print directly to it over the network, but now it can only do it when sending the queue to another PC on the network that shares it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried finding my printer on the "add printer" wizard, and it did not auto detect, nor could I add it by typing the IP address. Strangely, ALL other devices can find it, including Windows, Android, Linux, and Apple devices. It is ONLY this one PC (Which
 is also the SOHO server) that cannot find it. I even tried disabling firewalls, and even configuring the router to temporarily put it in a DMZ...no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer used to work directly wireless PC-AP-printer, but one day the printer icon "faded" and it said it could not print, so I deleted the printing device and tried reinstalling, with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The REALLY strange thing is, I can get to the printer's configuration page by typing the IP address in a browser, but when trying to install it as a printer, Windows 8.1 says it can't find the device...</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANY HELP PLEASE????</p>

            <p>I Found a fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the manufacturer's website and download the driver. Chances are you will have to extract them with something like WinRAR. Also know that many times there will be seperate downloads depending on whether your using a 32 or 64 bit Windows OS. (I usually
 download both, and add the other under "Printer Properties&gt;Sharing, so others on my network won't have to repeat the process)(Also note, sometimes there is a different driver, depending if you're using the printer via USB, ethernet, or WLAN, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In "Classic" Control Panel, click "Devices and Printers"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In ribbon panel, click "Add a printer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click "The printer that I want isn't listed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the "Add a printer using a TCP/IP address or hostname"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter the IP address of the wireless printer, and click next (you can try leaving the "Query the printer" checkbox selected)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows will spend a minute or two "Detecting the TCP/IP...."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it gets to the "Additional port information required" dialog box, ;eave the "Generic Network Card" radio button selected (You
<em>may</em> have to play around with the options). Click "Next"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, click the "Have Disck..." button and a "Install from disk" dialog box will pop up. Click "Browse"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigate to the folder you extracted the manufacturer's drivers to. Note that many driver packages will have multiple .INF's, so you might need to play around with them one by one until one works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>voila! Try printing a test page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
NOTE: After all is through, you can go to the device manager, and right click your wireless printer (Usually under "Print queues"), and on the popup context menu, click "Update Driver Software". If you're using Windows 7+ (or Vista+, I think), you can click
 "Browse my computer for driver software", navigate to the root of your downloaded extracted driver folder, and check the "Include subfolders" checkbox. It will find the best .INF to use (Some driver packages include dozens/hundreds of drivers in a bundle,
 and just because Windows allowed you to use the one you picked previously when trying them one-by-one, doesn't mean it's the optimal/fully functioning driver. Also, Once your printer is installed, Windows Update might recognize your printer and have a better
 match as well!</p>

            It was never plugged into the router. At one time it was plugged into a wireless Windows 7 machine via USB, now it is totally wireless. and I only wanted the driver itself, not all that bloatware that comes with printer programs<br />

<h3> mammyt  say:</h3>
<h2>            admin account problems</h2>
                    <p>I bought a brand new Toshiba satellite laptop for my daughter and was trying to set it up. it is a windows 8.1 which I have never used before. it wouldn't let me activate windows until I created a admin account (id already made my daughter a local account).
 I was trying&nbsp;to set up my Microsoft account with my own email but was distracted by one of my kids and accidentally typed part of the email wrong, and created a non-existent email&nbsp;address. I cannot remember the password either, and now&nbsp;it has set this as the
 admin account and I cannot get access to anything. I am absolutely baffled and need urgent help.&nbsp; I have tried everything I can possibly think of? Does ANYONE know&nbsp;what I can do to solve this? I am DESPERATE!!!!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. windows 8.1 is pre-installed so their is no disc with it,&nbsp; and I wasn't able to proceed as far as burning a re-install disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem. While trying to set up my moms PC I too put in the wrong Email.</p>
<p>I have been trying to fix it</p>
<p>But the main problem is Microsoft keeps prompting me to verify my Microsoft account</p>
<p>password. I have done this over and over and each time I change it it still will not recognize the new one or the old one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have been nble to get Skype up and running for her as Microsoft asks for an &nbsp;ID that it will not accept as correct.</p>
<p>Yesterday I could not even get on the internet using VERIZON.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen just kept saying enter your OPTIMUM ID which we NO longer use.</p>
<p>also the contact info is wrong/outdated.</p>
<p>there seems no way to update it.</p>
<p>Sending codes to a phone No longer used and a &nbsp;Email no longer used is NOT helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't she just use Skype without &nbsp;Microsoft interference? &nbsp;It is not as if she rarely uses Skype.</p>
<p>She uses it almost weekly to talk to her daughter in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Microsoft forgotten it has to service people with memory loss and who are not Computer Geeks?</p>
<p>and they are supposed to HELP us? &nbsp;OR Is it that the Computers made now problematic?</p>
<p>Upgrades are supposed to make things easier.</p>
<p>My mom is almost 80 and every day I have to help her with this New Lap top irritating</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So today I will AGAIN spend most of the day gin trying to get this problem fixed.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to say about your problem except that I'm sorry to hear this is happening...</p>
<p>I'm thinking you may have more than one problem though... The Microsoft Account and Verizon may be two separate issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with all the new features that are added to the newer computers is that they require more advanced security to function relatively safely... And that makes things more difficult...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not necessary to use a Microsoft Account to log in to your computer... But with the problems you are having it may be difficult to change that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring the machine to Factory may help with the logging in to Windows issue, but I'm not sure how it will effect Skype and Verizon...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another complication is that you are running preinstalled Windows. That makes Toshiba responsible for Windows support... BUT... your actual Account is with Microsoft... Toshiba MIGHT be able to help with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if calling Windows Tech Support would help or not.</p>

            <p>Thank you for getting back to me as to this problem.</p>
<p>I agree there may be several things going on that are&nbsp;</p>
<p>causing these problems.</p>
<p>Today things were better.</p>
<p>But I am still spending way too much time trying to set up this PC for my mom.</p>
<p>One problem is this is a new PC so all the info must be put in</p>
<p>unlike the old PC where mom did not have to put in old forgotten passwords</p>
<p>and was automatically signed in to avoid that headache</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also we bought a "HP Laptop" not a Toshiba.</p>
<p>The optimum page is gone.</p>
<p>I was able to get a Microsoft code finally but not back into the skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The frustrating is everyone at some point or another will get or need a NEW PC.</p>
<p>Some use more than one and other devices.</p>
<p>Signing in should not be so hard.</p>
<p>No device after all is guaranteed to last forever.</p>
<p>You can barely get any company to give you a free 10-7-5-3 year warranty.</p>
<p>will keep trying to get this set up finished.</p>
<p>FRUSTRATING</p>
<p>to have to keep track of my moms pins and passwords and my own.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a way to start your computer without any password... it isn't recommended, but I do it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you set up your computer when you get to the area where you create a password, login, or whatever, there is something near the bottom to sign without a Microsoft Account...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will take you to a window where you can create a password, but you can leave it blank...</p>
<p>A couple of times I had to just click in the box and enter nothing for it to accept it....If you want , you can try going to Settings.. Accounts, and possibly change that... I'm not using a password, so the options are not appearing for me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully things will work out for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a simialr experience last week with ATT internet services... They sent me an email, but when I tried to respond&nbsp;my login &nbsp;wasn't recognized... I then called, and they could find no record of my account...</p>
<p>This is even though they bill my credit card every month for the service...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out the email had the wrong link for a reply, as well as the wrong phone number to call...</p>
<p>It took four hours for someone to figure that out !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then took another four hours to get through to the CORRECT phone number... To say I was angry would be a HUGE understatement... So I know how you feel...</p>

            Unfortunately its an epic games support concern as microsoft has no affiliation or access to epic games accounts as it is owned by them, xbox support won’t be of much help and honestly what epic games have said is obsurd as ive never made purchases on
 their website either so why would i need it to confirm the unlink.

            <p><span>Hi Keith,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the computer connected to a Domain?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are there any restrictions set on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to manually add the wireless network on the computer and check if you are still prompted
 for password. Refer to the link for details:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Connecting to Wireless Networks with Windows 7</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to temporarily disable the Windows Firewall and try to connect to the unsecure network:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
 Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the results.</span></p>

            <p>I suggest you&nbsp;go to Control Panel -&gt; User Accounts and Family Safety -&gt; Manage Windows Credentials.<br />
You should be able to view your saved credentials in there and check their persistence level.</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;Try going in to Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Manage Wireless Networks. If the desired internet connection is already listed, right click and go to Properties. If not, add your connection manually. In Properties, there should
 be a check box with an option to have Windows 7 automatically connect to this network. Check if this fixes the problem.</p>

            <p>Here are the answers to your questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) No, she is not connecting to a Domain.</p>
<p>2) No restrictions that I am aware of.&nbsp; She is the administrator of the pc.</p>
<p>3) She is using&nbsp;a Dell Latitude E6420</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently the machine is not using Windows Firewall.&nbsp; I checked to make sure.&nbsp; We use AVG but we had disabled AVG for a test and there was no change.&nbsp; The connection has to be set up manually but even configuring it manually the next time she goes to another
 network then back to the office, the office is not in the list.&nbsp; In fact, there are no networks in the list.&nbsp; Once she creates the connection, she is able to enter the password and join the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you </p>

I followed your step looking for the saved credentials.&nbsp; I am not sure what you are looking for but nothing stands out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to the Network and Sharing Center, I can see the connection now since she is on the office network.&nbsp; When she first comes in and tries to get on the network (after being on another network like her home one) there is nothing to choose from and
 she manually recreates the connection.</p>

My problem is not exactly the same as andrewlday. I want to export my Windows Live Mail to another computer. I follow the procedure, but only one message is exported. prompted by your advice, I have tried putting the messages in my storage folder as well as
 in the main working folder before exporting, and the result is the same - just a single message goes out.
<div>Thanks if you can help.</div>

            <p>Mine is different as well.&nbsp; I can export&nbsp;nearly all the&nbsp;10,000 messages, or so,&nbsp;from the various folders in Windows Live Mail to Outlook.&nbsp; The export process gets stuck when trying to export the SENT folder messages.&nbsp; It sticks&nbsp;at the 2130th message of the
 2190 messages in the sent folder.&nbsp; How do I find that 2130th&nbsp;message and DELETE it so the export will continue.&nbsp; Once the export sticks there,&nbsp;I have to use Task Manager to kill Windows Live Mail and Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither will&nbsp;respond to a close command.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The export has gotten stuck at the same message every time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran a search on the number&nbsp;2130 + type:email&nbsp;&nbsp;and found a few email messages in the Sent folder that had 2130 in the header or body and deleted them, but the export process still hangs on the
 2130th message.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am out of ideas.&nbsp; Please help.</p>

<h2>            I don&#39;t have Office 2010 installed, but update KB2687455 keeps trying to install, and failing to install</h2>
                    I used to have office installed on my Surface Pro 4 running Windows 10 Pro. A while ago I upgraded to Office 2016 and removed Office 2010. It is not in the list of installed programmes. However, I keep getting the option to install this update but it keeps
 failing. How can I fix this?

            Please use Easy fix to remove all remnants of previous Office. Also look into manual uninstall option to see if any trace is left over.

            Hi Sheriff.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Has Folder Protection been set on your User account Desktop, Documents or Pictures folders?  Check here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />If so are the folders set only to be stored in the cloud using Files on Demand?  
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest version since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            <p>While you may have a problem with DirectX&nbsp; you&nbsp; have a different problem to the original post from 2011, and should have started your own&nbsp; thread, but -</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"is it true that vista dont compatible with directx11?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes.&nbsp; XP stops with DX9, Vista introduced DX10 but does not have DX11.</p>
<p>However d3dx9_30.dll is not a DX 11 file. It is a DX9 file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have reinstalled Direct X using the DirectX Redist (June 2010) there should be no</p>
<p>problem with the d3dx9_30.dll, unless the original file was corrupt and you only unpacked the</p>
<p>DX install and did not finish the installation .</p>
<p>( The files get unpacked to a location you have&nbsp; chosen, but you still need to install DX&nbsp; using the&nbsp; DXSETUP.exe&nbsp; in the folder you unpacked the files to.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- After running the DXSETUP.exe you can delete this folder. )</p>

<p>Many Toshiba laptops come with the factory software recovery image stored in a special (hidden) area on the hard disk.&nbsp; From this special hidden system recovery image, you can restore your computer to its factory-fresh software condition by following these
 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the computer is turned off ("Shut-down" from the Windows Start menu)
</li><li>Remove any peripherals such an external&nbsp;mouse, keyboard, monitor, USB flash drive&nbsp;etc.
</li><li>Make sure the AC Adapter is plugged in and working. </li><li><strong>Press and hold down the 0 (zero) key on the keyboard while powering on the</strong> computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Release it when the recovery warning screen appears.
</li><li>If the recovery process offers&nbsp;a choice of Operating Systems, select the appropriate one for you.
</li><li>A warning screen appears, stating that when the recovery is executed all data will be deleted and rewritten.
</li><li>Click Yes to continue. </li><li>When the Toshiba Recovery Wizard opens select "Recovery of Factory Software" or the appropriate option for your needs.
</li><li>Continue to follow the directions restarting as necessary.</li></ol>
<p>Please note that the process may vary slightly from machine to machine, that you may be asked to insert disks (multi-disk packages) and that the process may take one to two hours to complete.&nbsp; The recovery process will require you to restart your computer
 several times.</p>
<p>As you use the recovery process you will have several options. One of these may be to create a custom size partition. Follow the directions on screen for this and other options as prompted.&nbsp; When in doubt, it's usually best to accept the default, or pre-selected
 option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have problems with it, contact Toshiba and order a set of Vista Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP won&#39;t load</h2>
                    Hello, I'm having a problem with Windows XP home edition. It will not go past the splash screen on a normal start up, when I try to go to the repair console I get to the blue screen that says " Windows Setup Setup is starting windows " and then it hangs
 here and lastly when I try to boot to safe mode it hangs at agp440.sys service. From what I can tell that is a video driver that I think is causing all of my problems. Once in a great while it will finally boot to the desktop but my video display is locked
 at 640 x 480 4bit color. I've removed all unnecessary pci cards and even tried a different video card but the result is still the same. If anyone has any ideas I would be grateful. Thanks....&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;The problem here appears to start with the message "setup is now starting windows." This indicates that setup either did not completely finish running to completion, (creating your user account in the process), or else the setup disk was left in the machine
 at the end of the second re-start, and you are locked into an endless setup loop. (and you have not yet made your account, either. You will either have to make sure there is no disk in the drive, and that you restart the computer without it in the drive, to
 allow setup to run, or you may have to re-start setup and allow it to run to completion, which will take up to fifteen minutes for the first walkthrough menu to appear, as there is no user account yet for it open with.</p>

                    <p>I updated the software on my Asus Zenbook, and now there are these icons on my background that won't go away (see picture). When I click out of all my windows, I just want to see my wallpaper background, not these icons. I have tried to get rid of them,

<br />
The same thing happened to me. Does it not seem absurd that 16 people have this same problem and MS has not deigned to address it.
<br />
<br />
There is a connotation of safety when one downloads a MS update. Please address this issue. Please advise.

            <p>Hello TamimAnsary,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post. Sorry to hear that your contacts has been lost after you reinstall Windows Live Mail. Let me assist you with that. You can check your contacts via web and&nbsp;reconfigure your account in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your contacts are available only in Windows Live Mail, there's no way for us to recover them. To prevent this from happening again, back up your files (email message, calendar and contacts).

<h2>            Possible to exchange game download token&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. Old guy with zero XBox experience. Just picked up the Holiday bundle for my son's Christmas present. It has Forza Motorsport and a downloadable token for Skyrim. I read the reviews when I got home and don't feel it is appropriate for him. I don't know
 how those codes work yet - will sort it out on Christmas- but was wondering if I could exchange that token for a rated E game? I don't really want to go back to the store and fight the crowds (and piles of people buying Xbox!) to exchange that console if I
 can just download a different game.</p>

<p>I believe redeem codes are non exchangeable and the bundles are pre-determined by either the retail supplier, and (or) microsoft. Fortunately, there are plenty of E rated games on the marketplace you can download. I recommend the LEGO games, they are very
 fun and engaging for young gamers. The marketplace has a fair few of them (ranging from just $19.99 upwards)</p>
<p>To name a few.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Lego Batman</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lego Pirates of the Caribbean</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lego Star Wars</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Marketplace is vast and very reasonably priced. <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Games/GamesOnDemand?sortby=ReleaseDate&amp;GameRating=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>You have the right to do whatever you wish with that code. If you haven't used it, you can give or trade it away freely, but these forums don't permit that activity here.</p>
<p>As a freebie in a bundle, it's not something you can trade in stores though.</p>
<p>PM and I can explain better options on what you could do.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you will not be able to exchange the code or get it refunded. The only things you could do are:</p>
<p>1) Return the entire bundle to the store (seems you don't want to do that and I don't blame you).</p>
<p>2) Give/ sell the code (note you cannot trade this into a store). If you know another person with an Xbox, boom! Christmas present!</p>
<p>3) Use the code on the xbox. You can use it yourself and also invoke family settings on the console to make sure your son can't play games over a certain age rating (try to find the faq page on the site for help I can't link it sorry).</p>

<h2>            Family Safety Screen Limits and Activity not working&#59; 0 time yesterday, more time than allowed today</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My child contacted me a few minutes ago (9:43AM).&nbsp; He attempted to log on to his Windows 10 PC.&nbsp; It stated his time was up.&nbsp; I went to my account and the activity tab indicates he spent 0 minutes yesterday and 5 hours 6 minutes today.&nbsp; This is not correct.&nbsp;
 I know he logged in yesterday, I saw him logged onto the PC, playing a game.&nbsp; I also know he hasn't been on the PC for five hours today, because I was at the house this morning and he was not on the PC.&nbsp; Additionally, his daily time limit in the summer is
 4 hours.&nbsp; So how can he have used the PC for 5 hours 6 minutes?&nbsp; See the attached screenshots of his activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows will not let him log on at all, I am at work.&nbsp; He has already rebooted the PC at least once.&nbsp; Please help to fix this.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />
<br />It would suggest one of two things, the account if a Family Account or the NTUser.dat file is corrupt.
<br />
<br />Step 1:
<br />
<br />Change the date of birth on your Microsoft Account to ensure it reflects your are 18 years or older:
<br />
<br />Change the birthdate on your Microsoft account - Microsoft Support
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12411/microsoft-account-change-birthdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12411/...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: 
<br />
<br />If the other account is setup as a family account, sign into your Your Family at the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> 
<br />
<br />Under the account, click More options, click Remove from family.
<br />
<br />Restart then check if you can sign into the account again.
<br />
<br />Change the account privilege 
<br />
<br />It is possible there is a profile issue, you could try changing the account privileges to Standard User from Administrator to see if it logs you in.
<br />
<br />In your current account
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Users tab
<br />Select the account, then click Disconnect
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Select the other account
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Group Membership
<br />Select Standard user
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK again
<br />
<br />Restart the machine, the try logging into the account. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, then it suggest NTUser.dat might be corrupt. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type view advanced system settings
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Under User Profiles, click Settings
<br />For the affected profile, click Delete
<br />
<br />Select your user profile or another user profile that is able to log on successfully. 
<br />Click Copy To..
<br />Click Browse then save it somewhere on your drive
<br />Rename it to something else
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; system drive where Windows is installed
<br />Open the Users folder
<br />Open the troubled profiled
<br />Go to the View tab, then check off Hidden items in Show/Hide
<br />
<br />The NTUser.dat with backed up earlier, copy it into this folder
<br />
<br />Restart, then check if you can log in.

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One common cause for this is that the activity report is being shown in the wrong time zone.&nbsp; Could you go to account.microsoft.com/profile, "Edit country/region", and verify that the time zone is set correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't resolve the issue then let me know so I can investigate with you offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I install Windows 7 on a GPT&#63;</h2>
                    <b>YES</b>... I have a UEFI system (Asus P8H67-M Pro).
<div><b>YES</b>... I am using the 64-bit version of Windows 7 (Home Premium).</div>
<div><b>YES</b>... I have already read "Windows and GPT FAQ" and "Using GPT Drives" so please do not refer to them here. (Links are posted below for other readers)</div>

<div>The disk I am trying to install to a RAID disk (controlled by an 3ware 9750-4i).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In my many attempts I have experienced some inconsistent behaviour. But two things that remain constant (so far) are:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Trying to install Windows to a bootable GPT volume with the EFI and MSR partitions already created will give me this error:
<b><i>"Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk is of the GPT partition style."</i></b></li><li>Trying to install Windows to a bootable GPT volume with no partitions created will simply cause the volume to be converted back to MBR during installation.</li></ol>
<div>My steps are as follows:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Prepare my RAID disks: In a new array I create a boot disk and regular data disk (without an explicit boot disk Windows won't see a bootable disk).</li><li>I sometimes I need to unplug other storage devices/controllers before running the installer disc or Windows STILL won't see my boot disk as being bootable.</li><li>I boot from the installer disc using the UEFI option in my BIOS.</li><li>Once I'm in the Windows installer I load my drivers (for my RAID controller - and yes they are up-to-date).</li><li>Then in the command prompt I run <i>diskpart</i>&nbsp;and convert my RAID disk to GPT.</li><li>I <u>sometimes</u>&nbsp;also create the EFI and MSR partitions (100 MB, 128 MB) hoping it fill force Windows to install and keep the GPT.</li><li>I return to the installer and make my attempt.</li></ol>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div>This is obviously quite frustrating. I think I've been toying with this for a week now. I have no intentions of supporting obsolete technology. GPT is the future and there is no reason why anybody (with current hardware and software) should be forced to
 use it. I have already installed Windows 7 (from the same disc - which is authentic) on my Mac without any hacking or virtual environments. I was getting the same error for a short while ("Windows cannot be installed...") but it seemed to settle itself after
 a few attempts (which never makes since, but I'm not complaining).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have scoured the internet looking for answers, only to find countless threads of people with similar problems and no posted solutions or solutions that don't fit the bill.
<b><i>Can somebody (from Microsoft) PLEASE lend a hand here?!</i></b></div>

            Thanks David, both for your reply and your original post with some very useful info on it.<br />
<br />
It turns out that the problem I had was setting up the RAID array - the P8H67-M PRO has an old version of Intel Rapid Storage Technology (i.e. the raid controller) that doesn't support &gt;2.2Tb drives.<br />
<br />
Apparently, version 10.5 or above of the RST does support 2.2Tb, however, this is not available in the current asus bios (version 1003).<br />
<br />
The mistake I also made was to not switch the bios back into AHCI mode after failing with the raid - windows got confused and report only 280Gb. In ACHI mode windows is quite happy to install.<br />
<br />
My workaround is to use windows 7 software raid (only available in professional or above) until asus sort out a BIOS update!<br />
<br />
Many thanks, Pete.<br />

<h2>            Downloads will not open</h2>
                    My OS is Windows 8 and I'm using Firefox (I think 18.0.2).<br />
<br />
I tried to download the latest Adobe flash player update, but when I double click the file in the download window, it won't open. I tried downloading it again, clearing my download history, and uninstalling Adobe, but I still can't open any files. The same
 thing is happening with other downloads, so it's not an Adobe specific problem. I would really appreciate some kind of fix, because Adobe is pretty vital to almost anything I want to do.

    <title>Windows update not working after reinstalling windows&#58; error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows update not working after reinstalling windows&#58; error 8007001f</h2>
                    <p>After a clean re-install, I cannot use Windows update. First, I get a message that&nbsp; I "Need to install new Windows Update software."&nbsp; When I click to &nbsp;install that update, I get "Windows could not search for a new update" and error 8007001F.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Update:&nbsp; I think I neglected to mention that this is a 32 bit Windows 7 install</p>
<p>I was eventually able to get Windows to at least check for updates (after installing Norton if that matters) and download 21 updates (over the course of 3 tries).&nbsp; About 65 more failed to update though and I'm getting the above messages again.&nbsp; In addition
 to the above error recurring, I've gotten 80070570 a&nbsp;several times now and 8008005, 800F0902 once each.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Which is the security software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> You may
<b>temporarily</b> disable the firewall and the security software on the Windows XP computer and try installing updates.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Disable antivirus software</span></b></p>

<p><b>Important Note:</b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your
 antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to
 attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Try and perform a clean boot and then try to install the updates.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>Perform steps 7 to boot the computer back in Normal Startup, after the troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
