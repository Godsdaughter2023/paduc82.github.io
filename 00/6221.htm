<h2>            New Outlook.com missing &#39;Unread&#39; Category</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook.com has been upgraded to the new version today; and it seems to be missing, what for me, was a key feature of using Outlook.com in a web browser, the 'Unread' category in the folder list. This allowed me to review unread emails across all folders
 that had been automatically filed by rules in order to minimise the amount of non-urgent emails appearing in my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the old version there was an 'Unread' category in the folder list</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e147b744-2610-4f24-be98-0c48f5b5c920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e147b744-2610-4f24-be98-0c48f5b5c920" height="386" width="230" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the new version, this no longer appears and there is no 'Unread' category in the categories settings to enable for display in the folder list</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e48387cb-9f2a-4b92-84f4-c59b0048d409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e48387cb-9f2a-4b92-84f4-c59b0048d409" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to restore this functionality in the new version of Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance...</p>

            <p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer, but unfortunately it does not solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Unread filter at the top of the page in the new Outlook.com only&nbsp;displays unread messages in&nbsp;the currently viewed folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Unread category in the&nbsp;folder list of the&nbsp;old Outlook.com displayed unread messages&nbsp;across all of the folders; so it was easy to review emails that had been automatically filed by rules without having to open the individual folders where they were filed.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same issue. I used to use this feature a lot myself. I have found a workaround on this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I created a new category called 'Unread'.</p>
<p>Options -&gt; Layout --&gt; Categories : </p>
<p>&nbsp; Added a new personal category called 'Unread'</p>
<p>&nbsp; Marked it to be &nbsp;'Show in folder pane' and 'filter'</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. made a new rule to mark all the new incoming mail as 'Unread' category</p>
<p>Options -&gt; Mail -&gt; Inbox and Sweep rules</p>
<p>&nbsp; New Inbox rule</p>
<p>&nbsp; When the message&nbsp;arrives -&gt; [Apply to all messages]</p>
<p>&nbsp; Do all of the following -&gt; Mark the message with the category --&gt; Unread</p>
<p>&nbsp; Uncheck "Stop processing more rules"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So every time a new mail arrives it is marked 'Unread' category, so all I have to do is click on this category to see all the new incoming unread messages. Unfortunately, you will have to find and 'read' the older unread messages individually (for now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Nice workaround, there is only one thing. With this new interface, the way connected accounts are managed has also changed, my rules do not apply anymore on emails retrieved from connected accounts.</p>
<p>So this workaround does not work neither on the connected accounts...</p>

<p>In both instances the phone freezes endlessly. Tapping on the Windows icon in the menu bar results in a few seconds wait and then going back to desktop. It's been like this for a few days now.</p>
<p>It looks like I am not able to check for updates anymore. </p>

<h2>            Some cells are not locking&#33;</h2>
                    All cells are "LOCKED" but when I protect the sheet only some of the cells are locking.&nbsp; I've done this at least 50 times in the past year with this exact workbook, now all of a sudden some cells will not lock.&nbsp; I tried deleting the cells &amp; recreating
 - sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.&nbsp; The formatting on these worksheets took a very long time and I don't want to recreate them.

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1) The spreadsheet is saved on our network drive and is macro-enabled. It is shared via email and will eventually be shared on a Sharepoint site.</p>
<p>2) We don't lock cells on most of our excel docs, so I haven't needed to do this to any others.</p>
<p>3) I've tried copying and pasting the worksheet I'm having problems with, but the same thing is happening on the new worksheet I paste it into.&nbsp; However, worksheets created new seem to lock fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will take me days to re-do and I'm trying to avoid that.&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

<p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes apologies for not replying. I'd forgotten my Office 365 login. I couldn't establish if anything was wrong with any of the emails. &nbsp;What I did do was tick the box - send all emails as Bcc. &nbsp;This seemed to resolve it and the email sent. &nbsp;About a week later
 I got a message saying one of the emails couldn't be delivered because the server no longer existed. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Google calendar invites onto an exchange calendar&#63;</h2>
                    When I receive a calendar invite in Mac Outlook 2011 from someone sending the invite through google, it appears like any other meeting request. But when I accept it, it doesn't appear on my Exchange calendar (and thus doesn't appear across my devices).
 Instead, it goes onto the "On my mac" calendar.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I try to move the meeting itself to the Exchange calendar in the calendar view, but it's locked into the On my Mac calendar.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea how to address this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div>

<h2>            Office 2010&#58;-Picture Manager Does Not Rotate Cellphone Images Correctly</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Answers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If somebody sends me a photo attachment from their cell phone, let's say a traditional JPEG file, it often shows up in my email sideways or upside down.&nbsp; I use Office Picture Manager in Office 2010 to rotate the image, and than save it.&nbsp; I can resize the
 image fine in Picture Manager.&nbsp; The problem is that if I send the photo to someone, it does not "remember" that Picture Manager rotated the photo for me.&nbsp; I use Windows 10 Anniversary Update and I have to use the Rotate Photo in Photo Viewer built into Windows
 10 to successfully rotate cellphone images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do later versions of&nbsp;Office, have this same problem?&nbsp; Can users still edit pictures in for example later versions of Word, because Picture Manager has been discontinued as of Office 2013 and above?</p>
<p>

<p>That link doesn't really answer the question,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to save a picture in Office Picture Manager using those steps.&nbsp; The changes save fine when the image is re-opend in Office Picture Manager.&nbsp; But the photo reverts back to it's original rotation when opening the image with another program.&nbsp; I also
 have the latest Office Updates.&nbsp; They come through Windows Update Automatically in Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            HTC Touch Pro 2 cannot connect via USB and can not charge via USB but th cable is good</h2>
                    Hello and good morning to all.<br />
<br />
I live in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Three months ago I bought a NEW HTC Touch Pro 2 with Win Mobile 6.1 via ebay. The phone was working perfectly until past Friday when suddenly the battery state went low (being in sleep mode) and then the phone was
 shut down. When I realized the problem was related to low battery, being the battery new and the phone was not heavily used, I decided to recharge the phone, then I discovered that now the phone does not sync with the windows 7 laptop and also when the phone
 is on, it won´t charge via the wall or the PC. I discovered that if I turn off the phone and then connect it to the wall, it will start charging and then I can turn it on. But if again I unplug the cable and plug it again, it will not charge.<br />
I made a soft reset and nothing changed, then I cleared the memory and nothing happened. I then made a Hard Reset and still nothing changes.<br />
<br />
The phone actually lasts about four hours on sleep mode when I´m out and the battery was 100 % charged, so, the battery seems to be bad, but it went bad all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
As I cannot connect via USB I can not do an upgrade, etc. Strangely, whe I connect the phone to the laptop, it presents the options to select ActiveSync or Disc Drive. I have selected all options available in the connections settings to no avail. I think I´m
 a bit savvy with computers (I´m 42 years old and have been working with computers since IBM AT and XT computers in 1988)<br />
<br />
Please help me to repair my phone, as I think is not possible for me to send it to China via international courrier and wait months with out phone for the device to come back.<br />
<br />
Thank you a lot in advance.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello. Hmmm. The Touch Pro 2 is probably at least 3-4 years old. It is difficult to imagine that you were able to find a "new" one unless it was in storage for a long time. Was any guarantee given on the state of the battery? If not, I would order a new
 one as if it wasn't kept charged during storage, it may be bad just from no use. Completely discharging the battery is not good for it either. I would keep in contact with the seller to keep your options to return the phone open if there was any warranty.
 It seems right now that the battery is not holding charge well. </p>

            Thank you for your time. Let me explain better. The phone is/was new. The box, the manual, accompaning cd and the plastics covering the front of the phone. The phone itself still looks like new with no scratches, etc. The phone was working absolutely fine
 for three months.<br />
Concerning the USB connection, I tried with three different cables and the problem is that although the phone presents the option to select active sync or disk drive, neither option that I select will connect. Let me explain it again: I connect the phone, it
 presents the menu, I select any option or set the phone to connect automatically without user intervention and nothing happens! is like I didn´t connected the phone. That´s why I know the problem is the phone or the software in it. I even reinstalled active
 sync but the problem is not the laptop or the laptop´s software. To put it simple, you connect the phone to the wall or to anything with a good cable and it does nothing. As I said before, to get the phone to accept charge I have to turn it completely off
 and then it accepts charge.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your valuable time.<br />

            <p>Hello. Just to confirm that the battery is holding the charge and not discharging quickly. As I said, the device may have been new but stored for a long period of time without the battery being charged. It is not good for Li ion batteries. I hope you did
 not use the CD to install the Activesync on your XP PC. You should use the d/l link here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15</a></p>
<p>Please check this setting on your phone. Go to Start&gt;settings&gt;connection tab&gt;USB to PC. What options are there and what are checked? If you have a setting "enable advanced network connectivity", please make sure that is unchecked. Also, I'd like to confirm
 that you did do a hard reset and it was successful.</p>

<p>This is unusual behavior. It should start to charge as soon as the AC is connected. Can you try to take the battery out, leave it out for an hour or so, and see if that helps at all?

<br />
Thank you again for your help, I appreciate the time you spend trying to help me.<br />
<br />
The manual says never charge the phone without the battery, maybe is not convenient.<br />
<br />
Don´t let my poor english fool you, I´m very savvy with computers (once I learned how to program in assembler for the Z80)<br />
<br />
You can bet that I tryed everything possible on the phone, especially in the connections page. Or you mean to leave it out without charging?<br />
Maybe that´s what you mean after all.<br />
<br />
This is very weird, up to last Friday the phone was perfectly fine, the battery was behaving fine, I always used it with wifi off and bluethooth off, no internet plan, just a smart phone for business purposes (PDF, Exel, Notes...)<br />
<br />
Today I noticed another problem: I always leave it charging in the night to the wall charger. It is supposed to be in "Sleep Mode" but when I press the power button then I notice it was shut down by itself. If I leave it charging in sleep mode, after several
 hours it shuts off by itself.<br />

            <p>Hello. No, don't try to charge it, just take the battery out. You should leave it out as long as you can before replacing it. Overnight&nbsp;is good. That is another test of your battery. If you lose&nbsp;some charge with no&nbsp;power&nbsp;drain, it is not good. &nbsp;Your English
 is very good. Much better than my Spanish, which is zero. I should be more clear. You will find, though, that these mobile devices are quite different than computers. When I ask for info, &nbsp;I just want to make sure settings are correct before I go on to the
 next area of troubleshooting. It in no way reflects on anyone's computer abilities.
</p>
<p>It sounds like you should get a good 2-3 days of use between charging the way you are using the phone, not 4 hrs. I am sure you know about the Power and Screen settings. Please make sure these are not set for extreme discharging.
</p>
<p>On your PC, I would like to see if the driver is loading. Please go to Device Manager. Plug in the phone USB. Please try to keep the phone on AC power and not just battery. You should see some activity and the loading of drivers. It should be Windows Mobile
 Remote Adapter in Network Adapters node and HTC USB sync in Mobile Devices/Portable devices. Anything show up?

            Nop, nada. I tried that before starting the post. I did it several times, watching carefully to see if something changes in device manager but as you may guess is like the phone does not communicate with the laptop. I'll take your advice and will see if
 there is some kind of warranty in ebay.<br />

            <p>Hello. Well, since you said that it was working fine for 3 mos, I think you should try to get a new battery. They aren't that expensive. They are considered "consumable" items that can go out at any time. It is not like an iPhone where you can't replace
 the&nbsp;battery. &nbsp;I would doubt that the battery would have any warranty. However, I would explain to the seller your problem and if, upon replacing the battery you still have the problem, what your recourse is. The cable seems fine as it can deliver a charge
 and illicit some response from the phone as you said it asked for Activesync or disk drive. It is just that the battery is discharging too rapidly. The security software and residual partnerships can also prevent the device from connecting. Try to turn off
 your firewall/AV. Also, see if you have this registry key on the PC using regedit:</p>
<p><span>Hkey_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Windows CE Services\Partners</span>
</p>
<p>On the phone, do you have a registry editor? If not d/l&nbsp; and install this program
<a href="http://www.phm.lu/products/PocketPC/RegEdit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.phm.lu/products/PocketPC/RegEdit/<br />
</a>See if you have this registry key:</p>
<p>Hkey_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Activesync\Partners </p>
<p>Oh, I was also thinking, you could get a Bluetooth dongle for your PC and we can try to connect that way.</p>

    <title>caldav and cardav for windows 10 phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s_r_x  say:</h3>
<h2>            caldav and cardav for windows 10 phone</h2>
                    <p>I am using an android phone so far and in order to switch to a windows phone, I do need access to my cloud services. This is done using the caldav standard for calendar entries and the carddav standard for contacts.
<br />
</p>
<p>The version of windows 10 phone that I checked last did not have support for caldav and carddav. There was / is a workaround using a fake icloud account, but I will not base a long term decision about a platform for mobile devices on a workaround that might
 stop working any time soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the question is: </p>
<p>Is there or will there be an official support for caldav and carddav standards on windows phones, so that users can access cloud services (for example: owncloud) other than the ones provided by the big companies (icloud, onedrive, etc.)?</p>

            Down then across won't work for a subreport - pagination in a report is controlled by the main report; the subreport doesn't "know" when the page ends, so it cannot decide when to start a new column. You *must* use across then down.

            <p>There is a really convoluted way to do that by creating a sort field in the subreport's record source query&nbsp;that makes across then down look as if it were down then across.</p>
<p>If you can get by without using CanGrow on the subreport control, then you can make the subreport control an appropriate height so that it "knows" when it should start a new column.&nbsp; Trying to adjust the subreport control's Height so the columns are balanced
 might be possible, but I haven't tried it..</p>

Not quite so much sense as you might think as it worked perfectly well in Access 95.&nbsp; I recall dealing with a post back in the old CompuServe forum just after Access 97 was introduced when I couldn't understand why the member was encountering a problem as I
 was still using the old version.&nbsp; Given that it previously worked, quite why Microsoft have been unable to address this well known problem since then is a mystery to me.<br />

            I don't know about that Ken.&nbsp; Attempting to divide the number of records by the number of columns and using that to predetermine the number of records in a column can easily be defeated by CanGrow/CanShrink.&nbsp; Trying to work around that difficulty by using
 multiple passes can run into more trouble with KeepTogether.&nbsp; In general, this can end up in an infinte loop where KeepTogether can force a detail to a different column which in turn forces another row, but adding a row moves the KeepTogether problem detail
 back to its original column which elimates the need for extra row and around and around it goes.&nbsp; Determining when/how to break out of that kind of loop almost always ends up looking kind of funky.

            The point I was making was that in Access 95 it worked straight out of the box.&nbsp; You simply set the column flow to 'down then across' in the report definition, and when you embedded the report as a subreport that is what it did.&nbsp; It was only in Access
 97 that things went AOT and prevented 'newspaper columns' being used in a subreport.
<br />
<br />
Access 95 was the first version I used, and I couldn't understand why users were reporting a problem with something I was doing perfectly satisfactorily.&nbsp; It was only when somebody who'd moved from 95 to 97 pointed out that their subreports no longer functioned
 correctly that the penny dropped.&nbsp; I subsequently found this out for myself when I upgraded of course.<br />
<br />
The fact that Microsoft have never been able to reinstate the functionality available in Access 95 suggests that there was some pretty fundamental change in the report engine which precluded this.<br />

                    <p>I don't know how many MS people actually look at the site to see how it easy / difficult is to ask a QUESTION!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My troubles began when I upgraded my iPod touch.</p>
<p>I had been running Windows 8.1 FOREVER - OEM Samsung install registered with MS since day 1!</p>
<p>I was part of the beta Win 10 program almost since day 1.</p>
<p>It verified that I was entitled and allowed my computer to be part of your Beta program.</p>
<p>I don't know why but the iPod just wouldn't be recognized on this desktop computer BUT OK on my laptop also upgraded to Win 10; so I concluded the issue to be with my desktop. I tried countless searches but in the end I decided to do a clean install and
 hence my new 2 nightmares: Windows 10 activation &amp; Office 2013.</p>
<p>I was just told that I have to re-install Windows 8.1 because of some MS BS.</p>
<p>I can tell you if I do NO WAY is Win 10 coming back on and NO WAY Office 2013.</p>
<p>I'm just fed up with this stupid archaic choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way my English is perfect but your help desk could use a lesson or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At this point I really don't expect much from MS so unless a miracle happens I will revert back to 8.1 and download a Open Office as m patience has run out.&nbsp; I WILL CHECK NOT TO UPGRADE and next computer will be an iMac!</p>

            <p>It is absolutely simple !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reload the FULL system backup(s) that you made for win 8.1 onto each machine. Office will be on the same backup. - there you go, machines back up and running great. !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact apple about the ipod thing as it has absolutely JACK all to do with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are making a lot of fuss about nothing at all. You joined the insider program and were told at the beginning that you needed a reasonable level of technical knowledge. Making system FULL backups prior to changing an OS does not even fall into the category
 of 'reasonable level', it is absolutely BASIC level.</p>
<p>As you failed to do that, the fault is yours.</p>
<p>Oh, and Win 8.1 ??? &nbsp;'forever' ???? &nbsp;what ?</p>
<p>Ask your parents, or a teacher as they may be able to help also.</p>

                    Why is my 'No Fill' color something other than white? It's green for eeeeeverything, the background, borders, lines, font, etc. I cannot figure out how to change the standard color. I use Microsoft Word for Mac 2008, I believe.

    <title>How do I report a Skype user pretending to be me on another - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesmeek1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I report a Skype user pretending to be me on another website&#63;</h2>
                    I'm new to Skype. Mainly because I needed to see if an account exists under my user name from another website. I've searched and determined that it does. I've been informed that this Skype user is trying to contact people on this other website through
 Skype as if they're me.&nbsp; How do I report this person to Skype? From what I can tell, Skype has no actual customer service people to whom I can send my concern. They try to use their "virtual agent", which is of no help at all, or spin me off to the community
 in the hope that they hope will act as customer support. The Skype user acting as me elsewhere is of course not in my list of contacts, so it's not like just a simple blocking of someone I'm no longer friendly with. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;

<h2>            SharePoint Online Page Loading Very Slow &#126;10-11am EST</h2>
                    <p>I'm having trouble with our company SharePoint site with pages loading very slowly approximately between the hours of 10-11 est. All other websites seem to be doing fine. I ran through the SharePoint performance troubleshooting site and see no issues. As
 other sites are fine I don't think it is our firewall.</p>
<p>I've attached a screen shot of the Networking Performance screen showing where the performance issue is, right when the page loads. This is happening with all pages on SharePoint, normally between 5-10 sec.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to first monitor so I know when it is happening (right now users tell me) and how I could fix?</p>

            Hey Taylor,
<div><br />
<div>Jim provides a quick workaround on the following thread:</div>

<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>To really figure out where the issue is, let’s create a new user account and then test. Follow the steps on the link below to create a new user account:</div>

<div><br />
<div>Once you've created the new account, log into it and test. Does the same issue occur?</div>

<div>If not, let’s try resetting the PowerPoint preferences and see if that helps. Log into your main account, click on the link below and follow Step 1:&nbsp;</div>

                    My computer was activated under a work Office 365 (ProPlus) account. That account has been cancelled and I have installed Office 365 under a personal account. However, every time I use an Office 365 program I have to log in and it keeps asking me to login
 in with the account the device was activated under. But my boss deleted that account so I can't. How can I remove it permanently from my device? I only want my personal Office 365 account. The other one doesn't exist anymore, so I can't even login to remove
 it.&nbsp;

            Dear Caryl,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Could you please specify: you did uninstall your Office 365 ProPlus before installing Office 365 Personal ? How many Office installations do you have at the moment ?
<br />
<br />Please do the following:
<br />1. Go to your System settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Email and Accounts and remove your old account that was deleted
<br />2. Open any Office application, such as Word or Excel, and select Account. Under Product Information, you'll find your Office product name and, in some cases, the full version number. Check which account do you see there
<br />3. Type in Cortana Word and see how many applications you will see
<br />
<br />Please share the results
        </p>

<p>Thanks LA. The only account I have in my system - Accounts - Emails and accounts is my personal one. Work one has been removed. But I see my work one does show up under Settings - Access work or school. Should I also delete it here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word Product Information my personal Office 365 account shows up, but so does my work one. The work one says ' Word couldn't verify your subscription. Please make sure you're connected to the internet.'</p>

            Dear Caryl, 
<br />
<br />It is better to remove work account ( especially that is not existing anymore ) from everywhere. 
<br />
<br />As for Word, please sign out from all accounts and than sign in only with your Microsoft Account.

<h2>            Lost Excel File</h2>
                    I recently tried to open a file that had been in my Excel for years. However, when I clicked on the the file in "the recently opened files" list the prompt advised me that the file did not exist and that it might have been renamed, removed or deleted,
 To the best of my knowledge I have not renamed, removed or deleted the file. The fact that it was in the most recently opened files list proves that it did exist. Help! What can I do to retrieve this file.<br />

<p><span>I recently tried this tool. It claims to recover files from deleted file fragments. It seems to work. On my 100GB data partition it ran for about 1 hour and found 691 files, 450 MB, going
 back almost 7 months! I don’t remember if that was the last time I used a wipe freespace tool on my drive They definitely were not in my recycle bin.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Don’t do first auto run . The interface provides lots of Filter criteria such as: date created range, last saved range, last printed range, title, num pages, editing time, revision number, file type, author.
</span></p>
<p><span>All of the recovered files I looked at were properly structured.</span></p>
<p><span>Site has a 30 day moneyback guarantee. I haven’t tried it, but that sounds encouraging.</span></p>

            <p>The first place to look is in your Recycle Bin to make sure you haven't accidentally deleted it.&nbsp; If it's there, just restore it and it'll be put back into its original location.</p>
<p>The second place to look would be in the folder where it was stored.&nbsp; If it's still in your Excel 2003 recent files list, that will show the full path to it.&nbsp; Go look and see if it actually is in the folder.&nbsp; If it is, definitely make a copy of it and put
 that somewhere safe.</p>
<p>If you can't find it where it should be by actually looking in the folder then do a search of My Computer for the complete filename.&nbsp; If that doesn't turn up anything, do another search of My Computer for *.xls which will show you all Excel files on your
 computer (be sure and include hidden and system folders in the search).</p>
<p>If that fails, then try to remember when the last time was that you made a copy of it, whether it was to another hard drive, to a thumb drive, to a CD or DVD or anywhere and try to recover and go from there with it.</p>
<p>If you don't already have one, now might be a good time to develop and implement a backup strategy.&nbsp; You don't want to wake up sometime in the future and find other valuable files, pictures, etc. lost for some inexplicable reason.</p>

    <title>Filtering on column using vba withcells having multiple criteria - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Filtering on column using vba withcells having multiple criteria</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way through VBA to filter on a column of data that stores multiple values in a cell?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For example, column A contains inventory and could store one or more values in each row (i.e. oak, ash, cedar or oak).&nbsp; I need the macro to filter on those cells
<strong>containing </strong>"oak".&nbsp; I tried using the following code, but it does not&nbsp;work.&nbsp; Note, there is a second filter included in&nbsp;column B (field 2), but is not an issue.</p>
<p>Additinally, is it possible to filter on multiple criteria in column A (field 1), if necessary?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Sub Filter ()</p>
<p>Dim lngProduct as String</p>
<p>'user selects a value in B7 of the Final Result worksheet, this is the value they are wanting&nbsp;colum A to be filtered</p>
<p>&nbsp;lngInventory= Range("B7").Value ' in this example "oak"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sheets("Inventory").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.AutoFilter</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Range("A1:Q65000").AutoFilter Field:=1, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criteria1:="&amp;*lngInventory*", Operator:=xlFilterValues</p>
<p>
</p><p>Range("A2").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
'Looks for inventory where&nbsp;status is "Incomplete" - only one status is available per cell in this column<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Range("A1:Q65000").AutoFilter Field:=2, Criteria1:="Incomplete"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>

            <p>I am a bit confused. You dimension lngProduct as a string and then assign "oak" to&nbsp;lngInventory that has not been dimensioned. Also it is usual to prefix string variables with str; lng is the prefix&nbsp;for long integers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following&nbsp;assigns oak to strProduct and then concatenates the wild cards (asterisks) with the variable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your 2nd question, you need to create an array of the &nbsp;list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that AutoFilter.Range is the generic object for the filtered range so you do not need to specify a specific range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AutoFilter toggles AutoFilter On and Off so if using it then you need to set AutoFilterMode to False to ensure&nbsp;AutoFilter is off first otherwise the code might turn if off if AutoFilter has been previously set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn on AutoFilter, you only need to specify one cell in the range and AutoFilter is applied to all of the adjacent data. (Called as the CurrentRegion in VBA.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure about where you are getting Range("B7"). If from another worksheet then include the worksheet name as I have done in the example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Filter()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strProduct As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim arrFilter() As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strProduct = Worksheets("Sheet2").Range("B7").Value ' in this example "oak"<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - Tasks - Stop using &#34;To-Do List&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been using Outlook 2003 with my Exchange account on all of my computers until recently when I installed Outlook 2010 on my laptop. I've no real complaints, but there are few things that irk me. One such issue is how Outlook 2010 switches to the "To-Do
 List" view and doesn't remember my preference for just seeing active items in the top-level Tasks folder (whereas the To-Do List shows all incomplete tasks in all subfolders).</p>
<p>I can't see any option to remove the TDL folder view or even any "use as default" option.</p>

            You can't remove it or change the default - but you can create a view for the to-do that displays only tasks. If the custom view doesn't stick, restart outlook using the /cleanviews switch then create the view.

<h2>            N85 freezes while plugged in wall charger and alarm goes off</h2>
                    I plugged N85 to wall charger and set the alarm for the morning and found that it froze. Screen light is on. Does not respond to any buttons and CAN NOT TAKE calls. When I take the battery out and restart it, once it is on and alarm starts again it freezes
 again in 2 seconds (this time not connected to the wall charger). I found that I can prevent N85 freezing if I press the close the alarm button just at the moment the phone is coming on (after the PIN was entered).<br />
<br />
So far, none of the problems prevented taking calls. Phone crushing all the time was the major issue but it came on by itself. I have to be able to take calls. This is just too much.<br />
<br />
I did not yet have a firmware update. For my phone Nokia Software Updater does not show an update yet. I checked the Nokia web page using the code for the phone. Still the same.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to share. Other than not using the alarm any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            my suggestion would to first do a backup of all your important data on your phone to your computer using Nokia PC Suite or Nseries PC Suite. then do a hard reset of your phone (or just restore to factory settings through the menu option in the phone).
 then after that, try and contact your local nokia care centre and see if they can offer you a firmware update to 11.047.<br />
<br />
if your phone is generic and unbranded, then they should be able to do this, but if your phone is network-branded (e.g. Vodafone), then you will just have to wait until they release approved 11.047 update for their users
