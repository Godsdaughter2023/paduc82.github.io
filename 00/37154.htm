<p>Error 1607 when installing programs Win7 Ultimate 64-bit.</p>
<p>When is there going to be an update to the windows installer? I have reinstalled win7 for the last time. I have always had the error code 1607 whenever I try to install an program or game that uses the msi. I have tried all the fixes I have found online
 to no avail and right about now I'm ready to toss this copy in the can.</p>
<p>IS there going to be an update to the installer? If so, when?</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get my PROPlantronics Ear Piece to connect to Dell 370 Bluetooth Mini-card</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't get my PROPlantronics earpiece to connect to my laptop.&nbsp; I have a Dell's studio series laptop that I've recently upgraded to Windows 7.&nbsp; I still don't have a couple of things working.&nbsp; This is about my PROPlantronics earpiece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried installing the latest drivers from Dell, and uninstalling and reinstalling the device.&nbsp; The problem is that I can't find any place that lets me tell the computer to connect the device and it doesn't connect itself.&nbsp; So, I'm not sure if it is supposed
 to connect itself and that is not working, or if I do not know where to go to connect the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Windows Vista the Bluetooth screen came up with&nbsp; an audio device page that listed out my earpiece.&nbsp; I just clicked on that to connect or disconnect.&nbsp; There doesn't appear to be available on Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything worked before.&nbsp; Does anybody have some ideas for me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<span>Hi TomCougar2,</span></p>
<p>
<span>You might need to make your computer discoverable to Bluetooth devices, or set Windows to alert you when a new device tries to connect to your computer. To do this, you need to control how
 your computer pairs with (connects to) Bluetooth devices.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>To control how your computer pairs with Bluetooth devices</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Control Panel by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Control Panel search box, type
<strong>Bluetooth</strong>, and then click <strong>Change Bluetooth settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>Bluetooth Settings</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Options</strong> tab and do any of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To make your computer discoverable to Bluetooth devices, select the check box for
<strong>Allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span>When a Bluetooth enabled computer is in discovery mode, it broadcasts a wireless signal that allows it to be detected by other Bluetooth enabled computers or devices. This is sometimes called
<em>pairing mode</em>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<span>I would also suggest you to refer the below mentioned links.</span></p>

    <title>Can log in to Windows 10 but then nothing happens &#40;I can see - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moorshead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can log in to Windows 10 but then nothing happens &#40;I can see curser on black but nothing else&#41;</h2>
                    <p>That's the problem. I've tried restarting in safe mode which does nothing. Tried a full shutdown and reboot which hasn't fixed it either. My daughter has the same problem with her account on this computer. However, my wife's account is fine. I have noticed
 that the reboot screen and the windows start icon are coloured mustard. This may be a clue to the problem; previously, when the log-in worked, the reboot screen was blue and the start icon white. It's the same when my daughter tries to sign on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

</p><p>What happens if you press Ctrl+Alt+Delete?&nbsp; Can you start Task Manager?&nbsp; Then check out the status of explorer.exe.&nbsp; If there isn't one it explains your symptom.&nbsp; Then try starting it.&nbsp; If there is one try using right-click Restart.&nbsp; Otherwise you can also

            <p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur if you do not have file user permission or if the system files and folders are missing from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you the administrator of the user profile?</span></li><li><span>Since when are you facing the above issue? Did you make any recent changes to the computer?</span></li><li><span>Are the ‘Pictures’ stored in system hard drives or external drive?</span></li><li><span>Does the issue occur only on moving the pictures from one file location to another?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue might occur if the system files and folders are missing or corrupted on the corrupted. I suggest you to run
<strong>SFC scan</strong> and <strong>DISM scan</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is caused due to any of the missing or corrupted app files and folders on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span>
</strong><span>Open an <strong>
Administrator command prompt </strong>window by</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Yes</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></li><li><span>Check if it says
<strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: </span>
</strong><span>Type the following commands in the
<strong>CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><strong>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: </span>
</strong><span>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            I could not redeem prepaid code, it says something went wrong&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have purchased a prepaid card at a gameshop yesterday, and I've been trying to redeem the code ever since then. It won't work.</p>
<p>I have tried to redeem it on my computer, in which I move my cursor to my account on top rught clicking that "Redeem Code." After going through the steps and putting the code in, the page shows:</p>
Something went wrong
<div>Sorry about that. Give it a try in a while.</div>

<div>So I decide to give a try on Xbox One.</div>

<div>I followed this page to redeem to my account:</div>

<p>And it also shows the same message as that on my PC.</p>
<p>Something wrong with this code?</p>

<p>Can someone please help me?</p>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Alright, first off I'm not sure how or if you can tell which country your gamertag is set to except to remember when you set up your gamertag. &nbsp;It has nothing to do with the Hotmail email address.</p>
<p>You could change your region to the US in order to use the code. &nbsp;However, this is not recommended as you would then have trouble purchasing or downloading items because you physically live in a different country. &nbsp;Also, when you change region you cannot change it back for 3 months.</p>

<h3> patriciastuart ftw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10, need to reset pc back to MF setup</h2>
                    <p>I have now spent in excess of 37 hours on my own and with MS techs my DT, Yesterday and the day before I had a 2 hour session with the techys in India and was told I would get a call back today at 12.00, it is now 18.00! Since 15.00 I have remained at second
 position in the on line help queue§ All very frustrating to have my machine fiddled with by MS and then to be just abandoned apparently! How long must I sit here with no workable pc before somebody comes back from MS to sort out what they started. Yes you
 are right, I'm not very happy having sat here for a good few hours already. The problems only started when I updated Win 10 with the latest updates and now I've got to completly clean my complete system and start over after the discovery of corrupted drives
 through a compatibility issue. I have no idea what they have done or how they have left my machine..... all I know is.......... its got more corrupted since MS techy's had a go at it...... Grrrrrrrrh
</p>
<p>I just need to know why I am being held in number 3 slot for so long, MS has never ever spent 3 hrs working on my case, 1.5 tops! Anyone give me a clue what I can do about getting some one to help??</p>

            Hi PatriciaSTUART,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I understand your frustration by what you describe I would be very unsatisfied
<br />
<br />Our community is composed of independent advisors that try to help users with issues that arise with their computer.  We are not affiliated with Microsoft.  
<br />
<br />My personal recommendation would be to either call the number that you have been calling or other number that you might have been provided.  Along with the call have your incident number and express your need for service.
<br />
<br />Other option is to post your questions here and either I or another one of our collegues will try to help you out as best as possible.
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

<p>Thank you so much for coming back so quickly, incidentally, I'm still No 2 in the queue, 4 hours now<br />
My problem started when my pc just locked up, its done it about four times over the last 18 months, when I reboot its fine again but with my work it is a bit risky chancing something happening so the last time I took it to the repair shop and it came back worse
 than it went in. I am English living and working in France, but having a pc system in French is not an option as my tech french is non-existent. What happened is the repaire put a new HD in and loaded French version of Win10 64bit, my original build was Win
 7 with the 10 Upgrade running Office 2007 Pro, worked fine until the more recent Win10 upgrades ( Yes, in part my fault as I didn't realize that Office 2007 only came in 32 bit).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest 3 W10 updates, the MS tech tells me is completely uncompromising with compatibility and thus my pc is corrupted and each time I or they reinstall 10 the problem is worse, even changes the IP address! So now, the best thing for me to do is to reset
 the complete machine, set it for 64 bit and reinstall Win 10 Pro with Office 365 or Office 2019 (I am aware that Office 2019 is to be released soon, but MS wont/cant give me a date yet. Incidentally I purchase via the companystore so I am not certain if nthere
 will be a reinstall issue. PS Sorry this is a long reply...... but you did offer:)&nbsp;</p>

            Patricia... yes I did offer and I did mean it too :)
<br />
<br />Lets start by my asking you some questions.  Based on what you describe I am a bit confused.  Is your computer running but after a while or did the tech call make it worse and now the computer wont boot up?  Do you see any errors and if you do what are the errors?
<br />
<br />If you can get into your computer
<br />1.  Execute a command prompt in administrator mode by pressing the Windows+R
<br />2.  Type "cmd" (no quotes)
<br />3.  Right click on the "cmd.exe" and select Run as administrator
<br />4.  At the command prompt type "sfc /scannow" (no quotes)
<br />
<br />Allow it to finish and restart your computer.  See if that helps.

            Sorry about that. The pce is running (Im doing this on it) the last thing the MS tech did via remote was to stop the updates from loading as each time the updates where installed the machine did all manner of odd things in file corrupting and IP addy changes
 but when he disconnected the remote, the machine updated anyway, so I had to restore to the last point and now all. The MS techy from down town Bombay just left me to get on with it.<br />
I want to do is reset the pc back to its factory settings, the problem with that could be that the desktop is a custom built model with a Asus motherboard so not sure what will happen but it is a 64 Bit system for certain. Will try your suggestion and let you
 know, thanks again

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10.

<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home

<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB).

<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Thank you for all this great information, vm appreciate. There is still one problem, there are a lot of 32 bit files left in the system from the old Office 2007 and it is those that are causing the problems with the Win 10 installs that I've done to date.
 In short what I need to do is completly purge the system back to its build state then install 64 W10Pro, then once all that is up to date decided whether to add, Office 365, Office 2016 or wait for the new Office 2019.</p>
<p>I will certainly keep to hand your advice and will let you know how I get on. Again, big thx</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all the steps you showed me, and even tho they were really helpful with the PC"s performance overall but unfortunately it did not help solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I"m thinking it might have to do with the policies, but rather than conflicts with each other I fell it could be a conflict with Windows and Internet explorer&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will be great to hear from you again!</p>

            <p>Hi Jayant </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I am having is a server issue not a windows 7 issue (even tho I do not want to cross windows out just yet, as I said before all of the pcs/laptops are using windows 7) I feel that the delay and slow logins are a part of the multiple policies that
 are set up and whether they are conflicting with each other I have not figured out yet which yet but hoping to narrow it down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However that's what brought me here to try and conclude if it is a server issue or a windows or both :)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully by the end of the today I will be able to forward more clarifying information
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards </p>

<p>My PC is currently running in Windows 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already had assistance from a level 2 Microsoft technician after my PC got stuck in this boot loop who, after having failed to reinstall the 1803 update, used a third party website to reinstall back to 1709.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>He then suggested waiting until a later date to update to 1803 presumably hoping that a fix would be available then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my PC, a few days later, asked again to update to 1803 and did not give me an option to defer by more than 5 days I allowed the update to proceed but it crashed again to the previous boot loop cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use a recovery file created under 1709, but failed to recover back to 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install of my Windows 8 software and upgraded to Windows 8.1 and am still waiting to hear if the 1803 update is now bug-free to seek assistance to update to Windows 10 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC had crashed to a reboot loop when 1709 had updated earlier this year, and after quite a detailed series of calls and assistance from a level 3 Microsoft technician, he managed to get 1709 working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my latest enquiry to Microsoft support over the 1803 update crash, the level 1 and level 2 technician I spoke to suggested that the earlier assistance and details of the fix applied for the 1709 update were not accessible to them, since that had been
 successfully dealt with at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now being asked by Windows 10 to update to 1803 on my Acer laptop, and even though that had successfully updated to 1709 in January, I am reluctant to let it carry out the 1803 update because of the problem with my PC. Every time I get the forced message
 to update now or to pick a time in the next 5 days, I shut down my laptop without updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on vacation at present and will try not to let my laptop update to 1803 in case that causes my laptop to crash. It will be easier for me to seek assistance from Microsoft when I return home.<br />

            <p>Syed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Windows 10 troubleshooter in your link, but this did not discover any problems with Windows 10 Store Apps.&nbsp; Can you explain what a Store Apps troubleshooter is expected to fix regarding a problem with Edge sharing?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, for the first two weeks, I could share without any problems from Edge via email, and those emails were great.&nbsp; Now, with no indication of "why", I get "Something went wrong and we could not share..."&nbsp; With all due respect, WHAT on earth does
 this mean?&nbsp; I want to solve this, so what should I try next?&nbsp; I really don't want to just go, "Oh, well, something went wrong, I guess I'll just stop doing that," but THAT is what "Something went wrong" seems to suggest we do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look, Microsoft, do you want us to use this new browser and its amazing features?&nbsp; If so, GET ON THE BALL AND GET THIS THING UNDERSTOOD.&nbsp; HIRE SOME TIER-3 or TIER-4 ENGINEERS TO FINALLY FIX THIS AND WRITE SOME ARTICLES SO WE TECH-SAVVY FOLKS CAN HELP OURSELVES.&nbsp;
 But please don't direct us to an overly simplified "tool" that wants to fix something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PROBLEM: Users of Edge are unable to successfully share.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: Fix the problem or produce collateral so that users can solve this themselves.</p>

            I cannot use outlook 2016 to share from Edge. Perhaps they rushed Edge to market before making it fully compatible with other MicroSoft programs. Many other issues (stopping auto-run, ad blocking, etc.). Maybe by the second or third release it will work
 better.

            <p>Notice that I am writing this on August 4, 2016. &nbsp;The same problems still exist in Microsoft Edge that were there a year ago. &nbsp;Does no one at Microsoft know how to fix these annoying imperfections in a browser that has so much great potential? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Having to try two, three, four times to share to email or to social media</li><li>Having to go to Task Manager to end the process because the browser will not close normally</li><li>Waiting interminably just for the browser to load and then the same for individual&nbsp;pages</li><li>Not being able to import email contacts so as to be able to share more conveniently: why is the "Directory" always empty? &nbsp;Is there actually a "Directory"?</li></ul>
<p>Come on, Microsoft! &nbsp;Finish the job. &nbsp;Bring Edge up to the level of Opera, or even the old Internet Explorer. &nbsp;Right now it is a very inferior version of something that has the potential for being great.</p>

            I ran the troubleshooter and it came back that it found nothing.&nbsp; I have not been able to use the SHARE feature in Edge - it comes up with an error that something went wrong!&nbsp;&nbsp; I was simply trying to share a webpage!&nbsp;&nbsp; I use Office 365 and assumed that
 I could simply email the web URL easily, but that hasn't been the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is a documented issue, I'd like to know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm ready to change my default to another browser - too many frustrating issues.

            <p>I've experienced the same problem with the Share feature of Edge.&nbsp; It's annoying and frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't share using email at all on my HP Spectre tablet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had no success getting this resolved!&nbsp;&nbsp; Ran the troubleshooting and it came up with nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I have Office 365 installed on my tablet and it should launch Outlook and enable me to share whatever webpage I'm on!&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>A week later I got another BSOD: WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR, again no error code. This BSOD has only happened once.</p>
<p>

            <p>Update report....</p>
<p>
</p><p>We moved the tower from where it was(it had no space in the back for the 2 fans since it was against a wooden wall) and the problems mostly stopped. It has been shutting down at random times after a few hours now but boots up just fine afterwards, I recently
 checked and the power cable at the bottom wasn't all the way in and an easy knock into it shut it off, so I've tightened it and it's day 3 since we moved it, seems good so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only problem I noticed and cannot explain is...when I was trying to update my game "Guild Wars 2" it would crash after a bit for some reason, but after going into "GeForce Experience" then clicking on "Use Optimal Settings" and GW2 stopped crashing and completely
 updated and plays fine.</p>

            <p>windows update said I needed kb2621440 and kb2667402. Both failed to install. </p>
<p>When I tried to find them on microsoft.com I first found these kb numbers for vista, then I searched google for "kb2621440 + windows7" and saw that existed also. The vista version downloads as Windows6.0-KB2621440-x86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The win7 version downloads as Windows6.1-KB2621440-x86</p>
<p>note 6.0 and 6.1</p>
<p>btw, The win7 version of kb2667402 downloads as Windows6.1-KB2667402-x86&nbsp;&nbsp; These ( the 6.1 versions) both installed without any problem!!</p>
<p>It seems to me that windows update accidentally downloads the vista version and then (of course) fails to install. search for the self-installer using the kb number with "windows7" as keyword and all should be well, good luck&nbsp;</p>

<p>MS isnt THAT stupid ;)</p>
<p>The update also exists for Windows 2003 and Windows 2008 and W2k8 R2 OS'</p>
<p>I have been looking for this one:</p>
<p>_http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=29115</p>
<p>MS says it is for Windows 7 64bit version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe it would be my mistake..&nbsp;Therefore I downloaded this installer (again)...</p>
<p>But yet again this one fails to install..</p>

            Understood, but the key is detected when the Dell logo comes up. In my experience with Dell computers, if you hit it before the logo nothing really happens. You have it hit it a few times when you see the Dell logo.

<h2>            My account has gotten banned for marketplace theft and I haven&#39;t done anything related to that.</h2>
                    <p>Hello there, Microsoft Support and Enforcement Team. My name is Patrick Givargiss and I am writing a forum, due to my account being permanently banned for marketplace theft and glitching the Xbox financial system. I would like to start off by saying that I am only 14 years old and I have no idea of how marketplace theft works, let alone what it is. I would never commit anything illegal that can and will jeopardize my Xbox Live account. Although, I can definitely see why my account billing history can lead to suspicion. I have received numerous refunds for failed transactions on a game called NBA 2K17. I understand that the policy is one courtesy refund every 365 days and i sincerely apologize contacting Xbox over and over again knowing this information. But, I can safely assure the Enforcement Team that I have not even thought about trying to embezzle money from the wonderful people at Xbox. I sincerely love and enjoy the multiplayer experience that Xbox has kindly given to me and I wou

            <p>I also wanted to let you guys know that this has been a common issue with 2k and I have been going to Xbox because there isn't a known solution for these failed transactions, but I feel like the solution would be to stop spending money on the game and even switching to another game. Again, I can definitely understand that my billing history can bring up suspicion of marketplace theft, but I have just been receiving refunds for the money that I lost during the failed transactions. I kindly request that this permanent suspension can be lifted and I hope that the Enforcement Team can review my situation as if they are in my shoes and they can understand the negative emotions I am feeling right now.</p>

            <p>Also, the gamertag of my account is NBA2KMESSIAH23. So, if the Enforcement Team could carefully review the situation again and realize that I didn't do anything wrong, besides going to Xbox numerous times for my failed transactions.</p>

            <p>Also, I just wanted to let you guys know that I play Xbox 2 days a week, due to the fact that I have school. I most definitely enjoy playing Xbox every chance that I get. I assure the Enforcement Team that I had nothing to do with any form of financial theft or glitching of a financial system. I don't know where this has come from. I just got off of a two week temporary suspension for verbal harassment, which I will never do again, so help me God, but I did absolutely nothing when it comes to marketplace theft. Please. I beg the entire enforcement team to reconsider your decision and unban my account. I know that my disciplinary history on Xbox hasn't been that great, but I promise that I will be careful of what I do or say from this moment on. I have invested over $1000 on NBA 2K17 on my banned account NBA2KMESSIAH23. I can't afford to lose that over a false accusation. I beg you to please unban my account and put me on notice that if anything goes wrong one more time, my account can be perman

</p><p>What a lazy response.&nbsp; Why are you even bothering to comment on this matter if you couldn't give any information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1196ab05-543a-4b25-8271-fcd7d27b8ba2">facefashion</a>:&nbsp; I had this error with this kodak printer I bought.&nbsp; I tried everything I could, including contacting their support
 (who knew nothing and did nothing).&nbsp; After exhausting all measures I tried imaging the computer using a different image and it worked.&nbsp; Turns out the first image I used did have the full set of SysWOW64 files.&nbsp; I know this isn't what you want to hear because
 if this is a personal computer it could be a little annoying reloading Windows on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*P.S. I know this comment is 5 years old but I hope this helps anyone else having this issue because I know it was annoying trying to find any valueable information on this online thanks to people like Palcouk would should stay out of the IT realm if they
 have such an issue with assisting.</p>
