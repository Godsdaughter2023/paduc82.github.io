                    I'm using Vista Home Premium and Virtual PC 2007 on a brand new HP G70-460US laptop.&nbsp; But the problem is that the&nbsp;mouse pointer inside VPC environment is slow and&nbsp;jerky.&nbsp; How can I solve this problem?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I don't have this problem on my old Toshiba

<p><span><span>Hi PJZMAN,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try deleting and reinstalling the driver for your mouse. You might also want to check and see if there’s an update driver for it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Another thing that you could try is clean booting your machine. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to place your computer in “clean boot”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>msconfig </strong>in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under Selective Startup, click to
<strong>clear the Load Startup Items check box</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to <strong>select the Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then
<strong>click Disable All</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong> OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is your mouse working better?<br />
<br />
If this <strong>does</strong> resolve the issue, then see the following Microsoft Article on “Clean boot” and the section “How to determine what is causing the problem” to determine which program or service maybe causing the issue.

    <title>No More Double Tap on Windows 10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drunken joy  say:</h3>
<h2>            No More Double Tap on Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    I got new Lumia 950XL the other day. While customizing the device, I noticed I can now double tap to turn off the device, but cant double tap to wake anymore. Is there a way to turn the feature back on that I am missing, or was it purposely removed from
 this new build of Windows Phone? Any solutions are appreciated. (Maybe removed to make people use Windows Hello?)

            <p>THANK YOU MICROSOFT FOR BRINGING THIS FEATURE BACK!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For those of you who don't know, if you have the latest build 10586.545 you can now go to SETTINGS&gt;EXTRAS&gt;TOUCH&gt;GESTURES and slide to&nbsp;ON "Wake up the phone when I double tap on the screen".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will enable the signature Windows Phone Feature Double-tap feature of Windows Phone Version 8.&nbsp; So if you loved this feature, now it's back!&nbsp; Why it was removed, who knows, but it is now back.&nbsp; THANK GOD!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what these people at Microsoft are thinking at the top but it's probably that 'Old School Corporate Mentality the Builders of The Titanic had'!&nbsp; Like so many other fortune 500, 100, etc big companies.&nbsp; These guys get comfortable and then begin
 to 'coast' along while the rest of the tech world around them out competes them because they are asleep and out of touch with advancements in their related fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank God Microsoft is trying to wake up!&nbsp; Hopefully, they will smell the coffee and get out of bed completely!&nbsp; The 'Insider Program' has been a real 'Alarm Clock' for them and I hope these guys are able to hear what's ringing, wake up, and continue to
 implement, leading edge technologies within the 'Mobile Phone' category!&nbsp; Windows 10 Mobile can be that tool that changes the mobile world if Microsoft plays the entire field right and not just hit the ball once in a while to score a run.&nbsp; Play to Win The
 Game Microsoft!</p>

    <title>The battery on my Lenovo Edge 2 will not charge over 7&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donette_is_super_cool  say:</h3>
<h2>            The battery on my Lenovo Edge 2 will not charge over 7&#37;</h2>
                    <p>When I start my computer I get a low battery warning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which produces and removes a warning modal repeatedly. (It is super annoying)</p>
<p>The modal flashes on the screen for half a second or so then dismisses itself 8 or so times every time the computer comes out of sleep mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on my battery icon in my system tray it says:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"7% available (plugged in, charging)"</p>
<p>However, the battery never charges over 7% no matter how long I keep it plugged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>Driver updates for both AC adapter and battery.</p>
<p>Uninstalled both AC adapter and battery drivers and installed the newest version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed all approved updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other thing I can think of is trying to find a replacement power cord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any thoughts on what other fixes I should try?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Windows Apps and licenses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> salmmm22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Apps and licenses</h2>
                    <p>I just saw the following paragraph on a topic about a fresh install of Windows 10 at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>"You may lose your digital licenses, digital content associated with applications, or other digital entitlements for applications as a result of using the tool, which may impact your ability to use apps you paid for or app-related content you paid for. For
 this reason, we don’t recommend using this tool on any PC where you wish to ensure all of your applications and application-related content (including Microsoft applications such as Office) remain properly installed and licensed."</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I read that right, it is saying (in different terms and a different way, but very similar) that if you ever have to wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy of Win 10 that you would lose all your paid apps, music, licenses, etc. on the new installation.
 Is that true? If it is, I don't like having to attempt repairs or refreshes in some instances where a clean start works best. If it doesn't erase your rights, what are they trying yo say here? It's not the typical "let's reinstall and use again" terminology.</p>

            <p>This message is only applicable if you don't have the license key for Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 7, 8.1). As Microsoft only provides as the right to upgrade which provides us the digital license for Windows 10 using the license for the old Windows.
 Since this article focuses on Clean installation, this will totally wipe every data from the downloaded apps. Like for MS Office, of course you need to reinstall it with the license key. If your Office came pre-installed with your old Windows OS and you don't
 have a copy of the License key, you won't be able to re-install the Office apps. And for other Windows apps from the Store which you encounters some problems with the licenses or rights from the purchased apps, you need to contact their Accounts and Billing
 department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>

    <title>When I turn my computer on, previously set up profiles disappear and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacob grams  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I turn my computer on, previously set up profiles disappear and are replaced with &#39;Kiosk&#39; and &#39;other user&#39; options that require passwords. I can get into &#39;other user&#39; and find my previous user accounts, but lose them again after restart.</h2>
                    I bought a laptop with Windows 7 installed a few days ago. I proceeded to set up user accounts, one Administrator and one Guest. Until now i had been able to shut down and restart with the same user accounts re-appearing. I turned my computer on and two
 'user accounts' had replaced my previous ones. One named 'Kiosk', which requires a username and password to which I have no access, and one named 'other user' that requires a username and password. I type in Guest and no password and i am then able to access
 the Guest account. When i log off there my administrator profile is available next to my Guest account as normal. On restart 'Kiosk' and 'other user' accounts re-appear.&nbsp;If it is any help when i first turned on my computer i had accounts named&nbsp;MDX Kiosk and
 Administrator. I removed the MDX Kiosk account. I don't know if this is at all related. It isn't necessarily a big problem, but an inconvenience nonetheless and i freaked when all this popped up on my computer.

            You may be able to start Windows and restore to an earlier point in time; or even restore Windows from a recovery partition.&nbsp; The way to access a recovery partition is different between manufacturers e.g. Toshiba, HP, etc.
<br />
<br />
This is what worked for me, with a Toshiba Satellite F500<br />
<br />
1. Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
2. Repeatedly tap the <strong>F8</strong> key until you see the Advanced Boot Option Screen.<br />
<br />
3. Select <strong>Repair Your Computer</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<br />
4. Select your country keyboard &gt;&gt; <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
5. On the <strong>System Recovery Options Screen</strong> select <span style="font-weight: bold">
System Restore.</span><br />
<br />
This worked for me.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If it had not worked, the other option that I would have tried would have the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Toshiba Recovery Wizard</span> option).&nbsp; I assume that's a bit more drastic, and would reinstall Windows (factory fresh settings).<br />

            Yes you can uninstall MDX (It will be called Microsoft Digital Experience) and it will remove the kiosk account and any traces of it, then restart your machine. Any other accounts on the machine should remain, but I would do a backup first. That should
 fix your problem. The associates at the store you bought it from should have done this for you, why they didn't, I have no clue (we are instructed to do so before releasing the machine to customers). If you don't mind me asking, where did you purchase the
 machine?

<p>I think it's 'cause I feel lost using it. The other version I want to find read things more 'one at a time' like and made a 'clunk, or click' noise when my mouse hit something for the narrator to read. basically opposite features then the current one.</p>

<p>I researched the question some and i am afraid the only way I could find would be for you to revert back to your previous Build.</p>
<p>I think there are ways to delay the 1709 Upgrade from that Build including&nbsp; moving your toggle switch on either your Wi-Fi or Ethernet Connection to Metered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you choose to revert I'd do it soon as the Spring Creators Update (AKA Windows Version 1803) will be coming along SOON!</p>

<p>I had reverted back, and putting it to metored doesn't work the assistant program still shows up and reinstails itself no matter&nbsp; how&nbsp; many times I unstialed it. The Windows update mini tool doesn't work on my comp and newer versions of it won't fully instail.&nbsp;
 Even delting windows update from the windows servaces didn't work for getting the assistant program to not show up, and now 'cause of that my comp is kind of 'have a cold' just in the updates. Everything else works fine. Oddly for some games that I know by
 heart has sound to it isn't able to play the sounds. All video stuff works. Windows 10 has&nbsp; it's own flash player, but I wonder if I still need to install one since I uninstailed the&nbsp; outdated one. My&nbsp; real tech audio program works just fine. I find it odd
 I always see 'Radio device didn't accept the connection' in both my mail app, and when I use the troubleshooter. Al these problems is why I kept trying the upgrades afraid my laptop will get even sicker on me. I don't want to take it to the shop I have no
 back up laptop&nbsp; that&nbsp; has the newer versions of narrator. My first experience with the narrator I love and try to keep so much was when I first&nbsp; got the newer dell laptops with touchscreen. I also saw in the troublshoot all the time is 'Security settings have
 missing files, and how security settings have may have been&nbsp; changed.' I din't touch a thing in the security settings. the defender program when I clicked update button in the defender program it says 'You need to be connected' I am connected. See why I keep
 having no choice, but try a upgrade several times which always disables my audio player thing, and the upgrade always spits out any files X64 titled. The melishious software removal tool couldn't be instailed 'cause of having x64 in it's title. I don't know
 what to do anymore. I saw that I could just update the windows update program alone on other websites, but there's no windows 10 version for that. I'm trying to find a way to undelete the windows update servance too. I saw there's a way to reset windows update
 couldn't figure out how to use that properly so didn't try it. I thought resetting tools would help with the downloads never moving to one percent in the Windows update program. I think I listed every nook and cranny of what's wrong with my computer currently.</p>

<p>The Windows Update Assistant can be deleted by simply right-clicking it and selecting "delete."</p>
<p>It is a voluntary program that can be installed to help make sure your computer remains up to date but you don't need it and don't have to keep it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you reinstall 1703 after removing the update assistant from your device and then get back to us with shorter paragraphs to let us know how things are working then.</p>

            I've tried that too for getting rid of the assistant it stil lpops back on my comp, and I always had 1607 version. I never&nbsp; tried &nbsp;1703. Before upgrading to&nbsp; 1709 my &nbsp;system was windows 10 home 1607 x64. and that's the version I reverted back to from the
 upgrade.

<h2>            Windows answers to many customers hijack questions With solutions that may work on paper but fail miserably in life</h2>
                    <p>I have seen many posts by people with similar problems to mine get answered by techs who-it seems to me- don’t get it. For instance I still have same ssue after years of questions, paid and failed service from MSFT, PC repair shops etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I believe that a trojan (?) has hijacked every device I own. Basically hijacked network than device by device- regardless of OS. My Windows 10 PCs show OS as NT in environment windows, drivers and registry keys seem to be replaced by different
 drivers/keys/ List of “Users” include &nbsp;remote managers, service asserted authority. DNS and IP addresses cannot be changed. MMC indicates “local”device is not device I am using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the techs that have answered me and many ohers who seem to be asking same question give answers that depend on MSFTs GUI to work as expected. Very partial lists of Windows tools, actions intended to help and offerred as suggestions: #1) Roll back driver
 (grayed out) etc. file in System32 (where I think corrct drivers are) is read only and impossble to access after taking ownership and trying to (#2) add user “Everyone” as owner or as full control. I need to do this as every other user - the users I created,
 the othe users that should be there as well as the 12-15 new users that indcated remote control and administration of devices, .e users such as admnistrator, owner, system, local owner, all show a suffix attached to them. (The users with suffux seem to be
 know as e.g. S-5-15-2 (don’t know if this exact but others users like remote admin start with same S-*.* but have a 25 character alpha-numeric code following (I think activation code).</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3) When I NAME PC or change name- the name is further changed by showing unknown line of characters with”/“ and the repeated name. &nbsp;#4 All boot files are changed extensions often showing as *.*.exe.mui, i’e 2 extensions. #5) Cannot set rules in advanced
 Defender &amp; often rules are set that are inimical to device health, #5) overriding the set DNS/IP address to use correct settings does not permit internet access. #6) Using. &nbsp; &nbsp;#7) Either iso. Or .exe verson of new windows (from media player) not allowed -
 unused space on hard drive not calculated in space avalable, #8) Unable to change registry keys in curent config, as instructed or change permissions/access through “chage owner” #9). Not sure purpose of Powershell in 10 but it seems as if it is designed to
 make devic e easy to hijack #10) SubInACL finshes installaton with window that shows “remove” rather than “finish” as only active field</p>

<p>This reply is from original poster. I needed to submit previous ? W/o completing as the iPad I am working on was acting squirrely., s I’ve mentioned before This issue started w/Wndows but affects all OS. When I try to fix problem on OS X I encounter Windows
 apps/programs/Scrpts in OS x library files that are unable to be removed and I have same lack of access that occurs in Windows, also iOS and android.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sur if I inluded this in last message but OS shown is environment area of Users shows Windows NT as OS, # 12, every fle has “grouyp policy editor” in its path. I don’t know if a standalone PC shouyld even have a group policy editor but all files do,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#13) Admn (MSFT and local) does not elicit C:\Windows\System32 when cmd.admin is selected in tree but same path (C:\Users\*.* ) as a standard DOS screen would show, #14) SFC can only be run in read-only mode- same w/ CHKDSK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about vebosity but I have gone thru 25+ Windows devices in 3 years, have had many worked on by level 2 techs (both had no idea) taken to Windows Store (less of idea) . I realize this s likely as much of a network as device issue now but it started
 on 2 Windows 7 PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many questions by other users seem to be trying t either grasp or articulate same issue and MSFT techs still seem to rsvp with solutuons that do not work in real life. I’m desperate for solution and I sense frustration in some other ? As well.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The maps are up in rotation when playing. I believe there is still a separate escalation playlist.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are playing a private match where you can choose a map, look at the very top of the screen, there should be a tab that says dlc or something similar. It will open a new page with the new maps listed.</p>

<p>I'm also experiencing this problem, i have the escalation pack and today black ops came out with an update and i can no longer find my escalation option tho i am still able to play call of the dead. If this is something like where they tgake away a map that
 weve all paid for in order to focus on new maps then thats effed up and should be addressed they make soo much money already off of these dlc's that they shouldnt be beating us out of our purchases.</p>

<p>to the above post: u still have the maps, u just cant play ONLY those maps online anymore - they are now mixed in with the original maps.</p>
<p>the reason for this is they make a new playlist of new maps everytime a map pack comes out, therfore the 'escalation' playlist has been switched to 'aniahlation'

<p>I have another problem. I have deleted the title update 9 in order to remove patches for BO zombies, and i have also been playing on 'call of the dead' on the escalation map pack, but as soon as i deleted the title update i could no longer play call of the
 dead and the other multiplayer maps had vanished yet on my hard drive there is still 'Escalation [en['. Anyone know what i can do to play call of the dead again, please?

<br />Uncheck the option Use a proxy server for your LAN.
<br />Change the option Detect the configuration automatically (if it is unchecked, activate it and if it is activated, deactivate it).
<br />

<br />
<br />if it does not work, try this
<br />
<br />
<br />Start the computer in safe mode, for this you can follow the following link: start the computer in safe mode.

                    <p>On my Surface running Windows RT 8.1, whenever something requires Flash and that I don't have the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Adobe's website to download the latest version of Flash, it says that if you're using Windows RT, you have to get the update through the Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked Windows Update, there wasn't any updates for the Flash Player.</p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows RT 8.1 you need to have Adobe Flash Player 11. Before checking for Windows Update, I would suggest you to check if you are have the latest Adobe Flash Player 11 or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have the latest Adobe Flash Player, then I would suggest you to try downloading it from the following Microsoft Help article.</p>

            <p>some websites try to find certain specific flash versions (or some features that are not present in the built-in flash version) - when they don't find it, they simply revert to the logic of "you are not on the latest version of flash", but you probably are

<p>
</p><p>i'd say this is more of a website compatibility issue than a flash version issue. go to adobe's website to verify which flash version you are on:

<h2>            How to update from 32 bit Windows 8 to 64 bit &#40;having upgraded from 32bit Vista&#41;</h2>
                    Still have not seen any&nbsp;definitive&nbsp;answers related to this question. &nbsp;I had Vista 32 bit and went through the Windows 8 upgrade process. &nbsp;I am now stuck with Windows 8 32 bit. &nbsp;I was not given the option of a 64 bit install during the upgrade process even
 though my machine is 64 bit&nbsp;compatible. &nbsp;Like many other people here I recently purchased some hardware updates for this machine (additional RAM). &nbsp;I am now showing 4 gigs or ram, 3 of which is usable. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to know how to upgrade my current Windows 8 32 bit installation to a Windows 8 64 bit installation so I can&nbsp;utilize&nbsp;the new RAM I purchased. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Answers I am not interested in hearing:</div>
<div>1. Obtain a 64 bit Windows 8 iso and or disk and rerun/boot the Windows 8 install process using that.</div>
<div>-I do not have access to a Windows 8 64 bit iso or disk. &nbsp;I also have heard conflicting reports of whether a new 64 bit install using my 'upgrade' license key will work when it comes to the activation process.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. It was buried on some screen or in some document that you can't do what I am trying to do (go from 32 bit legacy to 64 bit Win8)</div>
<div>-This answer is absolute garbage. &nbsp;Everything Microsoft has said about the upgrade process to Win8 has been that it would be 'quick' and 'easy'. I am not looking for excuses on why this can't be done. &nbsp;From what I can tell my Vista install is gone anyways,
 so Microsoft has lured me into upgrading to software that clearly does not meet my needs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As a side note, they really should build the option into the Windows upgrade assistant to allow the user to choose a 32 bit versus 64 bit installation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As stated above I'm looking for an actual solution to this problem, and not a repost of answers 1 and 2. &nbsp;I appreciate anyone who can help bring closure and/or new information to this issue. &nbsp;Thank you.</div>

Thank you for the reply and my apologies for the epic typo in my original post. &nbsp;The second sentence should read:&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>"I had Vista 32 bit and went through the Windows 8 upgrade process. &nbsp;I am now stuck with Windows 8
<b><u>32</u></b> bit."</div>
<div><br />
<div>I need to know how to upgrade my current Windows 8 32 bit installation to a Windows 8 64 bit installation so I can utilize my additional RAM.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only viable solution I have heard of is to call Microsoft and cancel/refund my Vista-Win8 upgrade purchase. &nbsp;Then go to a store an buy a 70$ Windows 8 64 bit disc and reroll my harddrive with the 64 bit installation, and new license key. &nbsp;There has
 to be a better way and I am hoping someone here knows of one. &nbsp;</div>

            The viable solution is good to the point where you call Microsoft. Thereafter, you should explain the situation to them and maybe they will let you have the 64-bit version. It would be little skin off the nose to them as you would be using the same key
 as you have already been given..

            I did the same thing TimRider87 did, upgrade from vista 32-bit, and I called Microsoft with the intent of finding out if I could use the backup disc I ordered with the upgrade to upgrade from&nbsp;
<div>Windows 8 32-bit to Windows 8 64-bit. The guy I talked to said I could, but on this forum I read some posts that the disc I ordered will only come with the version I downloaded so I'm going to wait for the disc, which still hasn't shipped, and see what
 happenes. Hopefully it will work or if anybody knows better please let me know.</div>

            I do have 2 XP, 2 Vista and 1 windows 7 with 32 bit. So not an easy tasks. getting a 32 bit windows 8 Pro. which all of the computer able to support 64 bit. We purchase 32 bit software windows because 64 bit software are rare that time of year compare
 with current.
<div><br />
<div>Now there are more 64 bit out there. 32 bit software base are being replace by 64 bit. And the trends is&nbsp;accelerating.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>We do need help. In our local market they are selling at USD140.00 - USD160.00 for a Windows 8 Pro 32/64 DVD. This is before 31 Jan 2013. I can't get it at USD69.99.&nbsp;It is cheaper to upgrade online. but we do not have the choices 32/64 bit. Even the computer
 are equips with 64 bit&nbsp;architecture.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope that those who purchase Windows 8 Pro are given the choices of download 32/64 bit or better detection of hardware with 32/64 bit architecture.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

sometimes the truth is bitter. You just have to admit it. </p>
<p>You cant upgrade from a 32 bit Windows OS to&nbsp; 64bit Windows OS.</p>
<p>You have to perform a clean installation. It is the only solution. Hope you understand it..</p>

<p>If I pause a movie and let me computer go to sleep.&nbsp; The video will not start back up again.&nbsp; I have tried closing the browser and going back in, but no website will play video or sound after the computer has gone to sleep.&nbsp; I have to restart my computer
 everytime this issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have only had this computer for a couple months and would like to think this is an issue that could be fixed pretty easily with a little support from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also sent this same message to HP to provide some answers.&nbsp; I am clueless when it comes to video issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> tommay11  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP LaserJet P1606dn stopped working&#59; Windows 8</h2>
                    The PC has Windows 8 and has been highly frustrating for me, ie I'm not happy with my Windows 8&nbsp;experience&nbsp;thus far.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The printer is an HP LaserJet P1606dn.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the issue; it stopped being able to print from this computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The router is perfectly fine; PC reports full connectivity, no issues here.</div>
<div>The printer is perfectly fine; able to manually print test pages via a button, able to print documents from OTHER computers (that are lucky enough NOT to have windows 8 anyways) AND I was able to print off the PC, no problem as of last night. &nbsp;This morning,
 I go to print out an essay I have due and it does not work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried windows trouble shooting/diagnostic programs- they detect no issue.</div>
<div>I have searched the internet/windows forum for help, no on seems to have reported this&nbsp;similar&nbsp;issue/no solutions work.</div>
<div>NO! It is not the driver; not only did this print fine earlier, I have done the driver-based trouble shooting as described in&nbsp;similar&nbsp;support forums.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The main question mark lies in the fact that this PC has STOPPED printing, as in it could, and did, not that long ago. Nothing changed as far as I can tell. &nbsp;I have restarted printer, PC, router, etc multiple times. I have tried bypassing router and connecting
 manually to printer. Nothing seems to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows does not report any error, rather it simply sates "There was an error in trying to print doc X." &nbsp;The printer taskbar only shows "Printing" or "Busy" or "Printed."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am leaning towards this being a port config issue but can not find any such guidelines that may be useful in this area.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I will&nbsp;continue&nbsp;trying to figure this out and cursing the day I bought a&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8 PC- if you have any advice please help.</div>

            You may be infected with malware.&nbsp;To fix this problem download,&nbsp; install, and run the following two programs:
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a>&nbsp;and
<a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (<a href="http://www.pandasoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></a>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).<br />
<br />
Let's see if that fixes the problem before seeking any further solutions.<br />
<br />
Good luck and i hope this works in eradicating the malware&nbsp;(if that's what it is).&nbsp; Post back and let us know how it goes in any case.

<p>I am in a similar situation only with a couple more twists.</p>
<p>My two sons were sharing an Elite and I was on another Elite. I purchased a Slim for myself and did the Recover GT. Then I did the same for one of my sons onto the Elite I was using. The only one that hasn't lost any campain/career data on his games is the
 son that didn't have his GT moved. The two of us that did now have to start every game over from the beginning. We've been playing since the 360 launched so, alot of work would be involved to get back all the data for every game we've played.
</p>
<p>Can I reverse the Recover GT procedure and get all of our data back the way it was?</p>
<p>I didn't do a License Transfer. All 3 360's are under my name. Do I transfer my Elite License to the Slim, then put one sons info on the empty Elite, then transfer him over to it? Will this still leave him with missing data and having to start all games
 over from the beginning, as his GT is tied to the other Elite that his brother is still on?</p>

<p>Any content purchased via the Xbox LIVE Marketplace is tied to the following: &nbsp;1) The account it was purchased with 2) The Xbox Console (not the HDD) that it was purchased with.</p>
<p>If you change consoles, then the content will only work when the purchasing account is present _and_ connected to Xbox LIVE. &nbsp;If it's a new console you own and you want the content to be used offline you'll need to do a license transfer.</p>
<p>If you're using the console it was originally purchased on any account can use it online or offline and all should be well.</p>
<p>I hope this clears everything up.</p>

<p>Then the best I can hope for is one account not working. As the boys are both tied to the one Elite, doing a License Transfer will only help one. As we can only do this apparently once a year on our own, I would have to go through Xbox Support for this whole
 procedure.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help in this matter!</p>

<p>Called Xbox Support and now I have everyone in my house up and running. Here are the steps I was told to use:</p>
<p>1) On the new 360, make sure no Gamer Tags are signed in, then click on Recover Gamer Tag</p>
<p>2) Sign in when tag is recovered and then click on Transfer License</p>
<p>3) Sign out when step 2 is completed</p>
<p>4) On the old 360, make sure no Gamer Tags are signed in, then click Recover Gamer Tag</p>
<p>5) Sign in when tag is recovered</p>
<p>6) Insert USB Thumb Drive in USB port and click on the silver Xbox Guide button. Scroll over to the Settings tab and click on System Settings. Click on Memory and you should see your hard drive and thumb drive. Click on the thumb drive and the steps to format
 the drive will be shown. Just follow the steps.</p>
<p>7) From the Xbox Guide, scroll to Settings and click on Account Management and then on Download History. All the DLC, games, videos etc. that were purchased on the 360 are shown. This is for all Gold &amp; Silver accounts and all Gamer Tags.</p>
<p>Click on a game that is listed and you will see the files associated with that game (If more than one user played the game, you'll see the Gamer Tags beside the files). Click on one of your files and follow instructions to move it to the Thumb Drive. Repeat
 this for other files you want to move for that game (Some files won't let you Copy them, you'll have to Move them).</p>
<p>8) Sign out and remove the Thumb Drive</p>
<p>9) On the new 360, do the Recover GT steps again and then sign in</p>
<p>10) Insert the Thumb Drive then locate it in the Memory listing. Follow instructions to move the files onto the new 360 hard drive. Remove Thumb Drive when done.</p>
<p>11) Check to see that the game is up and running properly. You will have to redownload your DLC and other items again from the Market Place (It is free to do this for previously purchased items linked to the Gamer Tag).</p>
<p>12) If all is running properly, go to the old 360 and Recover Gamer Tag, sign in and insert the drive repeating the steps to Copy/Move files.</p>
<p>Files for each game can be moved one at a time or all at once to the Thumb Drive. I think you can also move all DL History items at once to the drive. I went through each file one at a time to dble. check because there were 4 different people using the same
 console.</p>
<p>Don't delete any files from the old or new 360 till you are sure they will not be needed.</p>
<p>You can use any USB Thumb Drive as long as you format it on the 360 first. The size of the drive should be between 4 and 16 GB. The 360 can only handle a maximum of 16 GB. You don't need an expensive one. Mine was $16.00 for a 16GB.</p>
<p>When I first tried moving my data to the new 360, I didn't do the License Transfer or try to move any files over. So, when I went to play my games, I had to start over from the very beginning on each one (only tried 3 games). This left me with saved files
 for these games. Before I moved any files over, I dble. checked the game files and deleted them off the new 360.</p>
<p>Hope this helps others that need the procedure explained a little more thoroughly. Use this as a guide but, go through Xbox Support first. Or, if you know of someone that has done this before, get them to walk you through the steps.
</p>
<p>Would like to thank Nathan from Xbox Support for his help! He made sure I had an understanding of the steps to take and was even willing to walk me through them as I did the file transfering at home (I declined that offer but, impressed at how some things
 have changed at Support!). &nbsp;</p>

<p>Forgot to mention that a License Transfer is required for each GT that is being moved permanently. You won't be able to perform this transfer again for 121 days should you want to move again.</p>
<p>This is not the procedure to use if you are just going to move your GT temporarily over to a friends 360 to play games, then move it back home again. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Remove colored ribbon tabs in title bar on a file explorer window in Win10Pro</h2>
                    <p><span>These colored ribbon tabs appear in title bar on a file explorer window when certain files are highlighted.&nbsp; To make these tabs disappear I have to click somewhere else in the file explorer window.&nbsp; I very often have many different windows open.&nbsp; I
 click on the title bars of the various open windows to make the window I want on top.&nbsp; That is how I often maneuver between windows.&nbsp; I click on a file explorer window title bar and a ribbon I never use take up most of the window.&nbsp; I have to click the arrow
 to remove the ribbon from view.&nbsp; This is a dreadful feature.&nbsp; Most of those “ribbons” have only three items for those who use the ribbon.&nbsp; Some ribbons have only one item. &nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>To prevent this from happening I have to click somewhere else in the file explorer window before I click a different window I need to be on top.&nbsp; That is a dreadful habit to develop to make my computer more usable.&nbsp;

<p><span>How do I permanently remove these colored ribbon tabs that appear in title bar on a file explorer window?</span></p>
<p><span>“Shortcut Tools” &amp; “Application Tools” in the posted screenshot are an example of what I do not want popping up any more.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your input on this. However, this feature has been added on File Explorer since Windows 8. Technically, the ribbon on the screenshot you included is already minimized. Otherwise, it would look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c285f99-4f9c-4dfb-9103-abb6804faa6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c285f99-4f9c-4dfb-9103-abb6804faa6f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To minimize the ribbon, you just need to click the arrow. Then, you're going to want to click on the blank area on the title bar if that's how you switch tabs. If you are not familiar with
<strong>Alt</strong> + <strong>Tab</strong>, it will let you preview all your open tabs so you can easily switch tabs from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6773deed-ea9b-4614-b65e-474c2f0d9362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6773deed-ea9b-4614-b65e-474c2f0d9362" /></a></p>

<p>When i am working i need to concentrate on my work. &nbsp;i need to switch quickly between many different windows using the mouse. &nbsp;That is how i use my computer. &nbsp;The existence of color tabs require extra steps to minimize the ribbon each time i put a file window
 on top. &nbsp;Or i must concentrate on finding the right spot to click on the bar. &nbsp;this slows productivity. &nbsp;Also the picture you posted shows how useless the ribbon is for those who may use it because that ribbon is mostly blank, only has three items and takes
 up a large part of the window. &nbsp;The ribbon is always available using the items on the bar just below the title bar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did not answer if those color tabs on the title bar can be shut off. &nbsp;Can a change in the registry shut off the&nbsp;color tabs on the title bar? &nbsp;Is there any other hack that can shut off these color tabs?</p>

<h3> debbiendc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Skype constantly trying to make changes to my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This happens randomly, usually at least once per day, despite the fact that I am not doing anything with Skype, nor am I downloading or installing any updates to Windows or any software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to just okay it, but then realized it might be some sort of security issue, despite the fact that I have extremely strong security software running, and since then, routinely deny.&nbsp; I almost never run Skype anymore but do want to have it available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain this?&nbsp; And offer any recommendations on how to stop it? The annoyance factor is now great enough that I'd like to stop it altogether.</p>

<h2>            American Greetings Creatacard Platinum Version 8</h2>
                    <p>Sorry, this answer is not correct.&nbsp; It may be correct for all other versions, but it is not true for Version 8 Platinum, which I believe is the last published version.&nbsp; I suspect it is the only 32 bit version.&nbsp; In fact, I have installed CreataCard Platinum
 version 8 in windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.&nbsp; Not a single problem that I know of.</p>
<p>I have not found a way to confirm that it is 32 bit, but have concluded that logically.</p>
<p>Upon initiation of the setup, Windows warned that there were "known incompatibilities with some drivers".&nbsp; It is not specific and I have no idea what drivers it refers to.&nbsp; Bottom line, is that it works just fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I did not use XP compatibility mode or any other measures to make it work.&nbsp; The only thing I did was ignore the message.&nbsp; I believe the problem is that the incompatibility may be with earlier versions but not this one.</p>

<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.
