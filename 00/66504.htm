<h2>            Skype for business- appearing offline</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My skype for business account always appears offline to other users, however I am infact signed in and online on my account. I can message and call out and people are able to message and call me, but they always see my presence as offline.
</p>
<p>We have tried removing me as a contact and re-adding, but the problem persists. We have recently upgraded to Skype for business 2016 but the problem still occurs. Is there any way to fix this?
</p>
<p>best, </p>
<p>chris</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>To narrow down the root cause of the issue, I’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>1.Are you an administrator of your organization? If not, please contact your admin and let him re-assign the Skype for Business Online license for your account, then wait for a few hours to check the result.</p>
<p>2.What is the detailed version of your Skype for Business client, such as 16.0.6528.1015? Please make sure it’s up to date.</p>
<p>3.Does the issue persist if you change to another machine or network environment?</p>
<p>4.Some screenshots about this issue. To upload screenshots, select Use rich formatting, and then click insert /Edit.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

    <title>Windows 10 black tiles and text&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 black tiles and text&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello Microsoft Community!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a serious Windows 10 problem, for which I couldn't find any solution on the internet.
</p>
<p>I have a yellow/orange kind of theme color, so most of my tiles should be this color. However, when I first open the start menu after boot, the tiles are really yellow, but in a few seconds they automatically get darker and darker. In a few minutes my tiles
 will become black so that I can barely see them. The bigger problem is that the texts (application and program names) will also get black and I also can't see them in a few minutes. I've tried everything. Changed the theme, changed the colours, even clean
 installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: The texts are weird in some applications too. For example texts are grey in the mail app instead of white. Also, in the official facebook app most part of the interface is black instead of blue. Basically I can't see anything, because the texts are
 black on black background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you will find some solution for me, because I really don't want to go back to Windows 8 only for this problem. Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set the Compatibility Mode of the installer (Setup for example) to Win 7 or sooner, depending on the age of the printer. The OEM CD should work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still get the error, look for other "applications" in the folder with SETUP,</p>
<p>There may also be Windows Installers that need to be set to "Previous Versions".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For better chances of success, REMOVE the printer from your system in DEVICES and PRINTERS&nbsp;before uninstalling and reinstalling the software.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SWSETUP is the collection of software and updates from HP.&nbsp; It does come in handy from time to time if you need to reinstall the software that came with your laptop.&nbsp; SYSTEM.SAV is probably safe to delete but since it's only 10mb (on my HP) I would not bother,
 it's not going to gain you much space.</p>

            Just to be sure that you’re clean try running these programs:
<br />MBAM free: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />Eset online scanner:  <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a>
<br />Adwcleaner:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />
<br />If these find one or more infections but do not fully remove them it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.

            1. Are you the administrator or in possession of admin password ?<br />
If no to either one, then forget about downloading. You are not authorized to do that.<br />
It may be your computer, but someone else can be the administrator instead of you.<br />
<br />
2. What error message did you get when you failed to download ?

            This can be a long session. Let's hope not.<br />
I'll start with the easy way.....<br />
You said about a week ago. Do you remember a good date when you were able to download ?<br />
If yes, please do a system restore, pick that good date as your restore point.<br />
<br />
<span><span>Start button &gt; search box, type system restore &gt;press Enter key &gt; uac prompt &gt; click Choose a different restore point &gt; Next &gt; select the date as your restore point, click it &gt; Next
 &gt; Finish<br />
Sit back and wait. The machine will re-start when it is done.<br />
<br />
Note : do it in Safe Mode if you wish. It is known to be more effective doing system restore in safe mode.<br />
<div><strong><span><span>Shut down your computer &gt; turn it back on, and immediately and repeatedly tab F8 key until you see a black and white screen. Use the up/down arrow key and select Safe
 Mode.</span></span></strong></div>

<h2>            Error code 0x8007025D-0x2000c when trying to update to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I did a clean installation of Windows 8 yesterday (formatted my harddrive and installed via USB), then installed all available Windows Updates, and then went on to install Windows 8.1 from the Windows Store.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no antivirus installed, and I have also trying detaching all USB cables during the process.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The update preparation finishes fine in the Windows Store, and then the computer reboots to start the new configuration. It reaches somewhere near 50%, then reboots again, and then it says it "Restores to the previous version of Windows". After that and
 another reboot, I get the error message that it couldn't update to Windows 8.1, with the error code:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>0x8007025D-0x2000c</div>
<div><br />

            I finally, somehow, solved it. For me, I messed around with the installed languages a lot. Origin Win8 installation was with English (UK) as the language, and danish as the input methods. What finally made it all work was by downloading and installing
 the Danish language pack, and changing the system language to Danish.
<div><br />
<div>So if you've installed with English as the language, but something else for input methods etc., try setting the system language to that.</div>

            <p>I have no certain idea what you are trying to ask.&nbsp; "vedeos" are "videos" I assume - as for what you mean by "not found in website" - maybe you mean some of the videos you are trying to view from some websites are not playing?</p>
<p>Install the proper web plugins (Flash, Silverlight, Quicktime, RealPlayer/RealAlternative, Shockwave, etc) to see whatever videos on whatever web page it is you are trying to get to.</p>
<p>As for the the other part - where you don't have aero ro change your bac[k]grounds - that could be all sorts of things.&nbsp; What edition of WIndows 7 are you running?&nbsp; What video device do you have (and how much memory does it have?)&nbsp; Do you have the latest
 drivers/software installed for that video device?</p>

    <title>CHKDSK runs at every boot up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> te1955  say:</h3>
<h2>            CHKDSK runs at every boot up.</h2>
                    
<p>I run CHKDSK, cleanup and defrag every couple of weeks.&nbsp; Since&nbsp;I made some changes in the services and&nbsp;start up tabs in MSCONFIG, CHKDSK now wants to run every time I fire up the machine.&nbsp; Wont do it if I just restart.&nbsp; It says, "Checking file system on
 C:. The type of file volume in NTFS.&nbsp; Cannot open volume for direct access.&nbsp; Windows has finished checking the disk."&nbsp; Never did it before.&nbsp; It only lasts for a couple seconds, then continues to a normal start up.&nbsp; It doesn't appear to affect the machine,
 it's just annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, what do I absolutely positively have to run at start up and can I disable the rest, i.e. Goggle updater, HP anything, etc.</p>
<p>Thanks, Tim</p>

<p>Try bringing up a command prompt (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd")<br />
Then enter the command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; chkntfs /D</p>
<p>It may want to check the disk at next boot (if it does, let it) but if it passes the test it shouldn't do it again.</p>
<p>For more info on the "chkntfs" command, type the command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; help chkntfs</p>

<p>Jose,</p>
<p>I have XP Home and srvice pack 3</p>
<p>HP Pavilion dv8000 notebook</p>
<p>I have the disks</p>
<p>Firing up is starting the machine after shut down.&nbsp; I turn it off every night</p>
<p>It was ok before I made the changes.</p>
<p>I changed from normal start to selective and disabled everthing except msseces, qttask and ctfmon in the start up tab.</p>
<p>I made the changes to improve performance.&nbsp; Since them I have upgraded the ram to 2 gig.&nbsp; That has helped</p>
<p>I tried going back and forth.&nbsp; Still get the error when starting from a total shut down.</p>
<p>I don't remember installing Spyware doctor.</p>
<p>I do have Piriform CCleaner.&nbsp; Loaded it several months ago and never had any issues with it.&nbsp; It is faster then windows cleanup.</p>
<p>Right now I am using Windows Essentials.&nbsp; Dumped Norton from Comcast cuz it REALLY slowed this machine down.</p>
<p>I am able to run Chkdsk from the Tools tab in Local Disk (C:) Properties.&nbsp; I check the "scan for bad sectors" box.&nbsp; In fact I am running as we speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give me a sec and I will let you know if anything comes up............Completed, everthing OK.</p>
<p>I cant think of anything else you might need</p>
<p>Thanks for the help and good luck on the a pony!!!!</p>

</p><p>Whenever a device causes a BSOD it can either be the driver or the hardware (or both)&nbsp; Since you have problems with it after updating the driver I would investigate a different adapter.&nbsp; They are not that expensive and you&nbsp; may never be able to get the current

    <title>User profile issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orphan7  say:</h3>
<h2>            User profile issues</h2>
                    So, I just started getting this message that the profile loader is unable to load my user profile.&nbsp; It doesn't say anything about it being corrupted, just that it can't load the profile, so after I hit OK it "logs me off."&nbsp; I looked around for help for
 this, as I'm able to get into my wife's profile.&nbsp; Found the thread showing how to create a new profile and copy info from the old one into the new one.&nbsp; I go to User Accounts and press the button to add or remove accounts.&nbsp; the window pops up for me to type
 in the admin password and I do.&nbsp; Then NOTHING.&nbsp; I go to try to do a system restore, but it only has restore points from earlier today, after the problem was in place, so I can't restore to a point early enough to deal with the issue that way.&nbsp; What else can
 I do?

            Hello Orphan7,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; When you tried to create a new profile/account, were you using an account with administrator p<span>rivileges.&nbsp; Also this usually a sign that the
 profile is corrupted when it doesn't load.&nbsp; You can try to access the newly created profile or create&nbsp; new one and be sure not to use system restore after load or creating new account.&nbsp; While you are logged in as your new account, you should then be able to
 copy files from the old account to the new one.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this was helpful.</span>

    <title>Printer will not print when I have to use Windows 10 print menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djsvs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer will not print when I have to use Windows 10 print menu</h2>
                    <p><span>I have two computers a desktop and a laptop.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have two printers, a Samsung SL-M2885FW Laser printer and a Epson Artisan 837 inkjet printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Both of the computers are on a wired network and were configured to use either of the two printers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Both computers belong to the same Workgroup and both printers are shared.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The desktop printer is using Windows 8.0 and the Laptop was using Windows 8.0, but now it is using Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Up until I installed Windows 10 on the laptop I could print using either printer on either of the computers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now I am unable to use the laser printer with the Laptop printer.<span>&nbsp; </span>
When using the Laptop I can print a test page using the laser printer (Click on Samsung icon&gt;properties&gt;general&gt;click on<span>&nbsp;
</span>Print Test Page)<span>&nbsp; </span>, or any time I am asked if I want to print a page using the laser printer it will print, i.e. a document in Microsoft Word .<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, when I choose what I want to print, like page 1-5 of a ten page web document, or all ten pages, the laser printer will not print, it doesn't place anything in the queue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I do not have any problems when using the laser printer with the desktop computer, even after installing Windows 10 on the laptop.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Both computers are 64-bit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>DESKTOP COMPUTER</span></p>
<p><span>This is a Windows 8.0 computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is part of my Workgroup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The laser printer is attached to this computer by a USB cable from the computer to the USB connection on the back of the printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The inkjet printer is connected by a ethernet cable running from my router to the back of the printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This computer can use either printer at anytime.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>LAPTOP COMPUTER</span></p>
<p><span>This was a Windows 8.0 computer and I recently upgraded it to Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This computer has always used the two printers discussed above by being part of the Workgroup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Prior to installing Windows 10 there were no problems printing on whichever printer I chose for a print job.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>OTHER INFORMATION</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The desktop computer is named DAVIDJOHNWIN8 and the laptop is named DAVIDLAP.</span></p>
<p><span>When I print a Windows Printer Test Page using the Samsung M2885FW laser printer, on the laptop computer I receive the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>PRINTER PROPERTIES</span></p>
<p><span>Computer name DAVIDLAP</span></p>
<p><span>Printer Name<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>\\DAVIDJOHNWIN8\Samsung M288x Series</span></p>
<p><span>Printer Model<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Samsung M288x Series</span></p>
<p><span>Port Name(s)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>USB001</span></p>
<p><span>Data<span>&nbsp; </span>Format<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RAW</span></p>
<p><span>Printer Share Name<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Samsung M288x Series</span></p>
<p><span>Print Processor<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ssa7mPC</span></p>
<p><span>PRINT DRIVER PROPERTIES</span></p>
<p><span>Driver Name<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Samsung M288x Series</span></p>
<p><span>Driver Type<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Type 3 - User Mode</span></p>
<p><span>Driver Version<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>3.12.75.4</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>EXTRA INFORMATION PERTAINS TO LAPTOP AND SAMSUNG PRINTER</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I was in Devices and Printers I troubleshooted the printer and received the following message:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Troubleshooting was unable to fix all of the issues found.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can find more details below.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then, under Problems found it stated: USB Composite Device can't work properly with USB 3.0.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I found this very strange because it has been working flawlessly, using USB 3.0, ever since I first installed the printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Anyway I plugged it into a USB 2.0 port (recommeded by troubleshootter) and it didn't change a thing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I go to Device Manager and click on Printers it shows the Epson Aritsan 837 series but it does not show the Samsung M2885FW laser printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, when I go to Devices and Printers it shows both of the printers and the Samsung M2885FW laser printer is shown with a checkmark inside a green circle, also it says State: This is the Default Printer and Connection, State: This is a networked
 device.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I go to Devices (Printers and Scanners) on the laptop it shows both the laser and inkjet printers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With all of the above I can't understand why the Samsung printer won't function correctly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I sent all of this information to Samsung support, but I never did receive a reply.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On December 21, 2015 I called Samsung Support and they sent me a new Windows 10 driver, version 3.13.12.0 and it did not solve the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>IF I HAVE TO USE THE WINDOWS 10 PRINT MENU WHERE I RIGHT CLICK ON A DOCUMENT, OR PAGE, I CANNOT PRINT ON THE SAMSUNG M2885 FW PRINTER.<span>&nbsp;

</p><p>I want to be sure that everyone understands that I am not saying that the Samsung SL-M2885FW printer will not print anything at all when used with my Windows 10 computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>It will print a test page when you click on the "Print Test Page" button.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It will print documents that do not require you to right-click on them to print (such as Word documents).<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, it will NOT print any webpage or document that requires you to right-click on it to activate the Windows 10 Print Menu.
<span>&nbsp;</span>After I click the OK Button, and nothing prints, I check to see if there are print jobs in the queue and there is nothing there; nothing is being sent to the printer.
<span>&nbsp;</span>All I am trying to determine is how to get this Samsung SL-M2885FW to print when I have to use the Windows 10 Print Menu.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Everything else works like it is supposed to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Windows 10 Print Menu.<span>&nbsp; </span>Has a black background with the white lettering.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the lower left hand corner is the Print button, and to the right of it is the Cancel button.
<span>&nbsp;</span>These two buttons can barely be seen because the task bar is in the way (Actually I think the menu is too large for the screen, hopefully Microsoft will address this problem that a lot of people have complained about).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The very top of the buttons can barely be seen just above where it says :Search the web and Windows.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you have trouble seeing the Print and Cancel buttons you can take your mouse to the top of the page (the white strip) click on it and holding the mouse button down drag the page upward and then it will bring the buttons up to where you can just barely
 see the top of the buttons. </p>
<p>This is the same menu that I have to use when I print with the Epson Artisan 837 inkjet printer from within Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft thinks that the Samsung SL-M2885FW Laser Printer is working properly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In Device manager, General tab, under Device Status it shows: Device status:<span>&nbsp;
</span>This device is working properly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore I think something is flawed within the Windows 10 Print Menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I could follow your suggestions to uninstall the printer and alter the registry I would need for you to show me what evidence you have, that tells you that this will correct this problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Right now the Samsung SL-M2885FW printer will print from my Windows 8 compurter, and in some instances, from my Windows 10 computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I do what you propose I don't know if anything will print.<span>&nbsp; </span>

            <p>MORE INFO 12/29/2015</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I had Samsung<span>&nbsp; </span>diagnose my printer configuration using Samsung's Printer Diagnostics program.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This program has three functions they can do,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagnose your printer - This function checks the printer and issues with the printing system, and resolve the issues, if you have trouble printing a document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install your software - This function installs and updates your printer software to the latest version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up Wireless Printing - This function enables your printer's wireless setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program also has some advanced options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had them Diagnose my printer and the results were:<span>&nbsp; </span>Diagnostics completed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No issues have been detected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please contact the customer service website below, if the problem persists after running diagnostics.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>http://www.samsungsetup.com/ts/client/contact center/contact worldwide.htm</p>
<p>You can print a test page to check your printer status.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then there is a Print Test Page button.&nbsp; I printed a test page and it said:&nbsp; You have correctly installed your Samsung M288x Series on DAVIDJOHNWIN8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I used the Install your software function.<span>&nbsp; </span>This function produces a list of software available for your printer.</p>
<p>In the list I was given it showed that I had already installed the Samsung M288x Series printer driver.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It also gave me a list of other drivers that needed an update:</p>
<p>Scanner Driver (TWAIN / WIA).<span>&nbsp; </span>Samsung Easy Printer Manager,<span>&nbsp;
</span>Samsung Easy Document Creator and<span>&nbsp; </span>Network PC Fax.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
These were all downloaded to my PC and installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing all the above I assumed that there was nothing wrong with the software for this Samsung
</p>
<p>SL-M2885FW printer and there shouldn't be any problems printing from the Windows 10 Print Menu.</p>
<p>I was totally wrong.<span>&nbsp; </span>I still have the same problem:<span>&nbsp; </span>
I cannot print using this printer if I have to use the Windows 10 Print Menu.</p>

            <p>Below is what I found out from Epson Printers Tech help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Epson regarding your Epson Artisan 837.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The default settings for Windows 10 has not changed from earlier versions of Windows. Make sure there are no programs running on the taskbar, then go into Control panel and preferences.
 Make whatever changes you want, and then click OK. This will be the new default. If there are any programs running, Windows will assume it is a one time setting only and not save the changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I really appreciate your time and effort to help straighten me out on what I was trying to do.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The answer I received wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but it got me thinking in a different way and enabled me to understand what I would have to do in Windows 10, whether I liked it or not.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help you better understand where I was coming from, and what I wanted to do, below is a comparison between accomplishing a printing task using Windows 8.0 (on my desktop) and Windows 10 (on my laptop).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Epson Artisan 837 is on a network with the two computers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows 8.0 I right click on the page to be printed, I then click on print, choose the Epson3F0368 (Artisan 837), then click on preferences, then I choose how I want to print, making any changes needed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I click OK, then click PRINT.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To accomplish the same thing in Windows 10 I have to right click on the page to be printed, then click on print, then I am presented with the Windows 10 Print Menu.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Windows 10 Print Menu is a black screen with white lettering.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I can make a limited number of changes in the Windows 10 Print Menu.<span>&nbsp; </span>
If I want to make changes similar to what I did on the Windows 8.0 PC I have to go to Control Panel&gt;Hardware and Sound&gt;View Devices and Printers, choose which printer I want to use&gt;then right click on it's icon, choose Printing Preferences to get to the Artisan
 837 Printing<span>&nbsp; </span>Preferences and then make my choices/changes.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Then I click OK, then close Control Panel, and then I click Print in the Windows 10 Print Menu.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I think this should explain why I was looking for a way I could configure Epson's print menu as the default menu when I use the Artisan 837 with Windows 10.</span></p>

            Well I have been asked to provide an update to this topic.&nbsp; So here it is.&nbsp; As of this date, January 12, 2016, their has only been one reply that was not initiated by me.&nbsp; However, I haven't given up on trying to find an answer.&nbsp; A few days ago I had a
 long chat (on line)&nbsp;with a Microsoft representative and she was unable to come up with an answer and said she was going to email me some things to try.&nbsp; I never received the email and I don't have any idea what her name was, what her email was, etc., so this
 appears to be a dead end.&nbsp; I am still searching the web for an answer and I am amazed at how many people are having printing problems using Windows 10.&nbsp; They don't necessarily have the same problem that I'm having, but&nbsp;they are having some kind of problem
 that is close to what I am having.&nbsp; In a few instances it sounded like they had exactly the same problem, but usually their was a slight variation.&nbsp; Some solved their problem, and I trie

            <p>SUCCESS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I had a long chat with Windows support and they told me&nbsp;"Alright.&nbsp; Then what&nbsp;you can do is unplug then replug your printer.&nbsp; Restart&nbsp;your computer as well then try printing again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked them which computer I needed to restart, and they said the one the printer was connected to, the desktop computer.&nbsp; I shut down the computer, turned off the Samsung printer, unplugged the electrical as well as the USB connection.&nbsp; Then I rebooted
 the computer, plugged in the electrical and then the USB connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then&nbsp;opened a&nbsp;webpage and selected the first page of it and the told it to print, and it worked.&nbsp; I tried some other documents and they also printed.&nbsp;</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p><span>I have two computers a desktop and a laptop.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have two printers, a Samsung SL-M2885FW Laser printer and a Epson Artisan 837 inkjet printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Both of the computers are on a wired network and were configured to use either of the two printers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Both computers belong to the same Workgroup and both printers are shared.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The desktop printer is using Windows 8.0 and the Laptop was using Windows 8.0, but now it is using Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Up until I installed Windows 10 on the laptop I could print using either printer on either of the computers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now I am unable to use the laser printer with the Laptop printer.<span>&nbsp; </span>
When using the Laptop I can print a test page using the laser printer (Click on Samsung icon&gt;properties&gt;general&gt;click on<span>&nbsp;
</span>Print Test Page)<span>&nbsp; </span>, or any time I am asked if I want to print a page using the laser printer it will print, i.e. a document in Microsoft Word .<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, when I choose what I want to print, like page 1-5 of a ten page web document, or all ten pages, the laser printer will not print, it doesn't place anything in the queue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I do not have any problems when using the laser printer with the desktop computer, even after installing Windows 10 on the laptop.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Both computers are 64-bit.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>DESKTOP COMPUTER</span></p>
<p><span>This is a Windows 8.0 computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is part of my Workgroup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The laser printer is attached to this computer by a USB cable from the computer to the USB connection on the back of the printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The inkjet printer is connected by a ethernet cable running from my router to the back of the printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This computer can use either printer at anytime.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>LAPTOP COMPUTER</span></p>
<p><span>This was a Windows 8.0 computer and I recently upgraded it to Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This computer has always used the two printers discussed above by being part of the Workgroup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Prior to installing Windows 10 there were no problems printing on whichever printer I chose for a print job.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>OTHER INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The desktop computer is named DAVIDJOHNWIN8 and the laptop is named DAVIDLAP.</span></p>
<p><span>When I print a Windows Printer Test Page using the Samsung M2885FW laser printer, on the laptop computer I receive the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>PRINTER PROPERTIES</span></p>
<p><span>Computer name DAVIDLAP</span></p>
<p><span>Printer Name<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>\\DAVIDJOHNWIN8\Samsung M288x Series</span></p>

<p><span>Driver Name<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Samsung M288x Series</span></p>
<p><span>Driver Type<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Type 3 - User Mode</span></p>
<p><span>Driver Version<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>3.12.75.4</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>EXTRA INFORMATION PERTAINS TO LAPTOP AND SAMSUNG PRINTER</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I was in Devices and Printers I troubleshooted the printer and received the following message:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Troubleshooting was unable to fix all of the issues found.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can find more details below.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then, under Problems found it stated: USB Composite Device can't work properly with USB 3.0.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I found this very strange because it has been working flawlessly, using USB 3.0, ever since I first installed the printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Anyway I plugged it into a USB 2.0 port (recommeded by troubleshootter) and it didn't change a thing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I go to Device Manager and click on Printers it shows the Epson Aritsan 837 series but it does not show the Samsung M2885FW laser printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, when I go to Devices and Printers it shows both of the printers and the Samsung M2885FW laser printer is shown with a checkmark inside a green circle, also it says State: This is the Default Printer and Connection, State: This is a networked
 device.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I go to Devices (Printers and Scanners) on the laptop it shows both the laser and inkjet printers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With all of the above I can't understand why the Samsung printer won't function correctly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I sent all of this information to Samsung support, but I never did receive a reply.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On December 21, 2015 I called Samsung Support and they sent me a new Windows 10 driver, version 3.13.12.0 and it did not solve the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>IF I HAVE TO USE THE WINDOWS 10 PRINT MENU WHERE I RIGHT CLICK ON A DOCUMENT, OR PAGE, I CANNOT PRINT ON THE SAMSUNG M2885 FW PRINTER.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have no problem printing on the Epson printer, from either Desktop or Laptop computers.</span></p>

            I don't know the answer to this issue and I doubt you will hear from anyone who does.
<div><br />
<div>Windows XP Fax Services is not a very robust application and often does not work with modems that are not on the Windows XP Hardware Compatibility List (which is no longer available). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When Windows XP was the current version of Windows, there were two very knowledgeable people, Russ Valentine and Hal Hostetler, who were frequent helpers in the Microsoft newsgroups. &nbsp;I have not seen posts from either of them recently.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is possible -- although probably not likely -- that you might get some help from paid Microsoft support, but I suspect that attempting to use Windows XP Fax Services in a non-supported fashion (e.g., with a vb.net application) is something you're going
 to have to figure out for yourself.</div>

<h2>            Service Registration is missing or corrupt and Windows store configuration may be damaged</h2>
                    <p>So here is the problem, I got this a few days ago after I installed the latest update from Windows Update in my Surface Pro 3. When I start to open&nbsp;Windows Store&nbsp;Apps program such as weather, email etc, it begin like this :</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b0ec9c0-5d3e-4190-9526-5c2e106aced3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The program trying to be opened then minimized. It happens on all&nbsp;Windows Store&nbsp;Apps program. So I run Windows Store Apps Troubleshooting, then I got this :</p>

<p>
</p><p>So, until now, I can't run any Windows Store Apps program, what should I do?</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going off your description it looks like your HDD has failed.&nbsp; Your only option is to get a replacement.&nbsp; Unfortunately you will have lost everything on the drive unless you have made backups of your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
