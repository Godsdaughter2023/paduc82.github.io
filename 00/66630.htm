<h2>            Extremely slow performance when using external monitor</h2>

<h3> thetekkitboss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Latitude D630 XFR Cannot find Hype bluetooth headset</h2>
                    <p>I had received a Hype One-touch Bluetooth stereo headset for Christmas, and I got it connected to my phone. I wanted to use it with my computer, but whenever my computer scans for Bluetooth devices, The only thing that comes up is my WiFi router. I have
 looked at other questions about this, and none of it worked. I tried using Microsoft Fix-It, but that didn't work either. I have checked to make sure I had a Bluetooth adapter, and it showed up in my "Devices" list. If anyone knows how to fix this, please
 reply!</p>

</p><p>1. When I search for a Bluetooth device it doesn't come up with any errors. Sometimes it picks up my WiFi Router as a Bluetooth device, but that's all I have ever found on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. On the computer, all I can find is my wireless internet router, but my headset will connect to my phone if my phone is scanning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I downloaded Microsoft Fix It: Hardware and Devices. The software did not detect any problems with my computer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you said that since you have got the headset, you were not able to get the headset to work. Also, When you tried to use the headset with a different computer it didn't work. So, I would suggest you to check with the manufacturer of the headset and see
 if that helps because, hardware seems to be defective.</p>

<h2>            Desktop Backgrounds from Themes not available for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 and wanted to change the background. I downloaded a new theme from Microsoft themes (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/wallpaper).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In settings I can select personalization &gt; Themes and click on one, but that only selects it, right clicking gives me the option to save the theme or save for sharing- which is not what I want. The new theme I downloaded was there, but I can't find it anywhere
 else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to&nbsp;personalization &gt;Background &gt; I get the five pictures preview, but they are not the theme I just selected in Themes. If I click browse it takes me to my picture file, but the background wallpapers are not in my picture file and I can't find them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can follow the path&nbsp;C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper, but my new theme is not there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I set a background wallpaper from a wallpaper in the theme I just downloaded?!? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked out how I set background in my windows 8.1 and I could follow this path &gt;Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Personalization\Desktop Background&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in Windows 10 I do not have the option of "Desktop Background". I can only go to&nbsp;&gt;Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Personalization.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Right, Settings :: Personalization :: Background doesn't currently show you the active slideshow after you select a theme.&nbsp; This is a known limitation/bug for now.&nbsp; The right people are aware of this confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed themes are installed out to %localappdata%\Microsoft\windows\themes .</p>

            You do need to take another step if you don't like one of the pictures and you want to remove it. That process was so easy in Windows 7.<br />

            Either is safe, but I personally thing (and this is my personal opinion), Microsoft Edge values your privacy more. Chrome for a Google is a means to an end and its serving ads even when you can't see it. But where Chrome has the edge (no pun), is its greater support among the billions of web pages and extensions available. 
<br />
<br />Out of those two though, my default browser is Firefox, I think it beats the pants of both when it comes to privacy, security and performance. Also, the bookmark syncing is really reliable.

            Hi Aditya,
<br />
<br />Browser choice is really a personal choice, in this day and age, all browsers are fairly similar when it comes to privacy . . .
<br />
<br />Your  security online mainly depends on the Security software you are running on your PC . .. 
<br />
<br />Also all Browsers nowadays have an 'In Private' or 'Incognito' more should you wish for extra security when say, banking online . . .

            Google Chrome is much better than Microsoft Edge. You can use Firefox too as the latest version of firefox is extremely fast and secure. I usually use Chrome as I use a lot of app extensions and I don't like MS Edge, but it boild down to personal preference.

            Not a big fan of Edge as a user interface perspective. Yes, it probably is as safe as any other browser. But I've noticed far more fake sites injecting the fake "Call Microsoft your computer has been compromised" with Edge and not a single one with Chrome
 or Firefox. Also, you could consider Opera a good browser built on the Chrome browser engine but without all the Google influence. If your concerned about privacy at times consider just using Private mode in the browser, and don't sign into Chrome as options
 to avoid some snooping. Also disabling Cookies can also improve your privacy, but of course it also defeats some useful features with web sites as well. I use Edge intermittently and it works pretty well much of the time, and certainly is as fast as the other
 browsers. I think many still ignore it because so many users are vested in Chrome and Google services and of course a large extension library.&nbsp;

<p>As far as safety goes, they are around the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is the better browser?&nbsp; As with most such questions, you'll get different answers from different people. That said, here's my personal opinion.:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome is better than Edge, but just barely.&nbsp; As far as I'm concerned, they are both poor choices. FireFox&nbsp; is my personal choice, and it's much better than either Chrome or Edge.</p>

            This is probably a case of unassigned drive (USB drive).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right click on My Computer icon</p>
<p>2. click on Manage.</p>
<p>3. Go to "Disk management"/Removable devices &amp; assign a Drive letter to it manually.</p>
<p>4. Right click on the drive without a Letter &amp; click on "Change Drive Letter and Paths..."</p>
<p>5. Click on "Change".</p>
<p>6. Assign an alphabet.</p>
<p>7. Click on OK.</p>

<p>I just bought a new Xbox 360 and I am trying to play one of the original games. I know there is a software I should download but I don't see it anywhere. I did the system update and when I put the game in the screen just goes black and that's it. Is there
 something I am missing?</p>

<p>Hi DestinedMoney,</p>
<p>In order for the Xbox 360 to play original Xbox titles you will require an official Xbox 360 hard drive and the game will have to be on the compatibility list.&nbsp; You can find out more about this at this link

<p>No I didn't get anything. When it updated I guess it restarted the system and it is working fine but it just gives a black screen when I try to play the original xbox game. It even gave an error message when I put in The Godfather game because it is not
 on the list so I am confused.</p>

<h2>            Windows just logged in without asking for my password...</h2>
                    I have a password set on my computer which I normally have to enter to login, but today I started up my computer after a shutdown and it booted straight to desktop without ever asking for it. I have thought this has happened in the past, but believed maybe
 I did enter the password and it just slipped my mind because of how often I do it it just becomes a reflex action. But today I am 100% sure that this happened.<br />

            <p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand that after restarting the computer, it booted straight to desktop without asking you for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand the inconvenience caused, but rest assured, we are here to help you with your concern.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>What is the <strong>Make</strong> and <strong>Model</strong> of the computer?</li></ol>
<p>You may be facing this issue cause of a User account corruption, or if there is a Virus infection in your computer or it could be cause of a user account setting not set correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below steps to see if it helps,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow the below steps to check and set the settings under the User Accounts correctly,</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press “<strong>Windows Logo</strong> +
<strong>R”</strong> key from the desktop to get the <strong>Run</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>netplwiz
</strong>and click <strong>ok</strong>. Now you would see the <strong>user account</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Please <strong>
uncheck </strong>and<strong> recheck</strong> the option “<strong>Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer</strong>”</span></li><li><span>If you are asked to verify your
<strong>password</strong>, please enter the <strong>password</strong> and click <strong>
ok</strong>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> the computer and check.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span>
</strong><span>If the issue still persist, proceed with
<strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Create a new user account</strong> - Your user profile is a collection of settings that make the computer look and work the way you want it to. It contains your settings for desktop backgrounds, screen savers, pointer preferences, sound settings,
 and other features. User profiles ensure that your personal preferences are used whenever you log on to Windows. If you tried to log on to Windows and received an error message telling you that your user profile might be corrupted, you can try to repair it.
 You will need to create a new profile, and then copy the files from the existing profile to the new one. Kindly refer to the below link to create a new user account,</p>

    <title>Controller scrolling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skibackcountry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller scrolling </h2>
                    
<p>so my controller seems to have a mind of its own and will start scrolling left or right all on its own at random. At first it was only happening on Netflix but now it's happening when gaming. This most often happens when playing NHL 16 HUT when I'm trying
 to look up a player to add to my team or puchas contracts. It also happens when I'm playing halo trying to look at rec packs. Doesn't seem to matter if my controller is plugged in or wireless via batteries. I have the plug and play recharge kit and I have
 replaced the cords thinking this might help and it did not. I have replaced the recharge batteries in hopes this would help and ut has done nothing. I have now purchased new controllers lunar white and at first this seemed to help but a week later they both
 started having this same issue. I have also made sure to do every update with them as well. Im starting to think this might be a consol issue rather than a controller issue but really don't want to have to buy a new xbox we already being I think ours is out
 of warranty. Sending it in for repair sucks as well being it takes so long to be returned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps xbox should be more like Apple and have certfied repair shops in large cities to make this a better and faster service. Or maybe they could do this via Game Stop so they could provide &nbsp;an additional service!? &nbsp;</p>

<p>After reading so many of these threads, I'm starting to think it's a console issue too. My controller recently started experiencing a similar problem where the left analog stick drifts up. It's very frustrating trying to play games through this issue. At
 first, I thought it was a problem with that particular controller, so I switched it out with my 2nd controller (which I rarely use). It turns out that this controller also has the drifting issue (except it's with the right analog stick).
</p>
<p>I then proceeded to search for solutions on this forum and throughout the internet. I have tried the suggestions by a forum mod (Mister Quimby I believe)....updated both controllers, unplugged console for 5 min, and re-synced the controllers with the system.
 It did not work. So I tried his other suggestion to try to get a replacement, but that also failed since the warranty for both controllers have expired.
</p>
<p>I currently have an open case with Microsoft Support and they advised me to test these controllers out on another system or try to use a friend's controller on my Xbox One so they can isolate the issue. The suggestion makes sense, but it still doesn't help
 solve my problem any faster since I don't have any friends or family that live close by. I feel as though there are so many people experiencing this issue, which I think Microsoft has been aware of for quite some time. I just hope they are working on a solution
 and I wish they would communicate something to us so that we are in the loop.</p>

<h2>            How can I uninstall MSXML 6 Serive Pack Parser 6.0&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I can't find the program installed anywhere but I found the dll's and the registry.</p>
<p>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{F5078F18-C551-11D3-89B9-0000F81FE221}\6.0</p>
<p>msxml6.dll</p>
<p>and msxml6r.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow this has been installed by mistake because it seems to be for XP (?) </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have Windows 7, SP1 x86 but my computer is now not recognized as part of Windows despite everywhere stating that I have Windows 7 6.1.7601.17514. I have IE 11 but when I go on the Microsoft page, it tells me that to update it, I must have a Microsoft
 OS, which of course I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had problems before this and I've have this computer for quite some time now, several years. I've been having issues for a couple of months now and windows does not update as well as&nbsp;a bunch of other problems. I'm trying to get to the root of things
 and I came across this now. I won't get into all the other problems because I'll be here all day, so I'm just tackling one thing at a time because it's been a couple of months and it's too hard to go back to figure out when this occurred. I can tell you that
 around February 14, 2014 I started having issues which I semi solved (but I think I had some kind of attack on the computer, not virus but DoS type attack) After that it ran ok until approx. mid May and then around June 20 is when it would not be recognized
 and updates ceased. They show up, but they just don't install, like MSI won't either. I think this had to do with an antivirus that I may have downloaded but I've completely removed all traces supposedly.
<br />
<br />
I cannot find the install anywhere for 6.0; just the dlls and registry. It's not in my "installed updates" or under "turn&nbsp;Windows features on/off"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANKS!! </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Msxml6.dll is a file related to MSXML parser. You are not suppose to delete it. The Microsoft XML parser is a Component Object Model (COM) &nbsp; implementation of the W3C DOM model. Two versions are associated with each &nbsp; parser: the release version of the MSXML
 parser and the actual file version of &nbsp; the DLL that contains the parser. The release version of the MSXML parser (for &nbsp; example, versions 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0) identifies the milestone of &nbsp; development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MSXML versions are included in different programs such as Internet Explorer, MDAC, Microsoft Security Essentials and other Microsoft products. Refer to the link to get the details:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/269238/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/269238/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you face while browsing websites or installing updates could be due to corrupt Windows system files or components.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may run SFC scan that will find out if there are missing or corrupt system files causing such issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let’s run DISM command to fix corrupt Windows Update components or any inconsistencies on Windows. After running the commands, we will run SFC scan and find out if there are still corrupt system files on the computer. Follow the steps accordingly:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the link to run DISM tool to fix inconsistencies on Windows:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix corruption errors</strong>”</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us</a><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you can refer to the following link to backup registry files:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/en-us</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the commands run successfully, proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the link to run SFC scan:</p>
<p>Follow the steps from section "<strong>Windows 8.1 or Windows 8</strong>":</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</a><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>For reference:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Verify if the same issue occurs in a new user profile as such scenario might occur due to a corrupt user profile as well:</span></p>

            Hi  ag7s,
<br />
<br />Backup your data before proceeding . . .

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br /> to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD
<br /> 
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)
<br />
<br />NOTE: during the installation process, your system will reboot, at that point, you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot order so your system boots from your Hard Drive, otherwise the installation may start all over again - do not remove the installation media at this point, only remove it when you reach the Desktop
<br /> 
<br />During the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC'

<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Make the ISO file bootable:

            If you carried out a Windows 10 reset and opted to keep your personal files then any saved files should be in the Documents folder. A reset removes all programs and apps so you will have to re-install those.

            <p>It depends on what you&nbsp; mean by a "reset" and how you did it (see neilpzz's reply). Please be explicit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But your question suggests that you don't do regular backups of your data to external media. If that's the case, you've been playing with fire. A<span><span>lmost everyone should be backing up regularly. It is always possible that
 a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus attack, even theft of the computer, can cause the loss of everything on your drive. As has often been said, it's not a matter of whether you will have such a problem, but when.</span></span>

    <title>HDMI No Signal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a largo slacker  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI No Signal</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 26" Vizio HDTV and have been using an HDMI Cable with my Xbox 360 Slim for the year that I've owned it. Recently, my HDMI input on my TV came up as "No Signal!" every time I turned my Xbox on. This problem occurred randomly. No settings were changed
 before the issue took place. I've tried everything including: Unplugging/plugging in all cables and devices, resetting xbox display settings using Y+RT, changed the HDMI resolution settings on my xbox, using other HDMI cables, and using the other HDMI ports.
 I plugged in my laptop to my Tv using the same HDMI port and cable with no problems. I plugged my xbox into my other Tv with the same HDMI cable and had no problem. It seems that both my Tv and xbox are working just fine, just not working together. I've seen
 a lot of people with the same problem over the internet but I haven't found a method that helped me. Please help if you know anymore methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have a friend that has an XBOX borrow their HDMI cable and if the problem is still there it narrows it down to your TV or XBOX, then try the borrowed cable and your XBOX on a different TV if the problem persists, it's your XBOX, if that is the case
 arrange a repair via customer services if it is still in Warranty, keep trying different combinations until you know for sure where the fault lies...</p>

<p>I stated that I used other HDMI Cables and another Tv. My xbox worked on the second tv with the same cable, and my laptop worked with the same HDMI cable on my Tv in the same HDMI Port. The Xbox, Tv, and HDMI cable work fine, they just won't work together

<p>Perhaps switching to component cables until you resolve the issue would be a suitable option for now, there is not much defference between the to cables on a 26" screen, i actually use a component cable on my 250 gig slim with a 40" TV and the picture is
 still great...</p>

    <title>Creating and Saving Win 10 System Images - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lshel42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating and Saving Win 10 System Images</h2>
                    I bought an external hard drive for backup purposes. I'd like to maintain several system images, so that in the event I need to re-image, I can select the image from the appropriate time frame. I remember reading that the system image must be on the drive
 root. Is that still true? If so, how can I keep multiple versions of "WindowsImageBackup" on the root of my external drive? Thanks.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The backup system image is exactly like the mirrored copy of the OS which contains the configuration of the OS. When you create backup system image, your windows 10 comes back to the same position at when the image was created earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use System Image Backup like you did in previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to Make a Backup System Image in Windows 10</strong></p>
<p>If you want to recover&nbsp;this system image in your PC you have to follow few steps one by one which are mentioned below:</p>
<p>- Right-click on the <strong>Start</strong> button and open <strong>Control Panel</strong></p>
<p>- Click <strong>File History</strong></p>
<p>- In File History, click the <strong>System Image Backup</strong> link in the bottom-left corner of the screen</p>
<p>- Connect an external USB hard drive to the computer with sufficient free space</p>
<p>- The backup wizard prompts you to choose from one of the three options to save the backup. For instance, just select the hard drive you just connected. However, you can also back up to blank DVDs and a network share, but these options are likely to slow
 down the backup process</p>
<p>- Click <strong>Next</strong></p>
<p>- Confirm the prompt to backup and hit <strong>Start backup</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            Hi Pavan. I think your first answer is wrong. I believe the image is stored on the root of whatever drive you select for storage. Secondly, I was looking for some work=arounds on the overwriting issue. For example, maybe it's possible to rename each image
 file, for example by appending the date, to prevent it from being overwritten. This would obviously require deleting the appended date prior to restoring that particular image. That's just one way that overwriting&nbsp;might be prevented, but I don't know if the
 renamed file will successfully restore. I was hoping someone on this forum would have some suggestions known to work.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As informed earlier its not possible to save system image backup in root drive and its recommended to take backup in external hard drive, DVD or USB. Because operating system Is in c: drive and&nbsp;so its not possible to&nbsp;backup is also in same drive. When the&nbsp;operating
 system crashes there is no way to get system&nbsp;image.&nbsp;You may refer the steps below to rename and store multiple system image backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Navigate to the backup location above for where you saved a system image that you want to keep before creating a new system image.
<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Right click, or press and hold, on the <strong>WindowsImageBackup
</strong>folder, and click/tap on <strong>Rename</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Rename it to something like <strong>WindowsImageBackup-Copy-1</strong>, press Enter, and click//tap on
<strong>Yes</strong> if prompted by <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">UAC</span></strong>.<br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong> <em>This way you can just easily change the
<strong>1</strong> an the end of the name to 2, 3, 4, etc... for each new system image that you make a copy of</em>.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> You now have a different system image version that you can leave at this location to be able to keep multiple versions.<br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong> When you want to restore a system image in a renamed
<strong>WindowsImageBackup-Copy-1</strong> folder in the future, then you must rename the current
<strong>WindowsImageBackup</strong> folder first, then rename the <strong>WindowsImageBackup-Copy-1</strong> folder back to
<strong>WindowsImageBackup</strong> in order to be able to restore it. The <strong>
WindowsImageBackup </strong>folder must be in the root directory of the drive, and not within another folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you have any further quires. Thank you. </p>

            Is there anybody on this forum that can provide me better answers than I've been getting. I asked two simple questions and I've gotten conflicting answers on both of them. I'm satisfied that I know the answer to the first, i.e. Yes, the image backup must
 be saved to the root of the drive. And for the second question, Pavan has implied that, Yes, I can save multiple images by renaming them like I had suggested, but what I really wanted was other, hopefully easier ways to save multiple images. Feel free to chime
 in Thanks.

            <p>Pavan is quite correct. As it is the ROOT drive, the SYSTEM OS that you are imaging, (along with any other drives you wish to image) it cannot be saved to itself. You will note when creating the image, the root drive shows up only as a drive to be copied.
 It does not show up in the destination drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot save an image of C: drive, on C: drive, or for that matter F to F, G to G etc. This would defeat the purpose of creating an image. If it were possible to create an image of Root (C:) and store it on C:, when C: fails, the image goes with it, which
 is why it is not permissible in the first place. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just saw how old this is. That was a waste. Oh well, I wonder if he finally got it? :-/</p>

<p>Hi Gas Money,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>a. Which edition of Windows 7 Operating system do you have? Is it a 32-bit edition or 64-bit edition?<br />
b. How are you trying to connect to the Camcorder? Are you using a Firewire or USB?<br />
c. As you connect the camcorder, does it get detected or you do you get any error message?</p>
<p><br />
As, I checked for the compatibility of this device with the Windows 7 32-bit edition as well as 64-bit edition which says that it is compatible with both the editions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=Canon FS20 camcorder&amp;type=Hardware&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=Canon%20FS20%20camcorder&amp;type=Hardware&amp;page=1</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=Canon FS20 camcorder&amp;type=Hardware&amp;page=1&amp;os=64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?s=Canon%20FS20%20camcorder&amp;type=Hardware&amp;page=1&amp;os=64-bit</a></p>
<p>I suggest you to disable the security software and try to connect the camcorder and verify if it gets detected.
<br />
<br />
Normally once the camcorder gets detected, the driver will load automatically and does not require additional drivers to be installed.</p>

<h3> joshua falken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t click on Windows 10 start menu</h2>
                    For some odd reason, I can't click on anything on the start menu, notifications sidebar, and anything related to the OS such as settings windows. &nbsp;I can use everything else just fine, and everything that I mouseover is highlighted in the start menu and
 such, but it will not respond to any sort of clicks. &nbsp;I've tried restarting my computer, explorer.exe, and even using powerbash through the administrator command line. &nbsp;The mouse is a razer naga 2014 and the driver for it is updated automatically through razer
 synapse, which claims it is up to date. &nbsp;Has anyone any idea what might be causing this?

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have the exact same problem on my windows 10. For the time being the only solution I have is work around but at least I can use my windows menu:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- open Windows PowerShell admin with a right click on windows icon </p>
<p>2- type: Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</p>
<p>3 - Once finished you'll get back the usage of windows menu, unfortunately at the next reboot you'll have to do it again, just a workaround not a permanent fix</p>

            I think I may have figured out what is causing this issue. I too am having issues with not being able to left click on the start menu or Edge, It turned out Edge had some kind of popup or something, as when I closed ALL edge browsers, my ability to left
 click on my start menu&nbsp;came back..

            This would be a different issue. As the spinning mouse indicates that system is busy. Which could be several things, Slow internet connection. To many programs opened at once, ( rebooting seems to allow them to open back up in windows 10), So manually
 close all browsers and programs and apps, then reboot. Other then that Hitting Ctrl Alt Delete, and opening the task manager, ( then click more settings or show more), you should see a list of all the processes, and such.. If one is using ALL of the CPU or
 Memory, then that would be whats causing it.

<p>The upgrade advisor may not work if there is a conflict with the third party program or service. I would suggest that you try to run the Windows vista upgrade advisor after disabling the third party program or services by following clean boot procedure<br />
&nbsp;Perform clean boot and check if you have the issue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135<br />
Reset the computer to start as usual<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;Refer the below link to download the Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor.<br />

&nbsp;Refer the below link to download the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx<br />
&nbsp;Note if you trying to upgrade to Windows 7 you cannot upgrade to Windows 7 from Windows XP you will only be able to do a custom installation of Windows 7.<br />
&nbsp;For more information refer the below link.<br />
Upgrading from Windows&nbsp;XP to Windows&nbsp;7<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7<br />
&nbsp;On your question if your computer can run 64 bit of Windows vista or windows 7 or not, the quickest way to find out would be to contact your PC manufacturer.&nbsp;<br />
You cannot upgrade from 32bit operating systems to a 64 operating systems. You will have to do a custom install after which you will have to reinstall all the programs and application on the computer.</p>
<p>Windows 7 System Requirements:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver</p>
<p>Windows 7 Upgrade Paths (Supported Upgrade Scenarios)<br />
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd772579%28WS.10%29.aspx</p>
<p>Upgrade paths:<br />
When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. In your case, you can upgrade to Windows 7 depending on edition and architecture of Windows Vista
 you have installed. If you are running a 32 bit version of Vista and want to upgrade to a 64 bit version (edition of Windows 7), you will have to a do clean install, this applies vice-versa.<br />
<br />
If you are running consumer editions of Windows Vista such as Home Basic or Premium, you can only upgrade to either Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. Also, you cannot do downgrades, which means, if you are running Windows Vista Ultimate now, you cannot downgrade
 to Windows 7 Home Premium. You must do logical upgrades:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista Home Basic &gt; Windows 7 Home Basic, Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Business &gt; Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Enterprise &gt; Windows 7 Enterprise<br />
Windows Vista Ultimate &gt; Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
