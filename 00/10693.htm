    <title>Underline not working on second line of bulleted text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Underline not working on second line of bulleted text</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue with MS Word 2013 not underlining the second line of bulleted text in my document.&nbsp; The document has multiple bulleted points and every other one&nbsp;works just fine if I select the underline feature, but this one will not underline the second
 line.&nbsp; I've tried using format painter and checked for any strange formatting marks, but nothing looks different from the other bullets.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Yes, but that's not working.&nbsp; I've never come across this issue, so I thought I'd try&nbsp;looking into the style templates per another suggestion. &nbsp;It's strange because it's only one bulleted point in the document that has this issue.&nbsp;

            Thanks!&nbsp; I redefined my&nbsp;normal template (which I've been wanting&nbsp;to do anyway)&nbsp;but I found that it was&nbsp; actually the bullet that was&nbsp;the issue.&nbsp; When I switched bullet formats, the issue went away.&nbsp; Very strange, since it was only on one particular bullet
 within the document, but switching took care of the problem so I'm not going to invest any more time trying to figure it out.&nbsp;

            It adds Bluetooth support to outlook, so you can sync calendar contacts etc with the phone - if you don't plan on connecting your phone to the computer, then you won't need it.

<h2>            From Address With Mail Merge</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(52, 58, 65, 1)">To perform mail merge "from" a shared mailbox address, I used to use Outlook Profiles so that Outlook could be running "as that user" and
 all the emails merged get sent from that account. &nbsp;When doing the merge, I just need to make sure I launched Outlook and used that profile so all the outgoing emails come from the right account.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(52, 58, 65, 1)">But since moving to O365, our shared mailbox is no longer an active directory user, so I can't setup an Outlook Profile to login "as that user".
 There's no password for that "user". &nbsp;I can't even create a profile, thus when I send my mail merges, all the emails come "from Shawn", which is not what I need when I send out these 18000 merges.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(52, 58, 65, 1)">Does anyone know any way to accomplish this? Am I going to have to abandon mail-merge and write my own macro of some kind to step through and
 send every email, setting the "from address" on each single one?</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Shawn,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Office 365, to create a mailbox in the Outlook profile as a separate profile, the official solution is to create the mailbox as a user mailbox and assign an Exchange Online license to it but not
 to use a shared mailbox. Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand it would be nice if we can create the shared mailbox in the Outlook client as a separate profile.
</span><span>Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</span></p>

</p><p>Whenever I open an Access file, an auto back up file is created. The name of back up file is added with "_backup". For example:</p>

<p>- Name of auto created back up file : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; database_backup.accdb &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this auto back up</p>

<p>Access 2007's included backup feature saves a copy of the currently active database. To open this feature, click the "Office" button. Highlight "Manage" and click on "Back Up Database." The program will prompt you to choose a backup location and file name.</p>

<h2>            Quick Access in Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Created an ftp link to my sat receiver, already a while ago. This includes the user name and password. However, always had to back-space to get rid of the "/", that is after clicking on the link. If I didn't, wouldn't be logged on&nbsp;to the receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, this worked ok until build 14393 installed. Using the back-space and pressing enter, opens the link in a new page, which in itself is no big deal, but shouldn't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wanted to remove the link from Quick access now, but nothing I have tried will let me remove it. Right click is unavailable on this icon.....</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#40;Mac&#41; on Exchange 2010 - Calendar Colors Disappear</h2>
                    <p>Good day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user running macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) and an up-to-date Outlook 2016 on Exchange 2010. User applies category colors successfully but they seem to disappear after a few weeks. This first happened a few weeks ago; I attributed it to an Outlook update.
 But the issue has reappeared today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>She is not logging into a Windows PC -- I see an article that talks about category colors not syncing. The only thing she did in the past 24 hours was to accept a calendar invitation from her iPhone which is not running Outlook. Not sure if that could have
 triggered the problem but it's the only behavior I've been able to identify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next step is to check logs to see what may have caused this to happen in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any input.</p>
<p>

            Hi iDonna,<br />
<br />
May I know which Outlook 2016 for Mac client version are she using (<em>e.g. version 15.30</em>)?<br />
<br />
Does this issue happen to specific calendar or every calendar color categories? <br />
<br />
Is she have set up email account on multiple devices such as Phone/Tab/desktop? If so, please temporarily disconnect the all other devices (<em>e.g. mobile/desktop client</em>) and then try to check this issue via using Web mail app to see whether the problem
 still occurs.<br />
<br />
Moreover, please try to check this issue via using different Mac PC (<em>e.g. any non-problematic colleague’s Mac PC</em>) to determine whether it is specific client side issue.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

            <p>Shyamal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurred twice on a Mac Pro running El Capitan (OS 10.11.6).</p>
<p>
</p><p>First on February 23rd:&nbsp;<strong>All</strong> calendar category colors disappeared. I ran the updater (15.31.0) and updated Outlook at the time. User reapplied colors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They disappeared again on March 9th. This time&nbsp;<strong>All but one </strong>category calendar colors disappeared. On March 7th the colors were there. On March 8th, the user did not log into that Mac but she did accept a calendar invite from Exchange email
 on her Android device. When she logged into the Mac on March 9th, the calendar colors were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user does not have another computer. (I read Microsoft's note about colors not syncing between Mac and Windows -- that doesn't apply here.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Category calendar colors <strong>are</strong> visible in owa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also a fresh install and newly configured Outlook profile from January. I see Outlook is creating numerous repeated entries in the logs too. So I think there's something else going on. Example:<br />
</p>
3/13/17 11:21:34.980 AM Microsoft Outlook[45128]: Stream 0x7ff6a26110e0 is sending an event before being opened<br />
<p>
</p><p>The issue remains unresolved. Thank you for any information to resolve this issue.</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint 2010 adds sound effect to transition of slides during recording</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I have been frustrated with a problem I finally realized happens when I record in PowerPoint 2010. I &nbsp;I start with a new file and a blank slide. Without direction from me the recording adds an animation sound of a plate crashing with each slide transition.

<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>I can see the animation icon on the slides.In the Animation function menu, it shows the animation sound in Preview. &nbsp;All the other possible functions are greyed out so I cannot figure out how to eliminate it.</p>

            <p>Dear Steve and Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After lots of troubleshooting, an IT specialist suggested that the clicking noise for the transitions came because I was using a jack microphone on my HP Pavillion laptop. &nbsp;The sound was my microphone gathering energy to function for each slide. &nbsp;I switched
 to an MSB microphone and this eliminated the problem. &nbsp;It took persistence with much frustration but I think this is a useful solution for this problem.</p>

    <title>First Impressions of build 9926&#58; No. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dustiiwolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            First Impressions of build 9926&#58; No.</h2>
                    <p>Seeing as I've found myself with numerous grievances with build 9926 (enough to put me back to using 8.1, rather than "roughing it" through the preview), I figured I would write about my first impressions and see what discussion comes of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Installation</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">I seriously hope that this is just a preview issue, but as it stands, one cannot upgrade from Windows 8.1 on most&nbsp;WIMBoot machines. Not everyone can afford decent computers with an SSD and a minimum of 64GB memory. This is something
 that has caused quite a headache for me (trying to find ways around it before backing up my disk and saying "to heck with it!" and doing a fresh install.), and
others too.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So, I go ahead and do a fresh install, and lo and behold, the touchpad off the bat is not installed (despite Windows supposedly having drivers built in for these things and the hardware being a simple Synaptic's clickpad). So, I
 have to drag out my USB mouse and go through the setup (which never asked me about sync settings; It just assumed i wanted the theme, explorer, and accessibility settings from my old tablet I no longer own which had settings optimized for touch). So setup
 completes and now I'm logged in.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1 Step Forward, 2 Steps Back: The Worst of Both Worlds</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">At first glance, the latest preview looks pretty nice. However, build 9926 is the epitome of "Don't judge a book by it's cover". In an attempt to appease both touch and mouse users, Microsoft has been working on merging the interfaces,
 which was working for them up to this point; Then they just had to go a spoil everything. Many issues were present (not all of them bugs) in many areas. To list some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Start menu is slow to respond (even post patch)</li><li>The live tile layout, while in concept is better, is completely destroyed (live tiles on my 1366x768 screen were small and fuzzy, and the counter text was oversized), especially when compared to previous builds (where the actual implementation was better,
 despite lacking the needed resizability and scalability that is poorly demonstrated in the current build)</li><li>Again, as with the live tiles, the All Apps layout is poorly implemented within the latest build, with earlier builds having a much more sensible implementation (this feels like its using the layout from previous builds, but the implementation of the All
 Apps screen in Windows 8.x, making for a hard to navigate all apps menu)</li><li>Letterboxed Dialogs. Remember those modern dialogs in Windows 8.x that would dim the screen and display a message in a banner the spanned the entire width of the display? Well, now it's cut off at both ends, only displaying the box from where the text begins
 to where the buttons end, and the screen never dimmed as well, making for a jarring experience (i didn't know a dialog had displayed till i realized that other elements weren't responding.)</li><li>Cortana really feels weird in that little box of hers that pops up from the taskbar. I appreciate the inclusion of her, but the interface feels all wrong. I can already see 2 better methods of implementing her ui:
<ol>
<li>Have her appear in the start menu (in place of the All Apps display) once a user starts typing, presses the mic icon, or says "Hey Cortana". Have the start menu expand to display results, replacing the entire menu display with Cortana</li><li>Have her slide out from the side in a "sidebar" that hovers over the desktop, similar to charms or the share dialog, and expand the sidebar for results display.</li><li>For smaller tablets, just duplicate the experience from Windows Phone. No need to complicate things there.</li></ol>
</li><li>Windows 10 isn't so charming anymore. No seriously, where are the charms? While, granted, they were better suited for touch, the complete removal of them feels awkward, especially as all the dialogs and such that came with them (exceptions being app settings
 and share) are either gone or repressed. Clicking the network icon in the taskbar now requires me to wait for the Settings app to open (if it will open) to select a wireless access point, and hinders anything I may of already been doing in the first place
 with Settings. Again, this makes no sense, as the original charms themselves were quite intuitive and mouse friendly, but rather, the method of accessing them itself was a bit one-sided (that side being touch).</li><li>Less is definitely not more, if the new settings app is to be believed. Not only is it less friendly for any input (Icons don't always equate to "better for a mouse"), but there are a considerable amount of settings missing (backup, onedrive, and more).
 The interface, overall, feels messy and with very little thought put into it. It's kind of like someone looked at Control Panel in category view, replaced the icons with weird new outlined versions, and then stripped any kind of setting they figured touch
 users wouldn't like.</li><li>While the new titlebars are decent, they still feel weird, and there has yet to be any kind of adaptive font color implemented for darker themes (which is a must have). The text also doesn't line up quite with the window's manipulation buttons, making it
 feel improperly aligned.</li><li>It would appear there is no longer a modern file picker, or at least, it didn't pop up when I went to change my account photo (I wanted the one I'm using in the People Hub). The ability to access files within other applications is key.</li></ul>
<p>So as one sees, a lot has gone awry in the latest Windows build where the interface is concerned. Makes me worry about the Windows Phone preview (I wasn;t to fond of the new background system seen in the presentation. Much prefer the current one in 8.1,
 especially since numerous developers updated their apps with transparent tiles for the current implementation.)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To the... cloud? Maybe not.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">Once again, Microsoft has decided to backtrack, as if Windows 8.x was some vile thing they wish to forget, and are killing good things in the process. What I mean is, the integrated OneDrive implementation found in Windows 8.1 and
 earlier Windows 10 builds is gone. And while this isn't too big off a deal (It still works the same for most of you desktop using folks), there are two glaring issues. The first is, with the newer integrated version, external drives are no longer an option
 for the location of your onedrive folder (in fact, the "Location" tab is completely missing from the folder's properties page. You have to delete the OneDrive folder and restart OneDrive to change its location). So to those 32GB and 16GB machines with limited
 space but a [SD] card in place,&nbsp;kiss goodbye to ever using any OneDrive files offline, as if Microsoft doesn't change this in future builds, you're looking at a forecast of sunny skies without a cloud in sight. The second issue I previously mentioned is the
 omission of a touch app. Now maybe I just got a faulty install, but I looked and didn't find a single onedrive app in the app list. What this means is touch users are back to using windows explorer and changing the icon size for their fingers.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I can has pinned sites?</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">Now this may have to do with the way Windows 10 syncs, but considering Windows 8.1 never did this with the same exact settings enabled, I'm not holding my breath. We all know Windows 10 has done away with Modern IE and Microsoft
 is prepping IE's successor, project Spartan (IE12? IEx?). However, remember when you had that windows 8 machine, and pinned all those tiles in modern IE? Well, they've just been synced to your computer (despite apps being turned off in sync, and those pinned
 sites being previously removed). I had dozens upon dozens of pinned sites I didn't even know I pinned, that synced down, presumably&nbsp;under "browser" settings. (on my previous Windows 8.x machines, they were either under Apps or Tiles (can't remember which at
 the moment, as I always have both of those options disabled in sync.).) This was easily remedied though, as in 10 I could actually right click them and view the shortcut source (to which I ctrl+a 'ed &amp; del. 'ed them). Oh, and since i'm on the topic of IE,
 despite my home page being set to nothing but about:tabs, the Internet Explorer Preview page launches every time you open IE. EVERY. TIME. Even in no addons mode. It also seemed to render pages
<strong>poorly </strong>in comparison to IE11 on Windows 8.1 (I had noticeable lag and page issues requiring a refresh or more.)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Drivers? Hahaha. Oh, youre serious.</span></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center"><em>"Drivers for basic functions like storage, networking, input, and display come with Windows. These drivers allow you to c</em><em>omplete the Windows installation and connect to the Internet. You might
 be able to get more drivers from Windows Update." - <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq-right-for-me-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Insider ('Is it right for me?')</a></em></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">This is seriously misleading. I have a simple Synaptics Clickpad, which supports generic HID mouse input drivers. Yet, for some reason, It's incompatible with Windows 10 (as well as the Windows 10 setup environment
 and recovery environment, to which the Windows 8.1 setup and recovery environment DOES support.). I had to use a USB mouse to manually install the drivers. Even then, I couldn't install the generic Synaptics drivers from the Synaptics website, as the installer
 said I already had a newer version installed (<strong><em>lies</em></strong>), and attempting to install using the inf manually resulted in "file not found" and a once more non-functional touchpad I had to rollback (this issue I've experienced before, and
 is typically due to an error in the INF file, but unlike in the past, I couldn't find anything noticeably wrong with it). I also had numerous drivers related to the Intel Dynamic Platform that had to be installed. But hey, the screen and speakers worked.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: left"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Conclusion</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">Amongst all the lag, bugs, and downright errors on Microsoft's behalf, along with the issues mentioned above, Microsoft has really let me down. I watched their webcast, got my hopes up for a new and improved
 preview, and then had them dashed. TBH, I haven't had a preview this bad since the Windows 8.0 Developer Preview. Now, the latest build isn't all bad; The new universal apps that were included look pretty good, and the store is headed in the right direction
 with it's interface (though it needs everything: apps, games, music, movies, books {Nook powered?}, etc..). They also showed with this build that they have some pretty great ideas. But in the end, It just doesn't work.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">No, really. I'm back on 8.1 as of writing this.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left">Please note that as I am a person on the internet and not a journalist or someone being paid, that this is my personal opinion, and does not necessarily reflect the views of others. If I was a journalist
 and or being paid, these would still be opinions, none the less, but the point stands.</p>

<h2>            Cortana Search results</h2>
                    <p>When I ask Cortana to "Open Control Panel" for example,&nbsp; she gives me a long BING list of Websites with Control Panel in there somewhere but does not give me Control Panel in my computer.&nbsp; The same goes for Device Manager or any other place I may want to
 go in the computer.&nbsp; Is there some way that her BING search default can be turned off or changed or is there some way to get her to get Control Panel in the computer rather than all over the Web?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried different ways like "Get Control Panel" or just "Control Panel" besides "Open Control Panel" and, no matter how I phrase the request for something in the computer, I end up with a BING web listing.</p>

    <title>Build 9879 issues. Warning&#58; nit picky&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trevor pott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 9879 issues.  Warning&#58; nit picky&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Below are a list of issues I have with the current build of Windows 10, in no particular order.&nbsp; Some (okay, a lot) of these are really nit picky.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to point out for the record that I am not asking Microsoft to apply my personal UI preferences to all and sundry, or to make them default, so on and so forth.&nbsp; I've done the dance of "you're just a filthy customer, you're supposed to take
 whatever UI Microsoft feeds you <em>and like it</em>" during every previous iteration of Windows.&nbsp; Let's put that discussion to one side and note that when I discuss UI elements here I am asking for the option of
<em>choice</em>, not to have my person views or desires foisted upon everyone.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also gladly pay a little extra for a "Windows 10, choice edition", where the cheap-o version was Windows UI design-by-fiat and the "choice edition" contained a bunch of little nerd knobs that we could twiddle until we had a UI that worked for us.&nbsp;
 Though if Microsoft chooses to go this route, I respectfully request they give us the ability to "export UI configuration" to an XML that we could then load onto another user on another PC so that we don't have to spend all our time hunting through registry
 hives to pull that stuff out into a .reg file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these issues have, of course, all been submitted through the official feedback mechanism.&nbsp; I am posting it to the forum because I am running on the "fast" track, and felt that it would be good to have a talk about the issues with other Windows Insiders
 before Microsoft releases another "stable" version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hopes here are not to chastise Microsoft, but rather to spark ideas in others for their feedback.&nbsp; Maybe there are items of consensus amongst my feedback, maybe I'm just completely off base on some items, and maybe some items are unique to my setup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, thanks to Microsoft for doing a Technical Preview and giving us the opportunity to voice our concerns and thoughts.&nbsp; Here are my nit picks with the current version.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Windows General</strong><br />
<br />
Some weird crashes are bothersome, but the big issue is the things that "broke" in the latest upgrade.&nbsp; A great example: closing the lid on the laptop now only "sleeps" the computer about 25% of the time.&nbsp; When the computer comes out of sleep, about 1/10th
 of the time it doesn't fully wake up.&nbsp; The light "breathes", but no combination of button presses will wake it.&nbsp; Hard off then back on is the only way.<br />
<br />
Still have issues with text in the actual window chrome: when a window is not primary focus, you can't read the title text.<br />
<br />
Can we please have an option to get away from the steamrollered-flat square look?&nbsp; Preferably something without the wasted space for text everywhere?&nbsp; PIXELS!&nbsp; They're important.&nbsp; Especially when you are stuck on 1377x768 (still the most common resolution.)<br />
<br />
I'm not a fan of the overly intrusive chrome.&nbsp; Things like Windows Media Player as an overlay that eats 1/8th the screen on a 1377x768 screen when I play a song?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; WHY?&nbsp; Similarly, notifications are a pain.&nbsp; Some giant box that pops up and eats 1/8th
 the screen to inform me Dropbox has received a file?&nbsp; Who thought that was a good plan?&nbsp; I have sads.&nbsp; Many, many sads.<br />
<br />
WiFi seems to be unable to exceed 100Mbit/sec no matter what I do, or what hardware I use.&nbsp; Unsure if Windows 10 or an issue with the Intel Drivers for my various WiFi adapters.<br />
<br />
A number of items are in Windows Firewall which don't have proper "names".&nbsp; @icsv.cll, ajrouter.dll, Cortana, etc.<br />
<br />
Can we please have spell check integrated at the OS level?&nbsp; This is built into modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox.&nbsp; It's built into proper instant messengers, mail apps, you name it.&nbsp; Why are we still typing into things like "feedback boxes" or "the Windows
 Preview Hub" or Internet Explorer without a basic spell check?&nbsp; Why isn't this functionality available for everything from Notepad to the command line to IE?&nbsp; Spell Check is so fundamental to modern OSes, apps and browsers that using an OS/apps without it
 feels a little like banging two rocks together.<br />
<br />
<strong>Task</strong> <strong>Manager</strong><br />
<br />
Task Manager can take up to 1 minute to show up after "right click on task bar, task manager" approximate every 10th time. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Task Manager doesn't group applications.&nbsp; (For example, it would be nice to see "Chrome takes up this much RAM" instead of each individual chrome thread.&nbsp; I'd love the ability to see "Chrome" threads as a group, then "expand" them as a tree to see what's eating
 RAM on a per-thread basis.)<br />
<br />
Task Manager's RAM consumption under "processes" doesn't add up to the amount of RAM consumed under "performance".<br />
<br />
Task Manger doesn't have a means by which to set the CPU display to "logical processors" and have it stay that way as a default.<br />
<br />
Task Manager's disk option doesn't have the ability to show Disk Queue Length, instead showing Active Time (which is far less useful.)<br />
<br />
Task Manager doesn't have a means to group Disk graphs/info into a single tab, like logical CPUs can be done.&nbsp; That would be very useful.<br />
<br />
Task Manager doesn't have a means to group Network graphs/info into a single tab, like Logical CPUs can be done.&nbsp; That was VERY useful back in the 2003/2008/2008R2 era.&nbsp; Please bring it back! &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Network graphs are "dotted/lined" instead of "two different colours of your choosing".&nbsp; This is very hard on people with colour blindness.&nbsp; Please let us go back to "two different coloured lines".<br />
<br />
Task Manager App History is only for Windows Store Apps.&nbsp; Nobody uses, likes or wants Windows Store Apps.&nbsp; Can we please get this functionality for real applications?<br />
<br />
Task Manager lists applications in Startup, but doesn't offer the ability to remove these applications from the startup sequence.&nbsp; We could basically remove the #1 reason to use MSconfig if this were offered here.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; It seems like a rational bit
 of right-click context menu functionality.<br />
<br />
Task Manger "details" does not offer the ability to view the command line for the process, but processes does?&nbsp; That doesn't make much sense, at least to me.<br />
<br />
<strong>Start Menu/Taskbar/Search</strong><br />
<br />
Right clicking on Windows Store apps in the start menu and choosing to uninstall them doesn't make them go away.&nbsp; This gives me sads.<br />
<br />
Cannot set "tiled" items in the start menu to have text descriptions.&nbsp; Considering how similar "This PC" "Control Panel" and "Network" look, this is a problem.&nbsp; Hovering isn't a solution as the point of a launcher system is fast access.&nbsp; That's like "press
 and hold" to perform actions on a touch screen.&nbsp; It's frustrating and time consuming.<br />
<br />
Cannot make "tiles" only one horizontal layer deep.&nbsp; This makes for a lot of wasted space.<br />
<br />
Start menu only offers this bizarre Windows 7-like "captive" start menu option in which all the items must exist within the bounds of the menu box itself.&nbsp; I far prefer the Windows 95-like "cascading hierarchical menus" style menu that would span a screen.&nbsp;
 This makes it easier to see individual items (and their hierarchical path) without a lot of scrolling or fussing about.<br />
<br />
Nothing I do seems to prevent my searches from going to Bing.&nbsp; I really - really - don't want my information being sent to Bing.&nbsp; Ever. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Notifications Icon near the clock takes up the space of two tray icons.&nbsp; Going back to "every pixel is precious, especially on a&nbsp; 1377x768 screen", that's remove one actually useful icon I could have visible for my use.&nbsp; Can we have the option to make the notification
 icon just behave like a single "always on" tray icon?<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows Explorer</strong><br />
<br />
Windows Explorer puts a bunch of stuff under "Desktop" that I don't want there.&nbsp; Why can't I configure what's there?&nbsp; Why is there both "Network" and "Homegroup"?&nbsp; Why is there the user folder and control panel?&nbsp; And why is there OneDrive in this Special Place?&nbsp;
 Shouldn't OneDrive live under "favourites" like Google Drive, Sync and Dropbox have to?&nbsp; In fact, why have "Desktop" here at all?&nbsp; I really just want "Favourites", "This PC" and "Network".&nbsp; The rest is extraneous **** that gets in the way of doing the job
 to hand.<br />
<br />
The Ribbon Bar.&nbsp; Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please give us the option of doing away with the accursed Ribbon Bar in explorer.&nbsp; Menu + toolbar was far easier and more space efficient.&nbsp; Make it an option extra and charge us
 for it, I don't care.&nbsp; Just please don't inflict this ribbon bar on me for the next 10 years, I beg you.&nbsp; Actually begging.&nbsp; If you need a video, I will send you one of me on my knees actually begging you.<br />
<br />
"Right click, copy" in the URL bar of Chrome no longer seems to work ever since I moved to Windows 10.&nbsp; Unsure if this is Windows 10, or just Google being plonkers.<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall rules, even in the simple interface, are proliferating to the point that it might do well to categorize them.&nbsp; "Windows Store Apps", for example and "Core Windows Components".&nbsp; "Steam Apps".&nbsp; "Third party apps" etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>Individual Applications</strong><br />
<br />
Windows media player doesn't seem to be playing MIDIs right.&nbsp; Every now and again it takes a MIDI that is a short length (say 10 seconds) then determines that all subsequent MIDIs are of that length.&nbsp; It also seems to be playing fast and loose with the actual
 playback speed.&nbsp; Basically songs don't play the same in Windows 10's latest WMP as they have for the past 20 or so years.<br />
<br />
VMware vSphere Client has a bug when running under Windows 10 wherein I cannot pull up a "map" of storage devices.&nbsp; It can crash the client.&nbsp; Does not occur under WIndows 7/Server 2008 R2.<br />
<br />
Chrome latest stable release seems to exhibit a memory leak that it doesn't under Win 7/Server 208 R2.<br />
<br />
Skype crashes out randomly (more than under just the conditions described in your blog post), I suspect this is related to the third-party app Pamela using the Skype API.&nbsp; Also, the new Skype UI for the latest Skype&nbsp; is atrocious.&nbsp; Please find the UI designers
 for it and given them a pantsing.<br />
<br />
</p><p>Thank you for taking the team to read this all. Have a great day!<br />

</p><p>So you decide to use a preview (not even a beta, a preview) of an operating system on your production system, the one that you make money on.&nbsp; This makes complete sense.

<p>I loathe it. &nbsp;Absolutely loathe it. &nbsp;To the point that if it is still in Windows 10, despite all the other enhancements, I'll be using a Linux desktop. &nbsp;I realize they're all pretty universally horrible, but they are - to me at least - less horrible than
 Windows 10. &nbsp;Virtually all my clients have gone Mac anyways (thanks, Windows 8), and if things like the Ribbon don't get fixed, then I guess they just won't be coming back from it.<br />
<br />
I don't care if Microsoft has the Ribbon as an option. &nbsp;Even a default. &nbsp;Go right ahead. &nbsp;What I am asking for is freedom of choice. &nbsp;Give us the option of reenabling a menu+toolbar. &nbsp;Why should those of us who despise the ribbon have it forced on us just because
 other people prefer it? &nbsp;Why can't we have choice? &nbsp;Why is choice so anathema?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, it is these sorts of things that are deciding factors. &nbsp;Windows 8 proved this loudly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I'm not attempting zealotry here. &nbsp;Merely voicing my concerns as I have been asked to. &nbsp;Microsoft requested people test and lodge their issues. &nbsp;I am doing so. &nbsp;With luck, someone at Microsoft may notice and may even take pity upon the very
 people they have disenfranchised with their previous release...and the subsequent PR and customer relations gong show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question, ultimately, is "is this a new, more responsive Microsoft under Nadella?" &nbsp;If the answer to that is "no", then my followup question is "why should I invest my personal money into this company" followed closely by "why should I trust my business
 or the businesses of my customers to this company"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft claims to be "mobile first, cloud first". &nbsp;The question remains to be answered: are they still "customers last, partners last, developers last, staff last?" &nbsp;Personally, I'd like to see "security first, privacy first" with "customers, partners
 developers and staff a damned close second". &nbsp;Mobile and cloud can get whatever resources are left over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft isn't prepared to be "security first, privacy first" and isn't prepared to bump customers up from "irrelevant" to "high priority", then why do we keep giving them our patronage?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Search results are highly personal. &nbsp;Being a tech journalist (and sysadmin) the overwhelming majority of my searches are highly technical. &nbsp;Far too many of them are an attempt to track down some obscure technical reference or an error code in Windows. &nbsp;To
 be perfectly frank, this is where Bing completely falls down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is just useless at searching Microsoft's own web properties. &nbsp;Google, for all it's many faults, is far better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the rest, I'm not a zealot. &nbsp;I'm a critic. &nbsp;I'm just as critical of Google and everyone else. &nbsp;(Except Ninite.com. &nbsp;They're my one exception.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do advocate <em>choice</em> where possible. &nbsp;There are seven <em>billion</em> people on this planet, all living in different jurisdictions with different cultures, mores and even different laws regarding privacy. &nbsp;The concept that we can all be -
<em>should</em> all be - expected to use one and only one version of anything is not only offensive, it's irrational and not remotely pragmatic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's <em>bad business</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The operating system itself is of decreasing relevance today. &nbsp;Microsoft knows this. &nbsp;It is the impetus behind their their headlong rush into the public cloud (and it's attendant highly addictive to vendors subscription model). &nbsp;This means two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Microsoft is no longer in a position to simply dictate what people will use (and bloody like it, or else!) &nbsp;Competition exists, and Microsoft is being forced to compete on merit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Enmity earned by Microsoft in how it deals with the operating system issues can and does translate directly into a lack of uptake in other, far more business critical areas, such as "the cloud". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, things like "providing choice" are actually important. &nbsp;If they don't, I submit that Microsoft will lose more than an irrelevant handful of nerds and whomever they influence through social media amplification. &nbsp;Microsoft risks losing an entire
<em>generation</em> of coders, and their customers, and that is only the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't make me a zealot to point this out, nor to ask pointed questions about whether or not I should continue to patronize a company that doesn't have my interests at heart. &nbsp;It's only good business to ask why I should sell Microsoft to my clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what a good businessman does: he continually re-evaluates his suppliers and business partners to ensure their goals are aligned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when the goals of Microsoft and myself - or my clients - are no longer aligned? &nbsp;When it becomes clear that Microsoft's intentions are to dictate to us how we will use their product instead of listening and offering choice? &nbsp;Why should we stick with
 Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the logic in brand tribalism? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no rational reason to support any company that doesn't support you in turn. &nbsp;To continue to support a company after it has proven not to be of benefit to you is loyalty bordering on fanaticism. &nbsp;To hate all things a company does or says without
 context or consideration is zealotry. &nbsp;Both are bad business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That we cannot discuss such things calmly and rationally is disquieting. &nbsp;Why is it that when one individual seeks options and choice others become upset? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't want Bing, for example, why does that grate against you? &nbsp;I want the ability to have an operating system that is focused on privacy; that means no integrated search of any kind. &nbsp;As an option. &nbsp;One I can verify can't be turned back on against
 my will, or "reset to default" as part of an update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That shouldn't affect you ability to keep Bing integration turned on. &nbsp;Yet it seems to upset you that I don't want the same thing you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing with the ribbon. &nbsp;I specifically asked for a <em>choice</em>. &nbsp;Not the removal of choice from others. &nbsp;From where does this fanaticism stem that says "all 7 billion of us must do things the same way?" &nbsp;And why do you become upset when someone
 seeks the option of doing it differently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think on it. &nbsp;Perhaps, if you can find an answer as to why others seeking choice bothers you, we might be closer to discovering why it bothers so many developers. &nbsp;Then, maybe, we could start to negotiate a middle ground.</p>

            <p>You are free to ask the powers that be to ban me, if you don't like the issues I raise, sir. &nbsp;It won't stop me from raising them elsewhere, though it will say quite a lot about yourself - and Microsoft - if they feel that an attempt to calmly and openly
 discuss the issues <em>as they relate to the technical development of the product&nbsp;</em>need to be censored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly believe that these issues are intertwined. &nbsp;The technical choices are intricately intertwined with the political and economic landscape. &nbsp;If there are solid technical reasons why something cannot - or should not - be done, hey, that's a great
 discussion point. &nbsp;If there are no solid technical reasons why a given item can't or shouldn't be done then it is a question of priorities, and those priorities are important to the customer as much as to Microsoft itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I find disheartening is that you view any attempt to discuss these items illicits such vitriol. &nbsp;I have nothing to gain by using Windows 10 as my primary operating system, putting the time and effort into testing and then providing feedback. &nbsp;Yet you
 ascribe me nefarious motives when I ask hard questions. &nbsp;Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can choose to believe this or not, as you will, but my only goal here is to help make Windows 10 better for everyone. &nbsp;I want Microsoft to succeed with Windows 10 if for no other reason than that I have spent so much of my professional life supporting
 it. &nbsp;Relearning everything for a new OS is a bit of a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the same token, if we don't raise we see to be issues - technical, political and economic - they will never get addressed. &nbsp;You accuse me of having a "chip on my shoulder" and demand I recuse myself from commenting further on the development of this operating
 system, using ad homeniem attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you unable to see the hypocrisy in that? &nbsp;By what right do you demand that I be silenced? &nbsp;And what issues have I raised, exactly, that are so ideologically impure that I should accede to that request?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have listed my issues and much of the rationale behind them. &nbsp;All you have done is attack me personally without providing even a shred of counterevidence against the issues I raised. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forum is for those who seek to improve Windows 10. &nbsp;What value are you providing by demanding that individuals legitimately attempting to do so leave, and without providing any rationale for that demand whatsoever? &nbsp;What is
<em>your</em> agenda, sirrah? &nbsp;And why is it incompatible with calm, open discussion of the issues raised?</p>

    <title>How do I remove the white eye flash glare effect in pictures taken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jvnext  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove the white eye flash glare effect in pictures taken with the new Windows Samsung Focus Flash phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I took some pictures with the new windows phone, and then uploaded them to Skydrive, and also emailed them. I tried to remove the flash glare white eye effect that appears using the red eye removal and all other tools available in Paint, Picture manager,
 the new Live photo gallery etc. There is no basic tool to take care of that. I was hoping to change the settings on the phone so it does not cause this effect. I checked the phone camera setting options, nothing seems applicable. I did find these articles
 on the Internet, but I was wondering if Microsoft makes an add-on product, and I just wanted an easy fix for the future.</p>

            Turn off the flash and take pictures with good natural light.&nbsp; If the picture is a little dark, you can use the tap the 3 dots in the lower corner of the screen while you are viewing the picture and select the auto-fix option.&nbsp; Turning off the flash will
 prevent the white glare on the picture.<br />

    <title>Lookup Fields in SharePoint List show as Read-Only on iPhone with - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lookup Fields in SharePoint List show as Read-Only on iPhone with SharePoint App</h2>
                    <p>We use a SharePoint List to collect Issue Details. I would like to use the SharePoint App on our iPhones to simplify data collection from the field, however the fields in our List that are type "Lookup" show as Read-Only to iPhone users. Is there a setting
 that can be changed or is this a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>Thanks for binging this issue to our attention. We can reproduce the same behavior from our side and we still need time for further investigation.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>We want to confirm the version with you: Are you using SharePoint 4.6.0(20190114) and IOS12.1.4? Can you help to check?</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>After some test, we just found the lookup fields are not editable in all the Mobile apps, include SharePoint Mobile app for IOS and SharePoint Mobile app for Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The request has been raised in SharePoint UserVoice:&nbsp;<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/350433-sharepoint-mobile-app-for-ios/suggestions/17689828-allow-the-mobile-sharepoint-app-to-edit-lookup-col" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">allow the
 mobile sharepoint app to edit lookup columns. they are read only in the mobile app, which makes the app quite useless</a>&nbsp;We hope you can vote for the idea. If more and more users vote for the idea, it's more likely to get the attention of the product team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround to this is opening the list with the browser of your mobile device and edit the list item. It is editable with the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<p>
</p><p>In reference to other post I put on the Excel support page, Word is displaying similar problems....<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Time for an update for Word too?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing PowerPoint will probably have similar issues, but not tired yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From research I did the other day it comes down to the way that Office saves temporary files and needing permissions to a certain folder when saving.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in other post no other software has the same issue. So hopefully you can troubleshoot that with an update.</p>

<p><span>Hi smallprint76,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the information and repro video you provided. We could understand your feeling. And we get the point that the issue happens in your local Mac and server. Thus, as you mentioned, it may be an issue with Mac and Microsoft. Please disconnect
 the server and try our suggestions below to narrow down it first. Once the issue is fixed, connect your server again and check whether the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><span>Considering this thread is so long, I’d like to make a summary to see the information more clearly and better address the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>1.Your OS version is 10.13.1, your Office version is 15.40.</span></p>
<p><span>2.You can’t save the new Word document in your local Mac (e.g. Desktop, Documents). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. You can’t open the file sent by others. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you choose Save as and save the attachment in the Desktop and then try to open it from Office client?</span></p>
<p><span>4.</span> You have tried to run First Aid. (The issue persists.)</p>
<p><span>5. You have tried to reset disk permission. (It works for 1hr and the issue persists)</span></p>
<p><span>6. It works in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>7. You mentioned you did a total install according to this article. (The issue persists.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; To completely uninstall Office 2016 for Mac, please refer to the following article:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Troubleshoot-Office-2016-for-Mac-issues-by-completely-uninstalling-before-you-reinstall-ec3aa66e-6a76-451f-9d35-cba2e14e94c0?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 it.</span></span></p>
<p><span>2.Considering you mentioned it may be related to temporaryitem file, please try to
</span><span>double-confirm whether you are trying to create a file to a network share instead of locally. If so, you may try to creating a .TemporaryItems directory with global read/write access at the root of the network share to see the result.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>3.I found two related threads, please confirm whether <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_mac/office-2016-for-mac-grant-access-error/784990ca-8565-44ce-9b0a-07959eeda6c2">

            It should be in Deleted Items, if you haven't emptied it. Soft by the Icon heading. Recurring events have a unique icon, so should be relatively easy to spot.

            <p>If your data from the secondary sources are required in a table format, you could use DATABASE fields in the mailmerge main document to import the data from those other sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, suppose you have a mailmerge with a data source listing students and various&nbsp;data concerning them&nbsp;in one file that you want to use as your main data source&nbsp;and another file containing information about their classes, birth dates &amp; teachers in
 another file, from which you want to list all students in the same class. You'd set up the mailmerge main document in the normal way, pointing to the main data file and, to extract the data from the secondary file, you might&nbsp;use a DATABASE field coded like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{DATABASE \d "C:\\Users\\Susan\\DataFiles\\Students.xlsx" \s "SELECT [LAST NAME], [FIRST NAME], FORMAT([BirthDate], \"DDD, D MMMM YYYY\") AS [Birth Date], [Class] FROM [Master List$] WHERE [Class] = \"{ MERGEFIELD Class }\" ORDER BY [LAST NAME], [FIRST NAME]"
 \l "37" \b "51" \h}</p>
<p>where 'Master List' is the name of the worksheet concerned. Note, too,&nbsp;that the field braces (i.e. { }) are created in the document itself, via Ctrl-F9 (Cmd-F9 on a Mac); you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message. Nor is it practicable
 to add them via any of the standard Word dialogues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The &nbsp;\l "37" \b "51" at the end of the DATABASE field are parameters setting the table format. Details of field switches that control the table format are given at:
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/field-codes-database-field-HP010260104.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/field-codes-database-field-HP010260104.aspx</a>. That link refers to a 'Table AutoFormat dialog box', which you can access via Insert|Quick Parts|Field&gt;DataBase. You'll need to set up a connection to the datasource
 before you can access the dialogue. Alternatively, you could create a temporary table in the document then use the following macro:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub ShowTableAutoFormatDialog()<br />
Application.Dialogs(wdDialogTableAutoFormat).Show<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dialog box options show what formats can be used. To use them, make a note of which table # you choose from the listbox (not its name) and which other formatting options you've checked. You'll need both of those for the \l and \b switches.</p>

                    I'm trying to consolidate all of my contacts into one place. I chose that place to be my Microsoft account (The basic account tied to the phone). So I went in to Outlook.com on that account and imported all of my contacts. But when I went to my phone to
 import my contacts from that account, there was no checkbox to import contacts. Only email. This account has no email. Only contacts. You see the frustration, yes?

            If it is the primary account you are adding, the contacts are synced automatically to the primary account and that is why you do not have an option to check contacts. Just add the account to the phone and the contacts will appear.<br />

<h2>            Change &#34;from&#34; address when replying to an email - Windows 10 mail</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When replying to a message in Windows 10 Mail, there doesn't seem to be any way to change the "from" address (it's greyed out). Let me describe the scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I colleague sent an email to account "A" but that was the wrong account. I don't want to reply to his message from account "A" but account "B" instead so any future replies from him will go to that address instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Note: I tried looking for the appropriate "Windows 10 Mail" category below and the closest thing I could find is Outlook.com --&gt; Email. I'm seeking help with the Windows 10 Mail Desktop app
<em>not the Outlook.com online email app</em>. If there's a better fit for this post, feel free to move accordingly or better yet, add the Windows 10 Mail option to the list of categories/topics in the dropdown fields.</p>

            Hi ggwells, 
<br />When you reply, you can only change addresses if the account is outlook.com and you have aliases or connected accounts configured - then you can choose from one of the other addresses.

<p>Thanks for the info Diane. Seems like every other email client on the planet can do this. I wonder why MS stopped short of this pretty important feature. I feel like I can't be the only one who finds this shortcoming very frustrating. I certainly hope it's
 on the development roadmap (nudge, nudge MS employees monitoring this thread)!</p>

            There is a lot about the mail app that could be improved - it's ok as a lightweight mail client but is missing a lot of features that are in better clients.

<p>I agree. I want to love MS but I find I'm continually disappointed by the promise of being more productive with their "new and improved" software that usually has less features and promises of what "will be" in the future that aren't realized.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The approach seems to be "launch a very basic tool and increase features later" and that's fine if it's a brand new category of software product but unacceptable for office essentials like mail, contacts, and calendars. They should combine the&nbsp;<em>best
</em>of what's out there at launch - not 10 steps short of this goal as it only frustrates customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should say that I actually really enjoy Mail and use it as my primary client on my Windows machine as the interface is clean, modern, and good for basic needs. It has a lot of potential and makes Outlook feel very clumsy, bloated, and dated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sentiment is if they combined the best of Outlook, Mail, and the features of their O365/Outlook.com mail into a single offering, they might actually have a good product. I seem to need at 2 or 3 of them now to handle all my needs.&nbsp;</p>

            &gt;&gt; makes Outlook feel very clumsy, bloated, and dated
<br />That's because Outlook is definitely 2 of the 3. :)  (Dated is in the eye of the beholder - a lot of users don't like change. )

<p>Fair enough and I agree. Problem is, MS is constantly changing their products - often based on whatever they're pursuing in-the-moment which sometimes doesn't align with what's best for the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy enough if they just doubled-down on Outlook and stopped trying to reinvent the wheel with new, half-baked web and desktop clients. They just do some things&nbsp;<em>differently</em> and not
<em>better</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give credit where credit is due though... MS does listen to their customers more than Apple does at the moment but I'll save that rant for another day ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the conversation. I hope MS is reading this and hits the mark of helping everyone leverage technology to be more productive--even if it starts with an amazing email client.</p>

<br />
I figured out a workaround, if not the core issue.<br />
I am using Firefox 16.0.2, a supported browser.<br />
I receive no error message when clicking on the button; it is as if it doesn't exist.&nbsp; In fact, none of the buttons from "B" for bold all the way through the smiley face icon in Outlook work at all.&nbsp; There are never any error messages.<br />
<br />
I tried selectively enabling and disabling add-ons.&nbsp; This act, rather than a specific add-on, appears to have fixed the problem.&nbsp; It could be a corruption in Firefox settings having to do with Add-ons.&nbsp; I turned them all off and the buttons worked, I then turned
 them on one-by-one to see which was the offending Add-on but hyperlinks always worked.</span>

            Further update:<br />
<br />
The workaround stopped working after a few days.&nbsp; It never worked on a Macintosh.<br />
So in sum, Outlook web front end doesn't work on multiple browsers and computers for all buttons from Bold to Attach Files and everything in between, I'm sticking with Hotmail.<br />

After reading some of the forums, I went to Start/Run and typed REGSVR32 OLE32.DLL to see if this would fix my problem. It&nbsp;did not.&nbsp; The result "was loaded but the call to DLL register server failed with error code 0X80070005."<br />

Any ideas on how to fix?<br />

            Thanks Don.&nbsp; I have done some more research and have found the real issue is my DellA940 printer is not compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;the Dell website states there is no dowload avaiable for this printer to make it compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; Some
 printers are and unfortunately mine is not.&nbsp; Looks like I am in the market for a new printer.&nbsp; It would be nice to find one that already has Windows&nbsp;7 (no download needed)&nbsp;but that appears not to be the case.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am creating a notebook on SharePoint Online and are receiving the following error code.:</div>
<div><strong>An error occurred while attempting to sync this section or notebook. (Error code: 0xE40107E3)</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The previous notebook i have created and linked to SharePoint in this way has worked fine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I open the Notebook in SharePoint, I get a message that the Notebook is empty.</div>
</blockquote>
Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you. &nbsp;Hitting Shift and F9. &nbsp;Seems to have fixed a part of the issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems that part of the issue &nbsp;is with the OneNote app in SharePoint.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;When I open the OneNote Document in SharePoint it opens in the OneNote app, even though I have set my &nbsp;document library settings to use the OneNote client program. not the app. &nbsp;When it opens in the app it says that the notebook is empty.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, if I right -click on the document and select to open in the client application, it opens fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>How do I force the document to open in the client application and not the app?</div>
        </p>

            Dear Alan,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />This bounce back that you receive comes from the server and has nothing to do with MS Outlook, as it is a client that shows what is happening on the server.
<br />
<br />As message suggests, it was rejected due to suspicious content. This may be because of the content itself, the attachments or other things. It is better to contact Google Postmaster support for more information.
