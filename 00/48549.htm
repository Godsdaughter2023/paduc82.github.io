    <title>add to dictionary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hiram53  say:</h3>
<h2>            add to dictionary</h2>
                    When I right click to highlight a misspelled word, the 'add to dictionary' option is grayed out and is therefore unusable.&nbsp;
<br />
I am able to 'ignore' or 'ignore all', but not to add it to the dictionary so that I can keep using the new word.<br />
I use many biblical words and abbreviations which are not in the computer's dictionary:&nbsp;
<br />
How do I activate this feature in order to add unfamiliar words to my dictionary?<br />

            <p>Having the same problem with a greyed out ADD TO DICTIONARY button I struggled for hours with other suggest answers (repairs etc)&nbsp;but then &nbsp;found a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Word 2010 Go File&gt; Options . Proofing &gt; click&nbsp;Custom Dictionaries. Then click New and type in name Custom on name bar (which shows .dic&nbsp;to be cleared before typing Custom. Then click Add button</p>
<p>, ciustom.dic appears in dictionary list. Do NOT make&nbsp;the Custom dictionary &nbsp;the default dictionary as it suggests, instead go to the drop down list of languages and select your preferred (English U.K. in my case), then click Default button OK all boxes
 to quit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This creates the custom dictionary again.&nbsp;I think the problem is that MS is default in English U.S&gt; but when you make another form of English the default, it sometimes fails to make the custom dictionary for saving your own special words</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this stops someone else having the same grief!</p>

<blockquote>I too have troubles with my own custom dictionary, which I have been building up after years of using various Word versions, being able to edit the file (with extension 'dic') with any simple text editor. Now with the 2007 version running under
 XP I cannot add such custom dictionary in Options/Proofing etc.&nbsp;A newly created one (copying the old one) cannot be edited&nbsp;nor&nbsp;have words&nbsp;added. No solution/suggestion in Help.<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I have just encountered this problem with Office 2007 Outlook, and believe I understand at least part of the problem. I, too, had a very long, 2200-word custom dictionary that I had built up over the years, and, at least up to Office 2007, had simply been able
 to copy the old&nbsp;CUSTOM.DIC into whichever folder the Outlook version-du-jour wanted it&nbsp;placed. After much experimentation, I have proven that neither Word 2007 nor Outlook 2007 can use a CUSTOM.DIC from Office 2003 (or earlier). In my particular case, I found
 that I had to rebuild the custom dictionary completely, after which an examination of its contents revealed at least one of the underlying problems (apparently due to differences between Outlook 2003 and earlier and Outlook 2007, if not also between Word 2003
 and Word 2007). <br />
<br />
To rebuild the custom dictionary, I performed the following steps:<br />
<br />
<br />
1. From the <strong>Outlook 2007</strong> window, I selected <strong>Tools</strong>|<strong>Options</strong> and then selected the
<strong>Spelling</strong> tab,&nbsp;and then clicked on the&nbsp;<strong>Spelling and AutoCorrection</strong> button.<br />
2. That opened up an <strong>Editor Options</strong> window, in which I did the following.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Unchecked the <strong>Suggest from main dictionary only</strong> option.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Clicked in the <strong>Custom Dictionaries...</strong> button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;That opened up a <strong>Custom Dictionaries</strong> window, in which I did the following.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;Set the <strong>Dictionary language</strong> to <strong>All Languages</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;Highlighted (checked) the listed custom dictionary&nbsp;file name, and then clicked on the
<strong>Remove</strong> button. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: This action&nbsp;does not actually delete the indicated file name, but merely removes it from the list of custom dictionaries that Outlook 2007 and Word 2007 are to reference.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) Now, with&nbsp;the previous&nbsp;custom dictionary file name disassociated, I clicked on the
<strong>New</strong> button&nbsp;in order to start the process of&nbsp;creating a new custom dictionary file.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (g)&nbsp;That opened up the <strong>Create Custom Dictionary</strong> window, and in the
<strong>File name</strong> box I typed the name of a new, not-previously-existing file (such as
<strong>techcust.dic</strong>).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h)&nbsp;Then I clicked on the <strong>Save</strong> button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) I confirmed&nbsp;(in the <strong>Custom Dictionaries</strong> window) that the newly-created file was "checked" (assocated) underneath the
<strong>All Languages</strong> category.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (j) Finally, I&nbsp;clicked <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;Then I clicked <strong>OK</strong> on the <strong>Editor Options</strong> window.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;Finally, I clicked <strong>OK</strong> on the <strong>Options</strong> window.<br />
<br />
Note: What all that accomplished was to tell Outlook 2007 not to use whatever custom dictionary it was using, and start using a brand-new, but empty one.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;Then I opened up&nbsp;my old CUSTOM.DIC file in <strong>Notepad</strong> and copied its entire contents into the clipboard&nbsp;and then pasted&nbsp;that&nbsp;into a new email message's body.<br />
5. Then I sent the message, which of course caused Outlook 2007&nbsp;to spell check it, and I simply, repeatedly, but laboriously&nbsp;clicked on
<strong>Add to dictionary</strong> <em>for each one</em>. <br />
6. That built up my just-allocated custom dictionary file with the same, basic contents that the old one had.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That was a labor-intensive process, I admit, but it was the only way I could get it to work. Every other technique I found on the web for solving this probem simply didn't work for me. After all this was accomplished, I compared the two custom dictionary files:
 my old one&nbsp;and the&nbsp;new one just populated by Outlook 2007. The comparison revealed&nbsp;at least&nbsp;three potential&nbsp;causes&nbsp;that could&nbsp;explan why old custom dictionary files don't work:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Not all words in the old dictionary got put in the new dictionary. Why that is so I do not know, but I doubt it's because they are now in the main spelling dictionary (all the words in my custom dictionary are technical terms with odd spellings and odd,
 non-standard capitalization, such as: "<strong>CustomDicT</strong>").<br />
2.&nbsp;Even accounting for the words that are "missing" from the new custom dictionary,&nbsp;the
<em>order</em> of the words in the two files are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
different</span>. It is as if Outlook 2007 constructs the custom dictionary file's contents differently, or at least orders them differently. One possibility is that Outlook 2007 looked at my perfectly valid Outlook 2003 custom dictionary file and saw that
 it was not properly constructed according to the new, Outlook 2007 rules, and so simply declined to even try to use it, much less attempt to update it.<br />
3.&nbsp;The format of the Outlook 2007 custom dictionary file is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Unicode</span>, whereas the format of the Outlook 2003 (and earlier) custom dictionary file is
<strong>.TXT</strong> file). <br />
<br />
I suspect that folks that have reported&nbsp;at various sites online that they have got this to work somehow (migrating their pre-Outlook 2007 custom dictionary file to Outlook 2007) have&nbsp;been able to do&nbsp;so because of something they did that they did not understand.
 They probably didn't have any words in their custom dictionary that Outlook 2007 would have never decided on its own to place there. They probably didn't have any out of order words in the file, according to Outlook 2007's new rules (whatever they may be).
 They probably had a Unicode-representation file already, or inadvertently created one when they edited their custom dictionary using Word 2007, not knowing that that process&nbsp;would, for an ordinary,
<strong>TXT</strong>-like, but non-<strong>.TXT</strong> file, convert it to Unicode.
<br />
<br />
To prove that hypothesis, I used my favorite "text" editor, <strong>TextPad</strong>, to create a simple custom dictionary in both ANSI and Unicode formats (which&nbsp;TextPad can easily and simply do). I populated these two files using the same word list (short
 and composed of nonsense&nbsp;words, constructed by random keyboard typing, such as "lkjwers"). I saved both of them in the folder that Outlook 2007 expected&nbsp;such files to be in&nbsp;and introduced them to Outlook 2007, using the above procedure [except using
<strong>Add</strong> instead of <strong>New</strong> in&nbsp;step 2(f)], one at a time. The ANSI-format&nbsp;file was&nbsp;<em>apparently</em> accepted, but was
<strong>not</strong> used (that is, no words contained in it appeared to be accepted as valid spellings, nor would Outlook 2007 update it when sending an email message containing either other nonsense words or any of the nonsense words in it). The Unicode-format
 custom dictionary <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>was</em></span> accepted, used for spelling lookup, and&nbsp;was readily&nbsp;updated with any new words during a&nbsp;spell checking operation. If I edited the Unicode custom dictionary and inserted new nonsense
 words obviously out of alphabetical order, Outlook 2007 refused to use the file, just as if it were in the old ANSI (ordinary TXT) format.
<br />
<br />
Finally, I edited a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;my old CUSTOM.DIC file in TextPad and saved it in Unicode format, and introduced it to Outlook 2007. It did
<em>not</em> work, because there were, I presume, words in it that should not have been in it, and perhaps also because they were out of whatever order they now need to be in. But I further edited it to remove the vast majority of technical terms that consisted
 of mixed-case letters [which apparently now are sorted in a different order in the file] and&nbsp;many&nbsp;other words, and again saved it in Unicode format, and reintroduced it to Outlook 2007, and found that it worked perfectly, as I originally would have&nbsp;expected.<br />
<br />
Thus, the way to get Outlook 2007 to accept&nbsp;a custom dictionary from a previous version of Outlook,&nbsp;in my opinion, based on my experiments, is to&nbsp;remove all words that Outlook 2007 would not now put in there in the first place, sort the words in the proper
 order demanded by Outloook 2007 [whatever that might actually be], and save the resulting file in Unicode format. How, exactly, one accomplishes that in general is difficult for me&nbsp;to say,so the bottom line is this:<br />
<br />
<em>To migrate an old CUSTOM.DIC file to Outlook&nbsp; 2007 and Word 2007, simply create an&nbsp;empty, new custom dictionary file,&nbsp;open the old CUSTOM.DIC file in Notepad and copy its contents into an email or Word document, and then&nbsp;check&nbsp;the spelling (for example,
 by sending the email message). That will populate&nbsp;the new custom dictionary with every word that actually now needs to be in there, and they will be in the proper order as well, and all will now work as you expect and desire. It will take time, but it will
 work.</em><br />
<br />
I'd love to hear from anyone who can accurately describe the new word sort order requirement and expectations for Office 2007, etc. As far as I know, the requirement that the custom dictionary be in Unicode format is
<strong>not</strong> documented, either. It is of course possible that these restrictions I have deduced by experiment apply only to my particular installation of Office 2007 because of some specific options I have selected. I'd love to understand this problem
 better, but I find it astonishing that Outlook 2007 would not simply accept&nbsp;an old file just as&nbsp;it&nbsp;exists, in any format, eliminate any words it deemed unworthy of inclusion, sort the remainder into the right order, and then save it in the desired format.
 The file is, after all, intended to be updated dynamically by Outlook 2007 and Word 2007. It's its own file, so it should have felt free to manipulate it to its heart's desire.
<br />
<br />
Go figure.<br />

<p>If you read CAREFULLY you will see that if you have the Hardened edition with the little Founder card and 20 digit code on the back, you CANNOT enter the code until AFTER the 13th of November.</p>
<p>There has been people saying that it needs to be done BY the 13th, that is wrong!</p>
<p>If you were to simply purchase Elite(premium) by the 13th you would become a Founder. Those of us that have the Hardened edition have the Founder card, so we are good to go. We just have to wait for AFTER the 13th.</p>
<p>I hope this clears it up a little for some.</p>

    <title>How to delete and extend a partition in Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heather r. 1994  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to delete and extend a partition in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP 15 laptop, with a freshly installed Windows 10. I have a friend that put on the Zorin OS in a dual boot configuration. However, the whole thing was botched (you have to go through the BIOS to access Zorin, plus after a few minutes the whole operating
 system freezes), and now I want the whole thing gone. Windows at first I thought wasn't affected, but it deadlocked one day on Pocket, but on nothing else so far. When I mean deadlocked, I mean deadlocked. The mouse won't move, the LAN switch doesn't respond,
 nothing. I had to force restart the whole laptop. Anyway, my friend created a whole new partition for Zorin, the size of which was 100 GB. I want to delete that partition, and extend the volume back over to the primary C: partition. I will include a screenshot
 of Disk Management so you can see what I'm talking about. I think I need to delete the 99.65 GB partition (Healthy, Primary Partition). Am I right? I would appreciate detailed instructions on how to do this safely, so that I don't delete the wrong partition.
 Plus if you will tell how to extend the empty space back over. If you will, I hope you can take screenshots of the entire process. Also, do I need to reinstall Windows? And why would Zorin freeze in the first place, and then Windows too?</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help!</p>

            <p>Wow, what sort of partition layout is this?! 3 primary partitions without drive letters (372MB, 99.65GB and 2.89GB) that are all 100% free? On top of that
<em>four</em> recovery partitions (450MB, 450MB, 731MB and 18.36GB)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, you should be able to delete the 99.65GB and 2.89GB partitions immediately after C: and extend C: using Disk Management itself, without the need for third-party partitioning tools.</p>

            But can you tell me how to do this? I want to delete all the recovery partitions, and all the unlettered primary partitions. The whole thing is a mess, and I haven't the slightest clue on how to clean it all up. Can you help me?

            <p>The bigger recovery partitions are most likely HP's, and it's better you don't touch them unless you've created system recovery or factory restore discs. One of the 450MB ones should be Windows' own, but I have no clue why there's a duplicate. Disk Management
 will probably not allow you to get rid of all the recovery partitions, and if you use a third-party tool to get rid of them then there's a possibility that Windows may no longer boot. You might need to boot from Win10 Setup media or a recovery drive in that
 case and run Startup Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now the easiest thing to do would be to delete just the 99.65GB and 2.89GB partitions, then right-click C: and extend it so it takes up all the unallocated space to its right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a clean slate I'd recommend booting from Setup media (which you can create using MS' Media Creation Tool) and
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1950-windows-10-clean-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reinstalling Windows</a>. In Setup you'd select the Custom install option and get rid of all the existing partitions, then simply create a new one of 80-100GB or so for Win10. Setup will also create the ESP and any other system partitions it needs, but just
 the ones required and no useless extras. Once Windows is installed you can use Disk Management to create one or more additional data partitions as per your needs on the remaining unallocated space on the drive.</p>

            <p>I've already told you what you'd need to do to get rid of the other (recovery) partitions, and also how to start from a clean slate if that's what you really want. However if you're unsure (which seems to be the case given you're asking for instructions
 even to delete the two primary partitions and extend C:) then I advise you to delete just these two partitions for now and get someone knowledgeable to help you out with the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting the 99.65GB and 2.89GB partitions immediately after C: and extending C: is fairly easy. Just right-click each one in turn and delete, then right-click C: and extend the volume to the max size possible so that it takes up all the unallocated space
 where the two partitions previously existed.</p>

<h2>            Windows Hello works intermittently on Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone else experience a problem where Windows Hello stops working after resuming from sleep? It works the first time I resume from sleep, but does not the second time and on until I restart. It's not that the camera doesn't recognize me, the red light
 that illuminates when the IR&nbsp;camera is on never lights up leading me to believe the IR sensor never initialized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found anything specific in the event viewer logs, just a bunch of WiFi driver crashes (which is also concerning...).</p>

<h2>            Error Code&#58; 0xc0000225 after dual boot installation__</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two partitions on my hp pavilion slimline C: and F: Windows Vista is on drive c: I attempted to install windows 7 on drive f: by
<br />
doing a custom install and formatting the partition. It worked properly until after put in the computer name and password. Then,
<br />
command prompt said that it could not find device/harddisk. The computer then restarted and gave the error code 0xc0000225 on boot of windows 7. It also says "The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible. Windows vista boots fine, however.
 It offered the solution of using the windows 7 disk to perform startup repair, but startup repair said that there was nothing wrong with it. Does anybody have a solution that will allow me to boot into windows 7. I have tried reinstalling many times. Also,
 the installation media has worked on other computers. Additionally, Build 7100 does install completely without any problems.

<p><strong><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span><span>A. Do you get any error message?<br />
I would suggest you to log in to safe mode and see if you are able to login; make sure no external devices are plugged in when you are booting the computer in safe mode, the following steps will help you to login to safe mode.<br />
</span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Safe Mode and press Enter.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should then be at the Welcome Screen.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install the downloaded update.<br />
10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer in normal mode.<br />
Reference link to start the computer in Safe mode:<br />

<br />
The notepad computers will be connected to a server running on Windows 7 and using office 2010.<br />
<br />
It would be advantageous if we could install a net meeting alternative within this closed system at both schools and would be grateful for your suggestions on alternatives?</p>

    <title>Tracking ID in WPL playlists - what is it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noldorin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tracking ID in WPL playlists - what is it&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I've been browsing through some WPL (Window Media Playlist) files in order to try to understand the format. Most of it is pretty clear, since it's entirely XML-based, though I am however curious about one thing.<br />
<br />
Each `media` element under seems to have a `tid` attribute which contains a GUID. I managed to find
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd563841(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this MSDN page</a> , which states that the `tid` attribute specifies the "tracking ID" of the media item. Specifically, it gives the description:<br />
<br />
The tracking ID that can be used to track the File System Object for this media item.<br />
<br />
The text then goes on to explain that the values can be used for auto-repairing playlists. All this however does not tell me much. How does Windows Media Player actually perform the auto-repair task? Or simply, where else is this tracking ID stored in order
 to match a playlist item to a media file? Is it somehow added as an attribute on each actual file within the file system (e.g. each MP3 file)? Any more detailed explanation of how this works would be great.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Alex

            Hi Judd,<br />
<br />
This was primarily a question out of curiosity. I'm not actually having any issues with Windows Media Player, but I was curious how the tracking system works with tracking IDs. (Perhaps this is the wrong place for such a question?) I seem to have figured this
 out anyway - Media Player stores tracking ID along with song info in a central database under the user AppData folder.<br />
<br />
Thanks for you response, anyway.<br />

            I too would like to find an example code snippet of how to create the "tid" or Tracking ID Guid of a Playlist file entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow Windows Media Player is able to read the low level unique file identifier assigned to each file by the Windows Operating
 System, and transform that Identifier into a Guid that is saved in the "tid" field of each item listed in the Playlist XML file.<br />
<br />
And this has nothing to do with recently installed software or computer hardware or even 32 vs. 64 bit architecture or Windows version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is strictly a question regarding how Media Player can locate and utilize a files unique low level ID in the Playlist
 ,wpl file to facilitate automatic repair of playlist files.&nbsp;&nbsp; And how I can take advantage of this in my own programs.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, is this functionality available from the Media Player DLL as an API call?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or possibly it's something that is coded using the .Net framework.

            <p>I've been looking into this because I want my windows media player playlists on my phone. When Windows attempts to sync my playlists, they appear on the device as .pla files and are completely empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I manually copy them on, some lists were empty, some lists were partially there, and some lists are full. After opening the lists in notepad I've figured some things out. First of all, anything using absolute paths will not appear in a list on my phone.
 (Well duh, the documents and settings folder doesn't exist). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, is that some songs weren't appearing because the .src was referring to a .wma file. Once upon a time, most of my library was in .wma format. Along the way, I converted it to mp3 because it was more versatile (mostly for my ipod at the time). What
 is interesting is that these playlists src values are still pointed at a .wma file. They aren't on my phone because the .wma file isn't on my phone. They do appear on my computer though, so the tid and cid values must be how WMP finds the songs on a list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions remaining are, why are paths sometimes absolute and sometimes relative in my playlists? Whatever the case, I think I'll need to do some manual scrubbing to update my lists to use relative paths and make sure that they are all pointed at mp3
 files and not wma's. Another oddity, is that after copying the .wpl to my phone, it creates an empty .pla file. It doesn't seem to do anything but maybe its used by the phone somehow, possibly a pointer.</p>

<h2>            Problem in uninstalling Intel Proset&#47;Wireless Bluetooth while upgrading to windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I purchased Windows Upgrade 8 and ran Windows Update Assistant. </p>
<p>However, It is asking me to uninstall Intel Wireless bluetooth, as it is not compatible with windows 8. I did just that and inspite of uninstalling in successfuly it is giving a message "Manually Uninstall". I dont know what this means? is it successfully
 uninstalled or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Yogesh</p>

            After a lot of trial and error I found one solution. &nbsp;I simply reinstalled the Intel ProSet bluetooth software and then uninstalled it. &nbsp;I had tried this twice before and it didn't work but now all of a sudden it did. &nbsp;Hope this helps

<h2>            Windows update wont stop force restarting my computer.</h2>
                    I upgraded to windows 10 and it didnt allow me to play any of my games so i went back to windows 7. Everything works fine except for the fact that windows update keeps asking me to restart now or postpone and if i dont catch it it restarts my computer.
 When it does restart nothing happens and it keeps doing this. i cannot figure out how to fix it.

            <p>Turn the computer off fully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when it boot keep tapping f8 until you get a dialouge [At Bottom]</p>
<p>Then use the up and down arrow keys until you get to safe mode and click enter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then let it boot and log in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then open windows update menu, click change settings</p>
<p>and under important updates click on the rectangle and change the setting to "Never check for updates (Not recomended)" But the updates don't matter. Then just restart and it won't update anymore! Thank you!</p>
