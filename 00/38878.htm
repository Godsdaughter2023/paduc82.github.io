<h2>            Windows 7 extremely slow login on 2003 domain</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody!</p>
<p>I have a network with a 2003 sbs which is my dns server and a 2008 server which is my dhcp server.</p>
<p>The problem is that i had some pc's with win xp proffesional that could take up to 20 minutes (applying computer settings...) to see the desktop after the log in information. After I tried a lot of things I reinstalled windows and it sort of solved the problem.
 I stiil have one more pc.</p>
<p>Now I have 3 pc's in the same network with windows 7 SP1 (all with new hardware) that used to work fine but (and don't know if that happened at the same time) now take from 3-4 minutes to go to login screen and after that 7-20 minutes to finally see the
 desktop.</p>
<p>When I start in safe mode with networking it works fine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tried to disable local policy for pc and user at gpedit.msc (Does this work when pc is part of a domain?)</li><li>Tried at gpedit&nbsp;under Computer Configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;System--&gt;Logon, change "Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon" to ENABLED.</li><li>Tried at gpedit.msc. under Computer Configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;System--&gt;User profiles--.Enable “Set maximum wait time for the network if a user has a roaming user profile or remote home directory” and set to 0 seconds</li><li>Remove windows 7 systems from domain and added again</li><li>Disabled IPv6 </li><li>Installed latest lan drivers</li><li>Desktop size is only 80 MB </li><li>Tried to use an image for background</li></ul>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            whea_uncorrectable_error</h2>
                    <p>Anyone know how to fix this, I've had this error for a long time however recently it's been very frequent and frustrating. It only occurs when I either play high-load games such as GTA V or when I try to play mid/low-load games while watching a Twitch livestream.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Loads of people say to reset your BIOS in case of any overclocking which I have done and sadly I still got a blue screen of death.<br />

            Hi, ElectricalBanana
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend you to completely repair Windows, First, it would be a good idea to backup your personal files and photos

            Hi ElectricalBanana 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hey John</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you do anything, is anything wrong with your windows? Anything that doesnt work?</p>
<p>The DISM.log and CBS.log has an ability to report errors, which gets fixed, or might not even be an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the errors can sometimes have a stupid reason.</p>
<p><span>[8352] [0xc142011c] WIMGetMountedImageHandle:(2897)</span><br />
</p>
<p>My educated guess is that either the command is with to many letters. Or the syntax which the command needs to be run, missing something or has something in the wrong order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does windows work? Do you get any errors when running software, scripts, functions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If stuff works, ignore that log.</p>

<p>I dug deeper into your command.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft docs says "<span>/checkintegrity /verify /bootable" shouldnt be used at the same time, because the accessrights are different to the targets for all 3 commands.</span></p>
<p>Also, make sure you have the correct "rights" to access Image files, Win setup environment, the boot section and Windows folder in general. Even as admin, you need to gain extra access right for certain operations
 and areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you capture a custum image, did you dismount your current one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would use:</p>
<p><span>dism&nbsp; /capture-image /imagefile:H:\custom\Pro\install.wim</span><br />
Then use Mount instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you get it to work?</p>

    <title>unable to open QuickBooks 2018 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s_potter  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to open QuickBooks 2018</h2>
                    <p>Have spent hours trying everything to get <em><strong>Windows 7 Pro</strong></em> to open
<em><strong>QuickBooks 2018 Premier Desktop</strong></em>. After looking everywhere I'm here. I just read that Microsoft is having an issue with the Patch # KB4074805. Apparently this is causing all the crashing and not allowing the program to even open. Does
 anyone have more information? Can the patch be removed or is it the update that has the problem not the patch? Nothing is clear. I really need this. Starting new job in 2 days and I&nbsp; am trying to get this trial version open to practice. Help....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />

                    <p>In Windows 7, you could block all programs in restricted users/profiles such as for children... and then allow specific ones. &nbsp;What happened to this feature? &nbsp;Other than web filtering, this is one of the most important features of parental controls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The children share a home computer with me. &nbsp;I basically want to be able to only allow access to a few programs (such as word, ppt, web browser). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was possible in 7. &nbsp;But not possible in 10? &nbsp;If so, why would such a feature be removed? &nbsp;The architecture of the blocking was already written in 7. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I tried what you suggested. &nbsp;However, this didn't do anything.</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn't work. &nbsp;For instance, I unchecked the "Enable Access to this program" for Internet Explorer. &nbsp;However, in both admin and child user accounts, you can still run Internet Explorer. &nbsp;It did not block the program at all.</li><li>This only applies to a select number of possible programs. &nbsp;This does not have the option to block all programs, which we could do through parental controls in Windows 7.</li><li>Even if it did work (which it doesn't) this has nothing to do with parental controls and blocking for specific user accounts.</li></ol>
<p>After a couple responses that do not address the issue of parental controls and the blocking of all programs.... it makes me wonder if my question is being understood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the feature, which was in Windows 7, is simply not available, then please just acknowledge it rather than come up with solutions that do not address the issue that I'm asking about.</p>

<h3> sidrun  say:</h3>
<h2>            E&#58;&#92;Program Files... refers to a location that is unavailable... while trying to run my documents.</h2>
                    The problem started when I wanted to uninstall Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. I used some mods which created a backup folder. And now I can't delete the backup folder. I belive the problem is, that I included "..." in the end of the name. I read that .'s
 at the end of windows files are a big problem.
<div><br />
The problem has gone out of hands, because I can't open My documents. And I can't download anything without it noticing, that the folder is gone.</div>
<div>When I try to open My documents, it says "E:\Program Files\Rockstar games\Gta san andreas\Backups\name.. refers to a location unavalible. It could be on a hard drive on this computer, or on a network. check to make sure..."</div>
<div><br />
I tried diffrent uninstallers that seemingly delete it, but it will be back on next boot-up. I even tried to delete it in command prompt, which got rid of it until the next boot up.</div>
<div><br />
If the question seems wierd, then I can explain further if I get questions.</div>

            Hi Kevin
<br />
<br />Are you using a PC with a separate monitor or a laptop?
<br />
<br />If that is a PC with a separate monitor, on the side or bottom of the monitor is a menu button, press that and then on the on-screen display, look for wither an Autofit option or vertical and horizontal scaling . . .

<p>It's a PC with HP monitor.&nbsp; I was able to navigate on it to Image Control. There is no Auto fit and the Custom Scaling is greyed out, not an option I can access.</p>

    <title>Can I sell OEM licenses of Windows 7&#47;8 to customers who did not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natez99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I sell OEM licenses of Windows 7&#47;8 to customers who did not purchase their machine from me but can provide original purchase receipts&#63;</h2>
                    I have had several customers ask if they can purchase OEM versions of Windows operating systems. My answer had always been no, but after researching the subject I'm somewhat confused as to Microsoft's policy regarding OEM licenses.
<div>I currently do not have a supplier for retail Windows licenses. All of my suppliers are only carrying OEM versions and upgrade licenses. In response to my inquiring of them as to why they do not have retail licenses, their answer was that it is not profitable
 to hold stock since most end-users either</div>
<div>a) purchase a new machine with OEM license</div>
<div>b) upgrade form an older version of Windows with an upgrade license&nbsp;</div>
<div>c) Installed a pirated version of Windows</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, I have a customer who purchased a new machine without an OS from another retailer. If they can prove to me that it is a new machine without an OS can I sell them an OEM license?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Well, in regards to Windows 7 OEM System Builder licenses, Microsoft is stringent about reselling OEM System Builder licenses to customers, but there is nothing wrong with it. Its just that they say you should not do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Windows 8 OEM System Builder licenses can be sold to consumers without a problem. Windows 8 OEM System Builder has transfer rights:</p>

<p>"Can I transfer the software to another computer or user? </p>
<p>You may transfer the software to another computer that belongs <u>to you</u>. You may also transfer the software (together with the license) to a computer owned by

 of purchase directly to that other person, without retaining any copies of the software. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software.
<u>Anytime you transfer the software to a new computer, you must remove the software from the prior computer</u>. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between computers. You may transfer Get Genuine Windows software, Pro Pack or Media Center
 Pack software only together with the licensed computer."</p>

<h2>            Audio&#58; Open Volume Mixer problems in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I first start my Dell XPS 8910SE, "Open Volume Mixer" shows Device: Speaker/Headphone and Application: System Sounds. Both these items volume seems to be tied together and they are not "Muted".</p>
<p>After a few minutes, "Open Volume Mixer" shows the above 2 items and 5 to 7 "Windows Explorer" applications (no other names) and these extra 5 to 7 applications are all "Muted"!</p>
<p>I use RealTek (Came with this compute) </p>
<p>I have Windows Sound turned off.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled/installed and updated based on any post I could find</p>
<p>Any suggestions</p>

            <p>FYI&nbsp; I fixed my problem!</p>
<p>I kept trying to find out what those 5 to 7 extra "Muted" mystery applications were in my "Open Volume Mixer".</p>
<p>I ran a "Process Monitor" program and could only trace them back to being embedded in Windows.</p>
<p>I remembered seeing seeing an old post about some older versions of Windows with a similar problem. It pointed at some types of malware.</p>
<p>I ran "Malwarebytes" and it discovered and removed 4 bad programs (Don't know source (where/when))</p>
<p>After I re-booted, every related audio problem I had been working on was gone!</p>
<p>Kudos to the folks at Malwarebytes</p>
<p>As we all know: What works for one doesn't mean it works for everybody.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Any assistance you can give me wound be highly appreciated as Fallout 3 is one of my all time favorite games. Thank you for time and attention to this matter.<br /></b></p>

                    <p>Original Title: reg servo</p>
<p>I, downloaded a product named reg-servo, it says, I have over 2,000 errows on my computer. I already have several other regestries fixing software, none of which gives me results like this. This procces all started as a rsult of my headphone jack became
 comprimised. My speakers work fine, but, I just get static through the&nbsp;headphones. I tried to restore to a earlier point in&nbsp;time. Restore was successful, but still have sme problem. This happened ounce before, and I fixed it. Don't remember how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I, fix? or is this software safe to use?&nbsp; (Software, says it is a microsoft certified)</p>

            I don't have anything to offer on how to remove the static on your headphones further than trying a different set of headphones to make sure the problem is in the computer's headphone jack.
<div><br />
<div>On the other hand, i have plenty to say about 'registry fixers' and performance enhancers.&nbsp;<span>These programs are</span><span>&nbsp;</span><i>snake oil</i><span>&nbsp;and
 are much more likely to turn your laptop into a brick as actually fix anything or create a measurable improvement in&nbsp;performance. I'm not singling out 'reg-servo' with this flame. I sincerely mean
<i>all</i>&nbsp;of them.&nbsp;</span><span>I've personally never seen one create a measurable benefit but I've seen several of them make systems inoperable.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are looking to recoup performance that you feel has degraded over time, look at the programs that start up every time you start Windows.
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AutoRuns for Windows</a> does an excellent job for that. If you feel your browser is lagging, look into opening a browser instance without any add-ons (<i>All Programs, Accessories, System
 Tools,&nbsp;Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</i>. After seeing how well your browser runs with no add-ons, try disabling any that you do not require on a regular basis. Run the free version of

8:06 PM TS-010: Please stay online; let me go ahead, check your system configuration and activate REGSERVO for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
8:06 PM Phil huber: Lots of junk on it that may interrupt<br />
8:07 PM Phil huber: &nbsp;I download things and then when I want to see them, im told windows cannot read the file. I am then directed to search for the program that will open what i downloaded. they direct me to you. I bought your program because I just had bought
 some downloads and I want to see them, Help please, phil<br />
<br />
8:07 PM TS-010: Okay, I will surely assist you with that. Please be online.<br />
<br />
8:08 PM Phil huber: ok<br />
<br />
8:09 PM TS-010: Phil, your REGSERVO software is good to go now.<br />
8:10 PM TS-010: Could you please show me the file which you are trying to open so that I can have a better look?<br />
<br />
8:11 PM Phil huber: is that it?? &nbsp;I thought you would assist in reading files that windows cant readd. &nbsp;thats why i was directed to your site and made the purchase,<br />
<br />
8:12 PM TS-010: Yes, I will surely assist you with that.<br />
8:12 PM TS-010: Could you please show me the file?<br />
<br />
8:18 PM Phil huber: When I click on it (they are CRDOWNLOD) files &nbsp;when I click on it I get the same "windows cant &nbsp;open" meassage which routes me to buy this instant program from you. &nbsp; &nbsp; ???Are you just a company advertising where windows routed me to. &nbsp;As
 far as clearing issues with the computer I have &nbsp;a software package &nbsp;with Best buy<br />
<br />
8:19 PM TS-010: Let me inform you that a file association associates a file with an application capable of opening that file. A file association associates a class of files with a corresponding application.<br />
8:19 PM TS-010: This error might be caused because the given file extensions may have lost their association to any application. It can also be caused if the given file association keys or entries are damaged or lost. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
8:20 PM TS-010: Shall I go ahead and have a quick check to see the real cause of this error and also check everything is working fine?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
8:20 PM Phil huber: I get the windowss cant open file often. &nbsp;Its very aggravating. &nbsp;I thought if I pay you money that I would be able to open all files I download.<br />
8:22 PM Phil huber: Please go ahead Jeff<br />
<br />
<br />
8:22 PM TS-010: Thank you. Please stay online.<br />
8:24 PM TS-010: I can notice that, the task manager shows that your CPU usage is Normal and that is good. But, there is only one application running with the User permission and the Processes usage is very high.<br />
8:24 PM TS-010: Did you notice it?<br />
<br />
<br />
8:25 PM Phil huber: no i didnt. but then again i dont know what your talking about<br />
<br />
<br />
8:25 PM TS-010: Let me explain you. The Processes usage is very high. This is because of many unnecessary applications running in the background process without the User permission.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
8:26 PM Phil huber: I see you circling something with red marker, but I dont know the significance of this<br />
<br />
<br />
8:26 PM TS-010: The high Processes usage may affect the system performance, internal system files and application of the computer. It can also lead to making the computer freeze or respond slow. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
8:27 PM TS-010: These are unnecessary files remains even after uninstalling the application or downloaded through Internet. We need to remove all the unnecessary files manually in order to reduce the processes usage and internal system file interruption issues.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
8:27 PM TS-010: Before that, have you performed any uninstallation or application updates recently?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
8:28 PM Phil huber: Are you talking about the little Icons I have all over the desktop&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
8:28 PM TS-010: I am referring the any applications. Please stay online, let me go ahead check the Windows Update status.<br />
8:30 PM TS-010: It is important to install all the security Windows updates. But, in your case, some of the important automatic Windows security updates are failed. It is NOT normal.<br />
8:30 PM TS-010: Did you see that?<br />
<br />
<br />
8:31 PM Phil huber: I see where your drawing the red marker. &nbsp;So how do we fix this?<br />
<br />
<br />
8:32 PM TS-010: I will surely assist you with that. Let me brief you that there are several reasons why your Windows Update can fail. If it happens on a frequent basis, then you likely have a problem with the Windows Installer itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
8:32 PM Phil huber: why are these 'failed'<br />
<br />
<br />
8:32 PM TS-010: You may also have some damaged or Support files missing or even a registry damaged which will also stop your Windows Update from being properly executed. We need to reconfigure your computer registry files and need to replace the missing files.<br />
<br />
<br />
8:33 PM Phil huber: ok<br />
<br />
<br />
8:33 PM TS-010: Are you sure that, you have not removed any Windows files from your computer?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
8:34 PM Phil huber: Im not sure of anything, &nbsp;I wouldnt knowingly remove a window file.<br />
<br />
<br />
8:34 PM TS-010: Okay. Let me go ahead check the System diagnosis report so that we will get the resolution to fix all this issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
8:34 PM Phil huber: good, and thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
8:36 PM TS-010: The system diagnostics report show that there are multiple errors caused by various applications.<br />
8:36 PM TS-010: It is recommended to resolve the errors causing this failed status report.<br />
8:37 PM TS-010: Since, the basic Windows security updates and anti-virus application are also been interrupted. All the Windows files might also been damaged. It can only be fixed using the advanced tools.<br />
<br />
<br />
8:39 PM Phil huber: Shouldnt bestbuys service fix this stuff. &nbsp;Its what I pay them for. &nbsp;can you fix this or is this just another way to extract more money from the victum (me) ?<br />
<br />
<br />
8:39 PM TS-010: Phil, as there are multiple errors has already caused to various internal system applications and files. In order to fix all the Windows and damaged file problems. We need to diagnosis each system file separately to identify the issue and verify
 their supported version.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
8:40 PM Phil huber: can you fix this?<br />
<br />
<br />
8:40 PM TS-010: Also, these issues is no issue with the computer hardware, warranty would not cover these issues.<br />

<br />
<br />
8:51 PM Phil huber: Its suppose to be a no questions asked refund guarantee<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After the above:<br />
The additional typed dialog did not take to copying unto Notepad but Jeff did type that he was putting in for my refund and it would take about 3 days. I asked where he was from simply because of a phrase he used with which I was once before the intended victum
 to be ripped off regarding a cell phone. &nbsp;That specific phrase was, "I can transfer this session to our Advanced Technician". &nbsp;Sometimes they will say, "advanced tools"(like at 8:37 pm) are needed for your problem. &nbsp;Also, when you, in the beginning, ok the
 charge to your credit card, they do NOT!send a confirm order and information to your email. &nbsp;When you want to follow up, you dont know where to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I dont know under what country's laws they operate? 'India' maybe. &nbsp;So if they dont refund, what can I do? &nbsp;Maybe catch a slow boat to Calcutta? Then hunt for a lawyer you can trust (LOL). And what if they keep charging to my credit card? What can I do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In searching the internet I found the following that may help in trying to document a refund request.<br />
<br />
What is REGSERVO.exe ?&nbsp;<br />
<br />

8:51 PM Phil huber: Its suppose to be a no questions asked refund guarantee<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After the above:<br />
The additional typed dialog did not take to copying unto Notepad but Jeff did type that he was putting in for my refund and it would take about 3 days. I asked where he was from simply because of a phrase he used with which I was once before the intended victum
 to be ripped off regarding a cell phone. &nbsp;That specific phrase was, "I can transfer this session to our Advanced Technician". &nbsp;Sometimes they will say, "advanced tools"(like at 8:37 pm) are needed for your problem. &nbsp;Also, when you, in the beginning, ok the
 charge to your credit card, they do NOT!send a confirm order and information to your email. &nbsp;When you want to follow up, you dont know where to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I dont know under what country's laws they operate? 'India' maybe. &nbsp;So if they dont refund, what can I do? &nbsp;Maybe catch a slow boat to Calcutta? Then hunt for a lawyer you can trust (LOL). And what if they keep charging to my credit card? What can I do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In searching the internet I found the following that may help in trying to document a refund request.<br />
<br />
What is REGSERVO.exe ?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
REGSERVO.exe is known as REGSERVO and it is developed by Tuneup System Software Pvt Ltd. . We have seen about 2 different instances of REGSERVO.exe in different location.How to remove If you encounter difficulties with REGSERVO.exe , you can uninstall the associated
 program (Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Add/Remove programs.Here is the list of instances that we see for the process: REGSERVO.exe:&nbsp;<br />

The additional typed dialog did not take to copying unto Notepad but Jeff did type that he was putting in for my refund and it would take about 3 days. I asked where he was from simply because of a phrase he used with which I was once before the intended victum
 to be ripped off regarding a cell phone. &nbsp;That specific phrase was, "I can transfer this session to our Advanced Technician". &nbsp;Sometimes they will say, "advanced tools"(like at 8:37 pm) are needed for your problem. &nbsp;Also, when you, in the beginning, ok the
 charge to your credit card, they do NOT!send a confirm order and information to your email. &nbsp;When you want to follow up, you dont know where to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I dont know under what country's laws they operate? 'India' maybe. &nbsp;So if they dont refund, what can I do? &nbsp;Maybe catch a slow boat to Calcutta? Then hunt for a lawyer you can trust (LOL). And what if they keep charging to my credit card? What can I do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In searching the internet I found the following that may help in trying to document a refund request.<br />

<h3> dariangarbig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade stuck at 99&#37;</h2>
                    Yesterday at around 7pm I started my Windows 10 upgrade. It was taking a while so I left it on over night. When I woke up at around 8am, the upgrade is at 99%. It has been this way for at least 3hrs now. Is this normal, or is it stuck and I should restart
 my pc? Thanks.

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

            <p>Wish I had found this YESTERDAY before I started upgrading my Lenovo T400 (Win7 Ultimate) and T420 (Win7 Pro) to Win10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started the upgrades yesterday (Friday, 7/29/2016) at about 4:30pm (CST).&nbsp; It is now past 4:30pm on Saturday, 7/30/2016 and these laptops have been stuck at 99% for over 12 hours now.&nbsp; I'm assuming that I HAVE to let them complete the update now because
 it is the 30th and the "free upgrade period" has officially ended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be noted that the T420 had a factory fresh Win7 Pro install because I received it back from a repair yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; I also had a T430 also with a factory fresh Win8 install (also receive back from repair at the same time) that "only" took
 about 6 hours for the update to take place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what are my options?&nbsp; Am I SOL?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A curious mind wants to know...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The T420 just prompted for the restart of the system.&nbsp; I THINK it is about to finish the Win10 install.&nbsp; WEIRD how all of a sudden they should BOTH break out of the 99% thing at almost the same time (within 10 min of each other).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'll just have to wait through the T400 upgrade process to see if it finishes.&nbsp; I see Win7 is now showing that there are "51 important updates" to do.&nbsp; I'm going to shut down Windows Update until this upgrade is completed.</p>
<p>

<p>Greetings, lovelySPANk! Thank you for bringing your question to the forums. The first step I would recommend is logging on to
<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://billing.microsoft.com</a> and seeing whether the points were successfully added or not. You may also want to double check with the retailer to make sure the code was successfully activated.
 Feel free to PM me the code and I can also check into it as well. :)</p>

    <title>How to make second hard drive as Primary hard drive, and move files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fishneedshelp  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make second hard drive as Primary hard drive, and move files from first hard drive to the second one.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> How come I can't delete Program files from my 1st Hard drive?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Basically I got a new gaming laptop with Windows 7 on it, and I basically know nothing about computers. So everything is starting on my SSD (180 gb) and I want to move it to my 2nd hard drive HHD (750 gb.) I want to keep windows and steam (gaming platform)
 on my SSD and move almost everything else to my other Hard drive. &nbsp;When I move everything over it works, but when I try and right click and delete the Program files or Program filex (x86) it says I don't have permission. So I give myself permission and ownership
 of program files, but it isn't working. I tried deleting everything that didn't come on the computer and retrying what I just said, but it still doesn't work. &nbsp;I tried giving myself entire ownership of the Drives, but it still doesn't work. It keeps telling
 me I need permission from myself. Is there anyway for me to have my computer recognize the HHD as the primary drive, and then I can move Windows and Steam to my SSD? And would that delete anything? (If so let me know so I can put the drivers I have onto a
 flash so they don't get deleted.) Any help or advice would be great! Thanks for reading and for you're time and effort!)
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S.</div>
<div>Remember I know little to nothing about computers, so just assume I know nothing and give me step by step instructions if that's at all possible.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Basically you cannot, you would need to uninstall the programs, then custom install to the location/drive of your choice, even then many files will still be located on your windows drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you install a program many entries are written to the registry, if you then try to move a program, if you can, the registry entries will be incorrect and the program will cease to function.</p>

    <title>Creation mode kills achievements even just loading it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolfiesden360  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creation mode kills achievements even just loading it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Yea, I read the dialog but I am unsure if they really mean it.&nbsp; It says that loading a survival game in creation mode will stop all leaderboard activity as well as any achievements for that game that was created, saved, joined or LOADED in creation mode.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Really?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>LOADED but not saved breaks achivements?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I tried it with a new world created in creation mode.&nbsp; It indeed does do a popup when loaded in survival.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I created a world in survival, saved, and reloaded in creation.&nbsp; I saved.&nbsp; It indeed does popup a warning.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I created a world in survival.&nbsp; Copied it to my cloud (because I didn't want to damage it).&nbsp; Loaded in creation but did NOT save.&nbsp; I can load it in survival with no popup.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The question I have is if it was created in survival, edited in creation and saved, does it shut down achievements for others joining it either via split screen or network?&nbsp; I have 400/400 so I don't care for me, but for others I care.</p>
<p><br />
I have not used the host options at all yet.&nbsp; Do they also affect the world in the same way as creation?&nbsp; IE, not affecting it unless saved?</p>

<p>Get it disables WHILE you are in creation mode or if you SAVE and later load. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>But, as I said, it doesn't seem to do anything to the saved world if you don't save or allow auto-save to do so. &nbsp;I loaded a world in creation mode. &nbsp;Didn't save and disabled autosave. &nbsp;I exited without saving. &nbsp;The saved world appears no different than
 it did before. &nbsp;It still says its a survival game. &nbsp;it has no popup when you load.</p>

<p>Loading or creating ANY world on Creative Mode yes kills achievements. Microsoft is super strict about having no ways to cheat with gamerscores. So yeah the game developers had to make it that way. Don't worry I have a main world and me and lots of my friends
 have played on it and will make sure I never load that world on Creative Mode quite easy to get achievements on that world. I also have a new main world on creative mode which a bunch of friends have joined. And when a world has achievements disabled ITS PERMANENT
 for that world.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: If I created a world in survival, then reloaded it in creative mode &amp; built a track long enough for the "On a Rail" achievement, &amp; then reloaded it again in survival in order to get said achievement - that's a cheap &amp; easy way to get

<p>On the PC version, where almost no one cares about achievements, people will switch between creative and normal because they're scared of mobs or just lazy. If they allowed any loophole on this version people would exploit it into the ground.</p>

<p>Yall are apparently missing the question/focus.</p>
<p>I am sure everyone gets that scenario.&nbsp; Yea, cheap easy achivos.&nbsp; MS would not allow that.&nbsp; And, frankly, the only achivo that would benefit from the use of creative mode is the "On a Rail" and "When Pigs Fly".&nbsp; The rest are pretty simple and come almost
 naturally as you play.&nbsp; And, also frankly, the on a rail was a piece of cake compared to the hours spent finding dungeons with chests in hopes of getting a saddle.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; Mining iron and redstone and some gold for the rails was nuttin and I got most of
 the mats while looking for the stupid saddle.&nbsp; Anyway, this is not the source of my question nor the focus.</p>
<p><br />
The question was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NO</span>T if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
saving</span> or <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">creating</span> would shut them down, that is obvious and the answer is
<strong>LOADING</strong></span> turn them off even if you do <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>NOT SAVE</strong></span>.&nbsp; Like load up a survival created world in creative mode, look around.&nbsp; Exit without saving.&nbsp; Load it later in survival again.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
What I am wanting to do is generate some random worlds in survival mode.&nbsp; Save and exit.&nbsp; Then load them in creative to explore them to see if they are interesting to play.&nbsp;
 If you look I already have 400/400 and got it long before this update.</p>

<p>you could just load up random worlds in creative, and when you find one you like, copy the seed and use it to make a new survival world....that'd be the easiest way to go about it I think.....anyway, I don't actually know if just loading and not saving in
 creative would kill achievements...I'd think it'd be only creating or saving in creative that would do it, but yeah, I just don't know 100% sorry</p>

<p>The game says if you "load" it in creative, it kills achievements. &nbsp;It could have said "save," but it says "load". &nbsp;I would take the game at its word. &nbsp;In any event, with regard to TG ZoBo's comment, you actually don't have to load up random worlds in creative
 and then copy the seed to your survival game--you could do it the other way around as well and take your current seed and simply create a new game in creative using that same seed. &nbsp;That way, you have two games with the same seed, one in survival and one in
 creative.</p>

<p><span><strong>QUESTION 1) The question I have is if it was created in survival, edited in creation and saved, does it shut down achievements for others joining it either via split screen or network?</strong></span>&nbsp; I have
 400/400 so I don't care for me, but for others I care.</p>
<p><br />
I have not used the host options at all yet.&nbsp;<span><strong> QUESTION 2) Do they also affect the world in the same way as creation?&nbsp; IE, not affecting it unless saved?</strong></span></p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note, basing my answer off your <em>actual</em> question, the answers are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 1 Answer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>YES</strong>. I have a world I created since day one of the Minecraft release on Xbox. It was created in Survival mode. When the new update hit, I experimented by launching this world (after other experiments on other seeds left me confident I would
 get the results I expected) in creative mode. Immediately I was notified that simply just launching/loading this seed in creative mode would disable achievements for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I exited the game, but DID NOT SAVE, and then re-loaded the seed but this time in Survival mode. EVERYTHING returned back to normal. I did not have all of the achievements at this time (still need two) and I was able to still earn my achievements. This is
 because I didn't save in creative mode. Had I altered that seed, and then saved, the game would have to disable the achievements permenantly to prevent any manner of cheating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my testing process, friends also joined that seed, and their achievements were ALSO disabled. They also noted that they did NOT receive notifications that they were entering a "creative" world at the time. They could not earn achievements or leaderboard
 stats during their stay. Once I returned to my normal save, they were once again able to earn achievements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was done to avoid people creating worlds tailored to their friends achievement needs, and then allowing them in to earn them regardless of their kind intentions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 2 Answer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>YES. </strong>Hosting options will infact alter any ability to earn achievements and leaderboard stats as well. I also tested this by loading up the same pre-update seed saved in Survival. The moment I selected the hosting options (for flying, exhaustion,
 etc.) I was notified that all stats and achievements would be disabled. Again this is to prevent you from gaining achievements. I.E. You stumble into a cave looking for metal ore to earn the MOAR TOOLS achievement but the only metal ore you see is on the other
 side of a huge drop surrounded by lava. You activate your hosting ability, fly over, gather the ore, then fly back and make the tool. That would be cheating as you did not actually work your way over there legitimately. So for that reason the host options
 also disable the cheevo's and stats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: NONE of that matters however if you do not save the seed. Once you return to your normal save, even after using hosting options, the world returns to normal as it was and able to update stats, and achievements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully I answered your actual question, my apologies if your question has managed to evolve from your initial post throughout the life of this thread and during the time I took to answer it.</p>
