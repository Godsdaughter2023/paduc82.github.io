<br />
If you receive Windows Update error 80070020, the cause might be a that program running on your computer is interfering with Windows Update. This is often a simple timing problem, and it can be solved by restarting your computer and running Windows Update again.

<h2>            WindowsUpdate_8020002E error on Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running into problems with Windows Update on my machine - a 64-bit Windows 8 Desktop. I'm unable to install any of the following updates as they all return with the same 802002E error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KB2761465</p>
<p>KB2769166</p>
<p>KB2756872</p>
<p>KB2770917</p>
<p>KB2779768</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some searching and found this seems to be a pretty common problem. I've already tried both troubleshooting and the clean boot method. Troubleshooting always finds and "fixes" a problem regarding the Windows Update Components, but it says this every
 time I run it and does not change the error so it doesn't seem to actually be fixing anything. The clean boot method also does not alter anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manual installation of these updates does seem to work (I was having the same problem with KB2769165 but tried a manual installation and it works). However, it seems like this is going to be a problem with every single update to come down the pipeline, so
 it is not really a practical solution, especially as I start to install other Microsoft products such as Visual Studio and the number of important updates grows dramatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what the actual root cause of this problem is? Or better yet... is there a solution for this beyond manual installation of each update? My research turned up that a lot of people were having this problem because of proxy-related
 issues with Windows 8. Unfortunately, I'm not connected to the internet via a proxy so it does not seem like this is the case for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help on this is greatly appreciated. I've been trying to get my machine working with Windows 8 for almost a week now and am HOPING I will have a stable installation once I get this sorted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Comment on repeated loss of drive letter assignment upon reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geslinkdk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Comment on repeated loss of drive letter assignment upon reboot</h2>
                    <div>On all my 7 Windows 10 installations, of which 2 in the fast ring, and on 3 Pc's, the drive letter of my external Seagate backup HDD was suddenly both not default any longer - also after setting it again - and left (on Save removal, Pc Shutdown/Start or
 Sign Out/In)&nbsp; "ghost"-icons named Local disk of 0 byte with the latest assigned drive letter in the This Pc window; those icons could be removed by a Pc restart only (not by Pc Shutdown/Start or Sign Out/In).</div>
<div>Found, in this forum, by an answer og Gavin Adams, that it could be caused by a set volume attribute Hidden (which was the case, but no idea how that happened).<br />
Could, in my case NOT be removed by DiskPart command Attributes Volume Clear Hidden, which resulted in an error message.</div>
<div>Got only rid of it (by the DiskPart command Attributes Volume Clear Hidden) under Windows 7 on an old, not any longer updated/used, Pc.<br />
After that, under Windows 10 again, none of the volume attributes could be SET either.<br />
NOTE: Replacing the external disks Win10 drivers by the Win7 ones didn't help and assume now that it is a bug in the interaction of DiskPart with Windows 10.<br />
I report this by feedback too.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>I run the following:</div>
<div>RUN Discpart<br />
Typed next commands for the external HDD</div>
<div>LIST VOLUME<br />
SELECT VOLUME=n<br />
ASSIGN LETTER=G<br />
ATTRIBUTES VOLUME CLEAR HIDDEN (was with me NOT executed on my Windows 10 PC's, which reported functional error; got it executed on my old stationary Medion under Windows 7, after that the problem was solved on all Windows 10 PC's and their multiple boot Win10
 installations)*<br />
EXIT<br />
&nbsp;<br />
*) on command DETAIL Volume next was shown now on the selected volume:<br />
DISKPART&gt; detail volume</div>
<div>Disk ###&nbsp; Status</div>
<div>Read-only&nbsp;&nbsp;: No<br />
Hidden &nbsp;&nbsp;: No<br />
No Default Drive Letter&nbsp;: No<br />
Shadow Copy&nbsp;&nbsp;: No<br />
Offline&nbsp;&nbsp;: No<br />
BitLocker Encrypted&nbsp;: No<br />
Installable&nbsp;&nbsp;: Yes<br />
---------------------------<br />
OTHER additional solution of creating a file.bat (as published under the same forum section, could not work due to the created "ghost"-Local disk icons with the latest assigned drive letters and which only disappeared on restarting the Pc - not on shutdown/start
 or log off/on)<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>The problem above can have been there in all my preceding Windows 10 versions, because I never used Diskpart before or knew about a disk volume attributes, since I used the Windows function Disk manager to set/change drive letters.<br />
Did some members meet such too?</div>

<h3> ykle333  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows media player is playing avi file half screen and the rest of the square is green&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I converted a home video file to avi so that I can edit it on windows movie maker. Unfortunately my vista&nbsp; is basic so it does not have windows dvd maker. Because of this I am forced to save the movie on my computer and then burn it on a dvd through windows
 media player. When I play the movie on movie maker it seems fine but when I play it on media player my video files are extremely narrow and the bottom half of the screen is green. I burned this on a dvd and it plays the same defective way. Can someone please
 help me. I converted my video using dvd shrink and auto gk. I even tried using **** to see if I needed to download a codec but it says that it is already installed. What can I do to fix this.</p>
<p>P.S. It's not the entire video just the portion with the converted avi files so the solution may not include a conversion of the entire movie because there are videos that did not need any converting that play just fine.</p>
<p>I appreciate ANY input as soon as possible. Thanks!</p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 the same movie plays fine on any other video player?</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Media Player does not support burning movies to video DVD discs. It does support burning data DVD discs, which could contain music and video
 files. However, data DVDs are typically not compatible with most home DVD players. Check your DVD player documentation for details.</span></p>
<p><span>Have a look at the following article link:</span></p>

                    <p>Hey everyone,</p><p><br /></p><p>So I&nbsp;have a Acer CB281HK&nbsp;monitor 4k 10 bit color w/ freesync and new xbox one X. I&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;freesync is most likely unusable with this combination (unless I read wrong elsewhere). However, I&nbsp;can only connect through HDMI&nbsp;because the Displayport receives no signal from the Xbox -&gt; HDMI&nbsp;-&gt; DisplayPort/HDMI adapter -&gt; Displayport on monitor. The HDMI&nbsp;port on the monitor is 4k however it lacks the 10 bit color + Freesync features only available through Displayport not HDMI.</p><p><br /></p><p>When I&nbsp;run the video settings on Xbox one X it says 4k but lacking freesync, 10 bit color, hdr (not on monitor) for gaming (I&nbsp;honestly could care less about 4k apps just gaming).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I've seen many adapters and off and on reviews and I will do what I&nbsp;need to get this 10 bit color and hopefully freesync working. I&nbsp;really don't want to wait for 4k HDMI 10 bit HDR&nbsp;monitors

                    <p>Hi I have a major problem. The&nbsp;Windows 10 Fall Creators update is stopping me using Autocad 2017 which I use everyday for my work. I rolled the update back to windows 10 and Autocad 2017 works with no problem. Windows is now saying when I log out to install
 update this is a serious problem for me. I looked on the web and Autocad say it is a&nbsp;Windows 10 Fall Creators problem. Are microsoft able to provide a solution?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that your program is not fully compatible with the latest Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. You have two options to resolve this issue. Since your program is working with the previous Windows 10 version, for now, you may keep it that
 way and wait for the next update, or you may try checking the developer's website for the latest version of your program.</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Try to log to the Wireless Router and switch On the Wireless broadcasting (see the Router's manau for how-to), then configure the security.<br />

<h2>            Xbox one Controller disconnecting or freezes up</h2>
                    

<p>My xbox one controllers are freezing up on while i have them plugged in via cable, if i try wireless the controllers don't connect or if they do only last for a few seconds.</p>
<p>I've had the problem with the wireless for a while now but i always use the controllers via cable which was fine.</p>
<p>i installed the latest patch to day it came out and that's when i have had problems with the controllers via cable, i'm not sure if the problem is with the usb ports as sometime now i don't seem to get a connection at all via cable and it does not matter
 which usb port i use they have all the same effect.</p>
<p>i have several controllers and they all do the same thing, i plug them into the my pc and they seem to work fine.</p>
<p>Has any one else had this problem.</p>

<p>All the time with the wireless disconnects... all the time since I started using it again. I've literally turned off every single wireless device within 20 feet of the xbox INCLUDING my wireless router but the disconnects still persist (I'm sitting like
 10 feet away from the console). Fresh batteries, re-paired controller, updated controller, even factory reset the console didn't help.
</p>
<p>Maybe it's just angry with me since I basically ignored it for a year after getting the day one edition :D. I don't recall having this issue back when I first got it and played thru Ryse and Forza... I do have the extended warranty though... Is this something
 that can be fixed with a repair?</p>

<p>I'm having a similar issue. I use the plug and play to connect my wireless controller to my XBONE, and it has been fine for a while, but a couple weeks ago it started to disconnect randomly whenever I moved it. This was really annoying especially when I
 was playing destiny with a group of friends; my headset would randomly shut off and I'd miss what everyone is saying, and sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes for my headset to come back on with with my controller.</p>
<p>I'm really worried now, because I bought a new controller a few days back (and ***, those things are expensive) only to get back and find out the same thing was happening... Then after ONE try, the new controller wouldn't even turn on. A complete waste of
 £45. </p>
<p>I really need to get this fixed before the new destiny DLC drops on Tuesday, because communication is key when it comes to that game.. And I really hate playing alone :(</p>

<p>I've had issues with controller disconnects and have had 2 different consoles and controllers with the same issue. If you have the issue it will probably persist no matter what you do. I will never buy another Xbox and would not recommend anyone to do so
 as it is a flawed system in many ways. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Stupid snap function, horrible running your cable thru it via HDMI because it intermittently loses reception, digital download problems,etc....<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> Microsoft!!!</p>

<p>Yea, this thing is starting to get on my nerves... first and last time I ever buy a day-one console of any sort.</p>
<p>My question is has anyone gone thru support and gotten a repair done and does that help at all or is this a software glitch? I have another year I think of warranty left (although myservice.xbox.com is like permanently glitched on manage my devices page)...</p>

    <title>Deleted Documents folder in error and start menu link won&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yzf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted Documents folder in error and start menu link won&#39;t work to new one</h2>
                    
<p>In the folder tree pane (Vista Home Premium) it appeared that I had inadvertently duplicate copied my entire Documents folder into the Downloads foledr, so it looked like I had two copies of everything: waste of disk space. So I deleted the Documents subfolder
 in the Downloads folder ... and the main Documents folder disappeared too! It was all the same thing. I don't understand why. But anyway. It wasn't in the Recycle bin because there had been too much to go in there, so it's all been permanently deleted and
 lost: over 8GB :-(</p>
<p>As a result, the Documents link in the Start bar stopped working. Even after I created a new Documents folder in the same location as the original, the Start menu link won't work; when I click on Properties for the link, the path is blank, and I can't find
 a way of saving a path to it. Any ideas?</p>

<p>The Document folder is a special folder that needs to be created in a special way.&nbsp; Here's the procedure to fix a folder that wasn't created correctly:

<p>Between these articles I think you should be able to resolve your problem one way or the other.</p>
<p>=================================================================================================================</p>
<p>In case you're still interested in trying to recover the originally lost Documents folder, here are some options you can try:</p>
<div>
<p><span>If you have Vista Business, Vista Ultimate, or Vista Enterprise you may be in luck.&nbsp; They have what is known as Shadow
 Copies which are saves of deleted or modified files which can be retrieved in case the changes/deletions were done in error.&nbsp;
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx</span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 further information on how to use this feature at: </span><a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If you have Vista Basic or Vista Premium, Shadow Copies is not available; however, there's an alternative that's free and mirrors the functionality of Shadow Copies called Shadow Explorer.
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Though it won't help you this time, it could very well save you in case this happens again.<br />
<br />
In case this doesn't work (not all files are available through Shadow Copies - it occurs periodically), here are some additional free recovery programs which might help:<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/system/fwdatarecovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/system/fwdatarecovery.html</span></a>&nbsp;(try Recuva first)</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/diskdigger.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/diskdigger.html</span></a>&nbsp;(try
 this second - if it too doesn't work, then chances of recovery are very slim but you're welcome to try the other programs if you want)<span><br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span>Files aren't actually deleted until they are overwritten (though they're no longer available through conventional methods).&nbsp;
 If you decide to try these recovery programs, you should stop using your hard drive
<strong>immediately</strong> so you don't overwrite the data you are trying to recover.&nbsp; Slave it to another PC and run the recovery from that PC.&nbsp; Even now you may have permanently lost some of them if you're using that same PC.&nbsp; If you can't do that (slave
 to another PC), you run the risk of overwriting the data with every action you do on the PC (but you still may be able to recover some or most or even all of the files - it's a matter of luck).<br />
<br />
Only you can decide if the data is important enough to take the PC to a data recovery expert to recover the files (they will have better programs and equipment to do so than any of us do and than I provided above).&nbsp; Do NOT go to Geek Squad or any of those big
 store centers - they mostly don't know what they're doing - take it to a data recovery expert.&nbsp; It will cost quite a bit and they usually offer no guarantees.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck and I hope this helps!</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Jackpot Losing Coins in the Cloud</h2>
                    <p>After reading other posts, I encountered the same problem a few days ago and lost all my coins earned in the Microsoft Jackpot game.&nbsp; I contacted Xbox and was finally informed (after several instructed attempts to retrieve coins) that, due to signing into
 Jackpot a corrupt file appeared and removed the coins.&nbsp; Per Xbox, they cannot be retrieved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the game automatically signs in when clicked, how can the coins then disappear?&nbsp; It appears it is a Microsoft issue, not Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will you please provide instruction on how to retrieve lost coins from the Microsoft Jackpot game?</p>

            In my view, you should talk to Microsoft Support for this issue. It is unlikely that you would get solution to this problem on the forum.
<br />
<br />1. You can talk to support by picking up appropriate country

            The black part of the screen means that the game is running at a different resolution than your desktop. You can either set it to your game matches your desktop resolution or you can try and find the option to "disable aspect ratio" in your settings. If
 you do this however, your graphics will look funny and stretched out, but that's your call to make.<br />
<br />
As for the game crashing, I really don't know anything about it so I'd go to their forum for any problems with crashing. What you can do is make sure your DirectX is up-to-date, make sure you have the newest .NET framework, and also make sure all of your drivers,
 especially for your video card, are updated.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

<h2>            Thumbnails of the folder contents don&#39;t show up for some of the folders.</h2>
                    <div>I have folders with music which I recorded from LP's and I took a picture of the album cover and placed into that folder.</div>
<div>Normally I see the thumbnail of the audio file and the picture inside the folder icon.</div>
<div>Some folder do show that way but a lot of them don't show thumbnails.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Already tried suggestions here. &nbsp;Like folder setting and clearing the thumbs database.
<div>I also tried copying contents to a new folder and same result. &nbsp;I also tried customizing the folder with the picture file I want and it does not change the appearance of the thumbnail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also have a main folder for the LP's that I converted to mp3's, the same LP in WAV is in a mp3 folder, with its same matching picture and it appears fine there. &nbsp;So the picture is not the problem or the file type.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is some setting or file in windows 7 that is corrupted maybe.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I should mention too that I converted my computer from XP to windows 7 and I don't remember if the all folders ever did show thumbnails that are now missing it, because I knew that some folders don't have pictures.</div>
<div>I do have another folder where i keep all my pictures and those folders all show thumbnails.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions? &nbsp;Should I re-install windows 7?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I will appreciate any help.</div>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your nice cooperation. In fact i have checked every point in the BSOD troubleshooting guide. And i want to let you know that all my drivers are automatically updated via Windows Update, also, i have toggled the fast boot mode between ON and
 OFF. Beside that, i don't have any attached hardware to my computer in the most of time. The device performance and health status is OK, plus, i keep the Windows OS always up to date by installing the latest updates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you can tell me which specific driver cause the BSOD by analyzing the mini dump file i have uploaded, it will be very kind from your part. Thank you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

            We appreciate your response. The system DMP generated a report seems to be pointing to a hardware either not being able to run properly or the system does not know how to run it the way it's supposed to. Cross-checking with your Original Equipment Manufacturer
 (OEM) drivers may serve useful to ensure that what you have in the system is updated. With regard to this matter, we recommend manually checking the drivers from the device manufacturer and installing them manually.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Resetting your computer is like reinstalling a fresh copy of Windows. If it did not work after a factory reset, then there is a possibility that the problem is with the hardware itself. For better assistance, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer of
 your computer.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            Unable to include Winmaps.adml</h2>
                    <p>Original title: WinMaps.adml en-GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else found that the WinMaps.adml in C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-GB\ is missing the localised string for the&nbsp;"turn off unsolicited network traffic on the Offline Maps settings page" value (string id "DisallowUntriggeredNetworkOnSettingsPage_Name")?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a look at the "Windows10_Version_1511_ADMX.msi" file (from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48257</a>) but that doesn't include an en-GB translation file.&nbsp; The en-GB language pack for Windows 10 1511 (from SW_DVD5_Win_10_1511_32-BIT_X64_MultiLang_LangPackAll_LIP_OEM_VL_X20-75632.ISO) includes
 WinMaps.adml, but it's missing the string id.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if I've got some patches installed in the wrong order, or if there actually is an oversight somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I'm adding a command into our build stream to simply delete the en-GB ADML so GPEdit.msc falls back to the en-US file (which does contain the string id) - obviously this is something I'd rather not have to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any comments and suggestions welcomed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this inquiry to our attention here on the forums. I understand you purchased an Xbox Live Gold 3 month subscription prepaid card is that correct? The promotion that gives you 1000 v-bucks for the purchase of Xbox Live Gold was a specific
 online purchase that had to be made from the console to get the v-bucks code. Hope this helps.</p>

            If the vbucks were part of a promotion with the prepaid code you purchased, there would either have been an additional code with the card or you would need to contact the retailer you purchased it from to get a code from them. Otherwise, the promotion
 through Xbox requires that the subscription be purchased with a credit card, so prepaid cards would not be eligible.

Code 39 means the driver is corrupt or missing.<br />

Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total process which solves

the issue.<br />

Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also check with your System Maker to see if there are updated drivers for your DVD. Or even if there<br />
are old ones you can reinstall. Many use the Windows Default drivers however a few will have special<br />
ones. Also check the drive maker's site.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
