<h2>            Is it possible to adjust the volume of a specific system&#47;program sound in Win7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to adjust the sound of the Facebook "ding" used when someone messages you...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm watching videos or something online, many times the volume was recorded/encoded kind of low which requires me to turn up the volume on my system, but then when I get a message, the "ding" is crazy loud, I don't want it off, just lowered some...(and
 yes, I crank up the volume of the individual video player to no avail)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible either natively, or with an app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all!</p>

            If you go to the&nbsp;<em>Notification area</em> (nee <em>System tray</em>) and click the loudspeaker icon<em> (</em>aka
<em>Volume</em>), you should find a hotspot to click for&nbsp;<em>Mixes</em>. In the mixer you should be able to set a separate volume for
<em>System Sounds</em> as well as the WMC or Media Player.

            <p>No, you can't. Volume level is a global setting unless a program or website has the option to mute at a local level.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example.. YouTube allows for muting a video, and if you start another video, you will hear the second one but not the first, unless you mute both of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Facebook picks up off system sounds. If you mute or turn down the Facebook 'ding', all dings will be affected..&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            You could open the sound file in Sound Recorder and reduce its volume there. That'll change that particular sound file so it's quieter, and leave the rest at their original volume.<br />

            <p>My take was that the OP wanted system sounds reduced while watching videos with low sound levels that required raising the overall volume output. Maybe reducing the system sounds will work for Ruester's purposes, maybe not.</p>

            <p>The Facebook ding volume is controlled by the Windows volume setting, but I have been made aware that there is a setting on your Facebook homepage which can silence the ding.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look for the small cog icon (the same&nbsp;as the IE cog) and locate the setting which works as&nbsp;an 'on/off' switch for Facebook sounds only..

            <p>It looks like there really is no way... I kinda thought maybe someone created an app or a hack for it, or something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Hall: I don't want it completely off, it just startles me when I'm watching a video (through Hulu, so turning down even just the volume for Chrome won't suffice) and because many videos are so quiet, that Ding wakes up my roommates too! lol But I don't
 want to miss certain messages, so muting isn't totally an option, but I may have to do that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I could reduce system sounds...<br />

Thanks everyone for your input...</p>

Well, Windows has had some variant of this capability for as long as I <br />
can remember. Right-click on the Task bar and select "Show windows <br />
stacked" or "Show windows side by side." (Windows 7's *new* "Snap" <br />
feature is just a new way of doing something that has been possible for <br />
years.)<br />

    <title>Hardware-Managed Bluetooth mode in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abergmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hardware-Managed Bluetooth mode in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have the problem, that&nbsp;my Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Keyboard falls into sleep mode after 2 or 3 minutes (not 8-10 as described in some posts) of inactivity.</p>
<p>It takes about 4 Seconds to wake up again after the next keystroke, so the first letters will not appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem has been described in:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/support/troubleshooting/mouse/bluetooth-delayed-response</p>
<p>
</p><p>The proposed solution is to switch the&nbsp;Bluetooth settings to use Hardware-Managed Bluetooth mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But how do I activate the "Hardware-Managed Bluetooth mode"?</p>

<p>Hey adacosta!&nbsp; Please read your replies!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no wireless tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to enable hardware managed bluetooth mode for my MS Sculpt mouse, for the same reason as OP.&nbsp; Again,</p>
<p>there is NO WIRELESS TAB in the control panel --&gt; mouse dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... how does one enable HMBluetooth without this wireless tab to click on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Restore Windows Media Center to &#42;absolute&#42; default settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>~~This thread has been posted on the behalf of another user~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Windows Media Center(Win7/x64) is freezing up every 10-15 seconds or so when I play music through it, not accepting any input from mouse or my remote control for that time. I only have the Digital Cable Advisor installed aside WMC.
</p>
<p>No third party apps have been installed since I started using WMC.<br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way to restore Windows Media Center to *absolute* default settings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

            OK, I wasn't sure it'd let me log in so I asked the super helpful twitter folks to post for me
<div><br />
<div>Did method 1 (as suggested by twitter team)</div>
<div>No effect. Music still causes system input lag and temporary lock-up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Did Method 2 :</div>
<div><br />
<div>No effect. It behaved as if I had done nothing at all to it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Did Method 3 :</div>
<div><br />
<div>No effect. It complained that it had recovered from a serious error, and took me through the first-time startup wizard.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Knowing that Windows Media Player and the Center are linked, I went ahead and reset the settings for WMP as well - which caused it to reset some settings and drop me back at the first-time startup wizard in Windows Media Center.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Either way, there is still lag present when playing music.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a lot of files in my music collection - I have some 1300 MP3s and a handful of OGG files.</div>
<div>Some of the MP3 files have embedded album art (it shows up in Windows Explorer when I look in my music folder) and I am wondering if that is the cause...</div>

<h2>            Is it possible 100hz comes to XboxOne, and or fix 1440p VRR</h2>
                    <p>I see a few issues that have arisen from offering VRR ala FreeSync2 @1440p - where as the display is not recognized via autodetect.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> When selecting Video Output, and Auto Detect - only 1080p and 720p is seen as an option, and VRR is able to be checked. To use 1440p the user has to select manual, and choose connection type (HDMI). 1440p then becomes available
 - but only with no VRR, and 60 or 120hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Solution:&nbsp;</strong>Add a few more*refresh rates, 60hz <strong>75hz, 100hz</strong>, 120hz,
<strong>144hz</strong> etc, and or fix in firmware to ignore some non standard aspect ration resolutions and let the users monitor dictate the scaling.</p>

            Actually Xbox one X has 120Hz support for games and apps in 1080p. Other formats may be related to performance/HW limitations.<br />

            Hi Hesed3, icrosoft removed the option to adjust the font sizes in the Creators Update 
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />For example, to adjust the font and font size in File Explorer: 
<br />Open Winaero Tweaker 
<br />On the left click Icons in the Advanced Appearance Settings Section 
<br />Then click 'Change Font' 
<br />Set your Font Size . . . etc. 
<br />Click Apply Changes 
<br />
<br />Then either log out or restart your PC for the change(s) to take effect 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to get WInaero Tweaker:

            We used to be able to do that. But MS 'improved' that feature out of Win 10.  What you need to change is the "System" font. 
<br />
<br />There are 3 options:
<br />.  *   You can use the SCALE option to make everything look bigger on screen, 
<br />.  *  you can do manual "Registry Hacks"
<br />.  *  you can use a 3rd party applet to make doing the reg hacks easier.

<p>"Clear cache" or "delete cache" or "clean cache" generally means to delete the files that your web browser has saved that make it work a bit faster to display pages when you re-visit a particular web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specific instructions vary depending on the web browser you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Internet Explorer version 11 (the current default web browser for Windows 7):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>With Internet Explorer open, click the "gear" icon at the top right of the window (or press ALT+X) and then click "Internet Options"</li><li>Near the bottom of the "General" tab, in the "Browsing history" section, click the "Delete" button</li><li>Make the selections you want; you'll probably want to check the top option ("Preserve favorites website data") and UNcheck the "Passwords" option (otherwise, your saved passwords will be deleted).&nbsp; To clear the "cache," check the box next to "Temporary
 Internet files and website files"</li><li>Click the "Delete" button</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Firefox:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the Firefox menu icon (the 3 horizontal bars at the top right) and then click "Options"</li><li>Click "Advanced" in left menu</li><li>Click the "Clear now" button to the right of "Cached web content"</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Google Chrome:</p>
<p>

                    <p>I accidenatly hit some hot key I did not mean to and now my desktop has a scroll bar on the side that I can't get rid of. I'm also using Classic Shell so it looks like windows 7. Not sure if that's relevant. Sorry I can't be more detailed I really don't

            <p>I am running Windows 8. &nbsp;I was trying to press ctrl+alt+delete to pull up task manage, and I pressed something else instead. &nbsp;The result being my icons got reorganized into a list with very small text(guessing size 8) and a scrollbar was added on the right
 side of the desktop so that I could scroll up and down to see the whole list. &nbsp;I was able to change from a list back to icons by just right clicking on desktop selecting view&gt;medium icons(just what I prefer, could have used small or large). &nbsp;Anyway, I can't
 get the scroll bar to go away. &nbsp;It's aesthetically displeasing and it interferes with the "quickbar" that pops up from the right side that is supposed to pseudo-replace a start button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already gone through some options in the control panel and haven't found anything that seemed relevant so I'm open to suggestions.</p>

            ctrl+shift+numbers from 1 to 9 I think and you can change the size of icons or style.

    <title>Touchpad problems with Windows 10 Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harshatech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchpad problems with Windows 10 Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>My Trackpad isn't working properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes after booting up, I can only use the cursor to select desktop icons. The taskbar becomes insensitive to the cursor. I am not able to click on start button or tray icons or even right-click on task bar. But after sometime (4-5 min) the cursor works
 just fine. </li><li>Another problem is that, switching between multiple windows/tasks quickly causes the cursor and the computer to slow down. The cursor becomes so slow, that it lags behind my finger movements. It lags behind like 2-3 secs. Not just the cursor, entire systems'
 GUI slows down. Restarting the system is the only option left.</li></ul>
<p>I went into the device manager, right clicked on "Mice and other pointing devices" and hit update driver. I choose to look for driver online. But out of nowhere windows installed some driver by ELAN. Dell's website doesn't suggest any drivers for specifically
 for the trackpad.</p>
<p>In short my system is all messed up...!!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not because of lack of system resources. I have an intel core i7-6th gen CPU with 16 GB of RAM, and NVidia GTX 960m.</p>

</p><p><strong>PS:</strong>&nbsp;When I first encountered this problem (after installing creators update), I went into the device manager, right-click on "mice and other pointing devices" and hit update driver. Then I choose for windows to find the relevant driver online.
 Then windows installed an ELAN Driver. This is the only new third-party installation, after the update.</p>

<p>Tried both possible solutions but didn't work.&nbsp; I forgot to put in the previous message was that the touchpad with worked correctly prior to logging into Windows.&nbsp; Meaning, tapping worked, clicking worked everything worked correctly.&nbsp; Then upon logging into
 Windows and the Elan drivers loaded, the only item that worked correctly was the moving the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse still moves but nothing more once logged into Windows.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The status on the new Skype for Mac are

<h2>            Disk listed as RAW</h2>
                    <p>After windows 10 pro update, my boot drive disappeared. I started with installation disc and went into recovery command prompt. With “Diskpart” I viewed the disks on my pc and my boot disk was listed as RAW, after exiting diskpart, I
 run chkdsk /f on that drive and it was readable again, however, after restart the drive went back to RAW.<span>&nbsp;

            Hi, RudiHenning
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />So I recommend borrowing a computer to create a USB to repair Windows.
<br />Downloading the ISO already comes with the Windows 1809 updates
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windows-10-usb-bootable-media-uefi-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will start with USB and you will follow the steps of this link to repair Windows without losing your files.

<p><b><span>To reinstall Windows</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you want to reinstall Windows with a clean installation—possibly to restore the default Windows settings—here's how to do it. (If you're having a problem with Windows,
 first see What to do if Windows won't start correctly, which explains how to use the Windows installation disc to fix problems without completely reinstalling Windows.)</span></p>
<p><b><span>Warning</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Back up your files before you begin reinstalling Windows, even if you're reinstalling Windows on a hard disk partition. A clean installation replaces the current
 version of Windows and also erases all personal files.</span></li></ul>
<ol>
<li><span>Turn on your computer, insert the Windows&nbsp;Vista DVD or CD, and then restart your computer. If you are asked to press a key to start (or "boot") from DVD or CD, press
 any key. When the Install Windows page appears, go to step 2.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the Install Windows page does not appear and you're not asked to press a key to start from a CD or DVD, you might have to specify that your computer use its
 DVD or CD drive as the startup device. This means that you need to set the DVD or CD drive to the first startup device in the basic input/output system (BIOS). To learn how to do this, see
Start Windows from a CD or DVD. After you have selected your DVD or CD drive as the startup device, restart your computer, and then start Windows from the installation DVD or CD as previously described.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the Install Windows page, follow any instructions that might appear, and then click Install now.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Get important updates for installation page, we recommend getting the latest updates to help ensure a successful installation and help protect your computer
 against security threats. You will need an Internet connection to get installation updates.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Type your product key for activation page, we strongly recommend that you type your 25-character product key to help avoid problems during activation.
</span></li><li><span>On the Please read the license terms page, if you accept the license terms, click I accept the license terms.</span>
</li><li><span>Follow the instructions on each page. On the Which type of installation do you want? page, click Custom.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Where do you want to install Windows? page, click Drive options (advanced). Select the partition where you want to install Windows, and then click Format.
 This erases all files on the selected partition, so you can install Windows on a clean partition.</span>
</li><li><span>When the format is complete, select the partition you just formatted as the place where you want to install Windows, and then click Next to begin the installation.
 You might see a compatibility report.</span> </li><li><span>Follow the instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b></p>

    <title>Barewire Ltd - Scam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> butuan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Barewire Ltd - Scam</h2>
                    
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span style="font-weight: bold">Barewire Ltd company presents itself as a legitimate independent online technical service support for repairing and protecting your computers from malware and viruses infections.&nbsp; In reality it is a big
 time and sophisticated scam!&nbsp; People need to be aware, avoid and report this company to authorities once it tries to contact you.&nbsp; I was a victim and I will share to you my own experience.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Their operation works in 3 phases as I had experienced the scam.&nbsp; Note that other past victims may have somewhat different experience on how Barewire Ltd got to them but the scam is the same... to steal your money!</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Phase 1: &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>I typed in Google Search on Windows address field to get to the google search engine.&nbsp; A list of google related links came up.&nbsp; Unknowingly, I clicked what I thought was the google search website was actually a fake link.&nbsp; Suddenly
 a screen popped-up with a warning.&nbsp; At this time my windows was already frozen and locked up.&nbsp; See also screen shot.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>&nbsp;[- Microsoft System Security Alert.&nbsp; Oops something went wrong with your computer.&nbsp; The Website you have recently visited may have downloaded the Malware and virus on your Window System.&nbsp; Microsoft is suspicious about your Windows
 Security System. Your TCP connection was blocked by your Windows Security System.&nbsp; Your Windows and Chrome has been locked until we may hear from you to immediately fix this issue.&nbsp; Please contact Microsoft Windows Help Desk.&nbsp; Customer Support:&nbsp; +1-844-232-4818
 (Toll-Free)]</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>When I called the tel# listed on the screen, a man with an Asian Indian voice answered.&nbsp; He claimed to be an employee of Microsoft and is a member of the Windows Help Desk. &nbsp; He said a lot of things to help convince me that he
 is legit.&nbsp; Then he requested access to my computer by telling me how to temporarily unlock my screen and then loaded the TeamViewer application to gain my permission and access to my PC.&nbsp; As I watched the screen, he performed some quick diagnostics to show
 a screen report of how much malware and viruses have infected my computer.&nbsp; "Threats Detected:&nbsp; 1844."</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>He said this is serious infection.&nbsp; He offered solutions based on three levels of service support.&nbsp; See screen shot.&nbsp; Obviously, he wants me to pick the most expensive option but I selected only the 1-yr plan for $349.99.&nbsp; Would
 have been $449.99 but he gave me a senior discount of $99.99.&nbsp; What a nice guy! :) &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Once I confirmed my choice, he said that Microsoft works with a trusted 3rd party company that actually performs the services for malware and viruses cleanup, protection and maintenance of my computer.&nbsp; The company is Barewire
 Ltd. [website: https://www.barewire.us]</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Phase 2:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>He asked me to stay on the line while he forwarded me to another tel#, which is supposedly the Barewire Ltd accounting dept.&nbsp; I gave my credit card account#.&nbsp; Once paid, I got forwarded to another Tel#.&nbsp; Here another guy with
 an Asian Indian accent again took control of my computer and did a lot of manipulations on my windows program. &nbsp; Once he said cleanup was completed, he asked me to type in several of my websites that I frequently visit to make sure all is fine.&nbsp; Did some internet
 connection speed test as well and all seemed back to normal.&nbsp; I was pleased and thankful for his work that now I can go back to work.&nbsp; He said that I can call Barewire toll-free 24/7 whenever I have problems that need their support.&nbsp; I then received emails
 from Barewire confirming the Service Agreement, Invoice, etc.&nbsp; All appeared very legitimate operation.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Phase 3:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Three weeks into this service agreement, my computer seems to work normally but then I did get a call from my internet service provider's internet security dept, telling me that my IP address was used to hack other IP addresses.&nbsp;
 I was advised to update my WIFI passwords and regularly run anti-virus scan.&nbsp; Here I remembered that Barewire tech removed my McAffee antivirus sw because he said Barewire does better in protecting my pc. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Almost a month into this Agreement, I received a call from a guy who introduced&nbsp; himself as an employee of Microsoft and he asked if the support I got from Barewire has been satisfactory.&nbsp; I said yes.&nbsp; Actually he sounded like
 that same guy that I talked to the very first time but he gave me a different employee name that I can recall.&nbsp; He then said that Microsoft is offering an additional refund of $149.99 for senior citizens as part of its service program.&nbsp; So the service will
 only cost me only $200.&nbsp; I said great.&nbsp; In order for me to receive the refund, he wants me to allow him again access to my computer by opening the TeamViewer program.&nbsp; Once he had access, he said that my refund can only be done directly bank to bank.&nbsp; So he
 wants me to log in to my bank account thru the website.&nbsp; This started to raise red flags and sirens in my brain. &nbsp; I told him I am not comfortable doing this but he said not to worry because Microsoft does this all the time and works with banks globally.&nbsp;
 Hesitantly, I did log in to my acct. &nbsp; He then took over the mouse and clicked the 'transfer tab' to see what bank options are there.&nbsp; While doing this, he asks me if I see a blank screen.&nbsp; I said no and that I can see the bank site.&nbsp; He then clicked to open
 another tab on the website.&nbsp; This is apparently to hide the view of the main bank screen.&nbsp; But then I used my mouse to click back to the bank site.&nbsp; Here he asked me with an annoying voice of what am I doing?&nbsp; I told him that I am not comfortable with what
 he is doing and that he should just mail me the refund.&nbsp; He tried hard to convince not to worry but this time my concerns were on heightened alert that this process is not right.&nbsp; So I closed down the window and turned off the TeamViewer.&nbsp; At this point his
 true intentions were unmasked and that he warned me that if I don't login again that I will lose all my money in that bank account!&nbsp; I told him that he is nothing but a scam artist and hang up the phone. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Immediately I changed all my bank passwords using my smartphone.&nbsp; I disconnected my laptop and brought it to the nearest local computer services store to have them check for malware and viruses.&nbsp; They called me back the next day
 and confirmed it was infected with malware and needs cleanup.&nbsp; Therefore, I actually paid Barewire $349.99 for adding more malware into my computer.&nbsp; And still not satisfied, wants to pullout all my money from my bank account!</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>I also called my Chase credit card company's fraud department to report the scam.&nbsp; I told then the story and that I want my money back.&nbsp; The Chase specialist called Barewire to reverse the payment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Although nothing was stolen from bank, the stressful experience with what would have been a major financial disaster for me to lose all my money in my bank account if I did not act quickly enough.&nbsp; I decided to share my experience
 on the website as well as report this incident to the federal authorities... FTC.&nbsp; Hopefully this will get this scam company investigated and closed permanently.</span></p>

    <title>Skype fails to connect to the internet from my Android tablets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john229-b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype fails to connect to the internet from my Android tablets</h2>
                    <p>To those people who wrote to me concerning this problem with Skype:</p>
<p>With the change in MS community, I now have '-b' appended to my name, but I have previously reported problems with connecting Skype from my tablet to the internet via my ADSL broadband service. Skype on my tablet works with my wireless broadband and broadband
 in other houses. Skype works from my desktop pc, and all other apps on my tablet connect with broadband except Skype.</p>
<p>I delayed trying to resolve this problem, as I expected it would waste much time, and I was able to use my wireless broadband on the tablet.</p>
<p>I have spent most of today on the phone, trying to resolve this, and it has been a waste of time. The broadband provider did get the tablet connected once by changing the DNS server settings, but when I returned to use the tablet after the phone call had
 ended, it would no longer work.</p>
<p>I phoned the broadband service again, but they advised I would need to talk to Skype about this.</p>
<p>I now agree with them that it is a problem with Skype, but as the Skype software has deteriorated so badly over the years, I don't hold any hope of it being fixed. My solution will be to continue using a broadband service that works on the tablet with Skype,
 but if Skype continues to deteriorate then I may drop it entirely.</p>

            If DNS changes appeared to resolve the problem (even temporarily) and it works with other providers, I suggest you write down the primary and secondary DNS server settings of the providers that work. &nbsp;You can then try to apply those DNS settings statically
 into the network configuration of your tablet devices to see if they will continue to work with all providers.

<p>Other providers are fine with those settings.</p>

            The only remaining issue would be with your provider or the equipment you are using. &nbsp;It might be your wired/wireless router having issues with uPnP, routing in general, or issues specific to wireless. &nbsp;If newer firmware exists, I suggest you apply it.
 &nbsp;You can also disable uPnP on your router to see if it makes any difference. &nbsp;Another thing you can try is a force reload of your router to factory defaults.

<p>Thanks, but the wifi box supplied by my broadband provider (Belong ADSL) has none of the options you suggest.</p>
<p>From Belong's viewpoint, every app on my tablet connects except Skype, and they think they have wasted enough time in looking at options to make Skype work, and the problem is with Skype.</p>
<p>In my view, either Belong or Skype have changed something that disabled it.</p>
<p>I am fortunate in also having a low cost mobile broadband service that does connect my tablet to Skype, so I have a work-around. But when another user asked if I had managed to solve this problem, I felt I should try to do so, as other users don't generally
 have such a work-around. But as I expected, it was a frustrating waste of most of a day on the phone to various people who supplied contradictory information.</p>
<p>I hope, at least, this may have alerted Skype and Belong to a problem that is unresolved, although it doesn't seem to affect very many people at this time.</p>

            I personally never use the routing capability of the equipment my provider supplies me as it generally is limited or buggy. &nbsp;If you are able to configure your ADSL modem/router into bridge or pass-through mode you could use any standard wireless router
 (non-ADSL) you purchase at the local store to handle your wired and wireless traffic. &nbsp;That is simply what I do to have proper functioning and reliable Internet regardless of what my provider tells me. &nbsp;I am just providing you with an option you could try.
 &nbsp;I personally stopped using ADSL after complications with the reliability and speed of the service due to misconfiguration and saturation on their end. &nbsp;They would not resolve the issue on their end, so I had to switch providers. &nbsp;My new provider had other
 issues that took 6 months to iron out. &nbsp;It was now made even more stable once I used my preferred equipment.

<p>Thanks again, your experience on this is very interesting.</p>
<p>I had another look at my Belong wifi box, and it does have connections for Lan1, Lan2, etc., so perhaps it may be possible to do something with it as you suggest. I also reset it again, and that enabled Skype to work on the tablet again, as it did once two
 days ago before it failed again.</p>
<p>So I will look into a wireless router, to see what is available and whether it may connect.</p>
<p>I think your suggestions will also be very helpful to others on the site who have experienced this problem, so thank you for that.</p>

    <title>Surface Pen Scrolls Instead of Drawing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natmca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pen Scrolls Instead of Drawing</h2>
                    I mainly use Photoshop CC 2017 for all of my graphic and illustration work, and I haven't had this problem until I just returned from my trip out of country to the Carribbean. I tried to draw in an Essentials workspace with the Brush tool and discovered
 that my Surface Pen that came with my Surface Book wouldn't draw when I zoomed in on the canvas. Instead it scrolls to the side and is super jittery when doing so. It allows me to still push buttons and select options as normal but if I want to draw I have
 to hold down the side button which gives me a hand cramp and is very inconvenient.&nbsp;

            It seems your hard drive is working properly and you're having issues with Retrospect Express software.&nbsp; If there are specific back-up points that you need to restore from, I would recommend using your other PC to get the data you need.&nbsp; If you need backup
 functionality, you could use Win 7 "Backup and Restore"&nbsp;after formating your drive in Win7.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
