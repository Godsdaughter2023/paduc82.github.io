<h2>            I can&#39;t find the new Windows Dvd Player in the app store on my PC</h2>
                    I have just installed Windows 10 and I have seen that there will be a new Windows DVD player available in the app store which can be bought. I never had media centre so I would have to buy it but I cant locate it in the app store, any ideas on where I
 can find it?

<p>This link has some information that may of may not help you.&nbsp; You may find the app just appears after you boot up.&nbsp; You could try going to "settings" and updates &amp; security to try to force</p>
<p>a download.&nbsp; I read this somewhere, I tried it and all it updated was Windows Defender.</p>

            The app is not listed in the Store. It’s only distributed through Windows Update to users who upgraded from a Media Center Edition of a previous Windows version. Keep an eye on the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-dvd-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows DVD Player product page</a> to see when it will become available in the Store.

    <title>Set Arcsoft PhotoStudio 6 as default for .jpg files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markamez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set Arcsoft PhotoStudio 6 as default for .jpg files</h2>
                    
<p>I have not been able to get Arcsoft PhotoStudio 6 to be set by Windows 7 as the default program for .jpg files. When I go to Control Panel, Default Programs, Associate a File Type or Protocol with a Program, then select .jpg and click on Change Program,
 then Browse from the Recommended and Other Programs Window, click on Drive C, Program Files (X86), Arcsoft, PhotoSudio6 folder, and then select PhotoStudio.exe and click on Open, which takes me back to the Recommended and Other Programs Window, PhotoStudio
 is NOT in the list of programs I can choose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have uninstalled and re-installed PhotoStudio6, repeated the above procedure, yet Windows 7 will NOT associate PhotoStudio 6 with .jpg files. Is this a Windows 7 bug? Or a PhotoStudio6 bug? Any assistance is appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Test and see if you can set PhotoStudio 6 as the default<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>Steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Right-click on one of the .jpg files and select "open with".</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select PhotoStudio 6.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Ensure that you put a checkmark on ""Always use the same program...."</span></p>
<p><span>See how it goes.</span></p>

    <title>Issues Changing Xbox Gamertag Email Address To Outlook.com Address - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues Changing Xbox Gamertag Email Address To Outlook.com Address Because Xbox Account Exists</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my dilemma.&nbsp; Our Xbox Live Account that was once shared by everyone in the family is now soley used by one of my sons.&nbsp; It's linked to my wife's Hotmail address currently.&nbsp; My son now has his own Microsoft Account since he has a Windows 10 computer.&nbsp;
 He's part of my Microsoft Family as well under that Outlook.com email address.&nbsp; I've tried added his Outlook email as an alias to the current Xbox account but I get an error that an account already exists.&nbsp; It looks like that at some point during the setup
 of his computer a gamertag was generated that he doesn't use.&nbsp; Is that the reason I'm getting the error?&nbsp; How do I go about making the email address change?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            You cannot add his email address as an alias as it is already connected with another MS account (his own). There is no way to move any content or saves to the new account.&nbsp;

<p>You can not add any MS server email (Outlook, MSN, Live, Hotmail) to another MS account because it is already and MS account. So your son is either going to need to create a new email address and use it on his Win 10 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that you want to keep in mind is that if you add an alias to your wives Hotmail account then remove her Hotmail account It will be GONE FOREVER and will NEVER be able to get it back.</p>

            Thanks.&nbsp; I'm new to the "your Microsoft account is also your windows login information" so need to do some more research.&nbsp; I'm trying to simplify things (although it's complicated clearly).&nbsp; He has a Microsoft Account/Email that he uses on his PC but the
 account info that he uses for Xbox is my wifes information basically.&nbsp; I'd like to make it so the information on that Xbox Account is his and my wife is completely removed from it now that I've made the account part of my Microsoft family.&nbsp; I would have him
 just use the gamertag associated with the Microsoft account that he doesn't use but his game progress and purchases are all saved under the current account hence the dilemma.&nbsp; Hope that made sense...

<p>Hey there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for clarifying that for us. From what I can gather here, your son's progress is under your wife's account but ideally, he would start playing under his own account? We currently do not have a way to transfer content between accounts, and our Outlook
 and Hotmail domains prevent changing the login emails, hence the error message. I hope this cleared up a few more things for ya.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Share Screen - Not working at all.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Skype 11.XX latest version and cannot share screens with anyone. When I click share screen there is a never ending connecting on the other end. On my side the yellow boarder shows up around my screen but nothing in the preview window or on the
 other end. Once I stop sharing the yellow boarder around my screen takes a while after Skype has closed to go away... I have an Nvidia Geforce 750ti with the latest drivers and DirectX, DirectDraw Acceleration, and Direct3D enabled. I have completely reinstalled
 Windows 10 and the issue still remains. I have also went through the DXDIAG tool without finding any problems. I've hit desperate level on this issue if someone could please help me out?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may check if the person you are sharing your screen with is using an older version or ensure that the person has the version of Skype that supports screen sharing, advise them to update the latest version
 of Skype. You may also check if you have enough bandwidth and the other person.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, you can check the video settings on your Skype application for the share screens with if it’s set to anyone.</span></p>

<p>I'm having this same issue - and oddly it is happening for my Skype account no matter whether I use my home laptop or my work desktop. The people on the call can only see a "spinning wheel" as if it's trying to connect but never does. I can see other people
 sharing but I am not able to share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a dedicated LAN connection to high speed internet at work, and broadband wifi at home. Both machines are Win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Skype 11.19.856.0</p>

<p>Hey</p>
<p>So I couldn't figure this out and have returned to the programme (v7.4) and ditched the app store version. Might not be as pretty, but it works as it should.<br />

<h2>            Having Region problems but microsoft cant help...</h2>
                    
<p>My problem is not solved unless I purchase again something I already own just in another region,
<br />
and your solution is just pay more money just buy it again...<br />
I own 2 dlc's region-ed in UK which I purchased (for Call of duty Black ops 1 which I also purchased)
<br />
the disc does not work anymore , so I download the french region version of black ops 1 from
<br />
market place as I live in France now so I pay the money for a new one, and to finish, the UK region-ed
<br />
DLC's are not compatible with the french version of the game so I of course need to purchase the
<br />
French Region-ed DLC's that I already had In UK and are installed on my Xbox again, so I can play
<br />
the maps I already have and payed for just in another language. And +, now I don't understand what
<br />
there saying in the game.</p>
<p>I am told that other region games do not work in different regions even though all my other games
<br />
purchased in the UK before coming here work fine and I purchase DLC's for them fine so why Xbox
<br />
cant swap my UK purchased DLC's for a french purchase I don't know as its all Xbox and its all Microsoft<br />
and I obviously pay for my subscription every month and I obviously payed for the Dlc's in the UK
<br />
So why do you make me buy it again? All I want is to be able to use what I have payed for without paying
<br />
for it again just because I moved country, it doesn't seem fair to make money out of people like this</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>So again My problem is not solved unless I purchase again something I already own just in another region,
<br />
so whats the point of paying Xbox every month , every year if they cant really help with the real problems....
<br />
and there solution is just pay more money just buy it again... Thank you Microsoft<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Apart from all this since I moved to France and changed my region in both account and console , half of my home-screen is in English half in French, and when I go to visit my parents in Spain and log in to my account from the console down there my home-screen
 has stuff in English, stuff in Spanish, and stuff in french, what kind of mess is this? why cant you just sort each console out in the language you want, no matter what country your in, its my console not France not yours so why cant I read it in my Language?
 Where is the customers support? can you help me?</p>

<p>This is my conversation with a Customers Support Chat person and the "Help" I've received...</p>
<p>You are now chatting with 'Eury'.</p>
<p>Eury: Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. My name is Eury. How can I help you today?</p>
<p>you: Hello I have Language conflicts in my homescreen (Xbox 360) and not able to use my downloaded DLC's in previous country (UK) with my new dowloaded game (while in France) +some games I buy and download from Xbox store are in English &amp; some in French
 I moved to France about a year ago and changed my region to France as I wasn't able to download my Free with Gold games, and some games weren't working on multiplayer</p>
<p>you: So I got that sorted about 6 months ago, but ssince then half of my Xbox homescreen is in english and half in French</p>
<p>you: some games download in English some in french </p>
<p>Eury: Hi, there! It seems that you are having issues with your console's language.</p>
<p>Eury: Let me see what we can do about this matter.</p>
<p>Eury: To start, may I please have your Gamertag or the Microsoft email associated with the console?</p>
<p>you: the achivements listings are french </p>
<p>you: sure</p>
<p>you: DaN1b0y</p>
<p>you: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Eury: Thanks, and to address you properly may I have your name? </p>
<p>you: Dani</p>
<p>Eury: Nice meeting you here, Dani! :)</p>
<p>Eury: A verification code has been sent to the email and contact number on file. You should receive the code within a few seconds. Let me know once you have it.
</p>
<p>you: ok</p>
<p>Eury: Thanks.</p>
<p>you: 92908903</p>
<p>Eury: Perfect! Thank you for verifying the account here.</p>
<p>Eury: I checked your account and it is region in France which is just right since you and your console is situated in France.</p>
<p>Eury: Now we have to check which locale or region your console is set.</p>
<p>Eury: To check that please go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Console &gt;Language and Locale &gt;Locale &gt; Choose France.</p>
<p>you: its set to Language= English Locale=United Kingdom</p>
<p>Eury: Okay, the locale must be in France. is there any option for France?</p>
<p>Eury: Then may I ask which language would you want to use? English or French?</p>
<p>you: sure</p>
<p>you: english</p>
<p>you: o want all to be in english</p>
<p>you: I*</p>
<p>you: i dont really understand french</p>
<p>Eury: Okay. Due to picking up France as locale , the Xbox marketplace and other items in Xbox environment will show up in French language.</p>
<p>Eury: But what can be done is to reset console to factory default and keep games and apps saved on console so that it can get the default settings as the way it should be .</p>
<p>Eury: Console really base from the region where you set it in.</p>
<p>you: so i cant have everything in English as i had before?</p>
<p>you: i have friends that live abroad too and they havnt got this problem</p>
<p>you: everything keeps showing in english even though they changed there region , locale kept in UK</p>
<p>Eury: The console detects your place, so if you are region to France it would really require for you to region the console to France so that your whole marketplace will be shown in French, cause the prices of items differs per region and not all games are
 working on all regions.</p>
<p>Eury: Lcoale is same with region.</p>
<p>Eury: Also, it is required to have same region/locale on our Xbox Live account and console so it won't conflict your purchases and games to work.</p>
<p>Eury: Language that can be managed to change or not.</p>
<p>Eury: But locale/region must be fixed as to where you are physically located as well as your Live accoount.</p>
<p>you: so how is it that some games i download are in englush including the achivements list and some are in french?</p>
<p>you: when acording to that everything should be in french as i donloaded them here and french language shoed as available in the game description</p>
<p>Eury: That is because console is set to English language and marketplace is on French language due to console can physically detect where you are located.</p>
<p>you: so why wont it do that for all games i download</p>
<p>you: can i not choose wich game version to download?</p>
<p>Eury: Do you download games from console only or with web site too?</p>
<p>you: its a store right?</p>
<p>you: just from console marketplace</p>
<p>Eury: the store would show the exact game version available on your place. Now, the reason why it comes in French or English is because you have different language which is not the same as French. You choose ENglish, right? That is why some details show
 in English but majority will show in French as it is your region literally speaking.</p>
<p>you: yes i got that part</p>
<p>you: if i can get some games in english</p>
<p>you: why not others</p>
<p>Eury: The reason why we have Language section on settings so that the customer can understand which to navigate on console.</p>
<p>you: i dont understand why Farcry 4 i downloaded is in enlish and call of duty is in french
</p>
<p>Eury: But region will cover majority part and marketplace of console since that is the main source of console.</p>
<p>Eury: Every game has their own settings too where in you can change languages into whatever language you may understand them.</p>
<p>you: and then i got as a gift a physical copy of Call of duty black ops 3 bought in france and everything written in french, but when i play it game languege and sound and everything is in english</p>
<p>Eury: Like games on phones, we can change their languages the way we can understand them.</p>
<p>you: its like it just chooses englsh when it wants</p>
<p>Eury: With regards to that, for every games being sold digital or physical, it depends on the game developer how they issue the versions of their games to markets.</p>
<p>Eury: Example : Call of Duty , on online marketplace or Xbox Store it can show in French if the game developer just issued the French Version. Or they can issue both English and French version.</p>
<p>you: so basicly i cant do anything about it</p>
<p>you: ?</p>
<p>you: i just have to keep playing and using translaters to understand my own xbox...</p>
<p>Eury: You can try to reset the console to factory default settings but that is not a guarantee that it can make all things you see written in English.</p>
<p>Eury: May I ask where was the console originally purchased?</p>
<p>you: uk</p>
<p>you: 5 or 6 years ago</p>
<p>you: in france since 1 year</p>
<p>you: i mean when i arrived it was working fine as i hadnt changed my region on the website</p>
<p>you: i just had issues with some games on marketplace</p>
<p>you: but others i could buy not a problem</p>
<p>Eury: Okay, you may reset the console to factory default.</p>
<p>Eury: From there you will be setting up the console just like a brand new one.,</p>
<p>Eury: Also, you can pick up the English language there to be set on your console</p>
<p>you: what does that affect or overwrite?</p>
<p>Eury: The reason why you had issues with buying games had matter due to account region issues or console region issues.</p>
<p>you: games saved games apps or updates?</p>
<p>Eury: Please be advised that whatever region you are located your console and account must have same region as where you are.</p>
<p>Eury: when you reset console to factory defaults, games and apps saved can be kept so no need to reinstall them.</p>
<p>Eury: I have some steps here to reset the console.</p>
<p>Eury: Would you like me to send it to you?</p>
<p>you: sure</p>
<p>you: ill try it </p>
<p>Eury: Cool! No problem . :)</p>
<p>Eury: Settings &gt; System &gt; Network settings &gt; choose your network &gt; &nbsp;Configure network &gt; Additional settings &gt; Restore to factory defaults</p>
<p>you: but i wanted to ask another 2 more things</p>
<p>Eury: Feel free to ask. :)</p>
<p>Eury: I hope I didn’t lose you yet. Are we still connected?</p>
<p>you: so say if i wanted to revert my settings on website and console back to uk as they were when i arrived that i had issues only when i wanted to downloed some free games (that i dont really mind), could i do that, and change back to france settings on
 both account and console whenever i wanted to</p>
<p>Eury: We can only change region after 90 days from the last change made on the account.</p>
<p>you: say if i had to dowbload a game and i had region issues?</p>
<p>you: ok</p>
<p>Eury: Also, wherever your physical location is it must be the same settings as your account and console region.</p>
<p>Eury: So not to conflict your console's settings.</p>
<p>you: so only 90 days</p>
<p>Eury: If these are off different regions then you may have issues buying games online and some games do not work on othe regions.</p>
<p>Eury: Yes, 90 days.</p>
<p>Eury: About issues downloading games you may contact us to help you fix it not just change you region .</p>
<p>you: ok... i suppose ill have to keep googleing what everything means</p>
<p>Eury: Here's the catch if you are trying to buy a game from other region ( like you are from France then you are buying from US or UK store ) system can detect that and will block you from purchasing.</p>
<p>Eury: It is a violation on Microsoft Terms and Agreement to buy items on a different region of marketplace.</p>
<p>Eury: So must buy items from the marketplace of your region only.</p>
<p>Eury: This activities are monitored and recorded to accounts so anyone who will check your account can see it from Microsoft.</p>
<p>you: ok thats a pain but i can kind of understand... so my last problem </p>
<p>Eury: Thanks for understanding. This process is done so to be fair with all users.</p>
<p>you: i use to have call of duty black ops 1 when i was in uk</p>
<p>you: physical copy</p>
<p>Eury: Alright..</p>
<p>you: and dowloaded 2 DLC's priced around 15 euros each, then it got scratched and woudnt work so didnt pplay it for a while</p>
<p>Eury: Are you in UK when you purchased those DLCs?</p>
<p>you: recently i got as a gift black ops 3 as i mentioned earlier and it omes as a bundle with a code to download black ops 1, so i did that</p>
<p>you: yes</p>
<p>you: (the gift was while in france)</p>
<p>Eury: Wait, may I ask what was scratched?</p>
<p>Eury: - "and dowloaded 2 DLC's priced &nbsp;around 15 euros each, then it got scratched and woudnt work so didnt pplay it for a while"</p>
<p>you: the original black ops 1 cd</p>
<p>Eury: Okay.</p>
<p>you: dlcs were purchased of the store so i still have thim </p>
<p>Eury: Then you got a Black Ops 3 that comes with a code for BO 1 and that was in French, correct?</p>
<p>you: them*</p>
<p>you: in my hard drive</p>
<p>Eury: So, the disc for Black Ops 1 from UK is no longer working?</p>
<p>you: so as i mentioned earlier the black ops 3 cd and cover is all in french but when i play it its all in english writting voices no french subtitles, that i think is weird but whatever im not gonna complain about exactly what I want haha so black ops 1
 downloaded from code here in france is in french </p>
<p>you: and region in france too</p>
<p>you: so my 2 dlc's are not compatible with it </p>
<p>you: and its asking me to purchase the correct regions versions of them and spend another 30 euros ...</p>
<p>Eury: About the the BO 1 downloaded from code we cannot change its language cause codes are region specific.</p>
<p>you: no disc kapput</p>
<p>Eury: That is why it is necessary to have the region on account and console as to where you are physically located so that marketplace can show you right version of the items you needed.</p>
<p>Eury: About codes they are region specific. Meaning if they were created on France then the code will be region to France only leading for you to see it in French only.</p>
<p>you: yes thats ok all is good but if i have the dlc's in english and i used to have the game in english and now i have it in french why do i need to pay again/</p>
<p>you: ?</p>
<p>Eury: When it comes to disc and codes they are region specific.</p>
<p>you: cant you please take away the english versions of dlc's and give me the french ones so i dont have to pay agaiin for something i already have? and payed for</p>
<p>Eury: The disc and codes are very sensitive, They have their labels as to which region they can only work.</p>
<p>Eury: Sorry but that is not an option, if system requires you to get the French version then it must be purchased from French marketplace.</p>
<p>Eury: We cannot process any purchase from our end for security and privacy.</p>
<p>Eury: I have given you all the information you needed to know to clarify things out how to make the games and DLC you have work.</p>
<p>you: so who can i contact to help me with this problem/</p>
<p>you: ?</p>
<p>Eury: You actually got the right department to give you help on this.</p>
<p>you: i dont see how buy something again when i already have it is a solution</p>
<p>Eury: I have given you all the possible ways to sort your issues out.</p>
<p>you: i understood the other solutions </p>
<p>Eury: Again your owned DLC is not on the right region which is on a disc and is not region to France which is why it won't work.</p>
<p>you: but for this one you ask me to rebuy something i have on my xbox , in another language?</p>
<p>Eury: It has been clearly stated above how DLC and Disc are region sensitive and how it affects your marketplace if you change from one region to another.</p>
<p>you: yes but that is xbox problems</p>
<p>you: not my problem </p>
<p>you: i pay my subscriptions and for my games</p>
<p>you: and i payed for these two dlc's </p>
<p>Eury: Microsoft and Xbox issues disc and codes that is just applicable to correct regions .</p>
<p>you: so how can you not help?</p>
<p>Eury: Like a code labeled as US, can only be used in US.</p>
<p>Eury: Gets?</p>
<p>Eury: Now, your DLC's are bought from UK right?</p>
<p>Eury: They can only be used if your account is region to UK, but that cannot be possible to be done for now if you change region cause that will again conflict the console settings.</p>
<p>you: yes</p>
<p>Eury: It is stated on Terms of Use that the console and account must have the same region as to where you are physically located.</p>
<p>you: yes yes i understand all that </p>
<p>Eury: In changing regions, it has a disclaimer there that once you change region it is not a guarantee that all of your games will work from one region to another region.</p>
<p>you: but most of my games where bought and downloaded while in UK as i was there for 6 years</p>
<p>you: so why do they all work including dlcs</p>
<p>Eury: Do you have the page about region change? I will be glad to send the link to you so you can get more details about what is going to happen if we change region.</p>
<p>you: sure</p>
<p>Eury: Again, there are games that do not work in other region to another region.</p>
<p>you: so out of say 50 games that i have the one game that doesnt work is this one</p>
<p>Eury: There are games in US or UK or whatever country it is that can work in France too. But there are some games that do not which requires you to get the real version base on your region. Hope
</p>
<p>Eury: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-account/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../change-region</a></p>
<p>Eury: That is the link that will lead you to the page about region migration.</p>
<p>you: ok so theres no solution for any of my problems apart from moving back to uk, buying something i already have just in a language i dont understand instead , and meanwhile i keep paying you 60 euros a year for not even helping with my actual problem</p>
<p>you: thanks for the help its not your fault you cant do more i understand , it just angers me</p>
<p>Eury: It is not just about language but the region specified on the item you purchased matters.</p>
<p>you: yes yes its ok </p>
<p>Eury: I gave you all things that can resolve your issue it is just up to you how will you take it from there.</p>
<p>Eury: Anyway, I have created a case on your account and this chat is noted.</p>
<p>Eury: Aside from all the possible solution sets I have provided you, is there anything else I can help you with?</p>
<p>you: i just thought that maybe as i pay a subscription, that if i have a problem with something i have payed for
</p>
<p>you: xbox could just seap the dlcs</p>
<p>you: to the ones needed </p>
<p>you: as i have already purchased them</p>
<p>you: shame this cant be done and i just have to spend the money again</p>

<p>Some games are region locked, but not all. That's why you will run into issues with certain games,but not all of them. Region locks are put in place by the developers, not Microsoft so they can't do anything about them. There is no way around region locks.

<p>Also should be noted for blackish specifically</p>
<p>In order to use the dlc your account region and actual region and disk region and the language of the disk and dlc must be the same</p>
<p>And yes it specific for blackops that's a treyarch restriction as no other publisher except for ubisoft in some of their games</p>

</p><p><span>I would suggest you to check for pending updates as well. To check for pending update, you can navigate to

<h2>            How would you like to open this file pop up on boot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i have read up on this issue a bit but most posts have different issues, from what i have seen, so i thought there is no harm in asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever i boot onto the main account (mine) i get the pop up (&nbsp;How would you like to open this file?) when the user is loaded. This doesn't happen on the other user account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran SFC Scan now and no damage was found. i have tried opening the apps that i shows (steam, internet explorer, Avast safe browser) but it doesn't remember the choice, and when i choose a browser such as internet explorer or Avast safe browser it
 just shows a white tab with some small text in the top left.</p>

            When you say it appears on your screen as soon as you have logged in, are you referring to logging in to your computer? It can be that one of your startup program is causing the pop-up message to appear. You can check your startup programs and disable
 each program that runs during startup to isolate the issue. To do so, follow the steps below:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press<strong> Windows key + X</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Click<strong> More details</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Startup</strong>.</li><li>Click the program and then, click <strong>Disable</strong> button.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest you to run Deployment <span>Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM). This is used when SFC scan was unable to repair the corrupted system files. This tool can download fresh copies of Windows system files. To run DISM,
 follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>.</span></li><li>Click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li><span>Type in the following command:<br />
</span><strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong></li><li><span>Press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After doing so, kindly run SFC scan again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            What would really happen to Windows Media Center users&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On the FAQ page it is mentioned that "We know that some users use Windows Media Center to play DVDs, and we are providing a free DVD playback app in Windows&nbsp;10 for Windows Media Center users.".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you explain more about this? How would I get the free copy of the DVD player app? If I use Windows Media Center on both my Win8.1 and Win7 computers. Can they both get the free DVD player after they both get upgraded to Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what about the TV recording features&nbsp;in the Windows Media Center? Will Microsoft provide anything alternative for that?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the latest reports, this DVD Playback App should be free in Windows 10 for Windows Media Center (WMC) users. Any upgrade to Windows 10 will remove WMC and instead there will be a DVD Playback App to play the DVDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, we don't have much information about the features of the DVD Playback App, if they will consist the same features of WMC. We will update the customers and our articles when we get the information.</p>

            Hi Geethu,<br />
<br />
I have Windows 10 Insider Preview (x64) - Build 10130, but I can't find this DVD Playback App. Maybe there's some method to activate it? Considering that there are less than 2 months before Windows 10 release, the app should be almost finished by now and we
 should be able to test it. I think it's important to test if DVD playback works properly in Windows 10, before making the decision to upgrade to it, after all that's what Windows 10 Insider Program if for.<br />

<p>I know how to use Bing or Google, but thanks for the hint anyway :) I'm not interested in third party DVD players (freeware or not), I'm interested in testing Windows 10 native DVD and MPEG-2 playback. I've never used Media Center and don't really care about

</p><p>Microsoft promises to include a DVD playback app but has so far not released any details. You have through July 2016 to get the free upgrade, so you may want to hold off and see what the specs are once they finally release it to market.</p>

<p>And this is what's weird. If they should have the final build in about a month, they should have it almost ready by now. The question is why not give us the opportunity to test it in

<h2>            Missing &#34;Look for another app on this PC&#34; option</h2>
                    I'd like to change some file associations in Windows 8.1, but I cannot chose an application that is installed on my pc. For example, I'd like to change some associations for Skype to be opened by Lync instead - but my only options are Keep using Skype,
 or "Look for an app in the store" - no option to choose my locally installed Lync client in Office 2013.
<div><br />

<div>How can i get the option back to search locally?</div>

            Unfortunately, this is not an acceptable answer because it leads right back to the same issue. I want to associate the Lync 2013 client from Office 2013 with all the same filetypes as Skype, but Lync is not an option, and neither is the option to search
 for an app on the pc. I can choose the Windows Store app, or nothing at all.<br />

            <p><span>I have the same issue: Windows 8.1, Office 2013, Lync 2013. When try to open an phone-Link (sample: tel:12345667) I get the window to choose a app. The window contains Skype, „Look for an app in the store“ and nothing else, no possibility
 to choose an app on the local PC.</span></p>
<p><span>In the registry the tel-protocol is wired with Lync:</span></p>
<p><span>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\tel\shell\open\command]<br />
@="\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\Office15\\Lync.exe\" \"%1\""</span></p>

<p>The option ( link ) is there. you just cant see it because your color settings on your pc are set to white. which means the text is white and its being camouflaged by the background.&nbsp;change your color to anything else, and boom, its there.</p>

<p>Thank you! I was racking my brain trying to figure out why this setting disappeared. Would never have begun to think it was due to me changing my colour in the past!</p>

                    hello. first time here. At startup, an error "CFTMON.EXE - unable to locate component. this application has failed because MSCTF.dll was not found. re-installing the application may fix the problem". My pc is slow, sluggish and programmes slow to respond.
 I don't have a virus, nor any malware, etc. I downloaded a microsoft Hotfix that may solve the problem, but didn't work. This happened at the last microsoft SP3 update. Have tried system restore, no luck. Can someone help, or advise how to correct this error
 please?

<p>You cited CFTMON which, sadly for you, is a trojan. Download the free Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware from
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a>&nbsp; Double Click mbam-setup.exe to install it. Follow the prompts but make sure ticks are placed next to ‘Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware’ and ‘Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware’ then click
 Finish. If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t lock desktop icons in place</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I use Remote Desktop to access my PC from different locations within LAN.&nbsp; I arrange desktop Icons to suit my needs.&nbsp; These Icons are getting shuffled after each remote session.&nbsp; Is there any way to FIX the icons in place. Most are shortcuts, but there's
 about 40, and they will not stay put. </p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
In Windows 10, there are ways to keep the icons in place. To make them stay in their location, we suggest that you check these methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In your desktop, right click on an open area.</li><li>Select <strong>Personalise</strong>, click <strong>Themes </strong>on the left menu.</li><li>Remove the checkmark on <strong>Allow themes to change desktop icons</strong>, then click
<strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Arrange your icons where you want them to be.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In an open area, right click on your desktop.</li><li>Select <strong>View</strong>, on the drop down menu <strong>Auto arrange</strong> icons shouldn't have a checkmark and
<strong>Align icons to grid</strong> should have a checkmark.</li></ul>
<p>Let us know if any of the above methods work.</p>
<p />

<h2>            Blue Snowball device error code 10 under Device Manager</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Original Title: Microphone no longer functioning with Windows 8.1? (Code 10)
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Purchased, blue snowball microphone and it seems like it's not working. Getting an Error message when I go to troubleshoot "Blue Snowball having driver problem" for the pass 12 hours. Been watching YouTube videos about it and searching
 it on Google as wished still couldn't find anything that could solve this.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Using a 2.0 USB port, yes!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I'd tried it on my MAC it works, record sound perfectly and once I brought it to my PC it had issues. Tried mostly everything there is on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Going to &gt;&gt; Device Manager &gt;&gt; Uninstall &gt;&gt; Blue Snowball &gt;&gt; Un-PLUG device &gt;&gt; Plug it back in&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Still having that "Yellow Symbol" beside my device, still not resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">If there's a possible solution to this problem, what could it be fixed?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Also, went to the store and purchased a printer USB cord which the Blue Snowball used. Still no luck! understanding it worked on my MAC I expected to work on the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Contacted Blue Snowball, there representatives are terrible. First they couldn't provide information on there products. They mumble across questions like Drivers and stuff and they believe I need Warrenty to solve the issue. Believing
 it's false so they can make customers pay more.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I'd even plugged it in every different USB spot there is possibly in my PC, also purchased a USB hub from Amazon tried that didn't work. I spent weeks and weeks trying to solve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">But I know there must be a way to solve this problem, it's very bad that every forum I go on won't provide a proper source of information. This product has the red light. It just has this Driver problem which I heard recently Blue
 Snowball said that Windows 8 has difficulty.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">But, many users have made it work on Windows 8 so there must be a solution to this, if you don't have any please don't reply saying " Get a new mic " and that. I can't I purchased it off a Seller who won't accept refund. I just
 need support!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Currently, running the latest Windows 8.1. Unfortunately I cannot downgrade as I don't want to risk it just for a microphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Like if there was someone who could help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some how they are but they're not? I'm not sure I understand. To be clear, are your save files present? If not, that's likely why your multiplayer progress is missing.

    <title>Why is SKYPE for business duplicating chat messages&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is SKYPE for business duplicating chat messages&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This has been happening for a while now and it isn't only for me. It is happening to my coworkers as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which hinders the communication process, because now we have to go through several message boxes from the same person to find something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY is this happening? It is extremely annoying, serves no purpose, and wastes time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is so hard about containing the ENTIRE history of a conversation within ONE chat box? Instead of new ones popping up everyday. Skype has been around for so long that this really betrays my expectations for this product.&nbsp;</p>

 with you the following information: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>May I know whether the application you mentioned is Skype, or Skype for Business?</li><li>If it is Skype for Business, please try to update desktop client, if issue persists after updated, please provide a screenshot of full version numbers to me.</li><li>Could you please provide a screenshot of this issue symptom to me for checking?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Gian 1995,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the screenshot, it shows that there are two chat tabs with the same person,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As my understanding, they are two different chat sessions between you and this person: When he firstly contacted you, he initiated a chat session and begin chatting with you (or you initiated the session),
 after then, the former conversation history might be removed from his device, or he logon another device to initiate the new second chat session with you. If it is the scenario, you may see the two chat tabs with the same person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>
        </p>

<p>OKay....so then let's FIX THE PROBLEM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need multiple chats of the same person filling up my skype. And the same goes for the person on the other line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the only messenger tool that I've encountered this problem. Guys, it's 2018, get your technology together</p>

<p>Hi Gian1990,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. As I have mentioned, it is expected behavior that if one initiate a new chat sessions, for example, switched to different devices. I understand that it may not satisfy your needs and
 you really want starting chat with the same person via only one conversation tab, I suggest that you may submit your suggestions at
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skypefeedback.com/</a> some features in Skype for Business are improved via people’s feedback, your suggestions are valued for our products. Thanks for your time and understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>
