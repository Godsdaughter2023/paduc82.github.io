<p>I was able, with the help of MS phone assistance, to ascertain that in order to edit a contact, one must do so from a contact card. Merely clicking on the edit under the person's name doesn't work. One must reveal the drop down menu and click on "card" to
 carry out the editing changes successfully.</p>

<h2>            Installation Problems with Compatibility Pack -- also with getting rid of Office 2007 trial version and Works</h2>
                    
<p>I have just upgraded to a Windows 7 computer, but I want to keep my Office Professional 2003 w/ SP3.&nbsp; The computer came loaded with Microsoft Works and a trial version of Office 2007 Home &amp; Student Edition.&nbsp; I have tried in various ways to delete, uninstall,
 etc. these unwanted "gifts."&nbsp; Nonetheless, almost every time I try to open Word or Excel, I get a dialogue box telling me to wait while Windows installs Office 2007 (which often it succeeds in doing).&nbsp; If anyone can tell me how to get rid of Works and Office
 2007 (trial) for once and for all, I would be grateful.</p>
<p>Of more immediate importance, however, is the Compatibility Pack, which I need because not everyone I communicate with wants to stay in the dark ages of Office 2003.&nbsp; At one point it was installed and working fine.&nbsp; Now it is not (possibly because of some
 damage I did while trying to uninstall Office 2007 and/or Works).&nbsp; I would gladly simply reinstall it.&nbsp; However, when I try to do so I get a message that an earlier version has already been installed and must be uninstalled.&nbsp; When I try to uninstall, I get
 a message that Windows cannot access this file:&nbsp; c:\Windows\Installer\O12Conv.msi.&nbsp; And, indeed, that file seems not to exist on my computer.</p>
<p>Can someone help me uninstall and then reinstall the Compatibility Pack?&nbsp; Additional words of wisdom on the banishment of Office 2007 would also be welcome.</p>

<h2>            Data model windows mot opening in excel 2016 preview</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing an issue with excel 2016 preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though 'manage' option for power pivot is available under the 'Data' tab in the ribbon, it is not actually doing anything at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that power pivot seems to work under the hood, meaning that I can add a table to data model when creating a pivot table, but don't have then all the functionalities that the manage window offers, not even the powe pivot menu in the ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus I can not find any of the new charts that are mentioned for the preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. There is no other office active in the pc. There was a 'shortcut' to activate office using a product key when I purchase the laptop, but have never done it. Plus I thought that by installing the preview, any other versions would
 have been disabled, if&nbsp;present at all.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>a new PC often comes with a trial version of Office already installed. Not activating does not mean that it disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the preview does not automatically uninstall any previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to manually check in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &nbsp;and uninstall any version of Office. I suggest you even uninstall the preview. Then reboot the machine and double check that there is no other instance of Office on your machine, then install
 the preview again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to respond again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had the same thought and perform uninstall using a 'fix'&nbsp;, however I can not find a way to uninstall the preview, as I am constantly getting error messages, whether I use the control panel uninstall feature or the repair function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is getting quite frustrating and I am not sure if I should spend any more time with, as the reason was just to check it out in order to request later on at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your time.</p>

    <title>Docking or snapping multiple desktop windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> honest abe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Docking or snapping multiple desktop windows</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 7 we could drag window title bars&nbsp;to the left or right to dock them as half screen windows on either side of the display.&nbsp; The feature was extremely well implemented because the new 'docked' position would
<strong>not</strong> overwrite the last saved 'Restore' position.&nbsp; So, in essence, we had&nbsp;four potential quick access window&nbsp;configurations - maximized, minimized, restored, or docked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not expand on this great feature by allowing the user to <strong>dock 4 separate windows in quadrants</strong>?&nbsp; This could be accomplished by simply&nbsp;dragging any window title bar toward the desktop corners versus the sides.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp;it would be
 nice if users could dock 1/2 size windows horizontally in addition to the left/right&nbsp;vertical placement.&nbsp; With today's large monitors, it is often useful to be able to work with different combinations of 1/2 or 1/4 size windows snapped to the&nbsp;predetermined
 screen&nbsp;locations.</p>

<h2>            Trojan detected&#33;</h2>
                    When inserting disc 1 (Office 2007 Pro), I have to manually open install. When trying to install, McAfee detects a Trojan and won't install. Can my Office 2007 CD have a virus? How can this be possible? I was going to disable McAfee and try to install,
 but is this safe? Any input on this matter?...Thanks

<p>Yes it is possible for your CD to have a virus on it. It has happened with other products in the past. But it would also imply that you have a bootleg copy since personally I don't remember hearing of Office disks being shipped infected. This site has images
 of counterfit copies:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/content.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;pg=counterfeit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/content.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;pg=counterfeit</a></p>
<p>I would also get a second (and third ...) opinion on the virus hit. Antivirus software has been known to have "false" positive results, identifying a virus when there isn't one. There are many online sites where you can submit the file for scanning by multiple
 AV tools</p>

    <title>Nokia C3-00 FM radio&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> starfishland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia C3-00 FM radio&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I just bought the Nokia C3-00, and am enjoying it greatly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the cool functions I've noticed is being able to use an FM radio. I was just wondering, does this radio use data?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have a data plan and therefore can't connect to the internet on my phone, but i'm just wondering if this radio uses data, or just functions like a regular radio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the Nokia C3-00 FM radio does not use data from any data plan.</p>
<p>However, in order for the radio to work you need to plug in the headset that came along with your phone.</p>
<p>The headset works as an antenna.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>It took me ages to get this sorted as there is nothing in the booklet to let you know how to sort it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I switched my phone off, took the battery out for 5 or 10 mins, checked the sim card, then put it all back together.&nbsp; When I switched the phone on again and put the headphones which were supplied the radio worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not technical one bit so if it works for me then this should work for you.&nbsp; If not I'm sorry maybe someone else could help.</p>

            When you plug in the headset do you see a small headset icon in the desktop/homescreen notitfication area? If not may be the headset connector is faulty which means that radio also will NOT function. Otherwise there shoudn't be any problems, good luck.

            <p>Are you talking about one of the 3 "Office 2016" one-time payment licenses, or one of the Office 365/2016 bundles? There is a significant difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, the short answer is you need a "product Key" to activate any copy of office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a Office 365 trial you have to go to myaccount and provide a credit card number.&nbsp;

<h2>            So far I think it is a load of C&#42;&#42;P &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have always been a lover of the Nokia Phones and so far I have had at least 20 starting off with a fixed car phone (with the hand peice the size of a standard BT Land line phone)and upto the 6330i. I went for the N73 to get the larger screen only to
 find that apart from the imputting of phone numbers to be rung the rest of the display was to small to see without putting my glasses on, with no way of making it bigger.Also, you lose the keyboard size so unless you have fingers the size of a babys and pleanty
 of light to see with you end up pressing the wrong keys.<br />
Although the end product photo's are good it takes so much time for the cammera to function you offten miss the shot you were after, this also happens when you press the shutter button as that also takes time to click and you end up with a picture of your subject
 moving out of frame.<br />
Over all I think like Microsoft Vista The N73 is to cleaver for it's on good. why don't people like Nokia and all the rest follow the one Golden rule that seems never to be followed nowadays and that is KEEP IT SIMPLE!!!

            Suspect you really didn't research the phone before you went for it. Style over substance? Features over ability?<br />
<br />
The smartphones do all they are advertised to do. In spades. Yes they have small keys. The display can't be set to large fonts.<br />
<br />
My old 8800 is more beautiful and has better battery life than my current N series. But I can do so much more that I NEED to do on my N series.<br />
<br />
Who is "too clever"? You or Nokia?

            That's a bit harsh valleyforge.<br />
<br />
I blame retailers for pushing smartphones at people that don't need them.<br />
<br />
Nokia has two ranges, smartphones and normal phones (also known as "dumbphones"). It always helps to read reviews before buying any phone to see if it suits your needs.<br />
<br />
A better replacement for the original posters phone would have been a normal phone like the 6233, 6300, 6500 slide or 6500 classic.

            I must of said something nasty about vallyforge, although I cant see where! I do agree that the retailers (The phone contract suppliers) are very breif with there discriptions, but if they went into more detail perhaps they would not get the business the
 are trying to push for.<br />
<br />
However, the points I made are all valid no matter if it is the right phone or not, the keyboard is to small and the display can not be changed

            I have several friends with the N73 and none of them have ever had trouble with it's text. Have you considered getting your eyes tested? My father had trouble seeing his phone but this was solved by buying some new specs.<br />
<br />
The text size can be made larger by installing an additional program, it does not cost much (€9.95):<br />

<br />
As for the keypad did you not think to look at a display dummy of the phone before you bought it? Also why didn't you return it as soon as you realised it was too small for your fingers?<br />
<br />
I have average sized fingers and have found the N73's keypad to be very easy and comfortable to use.<br />

    <title>Option Group Freezes on successive single clicks to same button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevthu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Option Group Freezes on successive single clicks to same button</h2>
                    I have an option group with 4 buttons that supplies a parameter to a query that an adjacent Listbox uses.&nbsp; When an option button is clicked, the Listbox is re-queried and the relevant, values appear according to the Option Button selected.&nbsp; It works perfectly
 as long as when you click an option button, it is always a different option button than the one currently selected.&nbsp; If you click a second time on an option button that is already selected, the Option Group freezes and the On Click event does not seem to fire.&nbsp;
 If you then click outside the Option Group it returns to normal function, but you must click out of it to get it to become enabled again.<br />
<br />
What might cause this behavior and how can I avoid it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Why would you want it to fire again if it is on the same option? &nbsp;That makes no sense. &nbsp;The values for the list box should still be there should they not? So, is it really freezing (where you can't make another selection) or just looks like it?

            Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
You're right that the listbox retains its correct contents on a second click of the same option button, for the simple reason that nothing has affected it.&nbsp; This isn't an issue.&nbsp; The issue is that the option group freezes/becomes disabled and requires the user
 to perform an additional, non-intuitive action to re-enable it.&nbsp; Its a glitch in the user interface, and I'd like to avoid it.<br />
<br />
The option group does actually become frozen/disabled.&nbsp; If you perform a second single click on any given button, no other buttons can be selected until you move the focus outside of the option group.&nbsp; The button that is selected also "dims" in a way that indicates
 it is disabled.&nbsp; On this second click, the OnClick event does not fire.<br />
<br />
Here's the full code I have in the OnClick event:<br />
<br />
Private Sub StatusListOptnGrp_Click()<br />
Me.StatusList.Requery<br />
Me.StatusList.SetFocus<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Note that the value of the option group is used as a parameter in the query feeding the StatusList.<br />
<br />
I'm still stumped on this one.&nbsp; Thanks for helping.<br />

<h3> shehab kamal  say:</h3>
<h2>            New to Windows Mobile</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,<br />
I have switched from Nokia 5800 running Symbian S60 5th edition to HTC HD2 running Windows Mobile 6.5.<br />
HD2 is a great device and HTC Sense helps a lot, however windows mobile is extremely difficult compared to S60.<br />
I have some questions:<br />
1- Is there a guide for Windows Mobile 6.5 itself and not the HTC Sense? I have read the quick guide at
<a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/qrg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/qrg/</a> but it didn't help. Also the insider section of the windows mobile site doesn't seem to be enough.<br />
I just need a user guide for Windows Mobile 6.5 that is as detailed as the HTC Sense guide.<br />
2- I don't use Outlook to save my contacts but it seems to be the only way to sync. I have synced my Nokia contacts to Outlook 2007 then using Active Sync, I got the contacts and notes to my Windows Mobile. From now on I want to use My Phone as my backup and
 syncing option however whenever I delete my Windows PC entry from the Active Sync program, all the contacts are gone.
<br />
Is there a way to stop using Active Sync and persist my contacts? <br />
3- In S60 you can assign more than one phone with the same label to a contact, i.e. a person has 2 mobiles and I don't want to classify them as work and home because they really aren't, in fact they are 2 numbers in 2 different countries. Also in S60, you can
 edit the label itself, i.e. mobile (favorite) and mobile (father) and so on.<br />
On the other hand Windows Mobile is has fixed labels and you cannot use the same label twice. Is there a workaround for this?<br />
4- Is there a way to stop automatic 3G data connection? HTC Sense can stop it momentarily but it goes back again. I want to download things via data connection only when I enable it first.<br />
5- Can I create shortcut to profiles so that i switch between them?<br />
6- Why the limit of 3 alarms, can I define more than 3 alarms?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />
Shehab.</p>

            Dear Shehab,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile world or Windows Phone as re-branded now and good luck with your HTC Touch HD2.<br />
<br />
Actaully the stuffs you can do with Windows Phones are vast and hence writing a manual will be like writing a big book. It is better when you learn as you use and it gets set once you start using. Alternatively, you can find various tips and information on
 many websites related to PocketPC phones or Windows Phones. That answers your first question.<br />
<br />
2. The contacts and other outlook data are synced between your windows phone and outlook on Desktop. Deleting an entry on either of it will remove the entry on the other device. If you dont want to sync the contacts anymore you can change the Sync settings
 in Active Sync and disable contacts option there. But this is not recommended as it is better to keep it sync always.<br />
<br />
3. You cant edit the labels here but does it really matter? I always recommend the frequently called number to be set in the mobile field and the rest in work, office and so on.. SMS messages can only be sent to the numbers set in mobile field.<br />
<br />
4. The Comm Manager app can help you switch off 3G or better yet, there is a <a href="http://pocketpc-live.com/free-softwares/automatically-switch-between-2g-and-3g.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free software</a> to do that.<br />
<br />
5. There is no profile support built-in to windows phones but you again have a <a href="http://pocketpc-live.com/softwares/pocket-tweaker-brings-profiles-to-pocketpc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free software</a> to do that.<br />
<br />
6. You can do that with third party softwares (many free ones are there) or else set reminders in outlook for unlimited number of alarms. By default, you can have only 3 daily alarms.<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>As I understand you have issues with Cisco Webex.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it works okay on other two browsers, I suggest you to enable the add-on for Java in Internet Explorer browser and see if that helps.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Refer the following steps:</p>
<p><span>You will need to make sure that the necessary Add-on is enabled in Internet Explorer, to do this follow the steps below:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WebEx has a facility to enable interactive chat. This is not visible when using Win8 / IE 10 or Win7 / IE 10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am able to get the chat window open on Win 7 / Firefox but not Win 8 / Firefox / Chrome.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appears to be a Win8 / WebEx incompatibility. Are you able to work with WebEx to allow it to be used with Win8?</p>

<p>I think all the applications of Office10 as well as Office13 [&nbsp;I've tried Word, One Note and Outlook ] are perfectly compatible with my Wacom Bamboo Pen and Touch CTH 460. I am using a 2011 driver version
<strong>Pen Tablet 5.2.5-5a</strong> which is the latest they have on the Wacom support site<strong>.</strong> In Outlook 2010 as well as in Outlook 2013, you have to click on the
<strong>Start Inking Ink</strong> which comes under <strong>Review</strong> tab while still connected&nbsp;to your Wacom, whenever you decide to send a new mail in your own hand-writing. Am having no issues with my Wacom. I am using Wacom with Windows8 Release Preview
 x64 with Office13 in dual boot with Windows7 Ultimatex32 with Office 2010. </p>

    <title>Drive migration and storage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ozzbatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drive migration and storage</h2>
                    When I started as an Insider, I already was MAP level partner and Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit upgrade owner. I have two 750gb Seagate Barracuda ST3750330xx {AS and NS} drives in my machine. I have Windows 7 running on the physical "C" drive, and Windows
 10 Pro 64-bit on the physical "D" drive.&nbsp; There is a 100Gb partition on the Windows 7 drive and, 336Gb partition labeled as "Data" numbers one and two. Plus a System 100Mb and 450Mb partitions on drive "0" (physical "C"), and I assume these are the related
 partitions to recover from if there is a boot issue. Both Physical drives have other operating partitions on them in so many words.<br />
<br />
Over the last few years I have kept the systems updated and Windows 10 is about full (16Gb remain) and I assume the swap file for the Windows 7 install is the only reason that space is still available. (I stuck them on the other physical drives for performance
 reasons.) I recently purchased a couple of 1TB replacement drives and an external 3Tb drive to do a complete computer backup and was wondering about the image migrating to the two new drives. I tried to shrink the "C" drive ("data #1") partition, and move
 th 450Mb partition (Windows 10 related?) with no success. This basically means I'm assuming that I need to redirect the 'Documents' and other folders to the external drive after migrating the backup image to the new 1Tb replacements.&nbsp;I'm also using "EasyBCD"
 to manage the boot process.<br />
<br />
I have used the Windows 7 Backup Image and E-boot Disk to migrate another OS on a friends laptop with no problems. A 500Gb to 1Tb drive swap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
My questions are as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Windows 10 Pro was a digitally signed certificate upgrade of the Windows 7 Ultimate installation. I have and still use the Media Center Remote for this program. Will migrating it compromise the installation?<br />
<br />
2) Since it appears that the hidden Windows related partitions that will not physically be moved, and I will have a bigger "back end" partition on the Windows 10 (Drive "1", or Physical "D"), is there some way to move the hidden partitions on Drive "0", or
 Physical "C", to the back end of that drive (Drive "0", or Physical "C") without corrupting the installs in the process?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3) If there is a Microsoft tool for for doing this? If so, what is it called and where can I get a link?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any answers in advance - Ozz<br />
<br />

I do appreciate the answer. Not what I am trying to do though. I'm using VMware already and have 4 of my old computers virtualized in the Windows&nbsp;10 Pro installation. What I am seeking is just information as to whether or not an image of both drives and OS's
 at the same time and transferring them will work.<br />
<br />
As I stated before, I've successfully&nbsp;migrated a Windows 10 Home install on a laptop using the backup and imaging program with an e-disk made at that time. My question is given these are both 64-bit OS's on two different partitions, one containing the "reserved
 for system use" stuff, will Windows 10 Pro take a crash due to the fact it's a digital licence upgrade that was redirected to install on my "D" drive (Disk "1"), and can those system reserved partitions (Win 10's 450mb, and Win 7's 100mb) that are physically
 located on my "C" drive (Disk "0") be moved to make more room for future updates?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm physically locked down into a 375Gb partition on the Windows 10 Pro "D" drive with about 16 free Gb of space left. That is about the size of the swap file. I realize I can physically redirect the files and folders to the external drive after making such
 a migration. I'm just trying to find out if that can be done?<br />
<br />
I've been doing computers since DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11, and along the way discovered hardware limitations before. The classic was losing my Millenium upgrade drive due to the fact I didn't have the right kind of video card way back in 1999. I believe had
 a 1mb card, and if I remember right you needed a 4mb card. I had a backup of the original Windows 98 SE, and wiped that drive in the process of of doing the imaging of the data back to its original state. I lost a bunch of music and emails in outlook in Office
 97 and Media Player in that process. I don't wish to do that again!<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for the suggestion. Not what I wish to do because the Windows 10 Pro host is already running virtual images. I don't believe images within images is a good idea.<br />
<br />
I do appreciate&nbsp;your help though, and that was a really good read!<br />
<br />

<p>Many here us the Macrium Reflect they suggested at the bottom of the Page. Seems it is one of the better cloning third party app that you can get a free version and make a USB Bootable to Clone while non of the Drive OS's are running making an exact copy
 to another Drive. I have never tried it but I have used Used one called Rescue kit 14 that Installs on USB also to completely move the 3 I use Win 10 Fast Win 10 Release and Win 7 to Drives of there Own and then just added them to the boot manager with EasyBCD
 all work and stayed Activated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By what you describe as what you have been doing I am sure that you will be successful.</p>

            I appreciate the answers folks! <br />
<br />
I forgot I had a copy of Partition Magic and the simple swapping of partitions around. Got the thing extended and the system imaged with the Windows 7 emulation in Windows 10 Pro. Swapped out the drives and the image files worked fine. Feel like an idiot actually.
 Got so many things in my head I forgot the basics!&nbsp; ;0)<br />

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try working with the Word Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word / Excel/ PW:
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how disable add-in:
<br />

<br />
<br />If, the procedures above didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Add and Remove Programs and highlight Microsoft Office. Click on Remove. A menu will pop up allowing you to choose repair or reinstall. Try a Repair Online and verified after repair it fix.

<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />

<h3> kevinwhitect  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10074&#58; Cortana is Dead &#40;and I kind of liked her&#41;, and the Start Button isn&#39;t starting</h2>
                    <p>Last build in the slow ring worked fine. I just updated (Samsung Series 9 ATIV Laptop) to 10074 (installed w/o any problem), and the start button does nothing but turn a little blue when the mouse hovers over it ... but does not open the start menu.<br />
<br />
Cortana's section is dead. I can't type anything in it (although the cursor will blink, it won't do anything), and clicking on the microphone doesn't pop a prompt.<br />
<br />
Oops?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions as to how to kick start either?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help!<br />
<br />

P.S. - I can install classic shell to regain functionality, but I'd rather have things work as designed.<br />

            The "fix" is quite simple, and I found it searching through other threads.<br />
<br />
Do a Windows Update.<br />
<br />
If needed, download Classic Shell, set it to the Windows 7 Start Menu, and search the programs and files for Windows Update.<br />
<br />
Then, do a Windows Update.<br />
<br />
Cortana will work immediately, but the start menu command in Classic Shell will NOT pop the Windows 10 Start Menu window.<br />
<br />
Removing Classic Shell returns the Windows 10 Start Menu to full functionality.
