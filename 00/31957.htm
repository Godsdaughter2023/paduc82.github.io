</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Browse to C:\Program Files\Windows Photo Viewer.<br />
b. Leave that window open and then right click on start, select “Command Prompt” (Admin).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Type “C:\Program Files\Windows Photo Gallery” and press enter.<br />
d. Next you need to register some of the files in this folder, for each file ending with .dll, do this…<br />
e. Type regsvr32 and the file name then press enter.<br />
f. For example<strong> regsvr32 Photoviewer.dll </strong>and press enter. There is a space between regsvr32 and photoviewer.dll.<br />
e. It should say something with the file name and “succeeded”. If not you need to try it again and watch the spacing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Note: </strong>If you cannot see the file extensions (The .dll) go explore and choose Organize, Folder and search options, click on the view tab, and then uncheck hide extensions for known file types.</span></p>

    <title>CD&#47;DVD drive not being recognized. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            CD&#47;DVD drive not being recognized.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Problems with 'D' Drive</p>
<p>Yesterday, Fix it Center replaced the driver for my CD/DVD. It then worked perfectly for a few seconds and then 'froze'.
<br />
After several attempts to restart it, I ended up doing a system restore, which (you might know) 'lost' the driver for the 'D' drive again!<br />
This morning I have again attempted to use Fix it Center, but now get an error code: 0x80092003.
<br />
Any help in sorting this will be appreciated.<br />
Regards.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like the drive might be failing, Have you added any CD or DVD programs lately -
<br />
particularly any that load at StartUp?<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<p>Manually try this fix if the 314060 Fixit did not work<br />
<a href="http://www.pchell.com/hardware/cd_drive_error_code_39.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pchell.com/hardware/cd_drive_error_code_39.shtml</a></p>

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

    <title>Using Microsoft Sidewinder X8 Thumb buttons in-game - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using Microsoft Sidewinder X8 Thumb buttons in-game</h2>
                    hi, I've recently bought the sidewinder X8 gaming mouse and of course i planed on using the two side thumb hot-key buttons in-game for different things. but when i tried to hot-key the top thumb button to "go prone" (keystroke... (z)) in Battlefield 2
 the button doesn't make my character go prone but yet the keyboard button "z" makes my character go prone.<br />
<br />
how would i make it so the top thumb button would make my character go prone?<br />
<br />
thanks

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that should not fix your problem then rename the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; windows\SoftewareDistribution&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;folder to SoftwareDistribution.BAK and restart the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes you may need to&nbsp;stop the Service for Windows Updates to rename that folder, but not usually.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>At the restart&nbsp;it rebuilds the folder and its contents to all new.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then wait 2 minutes before you run windows updates&nbsp;so&nbsp;the hard drive seems settled down and makes the new stuff.</p>

<p>Hello Royanna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the only application that is experiencing this loading error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this happens with only this application, it is possible that there was corruption placed during the process of the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our suggestions are to review the <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/connection-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One Network Connection Solution</a></strong> and if all is great connection wise, perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Soft and Full Factory Reset</a></strong>as there is mention of attempting the reset just not which one was
 chosen:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Reset and remove everything</strong>. This option resets the console to factory settings. All user data, including accounts, saved games, settings, home Xbox associations, and all games and apps will be deleted. You should use this option when selling
 or gifting the console to someone else. You should only use this option as a last resort in some troubleshooting cases.
</li><li>
<strong>Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</strong>. You should use this option as your primary choice when troubleshooting. It will reset the OS and delete all potentially corrupted data without deleting your games or apps. This will save you from downloading
 or reinstalling the large game files. In some cases, if a corrupt game file is causing the issue you're troubleshooting, you may have to choose
<strong>Reset and remove everything</strong>, but you should always start with <strong>
Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</strong> and save <strong>Reset and remove everything</strong> as a last resort.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Try these out for us and let us know if this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<h2>            Skype version 8.34.0.78 makes the computer stops &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I was working since win7, win 8, win 8.1 and all the versions of Win10 since the beginning with no problems with Skype and my Webcam Microsoft Lifecam VX-6000 !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since i got a big crash on 22 November and i needed&nbsp; to a ""clean"" install of Windows 10 Pro version 1809-17763.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that day every version of Skype 7.41 and version 8.xx stops the computer with error: Blue screen DRIVER IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL, TCPIP.SYS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had that before since i am working with Skype since Windows XP and all the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can i do to fixe that problem ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: i can't understand that every time a new upgrade or update cames out, there is always something that don't work anymore, and where we didn't haven any problems before !!!</p>

<br />NOTE: We’re letting you know that support for Skype version 7 will end on November 1, 2018 on desktop devices and November 15 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, we’ll begin requiring updates to version 8. Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while longer.
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. Since September 2018, we started seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>My Skype with Microsoft Lifecam was working since Win7 without no problems and even with latest Win 10 V1803-17134 and 1809-17763 before my CRASH.&nbsp; So i don't understand with the drivers for the Lifecam i put manually like in the past (Win10 don't have them)
 suddenly error, Blue screen and don't work anymore !!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, Win10 put the drivers for Audio for the webcam but NOT the drivers for the video and these i have to insert them manually !</p>

            The blue screen issue you are having can be due to failing hardware, drivers, or related services. Since the problem is occurring in the&nbsp; TCP/IP stack, it is more than likely related to a networking driver, service or network-related malware/virus. I suggest
 you obtain the latest drivers for your hardware from your OEM or device manufacturer. The drivers provided with Windows 10 may not suffice. If your hardware has a driver suite with unnecessary software, try to perform a custom install of the driver only. If
 you utilize 3rd party network/security software, try updating that software or temporarily removing it, to see if that resolves the issue. Another option may be to disable your default network hardware and try an external USB to network device, to see if that
 is more compatible/stable.

<p>I understand the whole issue, but no one of the helpdesk can explain why ""Microsoft Lifecam VX-6000"" works perfectly since the start of Windows 7, 8, 8.1,&nbsp; and now all the versions of Windows 10 today. Until the big crash i got on 12 November and i only
 received the option to do a ""clean install"", so all my programs has to been reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problem of the webcam is the ""video section"",&nbsp; the rest is ok, i can talk, i can write but i can't use the video section !</p>
<p>
</p><p>So very happy to receive so many helps.</p>

<p>Camera compatibility is generally down to drivers. In regards to the VX-6000 you have two drivers you can attempt to use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The LifeCam 3.x drivers for Windows 7.x (installs under Imaging devices).</p>
<p>2. The generic USB Video Device drivers that come with Windows 10 (installs under Cameras, in the latest versions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your camera is not being seen by Apps in Windows 10, it is best to update to the generic USB Video Device drivers using Device Manger - Update driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a LifeCam VX-800 and it functions with the generic drivers in Windows 10 - 1809. It is painfully slow when compared to my LifeCam HD models, but it still technically works. Older drivers may not adhere to current standards (established since Windows
 7) or may be buggy. Older devices may not adhere to newer standards but the generic drivers assume they do, allowing older devices to function in some capacity using those drivers. When dealing with camera issues, ensure the latest video drivers are installed,
 as that plays its part.</p>

<p>helo techfreak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hole story begins with a big crash on 12 november !&nbsp; The system let me do only a new "clean" install. So all programs and drivers were gone.</p>
<p>Since i was working with Microsoft Lifecam VX-6000 from Win 7, 8, 8.1 and all versions Win 10 with 1809-17763 and webcam was working perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Win 10 V1803 i have to install the drivers manually and that was no problem.&nbsp; Everything was working very good !!</p>
<p>After the new clean install i installed manually the VX-6000 (x64) drivers for the webcam and the webcam was accepted with no defaults .</p>
<p>After installing ""Skype for Desktop (new since a few weeks)"" i go to the settings and in the section audio and video i receive a computer stop with Blue screen Driver IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL tcpip.sys as error.</p>
<p>When i try to call by voice = no problem, writing (chat)= no problem. Only the section "video calling" gives the STOP and BLUE SCREEN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't find for the moment how to fixe the video section in Skype !&nbsp; Otherwise i also have VIBER and VIBER works with all, audio, video calling, writing with no problems !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions is welcome.</p>

    <title>Once a movie has been saved, can it then be re-edited, or saved again - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swilly1969  say:</h3>
<h2>            Once a movie has been saved, can it then be re-edited, or saved again in a different format, i.e save one to computer and another burn to disk&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Once a movie has been saved, can it then be re-edited, or saved again in a different format, i.e save one to computer and another burn to disk?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've created the movie and, so I didn't lose what I'd already done, I decided to&nbsp;save it (which looks as thought it's going to take hours).&nbsp; However, I'm not sure it is absolutely complete, it might need a bit of tweeking.&nbsp; Will this be possible to do after
 it's finished saving?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've taken a video of a school play and a number of parents want copies, but in different formats.&nbsp; Some want it on a disc, others on a flash drive.&nbsp; I originally tried saving the original filming to disk but it was way too big a file and I read somewhere
 that it should be converted to a movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having created the movie, I don't want to have to re-do it each time I need to save it in a different format - it's taken hours to do as it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be greatly received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>There are two things that Movie Maker will save:</p>
<p>1) A <u>project</u> file - when you go to File &gt; Save, what you are saving is the
<u>project</u> file.&nbsp; The best analogy is to think of your project file as a <u>recipe</u>.&nbsp; It lists all the ingredients used (videos, photos, music) along with all the instructions on how to mix them together (trimming, splitting, order, effects applied,
 transitions applied, captions added, etc.)&nbsp; The project file lets you go back and make edits to the content, the order, captions, etc.&nbsp; You should always save your
<u>project</u> file.</p>
<p>2) A <u>movie</u> file - when you go to File &gt; Save Movie, what you are saving is the
<u>movie</u> file.&nbsp; Using our prior analogy, this is like <u>baking the cake</u>.&nbsp; Movie Maker pulls together all the ingredients from your hard disk, mixes them together as instructed and creates the finished
<u>movie</u>.&nbsp; As you have noticed, this process is time-intensive.&nbsp; It takes awhile for Movie Maker to encode all the video into a new .wmv file.</p>
<p>Okay, now that I got that out of the way, let me answer your questions:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Can a "movie" be re-edited?</strong>&nbsp; Yes, if you have your original
<u>project</u> file you can go back and modify the recipe.&nbsp; You can change the order of clips, add new ones, change transitions and captions, etc.&nbsp; When you like the new settings, you can either save the
<u>project</u> with a new name (so you have both versions) or just keep the latest version if you no longer need the first.&nbsp; Similarly, you can then save a
<u>movie</u> in your desired format.</p>
<p>b) <strong>Can a movie be saved in a different format?</strong>&nbsp; Yes, you can go back and choose to save your
<u>movie</u> with different settings.&nbsp; However, as you noticed, this always takes awhile because Movie Maker has to essentially start again with baking your cake.&nbsp; Think of it as wanting two cakes and each one has to bake separately.</p>
<p>c) <strong>Can you save a movie again after a bit of tweaking?</strong>&nbsp; Yes, if you are changing things in your
<u>project</u>, you can always decide at any point to create a <u>movie</u>.&nbsp; It takes time, but if after baking your cake, you can always go back, change the recipe a little and then bake a different version of your cake.&nbsp; As aways, this step of saving your
<u>movie</u> does take time.</p>
<p>d) <strong>Do I have to save my movie again each time to get different formats, extra copies?</strong>&nbsp; In general, the answer to this is "yes".&nbsp; If you want different versions of your final movie (some as a DVD, some as a low resolution movie on a flash
 drive, etc.) you would need to save it in each of these different formats.&nbsp; However, what you might try to do is to standardize on one format (say a good resolution .wmv file to your computer).&nbsp; You could then upload that movie to YouTube and just give people
 the link.&nbsp; Or you can use that same file and put it on a USB drive that people could view on their PC.&nbsp; Or you could use Windows DVD Maker to take that .wmv file and make it into a video DVD that could be watched via&nbsp;a standard DVD player.</p>
<p>You have a big heart to be doing this for others.&nbsp; I've done a lot of similar work with filming school activities and everyone loves to get a copy for their own purposes.&nbsp; But I don't think they always realize how much work it is to create say 30&nbsp;cakes,&nbsp;but
 slightly different for each person.</p>

<h2>            Indexing is not running.  Search works, if sluggishly.  Any ideas&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have Windows 7, and the search function works, if slowly, but the indexing isn't running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My C drive is set to allow files and contents to be indexed.</p>
<p>In the Indexing Options (where it says it is not running), there are no locations listed and&nbsp;the Modify button is grayed out.&nbsp; In the Advanced section, the Rebuild button can be pressed, but nothing happens.&nbsp; The File Settings are grayed out, and nothing
 is written in the Index Current Location.</p>
<p>I tried using the Advanced indexing help and&nbsp;the Fix-It program, but it wasn't able to fix the problem.&nbsp; The Indexing Service shows "started" and set to Automatic, as is the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service which indexing is dependant on.</p>
<p>Someone mentioned that the following:&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\WSearch&nbsp;&nbsp; value should say "embedding", but mine just has default set to "value not set", and start set to "2".</p>
<p>Also, someone mentioned that in&nbsp;the following:&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Search, SetupCompletedSuccessfully could be set from 1 to 0, then restart, but no help there.</p>
<p>Any ideas??</p>

I got so tired of indexing in both Vista and Windows 7 slowing down my notebook that I finally disabled it entirely and installed Agent Ransack for searching:<br />

<p>It's much faster than the native search, and is very configurable for custom searches.</p>
<p>I know it's not the real answer to your question, but if you decide to try something different, I would recommend it.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi jdlendon,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may use the search and indexing troubleshooter and check if it lists any issues -<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter</span></a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may perform a SFC (System File Checker) scan. It will list any issues and will also recover the files if needed –<br />
<strong>Follow the below steps to</strong> <strong>p</strong></span><strong><span>erform a SFC Scan</span></strong><span>&nbsp;-</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>,
 click&nbsp; <strong>All Programs</strong>, click &nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click&nbsp;
<strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;<strong>Allow</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>After
 the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists I would suggest you to create a new user account and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Create a new user account-<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you do not face the same issue in a new user account then you may refer the below link and use the steps provided to fix a corrupted user profile
 -<br />

<p>I&nbsp;ran the index and search troubleshooter and it says there isn't any problem with the Search, but the Indexing is not running and can slow down the Search ability, and it wasn't able to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the SFC program and it didn't find any integrity violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem persists on a new user account as well.</p>
<p>Any other ideas???</p>

<p><span>Hello, jdlendon</span></p>
<p><span>Try the following:</span></p>
<p><span>Go to Start, Control Panel, Uninstall a program, on the left click Turn Windows features on or off then uncheck the Windows search box. Press OK and restart the computer. Note: Indexing
 is handled by Windows Search, not the indexing service.</span></p>
<p><span>After restarting, follow the steps again, but recheck Windows Search and restart once more.</span></p>
<p><span>After&nbsp;restarting the second time,&nbsp;go to Start, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>indexing</strong> in the search box and click the Indexing Options item, click Advanced, then click
 Rebuild.</span></p>
<p><span>The search index should start to rebuild itself in the background and may take a bit before the index will be available.</span></p>

<p>Thank you David!&nbsp; This did the trick.&nbsp; Any idea why this occured in the first place?&nbsp; Anyway, I see a lot of people having this issue, and you're the first to mention this fix and to mention that indexing is handled by Windows Search.&nbsp; So, what is the indexing
 service you mention, and if its not part of Windows Search, then shouldn't it be named something else?&nbsp; Why doesn't the search and indexing troubleshooter offer this remedy??</p>
<p>But again, thanks!!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you are referring to “Taskbar” when you said “Toolbar”.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>If you are referring to “Taskbar” then you may follow these steps and check if that helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on <b>taskbar</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Properties</b></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>Uncheck <b>auto-hide taskbar</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now click on <b>
Apply</b> and <b>OK</b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove
 viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></b></a></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded.
 To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the
 scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.</span></p>

<p>It is a NAT issue if he is on your friends. To change your NAT &nbsp;type, you need to either get faster speeds, or you need to port forward your internet to xbox. Your router is most likely located at 192.168.1.1 :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the help guys, but I set a static ip to my computer, then port forwarded my router to xbox specifications, but still no dice. Any further help? Also, here's the statistics you asked for.</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in? - US, NH</p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number: </p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number: Belkin - F5D8236-4v1(01)</p>
<p>If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter? Internal adapter</p>
<p>Things you have tried: Port-forwarding, making a static ip for my computer</p>
<p>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown - Yes</p>

<p>Hey there Wrath! I'd still like to check on the NAT issue before going any further with settings. You should be able to edit the NAT setting through the router's control panel. I'm not able to find a product manual online for the router your listed above,
 but you could try contact Belkin support directly to see if they can help with that portion. I'd suggest your friend do the same for his/her router as well. Let us know if that helps at all, thanks!

<p>So I just got off a chat service with Belkin, and according to the agent, my NAT is fine, and I port forwarded correctly. I instructed my friend to do the same, he was also told he did so fine as well. We try to connect, no luck. Thanks for the help again,
 but it's frustratingly difficult to understand what's going on. Any more help would be incredibly helpful.</p>

<p>lilwrath, although the xbox might not show you on a strict or moderate NAT, it could still be blocking some ports keeping you from connecting to your friend.</p>
<p>If you can successfully connect to your friend by connecting yourself directly to the modem that would be confirmation.</p>
<p>Is your router one of the routers on this page?</p>

<h2>            NAT Strict on Belkin F5D8236-4 V2. Tried a Few things, still no better.</h2>
                    
<p>This is on a friend's Xbox and computer but I have resolved this issue before so I'm trying to help him.</p>
<p>I read some of the stickies and most of those things I have tried or I am unable to do them. I understand some things but I still am very novice level with this stuff.</p>
<p>Belkin router as listed. NAT strict. Dynamic IP. Comcast provider. Turning off the firewall resolves the NAT issue, although we don't want to run the system that way. I checked to see if UPnP is enabled, and it is. (does this mean I don't have to open up
 those ports?)</p>
<p>I also tried to manually assign an IP to the xbox and I get DNS errors when I try that.</p>
<p>I tried something that may not be a correct way to resolve the problem, but I went into the DMZ and tried to add that xbox IP to the enabled list. I get MTU errors when I try that route. (Dynamic IP why this doesn't work?)</p>
<p>On a Verizon router I was able to add an Xbox to the list of allowed devices and that resolved NAT issues for that system. Is there a way to do this with the Belkin system?</p>

<p>StalkerStang50, sorry to hear about your issue. &nbsp;Here is my suggestion for you to try. &nbsp;Since routers have a firewall to protect you from outsiders you need to set certain ports to listening mode. That means you need to open ports that Xbox Live Server requires.
 The ports are 53, 80, 88, and 3074. &nbsp;You can't use Port Range Forwarding since it will only set those ports into listening mode to the IP address you set it. So if you use Port Range Forwarding it will only be open/available to one console(the one using the
 IP address). Use Port Range Triggering. Disable Port Range Forwarding and the DMZ. Make sure UPnP is enabled. To solve the MTU problem set your MTU size to 1364. This settings will work even if you have one or multiple consoles running behind the router. Just
 remember that you need to make sure first that you have a good connection from your ISP (Internet Service Provider). Online gaming consumes a lot of bandwidth. So just couple things to do. Trigger the ports at the Port Range Triggering, set MTU to 1364 and
 make sure UPnP is enabled disable your DMZ. &nbsp;Try this and let me know if it works for you :) &nbsp;Thanks</p>

please ALWAYS turn off UPnP when doing either Port Forwarding (preferred, as it's easier on the router, which is about a dumb as a pocket calculator) or DMZ. You can do DMZ, Port Forwarding -OR- UPnP,
<strong>only one at a time.</strong></span></span></p>

</p><p>Drivers for your Toshiba, including Wi-Fi Drivers are supplied by Toshiba.</p>
<p>As you installed 8.1 instead of 10, did you check that Toshiba supplied 8.1 Drivers for satellite?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And we don't get involved in BIOS updates; that is between you and the Manufacturer as a mistake can make the machine inoperable.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen error and kernel stack inpage error</h2>
                    <p>(Note:&nbsp; This post has been created on behalf of another user.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently my PC had been having blue screen errors.&nbsp; Thinking it was likely an aging HD problem the HD was replaced and a new istallation of Win XP Home Edition with SP2.&nbsp; The blue screens still persist despite the new drive.<br />
<br />
The error is a "Kernel Stack Inpage Error".&nbsp; <br />
<br />
This is a new drive with the same errors as before so I suspect that it is not a virus and likely an issue with another piece of hardware.&nbsp; There is a minidump file available if need be.<br />
<br />
Can someone please assist with these errors?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Also, here is some general info on troubleshooting&nbsp; the KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR error:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315266/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315266/en-us</a></p>
<p>The first line of troubleshooting is to install the latest Service Pack.</p>
<p>That avoids problems such as<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this</a> one, which may not apply in your situation but gives a good example of why keeping current with service packs helps avoid problems.</p>
<p>I realize you have had issues with SP3 but consider trying it again.</p>
<p>Also, did you replace the drive cable as asked by Joselbarra?</p>
<p>Also, Roxio drivers are appearing "unloaded" in all the minidump files which may indicate a problem with that software so try uninstalling all Roxio software and see if it helps.</p>
<p>Also, it is generally recommended to run only one real-time antivirus application to avoid conflicts so consider going with either MSE or Norton. MSE may be preferable as it installs a minimum number of drivers.</p>
<p>Also, if problems persist consider updating the BIOS as you appear to be at an older revision, 1008, while the latest non-beta is 1017.</p>

            If you would get BSV and run it and then choose:<br />
<br />
Options, Lower Pane Mode, All Drivers<br />
<br />
You will be on your way and see the stack and your ATI drivers.<br />
<br />
Microsoft updates come out the second Tuesday of every month (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Patch Tuesday</a>) so that would be 07/12 but since you have SP2, I can't tell what would happen or what updates you decided to
 install.&nbsp; If you accepted the MS recommendations for video drivers (which are usually wrong), who knows what is going on.<br />

<h2>            Trying to fix Toshiba laptop with missing or corrupt file &#92;WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM32&#92;CONFIG&#92;SYSTEM and no cd-rom&#33; Need Help PLEASE&#33;</h2>
                    When I try to start my Laptop, a Toshiba Satellite M45-S265, it comes up with the following message: Windows couls not start because the following is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM. The CD-ROM drive also does not work. Therefore, I
 cannot just insert the reboot disc and fix it. Is there any way to fix this problem without the CD-ROM drive working? It will not start in any mode, normal or safe. The software is (was, if it it's not deleted) Windows XP Home Edition. It is a legal version
 and it was registered through microsoft. I have had the computer for over three years and now all of the sudden this. I am not too computer savy, but am a really fast learner, so nothing TOO indepth please. Thanks, I really appreciate it!<br />
<br />

            I'm sorry but you will need a working optical drive or, if the BIOS allows for booting from USB devices, an external optical drive.<br />
<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).

<p>It looks like you've already set up Windows Hello an another account.&nbsp; Remove face recognition from your other account and then try again.</p>

We appreciate the information that you have provided. Since you were able to plug in your previous phone on your PC, we will need to isolate the issue further. Kindly verify if you have you tried to plug in your mobile phone on a different computer? If so,
 are you able to see the photos?<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your response.

            We appreciate the update that you have provided, Brenda. Since we're able to isolate the issue that the issue occurs not only just to your computer, we recommend that you contact the support of the manufacturer of your phone. This is for them to verify
 if the settings of the phone are correct or if there's anything else you need to do so that your mobile phone will be detected completely by a computer.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you have further queries.
