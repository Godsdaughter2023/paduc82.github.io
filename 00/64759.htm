<h2>            Xbox &#40;Beta&#41; App games won&#39;t Launch&#47;Crash Fix&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have tried everything to get the games in this new app to either run or to keep from crashing and nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried resetting the Microsoft store,&nbsp; Reinstalling the new Xbox (Beta) App and I've also updated windows to it's latest version as of this morning 6/12/2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that going into the apps settings and turning on (Offline Permissions) Fixed all the problems and now lets me play ALL the games in the app.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>

            I also wonder if it's a bug you found in the app since it's in beta. Might not be a bad idea to submit your issue via the feedback tool.&nbsp;

<p>I get this when trying to launch any game through the BETA App...thing is, I was just playing the game 30 minutes ago before if got stuck in an infinite loading screen and I did a full restart. I have went as far as uninstalling and reinstalling the game
 (losing 5 hours of progression in the process). However, EVERY game I have installed gives me this error now.&nbsp;https://imgur.com/TyVLH0N
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: On checking the "Games I own" section..none of the games appear. The drive they are on is where all my other games are (Steam, Origin, GOG, etc) yet, the BETA App doesnt' see them for some reason. They are on the left tab, but do not appear as though
 I own them.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Desktop background not fitting on screen but resolution is set - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop background not  fitting on screen but resolution is set correctly.</h2>
                    My desktop and background have become zoomed and cut off at the top. They fit correctly before. The screen resolution settings are correct for my monitor size (1680 x 1050) but this is still the case. The icons were larger also. I set them to the correct
 size by changing the icon size, but cannot get the backgroud back to normal. I check through my windows settings and NVIDIA control panel and found nothing to assist. My young son sometimes gets his paws on my keyboard and may have cnaged a setting unbeknown
 to me. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.

            Thanks for the reply. The last time I was able to purchase points with a payment method was a few weeks ago, maybe a month. I changed my WLID one time, probably around six months ago at this point.

<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 and an Epson Projector. I used to be able to project with the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter (Model 1733), but now it doesn't work. It worked a total of 3 times. Microsoft technical reps troubleshoot the problem and said they could
 fix it after I pay up, so I sign up for the annual tech support for $199.&nbsp; After 8 hours of updating&nbsp;drivers, troubleshooting/etc (2 hours included fixing something else they broke in the process). They eventually told me to take the device to the retailer
 as they couldn't figure out what the problem was. I then take it to Best Buy Geek Squad and they try to get it to connect to one of their monitors and once again, get the error that it cannot connect. The projector and Best-Buy's monitor recognize my computer
 and try to connect, it just never will.&nbsp; I then purchase another wireless adapter (since I read from reviews others went hot/stopped working), but that still didn't fix the problem so I had to mail the adapter back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From all the reviews, it's clear this is a huge problem.&nbsp; I feel Microsoft should stop advertising this feature if so many people either can't project or can't get Microsoft to fix the issue with it projecting. On a positive note, they gave me the $199 back,
 but I purchased my Surface Pro 3 for $999 and an extra $40+ for the adapter, not to mention the extra cost of the keyboard.&nbsp; I really wanted to purchase the Surface Pro 4, but this projecting issue is a show stopper for me.&nbsp; It'd be different if I was the
 only one with the problem, but when you research Microsoft's Wireless Display Adapter, you'll find that many others are having the same problem and have received little support from Microsoft on resolving the issue, as have I.</p>

            <p>I Google Drive Microsoft Online Chat Support &amp; was directed to a 24/7 page that enabled me to allow Microsoft technical representatives to remote into my computer to troubleshoot and make changes. The original cost was $249, but I told them I was military
 &amp; the rep got approval to knock it down to $199. I signed the agreement &amp; the rep began to make changes to my computer (prior to making the payment, he removed in and after assessing, said that he could fix it). During that 8 hour period, 3 different agents
 (Agent 6, 8, 10) tried to resolve the issue but couldn't. During that period, they accidentally deleted the components of my computer that make it WiFi compatible so for two of those hours, I had to use the 24/7 chat on my cell phone and physically connect
 my cell to my computer so that they could fix the WiFi issue &amp; continue troubleshooting my computer. I started the initial chat/troubleshooting at 7pm on 15 Jan &amp; they eventually gave up and said they couldn't fix it after 3 am the next day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During troubleshooting, they attempted at least 20 times to connect. Projector tried but always ended with msg stating couldnt connect. They tried removing the adapter from list of devices, adding it back. They searched for newer drivers even though my computer
 said I had the latest driver. Moreover, the computer said the adapter was working properly. They tried a bunch of other Microsoft computer updates (different from the automatic ones we get). They eventually deleted the entire wireless capability of my computer
 &amp; gave me instructions to add it back which didn't work &amp; also left me with a toll free number to call if I needed assistance adding it back but every time I called no one answered &amp; the call would eventually drop, which led me to my final option, to tether
 my cell phone to the computer which after over 20 attempts by the agent to remote back in, it finally worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At Best Buy, they attempted to connect my Surface Pro 3 wirelessly to one of their monitors and like at home, the monitor detected my computer &amp; tried to connect, but eventually got a message stating it could not connect. Mind you, there are no error messages
 in the Device Manager, the drivers are up to date, and when you select the device on my computer, it says it's working properly. Bluetooth is activated and computer has all necessary updates. I'd previously tried removing and adding back the Intel display
 in the device manager as recommended by others &amp; with this issue, but that didn't work either.&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you. That's the site I went to. When they tried to rush me through the contract, I told them to stop and let me take the time to read it which I did.&nbsp;No where on the contract did it mention Microsoft (I just caught that); I thought Tech Experts LLC
 was a subset of Microsoft - the name they use for their tech support. I'll do exactly what you said.&nbsp; Thanks again.

            <p>So, I refreshed my computer back to factory default and the wireless adapter started working again. &nbsp;I'm afraid to do all the updates now as I might loose the capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded my internet security (Bitdefender) and the wireless adapter stopped working again. After lots of troubleshooting, I finally go into my firewall and I pay attention to what happens when I try to connect to my projector. I noticed that whenever
 I try to connect, the firewall section of my security software identifies the adapter (mine says Local Area Connection * 4) I noticed that the setting on that one is set to "public" so I change it to "trusted" and then the projector immediately connected.</p>

            I've been trying since yesterday and it's stuck in "checking for updates". I know it should take a long time, but I've let it run like this for over 3 hours &amp; it just continues to keep checking - no error messages or anything. I've set my computer to never
 sleep so it can just do its job. Let me know if you know how to fix that. In the meantime, I'll keep troubleshooting it.

            Yes, I've tried that as well as running the trouble shooter &amp; some other steps. The troublessing shooter always says it found &amp; fix problems, but if I run the troubleshooter again and again, it keeps saying it found and fixed the same problems over &amp; never
 completely fixes them.

            <p>I tried Method 1, and it wasn't able to solve the problem, it found the problem though, and this was written&nbsp;Windows stopped the device, because windows detected a problem (Kode 43)<br />
<br />
A request for the USB device descriptor failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 always works for me, but only for a certain amount of time, when i restart my computer my mouse works perfectly fine, and i would browse the internet, and watch some stream, but when i open a game or a client. For example the League Of Legends client,
 if i open that my computer would stop recoginizing my mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched for the problem, and i even tried unplugging the battery from my laptop for about 15 minutes, and it didn't resolve it, and i have updated everything i could update.</p>

            UPDATE: Mouse wont get recognized at all now, it would only get recoginized if i was lucky while uninstalling the mouse, and plugging it in multiple times, i have tried searching the internet for everything, and my mouse just doesn't work, luckily i can
 use my touchpad. If you have any other suggestions i would appreciate it. I even tried downgrading to Windows 8.1 and the same thing happened, and now im back at windows 10.

            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us updated on this query. We apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Code 43: Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. This circumstances can occur if the device hardware fails or if the device driver fails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><strong><span>B</span></strong>oot the computer in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>, and check if the issue persist in safe mode.</p>
<p>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the power button on the sign-in screen to <strong>
Shift + Restart</strong>. This will take you to the recovery boot menu. </p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, select
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, and click on <strong>Startup settings</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You then see a list where you can choose&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(depending on whether you think you’ll need the Internet).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To know more about <strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>
Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode) </strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>If your computer works fine in safe mode, perform clean boot</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><strong><span>T</span></strong>o perform
<strong>Clean boot</strong>.</p>
<p>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Following is a link to perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: </span>Start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</span></strong>from the link above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!<br />

<p><span><span>Bluescreen errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow
 the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.</span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other options and explanations of bluescreen errors.&nbsp; What we really need now is the EXACT and ENTIRE text of the bluescreen message - just copy it down and post it in a reply.&nbsp; If the system shuts down
 too fast to copy the message, go to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Advanced / Startup and Recover / and uncheck the box to Automatically Restart.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and
 select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will freeze the program on the bluescreen so you have time to copy the information.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Can you boot into Safe Mode with networking?<span>&nbsp;</span>Skip
 any steps here or above that require you to be able to boot normally if you can’t stay or get booted (and the same for safe mode if that’s the case there as well).<span>&nbsp;</span>Post back when you’ve done whatever you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also use Skydrive</span></span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dump and text files related to the error (as you discover them throughout this and the above processes) which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control Panel
 / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span>oot into Safe mode with networking and see if
 the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going to start /
 search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click
 on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft
 Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>You
 may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible (assuming that is the cause):</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

            <p>Hello Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe you would do better posting you question in the MS Word forum: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/word">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/word</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you are trying to locate the Word application itself then you should be looking for Winword.exe which should be in "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14"</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 8 so my winword is located in "c:\program files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14"</p>
<p>If you can't locate it in Program Files check to see if you have a Program File (x86) folder and look there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello TomB1395,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Appdata files are hidden from view to stock users inadvertently deleting them. Go to the Folder options in control panel. In the folder options window, click the View tab. Look down the list of options until you see 'show hidden files and folders'. Place
 a checkmark (Tick) in the box and then press the Apply button. The AppData files should now be visible.</p>

<p>Hello Winner,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. You can use can of compressed air to spray in through where the fans are. Personally I have used compressed air on my console. However we cant recommend places to take it to get it serviced except Microsoft.
 If there is a Microsoft store near you, you can call them or visit and ask them. If is not recommended to open the console, as it may cause damage to internal components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            Hi,
<div>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community Forums.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>2. Does the issue persists with every game?</div>
<div>3. What is the make and model of the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows 8 comes with DirectX 11 already installed. It should not need any installing, but it might need repairing.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Run the System File Checker (SFC) scan. Follow these steps:<br />
a. Boot to the desktop view.<br />
b. Press Windows key + X <br />
c. Select command prompt (admin).<br />
d. Type sfc /scannow and then press ENTER: <br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>Uninstall the game or software program and then reinstall it again. Something might have happened to the files in the program that work with microsoft.directx.direct3d.dll and a reinstall could help.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>Updating the drivers for the video card in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.<br />
Steps:<br />
a. Press Windows key + X and select Device Manager.<br />
b. Double click Display adapter and right click on the device available and select Update Driver Software.<br />
c. Follow the prompted steps to complete updating the drivers.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps. </div>

    <title>Windows 7 is hanging and deleting restore points on my Toshiba laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadowfaxw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 is hanging and deleting restore points on my Toshiba laptop</h2>
                    To whom it may concern,<br />
<br />
I own a Toshiba Satellite L300-1G5 system unit laptop which has 2GB ram and 160GB hard drive . I purchased it in May of 2009 and it came preloaded with Vista. From the moment it arrived in my hands, it was working fast and efficiently. It is a European computer,
 which means it has a European keypad but that shouldn’t be the cause for the problems I started having then and the ones I am having now.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
In November 2009, my laptop suddenly just shut itself off. I tried to turn it back on only to read a message, this software is not properly installed. I took my laptop to a technician and he said the hard drive contained no viruses/spy ware/or malware but it
 would have to be wiped because Vista had toasted my machine. So be it. It was wiped.<br />
<br />
My father purchased the newly released retail Windows 7 Home Premium and Microsoft Office 2007 and the technicians installed these on the newly wiped drive. Upon getting my computer back, I preceded to copy my former laptop’s photos and music on my external
 hard drive to my Toshiba. The music was ripped from Cds I own and the mp3’s were iTunes downloads. I downloaded Adobe Acrobat, Skype, Windows Live Messenger, CC Registry cleaner and Firefox. Windows 7 would freeze every time Firefox opened. So I deleted Firefox
 and installed Opera. I must have had a bad download of Opera because it would not allow itself to be uninstalled from my system. I used Chrome then for awhile and it was fast until everything I opened, whether it be internet browset, start menu, control panel,
 etc. took about 3-5 minutes to open and while it was loading it said “Window not responding.”
<br />
<br />
I took the laptop to another technician and she could not get the computer to do anything for her. So she wiped the hard drive for the second time. Upon reinstalling Windows 7 32bit (the original one), she created restore points when she put&nbsp; Office 2007 on
 as well as created a restore disc. Sounded good to me. I was very wary with my computer this go round and was told to avoid registry cleaners. The only programs I put on there are the ones I used the most: Skype and Kaspersky Antivirus.&nbsp; I did not upload my
 photos. I only put 1/3 of my music on there. The laptop began to hang again, even with no downloads of internet browsers. The bigger issue was the computer was set to create restore points each time I put on a new program. I went to system restore and my restore
 points were gone. I inserted the restore disc which again reiterated that something with the software had deleted my restore points without notice.
<br />
<br />
I have been so frustrated with this laptop, once the fastest machine I ever owned has now slowed to a crawl. Is it because of Windows 7 not being compatible with a program? I don’t know. But I do know that I have spent more time and money trying to get it to
 work since Vista crashed it in November than I have spent enjoying myself on it. I’m a laptop nerd, one whom can always be seen with my machine, but lately, I have avoided it because of the problem it’s having.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
Frustratedly yours,<br />

<p>Because it's fine after a fresh install, I'm thinking it may be an issue with software you are installation: most likely antivirus software that is not optimized for Windows 7.&nbsp; Or, it could be malware that gets into your system.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I would wipe it again, install Microsoft Security Essentials before you begin copying any data back to the computer, so that if there is malware, it will be detected and cleaned instead of slowing your system.<br />
<br />
PS... Always stay away from 'RAM Cleaners' and 'Registry Cleaners'.&nbsp; Windows Vista and 7 have many technologies built in to speed up your system, and these types of software cause significant performance issues.&nbsp; Let windows do it by itself, and you'll be happier.<br />

            After the second fresh install and before downloading Skype and installing Kaspersky, my restore points vanished. Explain that to me, Mr. Wizard.

            There's many possible reasons:&nbsp; Restore points are automatically erased when automatic maintenance runs, plus anytime disk space is low.&nbsp; Additionally, when you restoring your computer, you have to check the box called 'Show more restore points' to see
 all available ones.<br />
<br />
However, missing restore points are not the root cause of your issue (losing a restore point can't cause a problem).&nbsp; I think it's best to treat the cause, not the symptom, of the issue.<br />

            Windows 7 has never worked right since it was first downloaded onto my Toshiba. Along with deleting the restore points, everything had slowed down. Another thing that bugs me is that whenever I pressed CTRL-ALT-Delete when my computer would freeze, it
 took 15 minutes for the Task Manager window to appear. That's unacceptable. <br />
<br />
I've never had low disk space and shouldn't have it when all I have put on there is an operating system, Skype, and an antivirus program. I would create restore points, do a bit of work, shut my computer down for the night, and after reboot, my restore points
 are gone. And I would like to know why. List for me the possible reasons why this could be happening on a freshly wiped machine.

            I ran the Windows 7 Uograde and it showed that everything in my system in compatible with the OS. The sluggishness I am experiencing now and it happens after I've had the computer on for about 10-15 minutes. I will go to the start menu, click on control
 panel, wait 3 minutes, control panel loads, click on security, wait 3 minutes for the screen to load. If I click on the pages while they're loading, the pages turn opaque white and I get the not responding message.<br />
<br />
I have activated Windows, the computer is updated both in Windows and Kaspersky.<br />
<br />
Also, when my computer goes in to standby, I try to bring it out of standby only to come to the blue screen of death. I then shut it down manually and it restarts fine. However, I have just let the machine restart itself without my pushing any hardware buttons
 and on restart, it wants to do a disk-check though it was shut down properly.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help so far.

            That sluggishness and opaque white 'Not Responding' is certainly troubling.&nbsp; There's got to be a huge bottleneck of something causing a lot of drive reads, but figuring out what might be hard.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, indexers or even antivirus scans can cause that kind of performance, but Windows and most programs calm down when the computer isn't idle.<br />
<br />
I'd bet that even when you aren't running any apps, your hard drive is probably going nuts reading/writing something, but what is the question.&nbsp; And certainly the control panel shouldn't be that slow, it's practically just html links these days.&nbsp; Your system
 specs are great.&nbsp; Honestly you should a super fast machine, it should have gotten better going from Vista to 7, not worse.<br />
<br />
How full is your system drive?&nbsp; Does it have at least about 10% free space?&nbsp; That could cause this behavior, but usually not until the drive is at 5% or less free.<br />
<br />
I don't like to, but maybe it's Kaspersky?&nbsp; Maybe try uninstalling it and rebooting, just play with it for a little bit and see, I'm sure you'd know if that fixed it within 20 minutes.&nbsp; I'm surprised no one else has chimed in here yet.<br />

            I've just deleted all of my music from the hard drive. I have it on an external, but the external drive was on Vista. It seemed to speed up a bit after doing that, but it was only 6 gigs worth of music--not big at all in today's world.<br />
<br />
On the hard disk, I have 135 Gig free.

            Computer started working fine after updating Kaspersky and activating Windows<br />
<br />
So I download Windows Live Essentials from the Microsoft webpage<br />
It installs to 60% and then my window disappears just to reveal a desktop background<br />
without desktop icons. Ok..then a Kasperky window pops up which says License<br />
notification, but it has a blank black box that extends vertically past the<br />
screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
I press CTRL-ALT-Delete which brings up a black screen with error message:<br />
Failure to Display security and shut down options: The logon process was unable to
<br />
display security and logon options when CTRL-ALt-Delete was pressed. If the operating<br />
system does not respond, press ESC or restart the computer by using the power switch.<br />
<br />
<br />
And it's been working fine for a few hours. It says on the site Microsoft Live<br />
Essentials is compatibile with Windows 7. <br />
<br />
I hate technology.

            And another thing to add. I will get to the main desktop screen and attempt to have the computer shut itself off over manual shutdown. It stays on the "Logging Off" screen for about 5 minutes. seriously unacceptable. Also you know when Windows 7 is running,
 on the desktop, when the mouse icon runs over the start icon, the icon itself sparkles a bit? When my comp loads up this evening after the first screw-up today, it boots quickly to the desktop and then it tries to connect to the wireless network and as windows
 7 tries to figure out whatever it's doing, it freezes my desktop meaning no icons move/what not when the mouse runs over them..hence, i can't click on anything.<br />

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are no such apps in Windows 8 for you to record videos. There should be other software/apps out there that has that functionality. There is, however, a way for you to record your actions and a screenshot on what you're doing on your Windows 8 device.
<span><strong>Steps Recorder </strong>is mostly used for us to record actions being done by our customers before an issue happens. This way we can have a better idea on what is happening on their end before the issue gets triggered. Here's an

            Thank you for your reply, but your suggestions did not fit my problem.&nbsp; I have no problem with my internet connections and I never received any Microsoft Software license terms for the two updates.&nbsp; They would download and then try to install and then
 fail.&nbsp; This process would continue several times a day (since Windows 10 removed the "ignore" option for Windows Updates).&nbsp; I did find the solution on my own.&nbsp; For some odd reason I had two Unknown Devices listed under my printers within the Device Manager.&nbsp;
 Once I removed the two devices the updates went away.

            <p>I would like to report that I have the exact same problem that this user reported, also with released Windows 10. Like that user, I have no problem with my internet or licenses so the provided answer is nonsensical. The error repeats over and over.&nbsp; Please
 help us get rid of it.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            You are a genius, M Crocker.&nbsp; I have been trying to get rid of this problem since installing Windows 10 and somehow never managed to find this post despite googling the issue multiple times.&nbsp; In any event, I discovered I also have two "unknown devices"
 in the Printers area of Device manager!&nbsp; Thank for you providing a real answer to the problem.&nbsp; As well meaning as the Microsoft answers I have seen are, they have all been completely off base, whereas THIS solves the problem.&nbsp; Thank you.

            There is nothing you can do until future upgrades resolve the issue (if they ever will). I also note that your 60 GByte hard disk is extremely tight for Windows 10. You will be perpetually struggling to find enough free space. 200 GBytes is a bare minimum,
 500 GBytes is good.

<p>In addition to Frederik Long's accurate observation about the size of your hard drive, Acer doesn't supply Windows 10 drivers for this model (see
<a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/ID/content/support-product/3959;-;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.acer.com/ac/en/ID/content/support-product/3959;-;</a>), so you may have some issues if you do upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; It's possible that the "Windows 8 upgrade from Windows 7" drivers might work if some of the hardware does not function with the
 "in box" drivers included with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, although this model has difficulty using the "upgrade" path to get to Windows 10, you can clean install Windows 10.&nbsp; See the post from

<p>There were some disk errors I suppose, which was fixed by Windows Vista.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried to do Start up repair, but it failed to fix anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even seen, those solutions, which asks me to remove all devices, but since Vista is running, none of my connected devices are malfunctioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to recover my files and would be awesome if could get my OS back, without re-installation and updating.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Windows 10 Version 1511 disc worked.&nbsp;I&nbsp;did start up repair, and it was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I also removed Windows 10 entry from boot manager first and created another entry, via EasyBCD. This step may help, if using disc doesn't help.</p>
<p>

<h2>            game not working properly</h2>
                    ive been playing a game for 2 yrs now.. i recently&nbsp; bought a new pc, installed the game, worked fine, a month later the gme messes up.. it runs very slow, so slow that i cannot&nbsp; play, i have ran&nbsp; several tests with the help of&nbsp; HP,they say my pc is fine..
 my isp came out and checked modem and lines.no problem there either, HP is trying to tell me&nbsp; my pc&nbsp; isnt compatible with the system requirements for the game.. and it is. i have an older lell that the game works fine on.. can someone&nbsp; give me a clue as to
 what the problem could be please..<br />
<br />
i have a HP pavilion p6320f, processor amd phenom 820 quad core 2.8 ghz, nvidia geforce9100 256 integrated memory, running windows 7 home premium
<br />
im having problems with any game that seems to have alot of graphics, worked fine the first 1 1/2 months i had the pc&nbsp; now&nbsp;&nbsp; just wont work.working fine on my older dell which is not as strong as the HP, the main game having issues with is perfect world international.<br />
thank you ahead for your&nbsp; help

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While the game hangs, does it display any error message?<br />

<strong>Alter the hardware acceleration and check if it helps:</strong> <br />
It is a good idea to turn off the computer’s hardware acceleration. Not all drivers support disabling hardware acceleration. To disable hardware acceleration<br />
on your computer, perform the following steps:<br />
1. Click Start, select Control Panel, click Appearance and Personalization, click Personalization, click Display Settings, and then click Advanced Settings.<br />
2. Click the Troubleshoot tab, and then click Change Settings.<br />
Note: Change Settings will be disabled if the graphics card drivers do not support disabling hardware acceleration.<br />
3. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of none. This is the basic acceleration setting.<br />
4. Click OK twice, and then close the window.<br />

            hello. my card does not support&nbsp; acceleration i dont guess i cant click on it i went to&nbsp; the links u provided and nothing is helping..HP&nbsp; says my card dosent meet requirements for the game but it does it worked just fine&nbsp; the first&nbsp; month and a half ive
 had it it just started all of a sudden i even downloaded&nbsp; 2 other games to see if it done the same thing. and it does seems any game that has high graphics it does it to i&nbsp;&nbsp; am wondering if there is some settings&nbsp;&nbsp; messed up somewhere in the pc? i even went
 as far as taking pc to friends house and using their net and it still does same thing. i also have a dell that is older than this one and its working fine on the dell
