<h2>            More FPS Lag in games after a format</h2>
                    <p>After updating to Windows 10 from Windows 8, I noticed a significant boost in my FPS while playing games.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in Windows 8, with the graphic settings on the minimum, I ran Grand Theft Auto V at around 20 FPS. Then in Windows 10, I was able to play the game on High graphic settings at around 30-45 FPS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However (for reasons) I had to format, or "Reset" my computer. I chose the "Remove Everything" option, which wiped my hard drive and reinstalled Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the format, my computer's performance has regressed to how it was in Windows 8 (a significant drop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure at all, and this is purely a guess, but I'm assuming the initial boost was due to the access to DX12 and maybe the format has disabled this feature or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What can I do to go back to how well my computer performed previously (Windows 10 before the format)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>method 1:</p>
<p>Tried it, told me that there were no updates to be had</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Restarted computer in "Clean Boot" exactly like the instructions told me. This mode has not boosted my performance at all, or if it has, it's made an unnoticeable difference. I tried following to instructions to revert back to the "Normal Boot" but "msconfig"
 does not appear in my search bar while in the "Clean Boot". Am I stuck in this mode? because I really would like to get out of it and go back to the regular mode.</p>

            <p>I've never used Grand Theft Auto V, but with your mention of a drop of FPS which I have also faced with FSX, I sense your bewilderment as to the reason for this. &nbsp; In the case of FSX and if I were to experience an untoward drop in frames given a new install
 of Win10, I would tackle it this way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp; Do the usual check of the drive (sfc /scannow, or any other in depth disk checker).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp; Download, say, Advanced System Care, do a scan of everything, cleaning up the disk and Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp; Using that tool, activate Driver Booster. &nbsp;It will scan your hardware for obsolete drivers and automatically find, download and install them for you. &nbsp; If I have several drivers out of date, I apply the fix for one driver at a time, rebooting the computer
 after each install. &nbsp; Critical drivers for your processor, mobo, graphics card, will be important in your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp; With ASC, you can also use its turbo boost to shut down unnecessary programs - this will also free up some Ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. &nbsp; If you're satisfied with the above and confirm that your copy of the game is complete, without duplicate entries or misconfigured configuration files, then I would attend to the game itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. &nbsp; Start the game and go into a scenario that clearly causes you this frame loss. &nbsp; Can you play in windowed mode? Then also open up task manager (right click on windows taskbar and select it). &nbsp; Keep it there &amp; minimized. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. &nbsp; With the game running and when the frames drop or fluctuate wildly, open up task manager and find out if there is a process or app that is hogging your cpu cycles. &nbsp; Your focus would be on CPU and Disk activity. &nbsp; Apart from Task Manager and System
 required activities, I would either wait for the other tasks to complete, shut them down, or find out why they continue to run. &nbsp; You may find some of the Win10 apps have a habit of poking their nose in now and then!</p>
<p>
</p><p>See how you go. &nbsp; Sorry if the above is too simplistic - &nbsp;don't know at what stage you're at.</p>
<p>

            I think our posts have become confused. &nbsp; It was wildandzesty with the problem - I was trying to provide some solutions to him/her. &nbsp; My FSX is the 'older DVD version', and am doing well with it. &nbsp; Thanks for the enquiry &amp; hope that zesty has sorted out

            If you hide Internet Explorer 9, it will not present itself to be installed, you will have to manually do that yourself. Updates that require Internet Explorer 9 will not be presented to you, because "IE 9" is not installed on your system. There might
 be combo updates that work for both IE 8 and IE 9 though, such as a patch or fix that works across both versions of the web browser.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One Crash - Wiped Hard Drive</h2>
                    
<p>Wondering if anyone else has had this problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week I was playing AC4 Black flag multiplayer, however the console crashed on the loading screen.&nbsp; My friend managed to get into the game but I was still at the loading screen.&nbsp; He said he could see me but I wasn't moving obvisously...</p>
<p>I press the Xbox button to go back to the Home scren, nothing would work on the controller, couldn't navigate...&nbsp; Occaisonally I would hear noises from AC4...&nbsp; Therefore turned it off by holding the power button...&nbsp; It took longer than usual to power off
 with a slight buzzing noise coming from the top of the xbox not the Drive bay...</p>
<p>Turned it back on and could only get as far as the green xbox screen and then turned to a black screen...&nbsp; Managed to get on Xbox support and someone managed to get it working again by holding the power button and eject button for 5 seconds.&nbsp; Which tells
 the xbox to boot into low resolution mode...&nbsp; Anyway it worked again great!</p>
<p>Last night I was playing multiplayer AC4 with my mate, and the above happened again...&nbsp; However this time after a while I managed to turn the console off via the Kinect, although it did take a while for it to recognise what I was saying...&nbsp; Again the console
 took longer to eventually turn off with the same buzzing noise as above...</p>
<p>This time when I turned it back on, it got pass the green screen and black and onto the Xbox one home screen... Hooray!&nbsp; However this time it had completely wiped my hard drive...&nbsp; I had to re-sign back in and re-install all my games...&nbsp; Luckily the save
 game for AC4 is saved in the cloud although I don't think it will be the same for Dead Rising 3...</p>
<p>Why did it wipe my hard drive?</p>

            <p>Yes, that's where they are, but most of us are used to seeing a print dialogue box which lets us choose (through file manager) the location to store each print event.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1. Annoying that Windows 10 has been simplified to print and file in one button press, and 2. Annoyed that Microsoft has "dumbed down" the app to prevent users from modifying the location, either by document or by default.

            I can't believe that nobody from Microsoft Support can answer this question satisfactorily! I remember seeing a screen under Settings that points to Documents folder in 'This PC' as the default destination location. But right now for the life of me, I
 can't recollect how to get back to that screen. Hope someone will discover and post the solution.

            <p>I just played with this.&nbsp; In other applications, Microsoft Print to PDF presents a window to choose file name and location.&nbsp; In Edge, it plonks it in "Documents" and I have no control over the file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the setting you were looking for Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; "New documents will be saved to"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I suggest that you open File Explorer, right click on Documents and choose Properties.&nbsp; In the Location tab, is the location where you would expect?&nbsp; Mine is c:\users\xxx\documents</p>

            <p>Hello ChemicalKicks, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a known issue with inline images&nbsp;in messages recieved from Gmail&nbsp;accounts that use&nbsp;Exchange ActiveSync to sync email, contacts, and calendar items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using you Gmail account for contacts in the People app or&nbsp;calendars in the Calendar app, You may be able to address this issue by removing this account and adding it in again as an IMAP account from Settings -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Add an Account -&gt;
 Other account -&gt; IMAP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<h2>            Audio issue with Razer Chimaera 5.1</h2>
                    
<p>So I've tried looking up my problem with Google but found out nothing as well as calling Razer and they weren't really any help either so hopefully someone here can give me some advice.</p>
<p>I purchased a Razer Chimaera 5.1 headset a little over a year and half ago. I love this headset it sounds and looks great but lately the volume on the headset will automatically turn itself down all the way. &nbsp;I'll turn the volume back up but then it just
 decreases again almost immediately. &nbsp;I'm not sure if it is a problem with the cables or something internally. &nbsp;I am using all of the original cables as well as the batteries, and I have even tried replacing the batteries temporarily with regular triple A's.
 &nbsp;So if anyone has any advice please please let me know, I would love to keep using this headset for as long as I can! &nbsp;Thank you!</p>

<h2>            My external monitor DELL doesn&#39;t works well with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody, I bought&nbsp;a laptop Lenovo Y40-80, with AMD Radeon grpahics, and it coming with Windows 8.1, but I actualize recently to Windows 10, and I work usually with two monitors. But when I actualize my Windows, the external monitor start with problems
 when I tried to move&nbsp;a window over there (I work with extended desk). When I move a Windows, it start to turn off/on a lot of times, and it stopped when i return back the window to the&nbsp;main monitor of my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything, I probe with other external monitor, with other vga cable, inclusive we bought a HDMI/VGA cable to could connect the external monitor to the laptop, but anything works. I tried to actualize the drivers off my pc, but all of them are the
 latest versión, and i don't know wetheaver else to do</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how I can solve it? Is a problem of software, hardware or a incompatibility between Windows 10 and my video card, or with de monitor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Monitor is a LCD DELL 22", only with VGA enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Need to re-establish full access to local Windows account after - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need to re-establish full access to local Windows account after deletion of</h2>
                    <div>
<div>I've been struggling for nearly two weeks, communicating directly with MS support and participating on community threads dealing with
<i>approximately </i>the same issue. I'm hoping that starting my own thread will solve a problem that seems like it shouldn't be hard to fix.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's what's going on:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I created a local Windows account a year ago using the same email as my MS Live account.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>I deleted the MS Live account recently, not realizing it would have local implications.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>I still can log on locally. But, when I attempt to connect to my Skydrive or change some local settings, the machine asks me to verify an account that no longer exists.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>Among the things my machine will no longer let me do (even though I AM able to sign on locally as an administrator):<br />
<ul>
<li>Change the user name on my local Windows account.</li><li>Associate my local Windows account with the MS Live account that does exist.</li><li>Change the user name associated with my Skydrive so that I may access it.</li><li>Create a second admin account.</li></ul>
I need somehow to convince my local machine that I have the authority to make the changes that will restore access to my machine.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm hoping someone out there know how to do this. Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

</blockquote>
<br />
<div>
<p><span>I have regained control of my machine!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I received this morning an email from MS support telling me that my previously used email was not available because it had been registered with the Windows Live Admin Center.
 I linked to the domain manager and deleted the domain. I then went to my existing MS account and added (</span>as the primary alias)&nbsp;<span>the email I had originally been using to log in to my local machine. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From there, I went to PC Settings on my computer and, after a full month of trying, FINALLY was able to verify my account. Now that my Windows user name/email address is
 recognized by my existing MS account, my machine recognized the account’s password. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s unclear is whether this fix would have worked before the end of the 30 day “recycle” period.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First order of business: Create a LOCAL admin account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to everyone who helped me tackle this mystery.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Please tell us more about your usage pattern.</p>
<p>Also, don't forget that there may have been several updates to perform on the OS and apps after you unboxed it. This process is battery consuming as it requires big downloads (through WiFi) and then installation.</p>

            Check your Power settings and re-select Balanced profile (switch away to Performance and Apply, and then come back to Balanced and Apply). Mine used to use a lot of CPU and only last 3.5 hours as well, but after I did the Balance power saving settings
 again (even though it was already on it) it now lasts 6-6.5 hours and the CPU doesn't spike up much anymore. Worth a try.

            This is my 5th Surface Pro 4 and all have had poor battery life. &nbsp;I am also only getting about 3.5-4 hours of battery life while doing pretty run of the mill activities (web surfing, some Hulu and Netflix). &nbsp;I'm thinking this must be the typical battery
 life since it seems unlikely that every single one of my Surfaces all had some battery issue. &nbsp;Still, I believe we all really need Microsoft to work on some software update to get that battery life up to 5-6 hours reliably. &nbsp;We all spent a good deal of money
 on this product, and we deserve something that holds up accordingly. &nbsp;Without a bump in battery life, there will likely be really negative consequences for the Surface brand and Microsoft in general. &nbsp;Hope you're listening, Microsoft!

            <p>I have&nbsp;an i7 SP4 and can agree that battery life is not great. Only under really light use it gets more than 4-5 hours and it sometimes has battery consumption spikes caused by OS's own processes or rogue websites with lots of javascripts on Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can advise is for you to run a powercfg /batteryreport /output battery_report.html and check that the battery health is ok. Here is an example of what I have:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6da82501-1cf5-4d01-a41e-da34ec95b58a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6da82501-1cf5-4d01-a41e-da34ec95b58a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25b213ee-d3fe-4a78-9b2f-145cb0909155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25b213ee-d3fe-4a78-9b2f-145cb0909155" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a big discrepancy between your battery's design capacity and the amount of charge it is holding then it can be a hardware problem. Also the report should indicate any other problems. If all is good with the hardware then the next step is to look
 at programs you have installed and running on the background, usage pattern and if there are no problems there then wait for software updates that improve battery life or return your device and choose something else.</p>

            <p>Same problem with my Surface Pro i7. 3 hour battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pathetic. The charge rate seems to be filling up to the design capacity. So I'm guessing it's not hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder **** is wrong with this tablet but 3 hours is pretty much unusable unless I'm plugged in... which is why I have a powerful desktop computer... Honestly the awful battery life would be manageable if it wasn't for the SLEEP DEATH on top of that.</p>

            <p>I noticed that recently, my SP4 has been consuming the batter much quicker.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the culprit is a service called 'Service Host: Unistack Service Group (4)'.&nbsp; My disk is running at 96%+ continuously.&nbsp; I cannot stop this process because it messages
 that system will become unstable and shutdown.&nbsp; However, its clear watching Task Manager, that this service is driving high disk utilization.&nbsp; I could do the Clean Boot to isolate further, but since this appears to be a Core Windows 10 service, not sue how
 I would solve.&nbsp; Any ideas? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, Michael.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this the first time you experienced the issue? No.&nbsp;</li><li>When did the issue first begin?&nbsp;<span>I have lived with this problem since migrating to W10 over a year ago.&nbsp; Only now, it is much worse (frequent).</span></li><li><br />
</li><li>Were there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue (e.g., updates, software installation)? No.&nbsp; But, I have installed several products since then, including W10 updates.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To make sure that we have not missed on anything, what specific troubleshooting steps have you done so far?&nbsp; Usually, I solve problems myself (from the days of DOS all the way to W10). I do not know how to troubleshoot this problem.&nbsp; I spent significant
 time searching the net for a solution to this problem. I found one solution that involved Malwarebytes. That does not apply to me. I just installed Malwarebytes after I wrote the previous post.</li></ul>

<h2>            Gamertag Change Cancellation</h2>
                    Hi. I saw a notice of the new gamertag system coming soon, and I was exploring some of the name availabilities. I unfortunately changed my gamertag to something I do not want accidentally, and I was hoping to change it back without imposing a charge.

            Hi! with the new gamertag system I think they give another free change. Did you change it recently? if so you may have to pay; try to change it and see if you can do it for free, otherwise paying is the only option.

            Yes, I was checking the availability of a name I did want, Dankius, but with no numbers. The language the page used was so subtle it made it sound as though the numbers at the end wouldn't show up. But obviously that isn't the case. I was Blade XY7, and
 now I've changed it by accident to Dankius3875, and I just want my old gamertag back, I want to cancel this change.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;What is the make and model of the printer?</p>
<div>
<p>- How printer is connected to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can try installing the latest drivers for printer from the manufacturer's website in compatibility with Windows 10 . Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>

    <title>Windows 10 Update 0x80070011 error Temp Fix - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zack sims  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update 0x80070011 error Temp Fix</h2>
                    This is how I fixed the 0x80070011 for Window's Update and it will need to be done every time a new cumulative update gets released.<br />
<br />
Prerequisites:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regedit or Registry Workshop<br />
Windows 10 Recovery Media USB, DVD.<br />
A Local user profile for testing and not your everyday one.&nbsp;<br />
Always backup your Registry and Windows Partition before making any changes just in case something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
Step 1: In Regedit or Registry Workshop change any key in these locations&nbsp;<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion<br />
<br />
that has C:\Program Files (x86) and C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files to X:\Program Files (x86) and X:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files.<br />
<br />
Note: Replace X with your drive letter to where Program Files (x86) is located on your PC.<br />
<br />
Step 2: (Only needed if you don't have a secondary user profile for testing or whatever you use it for): Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users and click Add Someone Else To This PC and when the windows loads click I Don't Have This person's
 Sign In Information then click Add A User Without A Microsoft Account. This will make sure no shortcuts or pinned applications will break when the junction is reimplemented later on when used on your regular everyday account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Step 3: Log into this secondary user account and delete the junction for Program Files (x86) in C:\ and after deleting, create a new folder and call it Program Files (x86).<br />
<br />
Step 4: After creating the new folder go to the registry by your preferred means and change all the keys back from Step 1 to C:\Program Files (x86) then reboot and log back into the secondary profile.<br />
<br />
Step 5: Go to Windows update and check and install the latest update then reboot and when done log back into the secondary profile.<br />
<br />
Step 6: &nbsp;Once logged in go to C:\Program Files (x86) and copy all the contents to X:\Program Files (x86) then prepare your recovery media and reboot.<br />
<br />
Step 7: Boot into your Windows 10 recovery media and go to command prompt then type notepad then go to File &gt; Open then find C:\Program Files (x86) and delete it.<br />
<br />
Step 8: After deleting C:\Program Files (x86) in the notepad explorer, close notepad then go back to the command prompt window and type mklink /J "C:\Program Files (x86)" "X:\Program Files (x86)" After it has successfully created the junction you can reboot.<br />
<br />
I hope someone finds this helpful.

<h2>            Other accounts</h2>
                    Two questions: &nbsp;I have created other accounts over the years but I don't remember what email address I had under them. &nbsp;I would like to delete everything attached to me apart from my active account. &nbsp;Is there a way to search for my name and/or anything
 attached to my name? &nbsp; Secondly, there is something wrong with my current account. &nbsp;I am wondering if someone has hacked into it or if I have done something to make it not function properly. &nbsp;thank you&nbsp;

Enable BCC Field In Windows Mail Email
<p>The BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) field enables you to sent mail to multiple targets without the list of recipients being displayed. This is particularly useful if you have an email that has to be sent to a number of your friends or colleagues. At least you can
 sent the mail knowing that whoever receives it will not know who else the mail has been sent to.</p>
<p>To enable the BCC field in Windows mail proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1/ Open Windows Mail</p>
<p>2/ Click the Create Mail button on the main toolbar</p>
<p>3/ The New Message window will now open</p>
<p>4/ In the New Message window click on View on the main toolbar and, from the drop down menu, select the All header option</p>
<p>5/ The BCC dialogue box should now appear in your email window <br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers.</p>

<h3> jacobkalasho  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen when the computer is idle</h2>
                    I am having a reoccuring problem where my screen will go black, sound will freeze up, then I will hear my PC restarting. This happens mostly when I am gaming but it also happens when the computer is idle. When I boot the computer back up I am met with
 a message that says there was an unexpected shutdown and provides details of the problem. I will post this if necessary, please let me know if there is anything I should block out from it. I don't know if its related but I also get an error where the screen
 goes black, but it recovers 10-20 seconds later, I believe that error is related to the graphics card. If there is any other information that I can provide to help, please let me know.

            <span>Hi Jacob,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Do you get any error message when you get black screen?<br />
<br />
This issue might occur due to some third party program or some recent updates on the computer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode. Safe mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic
 device drivers and services as possible causes. I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists. Refer this link to boot the computer in safe mode:<br />
<br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a><br />
<br />
If the issue is fixed in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot.

<br />
Note: Follow <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> from article KB929135 to reset the computer to normal mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong></span><span>The issue also could be due to graphics card. I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />

</span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><em><span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly.
 Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Pro 5 - the system does not start</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I apologize for my bad English - I am not a native speaker.</p>
<p>So, the problem is that when you restart my tablet, it stopped running. At startup, the Windows logo is displayed, but there is no “wheel loading” below the logo. When restarting, there is an attempt to diagnose the system, but this is unsuccessful - a message
 appears that the computer could not be diagnosed or the system could not be started (the same error). When checking the "diskpart" and "volume list" commands, it turned out that my internal drive has a RAW file system. When I try to reset this PC, I enter
 the BitLocker key, but without success - I find myself on the main page of this blue menu! I'm afraid to format the drive, and the files are very important to me.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>

    <title>Windows Freezes At Startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Freezes At Startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I know that there are a lot of posts like this one but I have checked everything and this is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Lenovo Thinkpad E330 and I had just updated it. I have also downloaded a new game on the same day. My windows has been occasionally freezing up for the last year (my laptop is just 2 years old :O). So, my whole laptop froze at night, long after I
 had installed the update and restarted windows. I decided to restart windows and - it froze on the "Starting windows sign" (I use windows 7). The four dots met and made the windows sign then it was stuck for hours. I decided to switch it off and try the next
 day. I still had the same problem the next day. I tried using system recovery but it was also stuck at the start screen (where the green lines move from side to side) for hours. I tried safe mode but repeatedly pressing F8 does nothing. I also do not have
 a windows disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize if it was confusing. I really do not know what to do because I can only load the Lenovo startup interrupt menu which leads me to the BIOS setup and other screens. Additional info: Before I enter the start screen, it would say that windows failed
 to start and whether I wanted to launch startup repair (which doesn't work). Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Aaron.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Model: Lenovo Thinkpad E330</p>
<p>Operating System: Windows 7 64bit</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the problem description, I understand that your computer randomly freezes at startup on “Starting Windows sign” for over a year. You’re
 not even able to get to the Windows recovery options and try safe mode as pressing F8 repeatedly at startup does not make any difference.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>sorry for my late reply. I really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I am able to go I into go into &nbsp;safe mode by pressing FN+F8 but it just starts loading files for a while then freezes :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I do have an external mouse, but I wasn't using it at the time and I disconnected all hardware.</p>
<p>2. It doesn't show any error message whatsoever.</p>
<p>3. No, sadly I don't think so. It came with the laptop 2 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried (but did not work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Try Safe Modes (It freezes after loading files for a while)</p>
<p>2. Windows recovery (It also freezes when loading (the green bar lines moving across))</p>
<p>3. Last good configuration (Also freezes at startup logo)</p>
<p>4. Disable automatic restart ion system failure (Freezes on startup logo)</p>
<p>5. Cleaning laptop and fan (Looks clean now but still doesn't work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: When it freezes on the windows sign, it doesn't freeze the image. It still moves but never goes to the next stage. The same goes for safe mode and recovery mode. The green lines never stop moving left to right. I have also used a system test using
 Lenovo recovery (which works) and I have saved the log on my USB. It failed a lot of stuff :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Aaron.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I used the Lenovo Recovery (different from windows recovery) and I saved a log file. I'm not sure whether it will help but I uploaded it to Google Drive:

 video and refresh rate settings to check if the issue is caused by the graphics card.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;

</p><p><span><span>Also check if you’re able to start your computer in
<strong>safe mode with command prompt, </strong>if yes let’s run Check Disk from command prompt to find and fix hard drive errors (if any).</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you’re not able to start the computer and get to the desktop at all, possibly there is some hardware part failure. In that case, I would suggest you to contact Lenovo (the computer
 manufacturer) or a local tech shop to get a hardware diagnosis performed on the computer to identify the faulty hardware part and get that replaced.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>thanks so much! I ran it in low resolution and it started up. I then started it normally and that also worked. I'm not sure if it is because the battery was completely depleted and everything had settled down but it went as fast as it has started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon starting normally, I was immediately greeted with a message that said "Windows has detected a hard drive problem please backup" which disappeared after a minute or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do now? I'm sure that the problem is still present and may happen again so I want to make sure that it is prevented while the computer is still on (just in case it cannot start up again).</p>
<p>
