<p>thanks.&nbsp; I won't contact them.&nbsp; I can't figure how I keep getting the false notification.&nbsp; I am always browsing the internet and it comes up moments after I open a new web site so I think it's on the web site I visit...........or have they put something
 in my computer?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Do&nbsp;any of those websites you were browsing have advertising?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was a rhetorical question by the way, of course they do, the Internet today is full of them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of these fake browser popups today aren't due to malware that's already on the PC, that was the case a few years back but stopped working well as AV programs began handling these better.&nbsp; Now the easiest way to find those most susceptible to such attacks
 are the advertising networks that sell blocks of advertising access on major websites, since these also contain the ability to target the types of people and activity which are known to be most likely to respond to this type of false messaging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, the malicious actors have decided that you are part of a group that is likely to respond, so they are using the advertising networks in order to track and target you for repeated ads that launch these popups.&nbsp; Now don't get paranoid, because
 it isn't you personally they are tracking, but rather the types of sites and/or articles you read and other actions you might take like clicking on other specific ads or articles on those pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So&nbsp;one way to stop these is often simply avoiding using the browser to do things like reading news or especially other hot button sites like those driven by advertising links such as "20 pictures of this" or "10 ways to do that" which are often found at
 the end of various articles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's hard to say exactly what specific activity is making you a target without knowing far more about your habits, but in general, this is why the trend recently has been to move to news and other apps rather than the browser for such regular reading.&nbsp; Unless
 you configure both Windows and the browser with privacy in mind, including blocking many of the ads that are normally displayed, it's hard to avoid these popups any longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To try and determine exactly how these popups are being delivered, try either removing your current home page if you have one or simply avoiding the websites you most commonly visit for a short time.&nbsp; If that causes the ads to stop at least temporarily,
 you've at least found which website(s)&nbsp;are delivering the ads, though they're likely to return eventually on other sites that use the same advertising networks, so this typically isn't a true solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned, there are other methods of configuring Windows and the browser for privacy, as well as using ad blocker add-ons&nbsp;in the browser, but these are relatively extreme.&nbsp; However, if you don't wish to change your web&nbsp;browsing habits, they may be
 the only way to dependably reduce the number of popups you see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that major websites like MSN, Yahoo and several others commonly used as home pages had seen significant increases in this type of popup activity earlier this year.&nbsp; Though some of this has been reduced, the deeper problems with the advertising networks
 still remains, so I assume we'll continue to see flare-ups and I'm also sure there are some websites that aren't even aware the problem is happening to them, since it isn't their own web pages that are causing the problem.</p>

<h2>            Workbook opens as readonly</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
I’m using the following function to open an xls workbook from MS Access.<br />
<br />
Dim xlApp as Excel.Application, wkb as Excel.Workbook</span></p>
<p><span>Set xlApp = CreateObject(“Excel.Application”)</span></p>
<p><span>xlApp.Visible = True<br />
Set wkb = xlApp.Workbooks.Open(FileName:=“C:\myFile.xls”, ReadOnly:=False)<br />
<br />
And when the workbook opens, its title is: <br />
“myFile.xls [Read-Only] [Compatibility Mode] – Microsoft Excel”<br />
<br />
How come I cannot open it in normal mode? Is it because I am trying to open an xls in 2007??<br />
<br />
Thanks, in advance, for any relevant suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a couple things to try/check.</p>
<p>What happens when you open the Workbook manually?&nbsp; Is it in read-only as well?</p>
<p>Set wkb = xlApp.Workbooks.Open("C:\myFile.xls")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI: Opening an *.xls in Excel 2007 should have no impact on being able to edit and save changes to the workbook.<br />

<h2>            Tables&#58; arranging tables in Word</h2>
                    <p>I have created multiple tables in a Word Document. I created the tables by drawing them, now I am trying to arrange the tables side by side, move them to the exact place I want them and they never end up where I want them, they overlap, them move to the
 bottom, they screw up my whole page. I drag them and place them where I need them and they jump somewhere completely different on my page. I am completely frustrated!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Probably the best method is to insert (not draw!) a table on each page where you want to arrange your tables. For example, if you want two tables side by side, create a two-column-by-one-row table.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that for each table, in the Table Properties dialog, the text wrapping is set to
<strong>None</strong> instead of <strong>Around</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then cut one of your tables and paste it into one of the two cells, and cut/paste your other table into the second cell. You can turn off the borders of the outer table so it doesn't appear unless table gridlines (Table Tools | Layout &gt; View Gridlines) are
 turned on.</p>

            That works if you a doing standard tables, but that is not my case. I have multiple tables in more than two columns and are not all the same. If I put them to close together they automatically combine, which I don't want and when I try to place one in
 particular spot it will not go there.&nbsp;

            The inner tables can be any kind, of any shape. Nesting them into cells of the outer table keeps them uncombined and prevents them from moving around. Try it, you'll like it. :-)

    <title>Need to set up custom alerts for Windows Phones using outlook as the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derekpotratz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to set up custom alerts for Windows Phones using outlook as the email application</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently started working with a group in my company that has windows phones. My company for the most part utilizes iPhones and the VIP feature for contacts so that when a n email notification comes through it plays a custom (usually loud and annoying)
 notification so that it can be heard at 1 in the morning if needed. We have been struggling trying to figure out a similar feature on the windows phone and i was hoping that someone here might have a solution. I know one way is to have outlook send text but
 my company has requested that we not go that route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there no custom settings for this? or at least a 3rd party app they can download to do this for them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give an example if my explanation was not clear if I have a critical issue at 1 in the morning and i want John Smith to be 100% aware of it via email he adds me as a VIP contact in his iPhone. When my email comes through he has a ringer set up that is
 loud enough to wake him up. Normal emails will come through with the default ringer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also advise that i understand we could just change the ringer for all emails to something that would be loud enough but our company sends a high amount of emails and most of them can wait until the next business day. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why should I stay with a microsoft phone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aec burky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why should I stay with a microsoft phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>To start with I am kind of a M$ fanboy, Ever&nbsp;since I had to abandon the Amiga, I have every Xbox so far, and have used every version of windows phone operating system. But now I am not sure anymore.</p>
<p>I am approaching time to upgrade my phone, and when I was waiting to get my hands on the HTC One M8 I was very excited what potential this little phone had and windows mobile although I was unable to download apps for many things my Droid using son could
 (My bank does not have a windows mobile app), I liked the system and&nbsp;was willing to stick with the limitations. When windows 10 came out I was stocked, I upgraded my laptop as soon as I could, was bummed when the Surface RT could not, but at least I was promised
 or so I thought that the HTC One M8 would be Supported for 2 years, and yet for I don't care who's fault it is, I cant upgrade my phone! So now it's time to buy a new phone and the other non ios phones look pretty good to me. Those of you that believe its
 worth sticking with the #3 phone, please tell me why? </p>

            <p>That post will be a year old tomorrow. Things change, and the M8&nbsp;is not on MS's list of devices being 'officially' upgraded. That doesn't mean it isn't being supported. It means it isn't being updated to the new, different, OS. That said, the issue of moving
 to Win 10 Mobile, or sticking with MS,&nbsp;is tricky. It is easier to comment on why not. That would be apps. There are, undeniably apps you can get on other platforms that aren't on, and likely won't be on, Windows 10 Mobile. It would be a personal decision on
 whether you 'need' any of these or not. For my part that answer is 'no'. There are apps I would like, but none that drive me to leaving the environment that I have enjoyed since 2000, and continue to enjoy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the hardware and capabilities of my current daily device, a Lumia 950, I have no issues with it. It is responsive, has a great camera, a replaceable battery, SD expansion, looks good (with its Mozo case), and has a couple of unique features. The
 Hello login is useful, if not as reliable as my Nexus 5x, or iPhone 6s, fingerprint readers. The Continuum feature has great potential, but needs to be supported more. It's new, so that is to be expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I own those other devices, but my daily phone is my 950 because I like the way Windows Mobile operates. I get a tremendous amount of insight just looking at my start screen live tiles, without ever going into an app. Android widgets can be useful, but
 you can't get as many of them on a screen, and iOS, well, it is what it is. I am extremely pleased with the direction MS has taken with UWP apps, in that my&nbsp;phone experience is very close to my laptop and desktop experience within individual apps. I feel like
 I am using the same mail, map, browser, regardless of the platform I'm on, because, well, I am using the same app. Even the settings experience is consistent across the various&nbsp; devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my Lumias I am comfortable believing the OS updates will come to my phone. Apple promises that as well, but Android is dismal in this respect. I have been through the WM6.5 to WP7 to WP8 reboots, and I know some feel abandoned with the limited W10M
 upgrades, and I feel for you. Going forward I don't see MS rebooting phone again. It is now inextricably tied to the 'one' Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, IMHO, a phone is about a two year thing at most anyway. At that point enough has changed I will want a new device anyway, regardless if the OEM is shoehorning a new OS onto the old hardware. For a lot of the flagships, 920, 1020, M8, we are at that
 point. For the sub $100 devices with low memory, I expect many of those were bought just because they were cheap, not because there was some promise of the thing getting better with age. I know that this may be a universal viewpoint, but a $100 phone is disposable
 after a year, and&nbsp;you can still get a sub $100 phone that is being upgraded to Win 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the bottom line is that you go with Windows Phone, or Win 10 Mobile, because you like it. I don't think I am missing out on anything by not going with iOS or Android, save an app or two.

            I'd be lying if I said I never got caught by that. Great thing about the internet is nothing ever goes away. Bad thing about the internet is nothing ever goes away.&nbsp;You search for something and you find everything about it yesterday and ten years ago.
 I had to look to see if the M8 wasn't on the list. I would have guessed it was before those BLU devices. :)

    <title>Mail Merge Conditional Statements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kmort95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge Conditional Statements</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to use Mail Merge to automate creating a certain document from an Excel spreadsheet I have. In the spreadsheet, I have a number of statements in one column, and each statement has a timeline and a responsible party. I'd like to use Word to create
 a document where the lists of statements are separated by the timeline and responsible party ("3 months staff, "6 months staff," etc). I've got the two conditional statements nested, but the problem I'm having is once an entry is skipped by one statement,
 it doesn't know to go back and re-evaluate it later. There are also a lot of blank lines. What I have now looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ IF { MERGEFIELD Timeline }= "3 months" {IF { MERGEFIELD Responsible Party }= "staff" "{MERGEFIELD Next Steps}" } } {NEXT}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have suggestions for how to 1) having Word evaluate the list 4 separate times in one document and/or 2) getting rid of the blank lines?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<div>You can use Word's Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge facility for this (the terminology depends on the Word version). To see how to do so with any mailmerge data source supported by Word, check out my
<strong>Microsoft Word Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge Tutorial</strong> at:<br />
<a href="http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/38721-microsoft-word-catalogue-directory-mailmerge-tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/38721-microsoft-word-catalogue-directory-mailmerge-tutorial.html</a>

<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Zips/Catalogue%20Mailmerge.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/Zips/Catalogue%20Mailmerge.zip</a><br />
The tutorial covers everything from list creation to the insertion &amp; calculation of values in multi-record tables in letters. Do read the tutorial before trying to use the mailmerge document included with it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Depending on what you're trying to achieve, the field coding for this can be complex. However, since the tutorial document includes working field codes for all of its examples, most of the hard work has already been done for you - you should be able to do little
 more than copy/paste the relevant field codes into your own mailmerge main document, substitute/insert&nbsp; your own field names and adjust the formatting to get the results you desire. For some worked examples, see the attachments to the posts at:<br />

Another option would be to use a DATABASE field in a normal ‘letter’ mailmerge main document and a macro to drive the process. An outline of this approach can be found at:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/many-to-one-email-merge-using-tables/8bce1798-fbe8-41f9-a121-1996c14dca5d">

Conversely, if you're using a relational database or, Excel workbook with a separate table with just a single instance of each of the grouping criteria, a DATABASE field in a normal ‘letter’ mailmerge main document could be used without the need for a macro.

<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_winother-mso_2010/mail-merge-to-a-word-table-on-a-single-page/4edb4654-27e0-47d2-bd5f-8642e46fa103">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_winother-mso_2010/mail-merge-to-a-word-table-on-a-single-page/4edb4654-27e0-47d2-bd5f-8642e46fa103</a>
<br />
For a working example, see:<br />
<a href="http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/37844-mail-merge-using-one-excel-file-multiple.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/37844-mail-merge-using-one-excel-file-multiple.html</a></div>
<div>The DATABASE field can even be used without recourse to a mailmerge. An example of such usage can be found at: http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/21847-mail-merge-into-different-coloumns.html#post67097<br />

<p>It sounds like you are want to create a Many to One to one document type of merge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you contact me by email, with some more details, I will be able to confirm that and can supply you with a customized version of the Many to One facility on my MergeTools Add-in that will create such a document.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My Merge Tools Add-in is contained in the MERGE TOOLS ADD-IN.zip file that you can download from
 the following page of my One Drive:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</span></span></span></a></p>

<p><span><span>“READ ME –
</span></span><span><span>Setting up and using the Merge Tools Add-in</span></span><span><span>.docx
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>to see how to install and use the various tools.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Using those tools, it is possible to perform the following types of merge that cannot be done with Mail Merge “out-of-the-box”:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to e-mail messages either with or without attachments, with the documents created by the merge being sent as either Word or PDF attachments or as the body of the e-mail message.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to individual documents in either Word or PDF format with the filenames being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Many to One type merges, which can be used for creating documents such as invoices where there are multiple records in the data source that have common data in one of the fields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a document that will include a chart that is unique to each record in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document with Content Controls</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document that contains Legacy FormFields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Duplex Merges</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a printer that will collate and staple the output created from each record in the data source.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letters type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message where relevant.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an
 Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For the Chart Merge utility, see the Mail Merging with Charts document that is included in the Merge Tools Add-in Zip file for additional requirements for the data source for use with that utility</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row
 that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character
 (0-9). <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The&nbsp;number of characters in the field names, including spaces, must not be more than 40</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Mac Outlook 2019 Outgoing Rules failing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I have recreated my profile and deleted all of my other rules both client and server side. &nbsp;This is for a Mac 2019 connected to Microsoft Exchange 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When creating a rule in Mac outlook 2019 client for outgoing rules it is not working. &nbsp;Specifically the rule is set to CC myself on all outgoing mails so it says:</p>
<p>FROM: &nbsp;IS ME</p>
<p>COPY MESSAGE: inbox</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created lots of variations including forwarding the message, using different forms such as my actual email address. &nbsp; every combination I can think of. I also created a rule to just change the color category.. nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p />

<p>Hello, thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reached out to support and they confirmed that Mac outlook 2019 can not apply rules to outgoing messages for Microsoft Exchange accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make this work out, I logged into my exchange panel and searched for mail rules. &nbsp;I created a back end mail rule directly in exchange to perform this task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note this does not work as a normal exchange rule, you have to go to the back end exchange admin and search for mail rules to apply, you can not do this inside your normal OWA screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>This is a windows 2008 R2 machine. It had earlier office 2013 installed on it so I upgraded the office 2013 enterprise edition to office 2016 enterprise edition and I am getting these errors &nbsp;on my event viewer. I am also not able to figure out what is going
 wrong with it. As for the Dirsync it is located on another server and that server has no issues. As for now I am not able to see any symptom as such but only lots of error messages on the event viewer.</p>

<p>Hi AjayDeval,</p>
<p>InfoPath 2013 remains the 2013 version and therefore won't be included in the Office 2016 version of Office 365 ProPlus. When you update an existing installation of Office 365 ProPlus to the Office 2016 version, InfoPath is removed from the computer. If
 your users still need to use InfoPath, the previous version will be available for installation on the Software page in the Office 365 portal. If you have any question about it, you can create a new thread so that we can focus on it.</p>
<p>Let’s back to your original issue. As you mentioned the Dirsync is working on another server, and there is no detailed symptom, we can narrow down it should be a local issue. I suggest you post the issue at our Windows server forum for further assistance.
 Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            The tab button isn&#39;t working with bullets&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I don't know how this happened or what setting I changed, but hitting the tab key no longer indents or changes the bullet it only indents the text. I know that I can hit the indent button on the formatting bar but it is so much easier to hit the tab button.
 &nbsp;<span>This is a very annoying problem. Can someone please help me?&nbsp; (I have Microsoft Office 2008)</span>

            Office 365 Personal is for a single person. Office 365 Home is for up to six. Is it the latter you have?

            Hi BrettClark3,
<br />
<br />I'm Tyler, an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />You can share your Office subscription with another person. For that, you have to do these steps.
<br />
<br />First, sign in to your Microsoft account and then select the option Services &amp; Subscriptions. Next, Scroll until you see your Office 365 subscription. Now, search for the Option Sharing and select it.
<br />Next, you have to select the Start Sharing option and then invite via email or invite via a link.
<br />
<br />Regarding those two options, if you select the invite via email you have to enter the email of the person that you want to share the office subscription and then select Invite and then, Got it. If you want to invite more people. Select the option Invite someone else.
<br />
<br />Now, if you select Invite via link, you have to copy the link using the copy icon and send it to the person or people that you want to invite.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps you.
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />Tyler.

            Do you get any error messages?  Unless Apple has done something to prevent access from multiple devices at once, you definitely should be able to stay logged in even though you are using app passwords. Are you using the same app password on both devices?

<br />I don't know as i haven't had a chance to test it, but at this point, its worth a try. The other option is to use the apple app on your phone to eliminate some of the problem - you can use your regular password with it.

    <title>Windows 10 Install Disc &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. shimer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Install Disc &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I posted this in a reply, but then realized this is going to be asked a lot so I am posting this as a Discussion.</p>
<p>" </p>
<p>One question I have left is, Will insiders like me who have participated (insider since 08/2014), as well as those receiving the "upgrade" receive a CD of windows 10. I still have my Windows 7 x64 Ultimate CD and Key "******-7TUCK-B8B74-88888-******" , I
 understand MS has done something with my Win7 key that effectively renders it useless.</p>
<p>So now most users will not know what their key is or how to reinstall windows should it become necessary.</p>
<p>Users and Insiders should receive a windows 10 install disc and key, no two ways about it. "</p>
<p>I feel this is valid especially because many of us weather we went to a windows store/ PC store/Software vendor or even Wal Mart we spent hundreds of dollars for what was our valid version of Windows.</p>
<p>Is it realistic to expect that we will receive a physical CD and Key ? I had one for windows 7 x64 ultimate.</p>
<p>If MS is offering to swap out or replace my valid and paid for previous version of the Windows OS (Which I had a CD and key for) why would I not receive a replacement CD and Key for re-install purposes ?</p>
<p>Is my Windows 10 software and key stored "online" and if it is how will a user without internet be able to install or re-install their OS ?</p>
<p>This is going to need to be addressed in a clear and <span><em>consice manner by MS.</em></span>

            <p>Windows 10 is currently only offered as an upgrade over w7 or 8.1 by downloading from Microsoft. A&nbsp; disc can be burned by downloading the ISO. If you do not have W7 or 8.1 then you will need to buy either the disc or USB flash drive for installation. However,
 these are not available yet for the public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, most new computers will come with W10 preinstalled with a recovery partition although (looking at where I bought my laptop) some will come complete with disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember W10 is a rolling OS so any disc will gradually become out of date.</p>

            <p>I am aware of what MS's official stance was, and how it works I have been an Insider for quite some time.</p>
<p>As I stated in my OP this is going to get asked a lot by users and was my reasoning in creating this "Discussion"</p>
<p>Your only parroting what MS posted early on as "reasons why".</p>
<p>After release date consessions will have to be made, and for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for this --&gt; "Remember W10 is a rolling OS so any disc will gradually become out of date."</p>
<p>All install discs become "out of date" almost from the moment they are issued, the point is they offer a valid "install foundation" or "launching point"</p>
<p>then you update as needed, so using this to invalidate the need for a physical CD does not even fit. PeAcE</p>

<p>I see your point, I will edit out some of it but I have no intention of returning to Win7, even though I miss it already :) lol<br />
</p>
<p>Re-Installing win 10 will require the key issued for that version, and as of today MS trashed the insiders keys I noticed in my logs.</p>

            <p>insider already no key MS has that info in the MSA so your qualifying key is there.&nbsp;so you can go forward--you can download the upgrade and&nbsp;iso. To upgrade&nbsp;and use on any computer-- they will&nbsp;need a legit key&nbsp;to activate</p>
<p>you can download&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10.</p>
<p>after upgrades MS will have that in the MSA so no more keys for that device. we are talking MS here so keep the keys handy.</p>

            <p>That is going to be addressed very soon.</p>
<p>the only keys now to be scrapped are those used to upgrade, and those the "Insiders" were issued early on.</p>
<p>MS will replace those very soon as the Final OS is distributed (from what I understand). PeAcE</p>

<h2>            My name doesn&#39;t show when i send mails from Microsoft Outlook app latest version on Galaxy Note II</h2>
                    <p><span>I have installed 5 times this new Microsoft Outlook app since last month, but when people receive my email messages they are not showing my name as the sender, when i send mails it only shows the first part of my email address (the
 part before the @ sign) as the sender or my complete email address sometimes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried with my second Hotmail address</span><span>&nbsp;as well and the result is the same, my name doesn't show as the sender, so quite possibly this is a problem with the app and/or the Exchange protocols
 messing with the sender name configuration. The Microsoft Outlook app version is 1.2.19 (54) mainline, downloaded again today. I</span><span>&nbsp;am using Galaxy Note 2 and this is not only happening with the Microsoft Outlook app but also the native
 Email app that ships with the Galaxy Note 2 which uses Exchange protocol. The 'Account Name' does show my full name in the app settings, but the mails are sent without it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even factory reset my mobile phone as well, and even that way the problem persists.<br />
</p>
<p><span>My hotmail account is and has been configured for almost 20 years with my full name and when i send mails using hotmail with a web browser, it shows my name correctly, so i simply wonder what is wrong with your protocols now?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Receivers always receive mails sent from the browser correctly, but mails from the apps only show my stripped email address as sender.</p>
<p>The Miscrosoft support suggested me to clear the account in the app and reinstall, wait for ONE hour and recreate the account, it didn't help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for any help you can provide.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detail explanation on the issue you are facing. I am sure this would help us to investigate what exactly is wrong. For now I would want you to try using your ID/IDs on a different phone just to know if it is an issue with your particular
 phone or it is a wide spread issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also want you to check the private message and provide us the asked details.</p>

            <p>You read my mind, i installed thd Microsoft Outlook app <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
1.2.19 (54) mainline&nbsp;</span>in a brand new Galaxy S4 phone using the same Android version 4.4.2 -factory reset- and the result is the same, people keep receiving the first part of my email (before the @ sign) as sender, not my full name. I also tested in that
 phone the native Email app that ships with the Galaxy S4 and the result is the same, so this proves that there is something wrong in the way Exchange/Active Directory interacts with the apps that is messing with the sender name.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi HPHP77,</p>
<p>I would like to know how you did the re-indexing. Based on my experience, some users resolved the issue by rebuilding index and then re-enabling the Windows Search service. If you have tried the rebuild step, please disable and enable the Windows Search
 service to see if it will resolve the issue.</p>
<p>The steps to re-enable Windows Search are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <b>Windows + R</b> and enter <b>services.msc</b>. Press <b>Enter</b> or click
<b>OK</b>. </li><li>Find and double click <b>Windows Search</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Disabled</b> in <b>Startup type</b> and click <b>Stop</b>. </li><li>Restart Windows 10. </li><li>Enable the services and restart again. </li></ol>
<p>If it cannot resolve the issue, it’s recommended that you seek help in the <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=outlook&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Forum</a> where engineers and experts have more professional knowledge regarding Outlook client troubleshooting. This kind of issue is normally not related to the Office 365 online services, so we are not the masters to troubleshoot it as O365 support
 engineers. Your understanding is highly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I waited for about 5 minutes and it finally booted into the Installation screen.( I was able to successfully install it.)&nbsp;This is something Microsoft needs to do something about, because another person said it took her 20 minutes... and the screen "Appears"
 to be froozen... NOT loading...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your machine is capable of booting from a flash drive, you may find that it is A LOT faster that way....</p>
<p>
</p><p>part of the problem may be the installation process, but it is also possible that your\their DVD is not of sufficient quality.... I have had that issue several times over the years.</p>

<h2>            Nokia PC Suite VS Nokia PC Connectivity</h2>
                    
<p>This may be a noob question, so please forgive my ignorance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please give me a concise rundown of what Nokia PC Suite &amp; Nokia PC Connectivity Solution are?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been searching Google &amp; all over &amp; can't really get a distinction between the two. I'm largely unfamiliar with these applications, but because of some of the work I'm doing for my job I need to find this information out.<br />
<br />
Thank you all.</p>

<p>There used to be separate versions of PC Suite for each and every phone model</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At some point it evolved into a single, "unified" PC Suite version supporting all phone models (relatively current at the time and afterwards, ignoring support for many older models).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few yeara later Nokia branched off parts (the core PC connectivity bits/components) from PC Suite to create a new application (user interface) called Ovi Suite (PC Suite was being kept updated alongside) based on Qt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of years later (last fall) Ovi Suite was renamed to Nokia Suite (as Nokia is gradually moving away from the "Ovi" brand it introduced in 2007).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Latest Ovi/Nokia Suite here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If things haven't changed lately, you can even install both on the same PC, if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For N9 (MeeGo) Nokia also has the Nokia Link:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for Mac users Nokia has had stuff, too:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Note: For Windows application developers Nokia has also released two different SDKs, Software Development Kits. For the phones prior to the "unified" PC Suite times, there is/was something called the "Nokia PC Connectivity SDK", and for the newer PC Suite
 supported phones there's the "PC Suite API", also known as "Nokia PC Suite Connectivity API".)</p>

            Unfortunately no .. cos its a privacy thing.<br />
<br />
But you can buy a third party app from <a href="http://www.ultimateportable.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.ultimateportable.com</a><br />
<br />
Its called Ultimate Voice Recorder .. and there is an option to switch off the beep and automatically record all calls. I've used it on the E61 and E51. The current version 4.01 works fine.

</p><p>I actually discovered that my SharePoint browser plugin for Firefox was set to "Ask to Activate" instead of "Always Activate" but it wasn't asking me and so it was throwing me the error that I did not have a compatible version of Word when I actually did.</p>
