<p>I have some conditional formatting that I'd like to apply to several sheets in my workbook.&nbsp; Is there a way of cutting and pasting it to all the other sheets?&nbsp; There's 12 sheets total.&nbsp; Or do I have to go in and hand do each sheet?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; You can use the format painter</p>
<p>2. You can use Copy, Edit, Paste Special, Formats</p>
<p>You should tell us the conditional formatting you are using because it may make a difference</p>

<br />
<br />If you need an access to your account that it works for some browsers.
<br />
<br />Try to use different one, for me it works in Microsoft Edge. 
<br />
<br />This can be used as workaround.
<br />
<br />Hope the issue would be resolved soon.

<br />
<br />In case it is still not working for you, it could be a browser-related issue.
<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser?

<h2>            Access 2013 changing field names</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp; I am a newbie to Access. I am trying to work with the Services template and change a field name and add a field to the Products datasheet. I must be in the wrong place to try to make changes because there is no option in this view to add a field or
 change a field name to a custom name. Specifically I want to change the "Unit Price" to and "Adult Price" and add another field named "Child Price". thanks for any help.

            <p>Yeah, isn't that annoying. This is an Access 2010 template when MSFT thought everything would eventually run on SharePoint. I would stay away from these templates. They can be recognized by the unusual object icons that are the normal ones with a globe on
 top of them.</p>
<p>You can create a new standard database, then External Data &gt; Import &amp; Link &gt; Access to import SOME of the objects. Then recreate the other objects yourself. Sorry the news isn't any better but if you don't do this it will be a gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question directly: open the table by double-clicking it. You can then add fields via the Fields tab in the Ribbon.</p>

<h2>            Display problem with SharePoint&#39;s list display web part and multiple choice column type</h2>
                    <p>I set up a nice, clean&nbsp;list display for our public outreach staff to look up multilingual work that others have done, to help&nbsp;share ideas and resources.&nbsp; Our list tracks 20+ languages that display in a multiple choice column that staff can filter&nbsp;to simplify
 the display.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we're running into a display problem for one record in which all multiple choice items are selected, need to be displayed and filtered: SharePoint retrieves the comma-delimited list as a long&nbsp;unbroken string and displays this long string
 unwrapped in its table cell, pushing out the table to 2 screen widths and pretty much ruining the whole display.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know of a reasonable method to insert spaces after commas so that the data will make use of rendering standards, wrap in a table cell and be&nbsp;usable for&nbsp;screen&nbsp;display?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm scheduled to present the list to the team in a couple days and would really like to clean this up first.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to explain that the feature of replacing comma with comma-space in table cell is not available. I understand it will be much more convenient if we could display the list data more flexible.
 Therefore, I suggest you submit your feedback in our <a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint Uservoice</a>. Many new feature came directly from customer's advice. We appreciate your valuable insights.</p>

<h2>            What happened to the Tab key in Outlook email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to getting a new laptop with Windows 8, I'm being forced to move from LiveMail to Outlook.&nbsp; Among a number of other issues, I've discovered that, when I'm composing an email in Outlook, the Tab key no longer works to produce an indent to begin
 a paragraph.&nbsp; WHY NOT?!&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that the "Increase indent" button won't do what I want because it indents the entire paragraph.&nbsp; I'm looking for the simple, old-school, 5-space indent to begin a paragraph.</p>
<p>

            <p>I too had the red x&nbsp;showing on the network icon while it appeared to be working otherwise. Looking in Device Manager - my Gigabyte motherboard has two Ethernet adaptors - both had been given the same name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appear to have fixed it by uninstalling both and then, without rebooting, &nbsp;searching for new devices and allowing Device Manager to re-install the network adaptor. This time they were given&nbsp;the different names&nbsp;- the second now ends with #2.</p>

<h2>            Resume files not possible in 2016 as in 2011&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the 2011 of Office for Mac, if quitting the program while a document was open that document would reopen automatically the next time Word, Excel etc. was launched.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Office for Mac 2016, this feature no longer seems to work. Can this be possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a document open that I am working on and quit the app, the next time I restart the app it launches to a blank page and I have to manually reopen the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very important for me to figure out how to store the previous behavior of restoring the windows I was working on. I also checked all the settings in the OS - they are still correctIs there an option that I am missing somewhere or do I have to go back
 to 2011?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Cristal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. Concerning the clarifying questions that you have please read the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My phone is Lumia 730. OS - MS Windows 8.1 Denim</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<span>Yes, it was the first thing I have tried. The solution there is to log in with the phone in Microsoft - it was disappointing because I am logged in all the time. The only
 suggestion if still have problem is to reset the phone - something that I really do not want to do.</span></p>
<p>- I tried to read over as much FAQ as I found in the Microsoft site - the only thing that is close to the topic is that I have to wait 30 days and the device will be added automatically. It also do not suits me as you can understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to find something that really works.</p>
<p>Thank you once again.</p>
<p>

    <title>Unable to play any media in build 10130 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to play any media in build 10130</h2>
                    <p>After updating from build 10122 to 10130 not only do I not have any sound I cannot play any media files (I have switch the audio playback to 16 bit 44K Hz). I've tried playing WMV, MP4, MKV, MP3, FLAC and none of these play in either Windows media player
 or the Music/Video apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also installed VLC and Shark007 CODEC's to see if that helps but I still can't play anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Music/Video apps do nothing when media is played to them - no error message. They simply sit there and eventually hang. Media Player pops up an error message that it doesn't support the CODEC of the selected file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My audio card is a SoundBlaster Zx with latest drivers (worked perfectly in 10122) and my video card is a GTX 970 with latest drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the built-in Windows CODEC's missing from build 10130? How do I check what CODEC's are installed in the build?</p>

<p>Windows Media Player has always&nbsp;been able to play videos&nbsp;in Windows 8.x (with additional CODEC's for MKV's and FLAC) and it was even able to play MKV and FLAC files out of the box&nbsp;in Windows 10 builds previous to 10130.</p>

<p>If you change your default format to something that works, does video playback come back? In theory it should... Sorry, I don't actually have a problem machine available to me to verify this.</p>

            <p>Hi John W.&nbsp;&nbsp; And guess what, the Creative drivers are still broken or get broken by W10.&nbsp; Did an upgrade from 10125 to 10130.&nbsp; Windows still makes no attempt to find Creative drivers.&nbsp; It did carry over some Creative stuff from 25 to 30 but it wouldn't work.&nbsp;
 Software wouldn't open.&nbsp; Figure the sound was being delivered by the Nvidia HDMI audio device.&nbsp; Reinstalled Daniel K's Creative drivers, set them and the software up as desired.&nbsp; Shutdown the machine and it holds/doesn't mess with my Creative settings.&nbsp; So
 far haven't seen one bit of change in how W10 deals with Creative drivers/hardware.&nbsp; It isn't a deal-breaker, just a pain.&nbsp; Have had to do workarounds on both Vista and W7 to use Creative hardware and software.&nbsp; Expect it will be the same with W10--at least
 I am comfortable with doing the necessary changes and understand how to do it.&nbsp; Same might not be said for all users.&nbsp; Am running 24-bit sound no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW--got into a deal where MS wouldn't accept my password and thought things were hacked.&nbsp; Found out later it was a server problem and lots of people couldn't sign in--only after I'd already cancelled the account and setup a new password but it is still
 me complaining about Creative.&nbsp; :-)</p>

            <p>Hey John...&nbsp; It was a funky one. I switched to 16 bit audio and it didn't work. I rebooted and it didn't work. I switched to 16 bit audio then switched to stereo (it was at 5.1) and it worked -&nbsp; sound played and media played. Then I rebooted and it didn't

            Although Dolby is installed by the Creative driver installer it's not enabled by default and isn't on my system. I do have the SBX&nbsp;Pro Studio enabled though but I'm not sure what that is using to create virtual 5.1 surround.

<p>Hi Gap Tooth Heidi,</p>
<p>Do you mean you only want to forward the emails that were sent to the alias email address? If that is your requirement, I’m afaid it is not feasible to set up such a forwarding rule. In Office 365,&nbsp;an alias is only used to receive emails. Forwarding rules
 are set up on individual mailbox and there is no official solution to filter emails according to the different alias email addresses.</p>
<p>I understand it would be very convenient if we could achieve the job, especially in a business situatuation. Therefore, we suggest you submit feedback to our relevant team via the link below. Many features have been designed based on our customers’ valuable

            Hi MBW8891,
<br />
<br />I'm Tyler, an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />If you are seeing this error, it means that OneNote can't sync one or more large files because they are over the size limits{2GB}. 
<br />
<br />There's a fix that can help you, but following the steps below will remove all earlier versions and backups of your notebooks. I recommend that you make sure that you don't need them. After all these steps you won't be able to revert to any earlier versions of your notebooks. If you rely on the automatic backups that OneNote creates, I suggest that you make copies and keep them in a safe place.
<br />
<br />Now, when you delete a page or a section from your notebook, it's then moved to the Notebook Recycle Bin. This feature gives you a chance to recover data that is accidentally deleted. However, when large files stay in the Notebook Recycle Bin for too long, they cause sync errors. You can resolve this issue by emptying the Recycle Bin of Notebook.
<br />
<br />Do one of the following:
<br />
<br />Click History, then check Notebook Recycle Bin and then go to Empty Recycle Bin.
<br />
<br />Click Share, then check Notebook Recycle Bin and then go to Empty Recycle Bin.
<br />
<br />OneNote stores cached versions of pages so you can go back to previous versions. If you deleted a large file, it may still be in an older version of the page. You can resolve this by deleting your notebook history.
<br />
<br />Do one of the following:
<br />Click History, then Page Versions and then click Delete All Versions.
<br />
<br />Click Share then Page Versions and then click Delete All Versions.
<br />
<br />After you’ve completed both of these steps, you will have to restart OneNote and then try syncing your notebooks again.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps you.

<h2>            nokia n95 8gb - real or a fake&#63;</h2>
                    please help. i just recently bought a nokia n95 8gb, which is supposedly brand new.<br />
<br />
the phone is still on its way and i will be getting it soon. however, i managed to get the following information from the seller in regards to the phone.<br />
<br />
nokia n95 8gb:<br />
<br />
V 15.0.015<br />
11-12-07<br />
RM-320<br />
Nokia N95 (12.01)<br />

<br />
can someone tell me - based on the above info - if this is a real or fake nokia n95 8gb.<br />

            hi. just curious as to why the IMEI number has been deleted? i thought that if you have the IMEI number that it can help verify if this phone is real or fake.<br />
<br />
in regards to the version firmware that is in this phone, is it the latest? the seller claims that the phone is brand new and unused. is this true?<br />
<br />
ps. what programmes and software should i be looking for in a real nokia n95 8gb? which programmes and software are missing from the fake nokia n95 8gb?<br />
<br />
cheers.<br />

            In regards to the firmware version (version is above) can someone tell me if this is the latest? If not, how can I get the latest firmware into my phone.<br />
<br />
This is supposedly a brand new phone so does that mean that the firmware should also be the latest. I have a feeling that this phone is not brand new, I have a feeling that its been used but the house changed to a new one. How can I found out if this phone
 was already in use and not brand new?

            The firmware version is not the latest, but this does not mean the phone is not new, I got mine from one of the big networks and had to upgrade the firmware as soon as i got it.

            hi,<br />
<br />
nokia phone received today.<br />
<br />
i am still in the process of trying to figure out if this is a genuine nokia n95 8gb or a fake.<br />
<br />
can somebody help me. i removed the battery to see what the CODE was on the white sticker (underneath the battery) and believe it or not, but there was no code! Only the following information was on the sticker:<br />
<br />
nokia corporation MADE BY NOKIA<br />
FCC ID: PDNRM-320 IC:661R-RM320 359542/01/267560/70562123 WLAN:001E3A8D6198 MODEL:N95-2 TYPE:RM-320<br />
<br />
just curious: is the code supposed to be the "0562123" attached to the end of the 7? there is no where on the sticker that has the word: CODE. This is funny because my other Nokias have the word CODE at the back and whatever the code is. It doesn't have a country
 where this phone was made, only the words "Made by Nokia". But on the Nokia battery, it says Made in Japan. Outside the Nokia box it states: Made by Nokia. No country of where phone was made.<br />
<br />
can somebody verify, given the following information, if this is a real or a fake nokia N95 8gb?<br />
<br />
thank you in advance,<br />
<br />

<p>Everytime I open Access the following message pops up and I have to click OK to get past it. I can't for the life of me figure out where this issue is coming from. I have searched endlessly for ANYTHING that might have this name in it and can't find it.
 The Action Failed dialog box never appears and there is no form (that I know of) named Switchboard.&nbsp; I am hoping someone can help me hunt this down. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><em>"The form name "Switchboard" is misspelled or refers to a form that doesn't exist.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>If the invalid form name is in a macro, an Action Failed dialog box will display the macro name and the macro's arguments after you click OK. Open the Macro window, and enter the correct form name."</em></p>

            I'm not sure where it is in 2007, but "Switchboard" is a menu form that is managed by access if you wish to use it.&nbsp; Access creates that form for you.&nbsp; What you need to do is find where startup forms are set.&nbsp; In 2003 it is under "tools" -&gt; startup.&nbsp; Just
 delete "switchboard" from display form/page text box.

<p>That <strong>won't </strong>be possible.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 paid for renewal&#59; cannot access Word or other products</h2>
                    My Office 365 automatically renewed on March 30, 2015. When I attempted to open Word and Excel today, I was advised that my subscription had expired. My three options were to 1) renew or buy Office (already done with confirmation on iTunes), 2) enter the
 product activation code (not able to locate), and 3) add this computer to an active account. When I attempt to add my computer to an active account (which was using Word as early as this afternoon), it tells me that my email is not associated with this subscription
 (it is the only email I use). This is extremely frustrating as I am working on several projects that are under tight deadlines and cannot access anything! Help somebody!

            First you need to give some details what is the issue? what version/build do you have installed? is it activated? what is your system? The Insider/Preview program is a self help program and doesn't have any direct support from Microsoft, it is manned by
 nonpaid volunteers who are not Microsoft employees.

<h2>            Stopped Receiving Emails</h2>
                    
<p>Dear All:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently bought Nokia E72 phone and setup emails using email.nokia.com web site.&nbsp; Every thing was working fine, but then all my emails stopped comin in.&nbsp; I may or may not have changed any setting while exploring this new set.&nbsp; Then I tried to check
 my accout settings on the same above mentione web site, but the website does not let me log in and says some thing like that you can not login now, please try later.&nbsp; I am receving this message for the last 4 days.&nbsp; I also tried to delete my email accounts
 from my phone but the phone does not let me delete these accounts with a message "you must be connected to delete account.&nbsp; My GPRS and WIFI are working perfectly.&nbsp; When I check email from any account it keeps on asking for password again and again for the
 same account, but does not receive any emails.&nbsp; Please let me know should I do, so that I can log in to the email.nokia.com site or else delete or fix my account settings so that I can receive emails on my phone as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Just the same thing has been happening to me since I bought the phone on Thursday and I've posted a few messages on here. I eventually found a thread on here, dating back to July, which indicates it's been a problem since then,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I foolishly spend hours calling the Nokia help centre and they weren't aware of the problem. During two separate calls I asked them to log into the web site using my user name. After ages they finally came back and said it was because I'd done too many attempts
 to log in, it was like spamming the system. They said it would be OK to log in 3 or 4 hours later. I tried it 4.5hrs later - no joy. Left it overnight - so 10hrs - still no joy. Left it all day - another 10hrs - still no joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to this I'd had problems getting the emails to autosynch - and the Nokia callers themselves wanted me to go on the website, log in, and&nbsp;delete my account and re-set it. But neither me, nor they, have been able to do this. Now, despite re-setting my
 phone to factory settings, I can't get new emails to come in. They did give me a default password, but that just enables emails prior to the problem coming in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They said they would ring me back on Monday. I'm not holding my breath for that. I'll wait until Monday lunchtime, then ring Vodafone (who sold me the phone) and ask for it to be replaced by a Blackberry. I've already called and warned them about this and
 they said that would be fine, but give Nokia chance to ring on Monday. I wouldn't mind, but the one app I want to work on this phone is emails. I'm really not bothered about the rest - but thought they seemed "nice to have" for the same price as a Blackberry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll let you know how I get on, as no one else has responded to any of my messages on this forum (look for my name to see my other messages). Please keep me posted as well. Cheers.</p>

<p>I think there is some confusion here, you've mentioned colomns C&amp;D, but there is no reference to them in your query else where... so asuming you meant H&amp;I...</p>
<p>If you change the equation in G4 to =IF(F4=0,0,F4/$F$30) it will stop the #VALUE error in H4 and I4 , returning&nbsp;0 (zero) instead.</p>
<p>Also, as a note, putting <strong>=G4*$I$2</strong> in I4 will give the same result you are currently getting in I4.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            ... &gt;&nbsp;the target column has text #VALUE!<br />
Think you probably have zero length null strings ("") returned by other formulas into either F4 or F30<br />
These are TEXT hence #VALUE! results as Excel cannot calc arithmetics with TEXT<br />
As a&nbsp;fix, you could just use ISERROR, viz : =IF(ISERROR(F4/$F$30),"",F4/$F$30)

<h2>            Display issue after installing  &#34;Sis Mirage 3 Graphics card&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Display driver on Sis Mirage 3 Graphics card</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello guys, I just installed the Windows 10 Technical Preview 9926 and the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter driver that came with it is very slow and video playback ends about 2-3 seconds after the audio on YouTube. I also cannot change the screen brightness
 so I downloaded the Sis Mirage 3 Graphics driver that I was using on the Technical Preview before 9926. My screen is now divided into three parts, the one in the middle is black and the part on the left shows the right side &nbsp;part on a normal display and the
 right is the same "opposite" like the left one. If anyone has any advice on how to fix this please help.</p>
