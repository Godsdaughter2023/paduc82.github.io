<h2>            No sound when receiving instant messages</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Mac and Skype version 8.33.0.41.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For about a month, I have not been receiving any sound notifications from messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All notification preferences are turned on, both w/in Skype and in Mac preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled, reinstalled, and restarted my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not getting back to people in a timely manner - not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for <strong>ANY</strong> help you can give me.</p>

            Are you running macOS Mojave? If so, some users are experiencing issues running Skype under that release. I recommend you uninstall Skype again and install Skype Insider:

            Skype Insider is actually releases still under development (still being made). But its relatively stable. I would at least recommend trying it to see how it behaves.

<p>I can't tell you, but I'm pretty sure if you looked at the back of the case that would tell you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>With Halo 3 you could use four consoles with four players each, but I've never done it with Reach. I presume it would be the same.</p>

<p>I believe the back of the box just says System link 2-16 players. &nbsp;Not sure, since I'm not at home right now. &nbsp;I suspect that 4 consoles is the max, but can anyone verify that?</p>

<p>If it's 2-16, then yes, it's four 360's. Don't worry too much, because there's no reason to drop the maximum from 16 to 12 or lower.</p>

<h2>            Windows Basic Display Driver</h2>
                    <p>I am not sure what occurred over the past 24 hours, but need help. As o11/22/2017 at 4 P.M. EST. I had all my&nbsp;computers working perfectly with displaying multiple displays and utilizing the windows basic display driver to do so. as soon as I get into work
 on 11/23/2017 at 3 P.M. EST I am called in and told that sometime this morning around 8 A.M. ish EST that the first computer went black on both screen and then came back up. On that computer I am using a DVI splitter to convert the single to two displays.
 The computer now has mirrored displays. I tried to get it to project by using windows key + p, but a message comes up and says his PC can not project to another screen. I then tried to go into the display settings and tell it to detect the other monitor, but
 it says it can not detect the other monitor. This was on a dell OptiPlex 755. I then went into my office where I have two additional monitors ran through a ATI radeon hd 4600. The two monitors which were working yesterday are no longer able to be accessed.
 I tried to do the projection and detect display with no help. This a HP machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need help, don't know if this is a bug in some update that was pushed out last night, or if it is something new and stupid that Microsoft did with windows 10</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the graphics card driver of the devices are outdated, or it may have been corrupted or damaged. For us to isolate the issue in connecting multiple displays, kindly respond to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed on both devices? Is it the Fall Creators Update version 1709? Kindly go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>About</strong>, and see
<strong>Version</strong>.</li><li>Can you tell us if there are any updates that were installed before the issue occurred? Kindly go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security </strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong>, then click
<strong>Update history</strong>.</li><li>May we know the exact error message that you get when attempting to extend your screen to multiple displays?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>the graphic cards are out dated and no longer supported on windows 10, which is where the Microsoft basic driver display comes in. I don't see it being corrupted, due to two separate computers having the same issue on the same day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I am using win 10 pro VS. 1703 Build 15063.726</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. the last updates this machine received was on 11-15-17 which was the update to version 1703 (KB4049011), (KB4048954), (KB4048951), (KB4011205), (KB4011265), and KB907417 which failed and I had to manually install&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. when I hit the WIN+P it states&nbsp;" your PC cant project to another screen. Try reinstalling the driver or using a different&nbsp;video card", then when I go into the display settings screen and scroll down to where it use to show my monitors it states "Multiple
 Displays Old displays might not always connect automatically. Select detect to try and connect to them. I then hit the detect button and the message shows up, did not detect any other monitors. Under the adaptor properties, the adaptor type is Microsoft basic
 display adaptor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going into the device manger and uninstalling both the Microsoft basic display and the Radeon display adaptor and rebooting the pc. This has not yielded any results and the drivers are reinstalled upon boot up</p>

<p>Correction to answer number 3. I went in to the system restore and it showed that a windows update was done on the 23rd of November at 11:23 hours EST, this was not shown in the update section under the settings. I rolled back the computer to the update
 that also occurred on the 18th of November and now have all my monitors back and running. Something occurred in this update on the 23rd which killed the dual monitors. Also after restoring the system back to last week, I now have the option to project to other
 screens restored as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The edition is still win 10 pro win a version of 1703 and a os build of 15063.726</p>

            What it says is that if you want to use POP and SMTP from an email app, not specifically the one that you see with the new interface.&nbsp; That is and can only be used with the 8UI interface.&nbsp; You will have to download Live Mail, get Outlook or use another

<h2>            Windows 10 Blue Screen UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having some trouble with my computer; it keeps getting blue screens and I'm not sure how to solve this. Using BlueScreenViewer, I found that the problematic drivers are ACPI.sys, ntoskrnl.exe, and storport.sys. There was nothing being used on the computer
 that would overload it since I'm usually just reading something or finding out how to solve the problem of the BSOD when the crash happens. What should I do to prevent this from ever happening again?&nbsp;</p>

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />Have you noticed any common thread for when the BSOD happens? Such as it happens usually when opening a specific application or group of applications? Or doing some other task?
<br />
<br />Also, I would recommend opening up the device manager and making sure there are no error icons there. 
<br />
<br />The last thing I would recommend is to open up a command prompt with administrator privileges and run:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />
<br />This will search your computer for any missing or corrupted system files and attempt to repair it.

<p>Hi there,</p>

</p><p>The BSODs that happen to my computer happens randomly. Usually it happens when I'm reading or typing something into a Microsoft Word document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, I already tried using sfc /scannow and got Verification 100% and no errors found. If you can help me out with the DMP files, that would be great.</p>

            Alright. Here are the steps I think should be taken because of each error seen. 
<br />For ntoskrnl.exe:
<br />If you have any overclocking done please reset to factory speed and settings. 
<br />Then perform a memtest by:
<br />1) Start button, then type Windows Memory Diagnostic and press Enter. 
<br />
<br />2) Click Restart now and check for problems(recommended). Be sure to save your work first because your computer will restart immediately. 
<br />
<br />3) Your computer will restart and the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool screen will appear.  
<br />
<br />Don’t worry if your test takes some time to finish. That’s normal. You’ll see the test results after you log on. 
<br />
<br />
<br />For ACPI.sys:
<br />Check for harddrive corruption by
<br />1) Open command prompt as administrator
<br />2) run "chkdsk /f"
<br />
<br />Also, make sure all windows updates are installed
<br />
<br />For storport.exe:
<br />Make sure your BIOS firmware is fully up to date. If this is outdated it could actually be the reason why the BSOD is happening fully. 
<br />Just be careful with updating the firmware. I have had experiences before that it no longer would boot from my drives until I formatted them. As long as you don't change any other settings besides updating the firmware it is usually okay though. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know if you are able to get through those steps and if you still see the BSOD after it or not.

<p>Thanks for the help, but there's another problem that I'm not sure is related to the BIOS or not. When I started my computer today, it had a bluescreen during the startup and now my computer doesn't recognize my hard drive and is stuck on the BIOS screen.
 This is not the first time this has happened. What can I do to fix this?</p>
<p>

            Hi,
<br />If you have tried making the media again and get the same message while doing a clean install,
<br />The hard drive probably might have reached the end of life. 
<br />Please run Bootable rescue disk and see if you can save your files:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/27180-windows-10-recovery-tools-bootable-rescue-disk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/27180-w...</a>
<br />I would also suggest you to run a disk check from Bootable rescue disk to check if it removes anything.

            Hi kianmotahari,
<br />
<br />Since the reset is not working, your best option is to clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />If you are getting a message that some files are missing, during a clean install - your Installation media is corrupt:
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

<h2>            Feeling cheated</h2>
                    
<p>Dear xBox Technical Support Team,</p>
<p>I received and xBox 360 Black Elite system a few years ago as a Christmas present. &nbsp;The unit was brand new out of the box. &nbsp;Sometime last year I had a problem with my system and mailed it in to you guys for repair. &nbsp;Sometime
 last year I had an issue with the red rings and mailed my xBox 360 in for support. &nbsp;The unit was returned to me and I was told that the hard drive had been replaced. &nbsp;Outside of losing a few save games there was no further issue. &nbsp;Sometime later I had a problem
 with the power adapter and received a new unit in the mail.</p>
<p>I have stopped using my unit to play video games for more then a year now. &nbsp;I strictly use it as my sole source of television through the Netflix and now Hulu services. &nbsp;I have updated every time it was available. &nbsp;Today,
 May-19-2011, I started downloading your new update and left the room as my xBox downloaded. &nbsp;When I returned the screen had a large white box with a black frame around it. &nbsp;The black frame said: &nbsp;"System Update Failed," and the large white box said: &nbsp;"Can't
 update your console. &nbsp;Please visit www.xbox.com/support.</p>
<p>Status Code: &nbsp;3151-335A-B380-0402-C000-0001</p>
<p>I restarted my xBox and that process repeated itself. &nbsp;The system would say that it would load the new update and get about 1/5th the way through before freezing. &nbsp;At which point the same white box and black framed screen appeared. &nbsp;I called your tech support
 and explained the issue. &nbsp;At which point, I was told that I had modded my console or done something illegal to alter it in some way and voided its use. &nbsp;Your tech support was quite adamant about this and implied I was a liar when I had said I have never done
 any such thing. &nbsp;"I have never modded, opened, or done any other sort of technical things to my xBox unit." &nbsp;The fact that someone would accuse me of such a thing when I'm already frustrated about being unable to use my system is extremely disheartening. &nbsp;I
 really do not know what to do at this time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since that time spoken with more reasonable and less rude tech support; however, all of which have told me that they can not simply send me a mailer to send the unit in to be inspected. &nbsp;I am positive that under
 any inspection you will see the unit has never been modded. &nbsp;The only thing I can imagine could have happened is that this is a result from the initial repair I sent the unit in for last time. &nbsp;I truly feel helpless about the situation at this time. &nbsp;The xBox
 though I do not play games on it is the sole source of television in our household and dvd player. &nbsp;It feels the same way as if someone had hit my car and drove off. &nbsp;Clearly I will never go so far as to take you to small claims court. &nbsp;As of right now my
 $400 xBox, many games, Netflix subscription, xBox live subscription, and Hulu subscription are all completely worthless. &nbsp;To add insult to injury I'm being told this is somehow my fault. &nbsp;Again, I have never done any "modding," pirated software use, or physical
 changes to my xBox. &nbsp;I am simply a customer that has been cheated out of their money, and if someone would actually take a look at my unit they would see that.</p>
<p>Feeling cheated,</p>
<p>xBox Customer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am having a similar problem. I recieved my xBox 360 on May 26, 2007, for my birthday. About two years later I got error E54 and payed $100 to send it in and get repaired. I progressively stopped using my xBox 360, and have just come back to this update.
 Now, everytime I load up my dashboard, I instantly recieve a black screen, with blue lines flashing across it. I called in today and was told that with a small fee of "$120" I could send it in and get repaired again, because my warranty has expired. After
 some discussion, I was given a discount of $20, where one of your employees told me, "I see you value your money, as do I," clearly, read off of a screen. Your support line flaws aside, I wish to be helped here, free of charge. As you can see, many other people
 who have never tampered with their xBox 360's are having them bricked, and now unusable. I am just an honest, paying customer who is getting forced into paying more money for your company's mistakes.</p>
<p>Feeling very cheated, Microsoft. Not like a "valued customer" should.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Another xBox Customer</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely certain. &nbsp;In fact, the tech service people were able to see it in the history when I spoke to them over the phone. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure it was warranty covered work as well. &nbsp;Update: &nbsp;It has been 24 hours, I was told that I would be getting a
 response and still have not received any response. &nbsp;The problem is still the same. &nbsp;Nothing has been resolved and I feel as if Microsoft will continue to do nothing, as I am only one individual customer.</p>

<p>I am having the same issue. As with the other 2 on here, I have been using my Xbox as a DVD and streaming system. After the update on the 19th can no longer get to the dashboard. Every time it starts, it attempts the update and gives the same error. Bought
 mine around Sep. 09. Black 120 Gig. model. Support is telling me that my system is just broke and I need to pay for repairs. Mine has never been repaired for any issues at all. My error number is 3151-335a-b380-0502-c000-0221. After the update, the drawer
 won't even open to take out the Netflix disc in the drive. Need to remove face plate and manually eject. At this point I am just giving up on Xbox and buying a BluRay for DVD and streaming. At least with that I don't have to pay additional Xbox live fees to
 pay fees to Netflix and Hulu.</p>

<p>[quote user="FirstFreekgeek"]Support is telling me that my system is just broke and I need to pay for repairs.[/quote]If it's an issue caused by the update it'll take a while for Support to catch up with the root cause and change policies accordingly.</p>
<p>[quote]At this point I am just giving up on Xbox and buying a BluRay for DVD and streaming.[/quote]Given the large power disparity between a Jasper and a stand-alone Blu-ray player with Netflix and Hulu support it's a good idea to go that route if you rack
 up large numbers of hours of DVD/streaming usage a month.</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem . I try to sign on my gamertag , and i get the update to download about 95% , than it says applying update and sits until a pop up comes saying "reconnect controller" i just pop out my battery from the back of my wireless controller
 and put it back and turn it back on , the message disapears .The applying screen will sit for another 10 minutes before i get the error code ending in &nbsp;C000-0001. i tried cleaing my cashe and opening up enough room to accept the update (i deleted red dead
 redemption off my hard drive) and nothing seemed to want to let it apply . i called live support and they sent me to hardware. Hardware first said i would have to send it in to get it fixed , but i know its not broken , and i know i never modded my system
 . the only time its been out of my possesion was when i sent it in to xbox to fix my red ring of death . the update is messing with the older systems somehow and it looks like either microsoft will need to tweek the update , or we will all be in the market
 for a new system . i have the older bulky white system,maybe it has something to do with how old it is .

<p>For me this is not even an issue of the update damaging the system, that will eventually be the problem but that happens with updates. How many times has a Microsoft Windows Update been pulled after it broke something unexpected. My real issue right now
 is that when you call support because an update was applied and now something doesn't work, the instant answer should not be to send in for paid repairs. There should be an attempt to look into the matter. As you said, if it is a problem caused by an update,
 it will take awhile to work that out. However, the only way the problem will ever be found is if support doesn't blow off every call as someone just needing repairs. Complaints that a system worked before an update and can not be used, in any way, after the
 update, needs to be taken seriously and investigated. Obviously my system worked to download the update and now it doesn't work. If I send it in for repair, they will do whatever it takes to clear the error, charge me $120 and move on with no way to look into
 the problem. The instant answer of paid repair for the system amounts to them wanting you to pay to get your system removed from a list of systems that were damaged by the update.</p>

    <title>Skype Camera not working- Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevekomar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Camera not working- Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello- my video won't launch in windows 7- the camera which is an inbuilt one on my Samsung laptop used to work fine with skype and still works on Google hangouts- but it has stopped working. I had installed Cyberlink at one point and that seems to have
 affected the camera- I uninstalled cyberlink but Skype was linked to that application. I have tried to change that and initially received an "invalid port" message. Then I reinstalled Cyberlink (trial version) but the camera still did not work. Please help.

<h2>            Can&#39;t open Settings after Windows 10 Fall creator update</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed windows 10 fall creator update recently after I've got it in windows update.</p>
<p>Then I've faced many instability in the new update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- I can't open Settings, when I try to reach settings, the splash screen for it is shown for seconds and then it is closed.</p>
<p>2- I can't access to any item in Action center.</p>
<p>3- Sometimes While I try to opening some programs in my laptop or while I playing around, a notification arise ( RuntimeBroker.exe - Application Error ) with information about the error, And with lags to my laptop performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows before this update was working like a charm. I'm a fan for windows 10 since it has been released and I'm always up to date to latest formal windows released. This is the first time to me facing problems like this in windows 10 releases.</p>
<p>I try to roll back to previous build, but the process is failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone have an idea to how solving this problem instead of making reset or fresh install for the windows ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks you very much.</p>

            Don't shoot the messenger but this is not good news and this is because of the limitations of Windows 10 Mail.
<br />Currently there is NO option to import contacts into Windows 10 Mail.
<br />You can export contacts from windows live mail to a csv but then windows 10 mail does not support importing it.
<br />IF you google it there is many discussions online about this and people very upset that this is not a capability.
<br />You can only import contacts from an existing POP\IMAP account to the People\Windows 10 mail app.
<br />
<br />So basically the only thing i can suggest is to send Microsoft your piece of mind in the feedback hub.
<br />
<br />Again sorry.

<p>Your contacts are located in C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Contacts</p>
<p>
</p><p>And your live mail and windows 10 mail both are a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>All your contacts are automatically synced to windows 10 mail app from your Microsoft outlook account which is</p>
<p>
</p><p>msn.com</p>
<p>live.com</p>
<p>hotmail.com</p>
<p>outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, log in to your email online through a browser. </p>
<p>www.outlook.com</p>
<p>select the People or contacts button</p>
<p>in the Manage menu, select import contacts</p>
<p>now they are for sure loaded into your Microsoft outlook account.</p>
<p><strong>OH and by the way, I never did the import part. But I stopped using WLM a year before Windows 10 was released. I used Outlook online. Everything has always synced. I just added the import from WLM to outlook online to make sure your contacts get
 transferred and synced. What is in WLM or Win 10 mail apps, are also online using outlook.com mail access.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now set up your email account in 10 Mail. then select the sync button in 10 mail. All your emails and contacts will be added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use a Microsoft email, and you sign into PC with your Microsoft account, then you can go to Settings&gt;&gt;Accounts</p>
<p>and turn on sync your settings. </p>
<p>This will keep many things saved and synced. Not sure if mail is involved in this section, but I have yet to see contacts not be loaded in to Win 10 Mail. That would make no sense for Microsoft to develop a new mail app and it be the only one that does not
 grab and load your contacts automatically like all others do.</p>

<p>Mine are too. You might be able to right click on them and load into mail. But if you have a Microsoft account. Sign into it online with your browser at www.outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then all your email and created storage folders will be online. If this is the first time, it will have to sync and download. It could take some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then once your email account online is all up to par, open Windows 10 mail, add your email account, sign in and select the refresh button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, it will sync and download all your emails into 10 Mail and your contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never did anything in Windows 10 Mail except add an email account, sign in and it always syncs everything. Click on the refresh button.</p>
<p>maybe restart PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in</p>
<p>Settings&gt;&gt;Accounts&gt;&gt;sync your settings</p>
<p>turn those on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signing into your PC with Microsoft account is a good options too if you are not already. You do that here in Settings&gt;&gt;Accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when you sign in online in outlook with your email, go to your Microsoft account settings. There are many account settings and features that are all tied together with your PC's and Devices. Including privacy settings. What you do on your PC can be
 recorded in your privacy in your account online or on the Cloud.</p>

<p>One problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were using Windows Live Mail and created storage folders, then you will have to create them on Outlook.com email. Then those will sync to windows 10 mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the emails you had in WLM storage folders will need to be moved in one of the default folders, such as, Inbox, sent, junk. Then they can sync to those folders online. then they will sync to win 10 mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is it my understanding that WLM will now NOT connect and work. I kept telling people that since Microsoft quit supporting it long ago, and my email notification then even said it would not work at all in near future and to use outlook online, and this
 was before Windows 10 was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if this is the case, you might not be able to sync the main online default folders from WLM to Outlook Online and then to Win 10 Mail..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your WLM created storage folders are on your computer and you can always view them by using WLM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can connect to WLM, put all WLM storage folders saved emails into new created subfolders in your INBOX Folder. Now they can sync to outlook.com online, and therefore now can sync to Win 10 Mail.</p>

    <title>Easy Transfer - User Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomcu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Easy Transfer - User Accounts</h2>
                    I will be using Easy Transfer to migrate all the possible files from our XP machine to a new Windows 7 machine. I have been using the W7 computer offline for a course I am taking and set it up with the same 4 User Accounts we have on our XP machine with
 the same names. If I choose to transfer "everything" including User Accounts will the prior existence of those accounts cause problems with Easy Transfer? Will it try to create alternate User Accounts?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a few empty test folders under three of the accounts since I had some problems setting up the accounts initially. My account contains a folder with a number of files for my course but I plan on copying them to a flash drive "just in case" they
 get clobbered by the Easy Transfer process.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I'm at it, should I install my program files after the transfer or before or doesn't it matter?

<p>Hi TomCU</p>
<p><br />
Windows Easy Transfer helps you move your many files, folders, and program settings from one computer to another—all in one process.</p>
<p>Using Windows Easy Transfer, you can choose to move:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user accounts</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; documents</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; music</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e–mail</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet favorites</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; program settings</p>
<p>When the transfer is done, Windows Easy Transfer Reports shows you what was transferred and provides a list of programs you might want to install on your new computer, as well as links to other programs you might want to download. When you've finished moving
 your files and settings to your new computer with Windows Easy Transfer, your new computer will have your familiar files, folders, and program settings—and that makes getting back to work much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can only open Windows Easy Transfer if you're using an administrator account.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can view your Transfer Reports anytime after your transfer is complete.</p>
<p>Windows Easy Transfer can't transfer files from a 64-bit version of Windows to a 32-bit version of Windows. If you're transferring from a 64-bit version of Windows Vista to a 32-bit version of Windows 7, you can move your files manually or use Backup and
 Restore in Windows Vista. For more information, see Back up your files and Restore a backup created on a previous version of Windows on the Windows website. If you're transferring from a 64-bit version of Windows XP, you'll need to move your files manually.</p>

<p>Yes you need to install&nbsp;the programs once you are done with the Transfer because Windows Easy Transfer will only transfer the&nbsp;Program Setting Files.<br />

Try removing and reseating all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug (on a PC) and clean out the dust bunnies and&nbsp;vents. On<br />

<br />
============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.memtest.org</span></a><br />
<br />
For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; Memory - find Memory Diagnostics tool at top of list - Right Click -<br />
RUN AS ADMIN follow the instructions<br />

<p><span>I am using Lumia 640 DS with W10m. </span></p>
<p><span>I launched Xbox app, logged in using my MS account. I added a random suggested friend (lets call him John Smith) just to explore the features of the app. After a while I have deleted that random friend and he no longer shows in the Xbox app.</span></p>
<p><span>On the start screen in the Contacts live tile I saw that there is John’s avatar visible, so I launched Contacts – there was another filter added – Default (Xbox). It seems that John Smith was added to my contacts list and he is still there, despite
 that I have deleted him from the Xbox app. I cannot manually delete him (in a way that you can delete any other contact), the option to delete is greyed out.</span></p>
<p><span>Does anybody know the way to remove this Xbox contact from my contacts list?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>
