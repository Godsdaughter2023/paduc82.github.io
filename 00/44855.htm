<p>WTF, LOL, Seriously, you are telling someone to go back to a previous version of Windows because all they need to do is uninstall Live Mail and reinstall using compatibility mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where do they get you guys that they give you tags as VIPS, MVPS, Advisors that have no clue themselves. This gets more hilarious everyday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you should be more educated before giving anyone any advice. How disguising and pathetic.</p>

<p>And live mail support for this version, there is no real support for WLM anymore for a long time now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of January 10, 2017, Windows Essentials 2012 is no longer supported on Windows 10, and is unavailable for download. Windows Essentials 2012 included Windows Movie Maker, Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Live Writer, Windows Live Mail, Windows Live Family
 Safety and the OneDrive desktop app for Windows. Already installed applications will continue to work as they do today.
</p>
<p>Note: Any websites offering free downloads of Windows Movie Maker are not offering sanctioned Microsoft products. Be cautious as these products may contain viruses or hidden costs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have Windows Movie Maker, Windows Photo Gallery installed on V1803 and runs fine. And if I installed WLM 2012 right now, it would install and run correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a MOD on here months ago confront me about the safety of WLM on Windows 10 and it was fine to run and was safe. I told him not for long and it was not as secure as he claimed. Maybe it was, but I knew Microsoft would not assure security for it soon
 and now they do not. This argument with the MOD here, LOL, was after this article was published. But you know how it is on this joke a... site, all these MODS and VIPS and blah blah that do not know jack poo, but people coming here use their advice because
 of these phone accolades and badges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not get me wrong, there are about 15% of the MODS and Special people here that know a lot and a few&nbsp;volunteers that are equally knowledgeable, but in general, the owner of this site gives all his buddies a MOD title of some sort as if they know what they
 are talking about. And I can assure they do not.</p>

 back to Windows 1709 yet. leaving on a vacation and won't be back till next week. Placed the problem on the back burner for now.

<p>This seems to have something to do with certain display drivers after installing 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the issue on two customer's computers. Rolling back or uninstalling the display driver solved the problem until Windows just automatically reinstalled the display driver that was causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my own computer and my wife's computer - no problem with WLM after updating to 1803&nbsp; and I have just installed WLM 2012 on a clean install of 1803 and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next step is to install an add-on graphics card in one of the above mentioned customer's computers to see if it solves his problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say that some older display drivers might manifest this problem, while newer "made for Windows 10 graphics drivers" will probably be ok. Of course, it's probably impossible to tell which drivers are ok and which are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will report back once I have more clarity.</p>

            I installed a cheep RADEON R5 220 graphics card which solved the problem. All the other recommendation did not solve the problem.

<h2>            Backup stuck when not finished--how do I continue the backup&#63;</h2>
                    I am almost finished my backup (which in the past has run overnight, giving me the message to label a new one and insert it in the drive).&nbsp; Now, after finishing running the current DVD, there is a flashing light next to my DVD drive and the "in progress"
 bar on the screen, but no new message to insert a new DVD even after a whole day of waiting and no "successful finish" message either.&nbsp; I do not want to lose this full backup 29 DVD's in!&nbsp; How do I get it to continue the backup?&nbsp; Pressing the button on the
 DVD drive does not eject the DVD.

            <p>I suggest you get away from the Windows backup program and get yourself a good commercial backup program. This forum is fraught with problem reports for the Windows one. I know I was very unimpressed when I tried it. Two I'm familiar with and like are Norton
 Ghost (which I've been using for 8 years without the 1st problem), and Memeo which has a 30 day free trial and you can buy it for $29.99 - you can download it from
</p>
<p><a href="http://memeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://memeo.com</u></a> . You can get Ghost for next to
 nothing (like I did) if you watch the sales. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The March 2012 issue of PC World is very high on the FREE program from Easeus,
<b><i>Easeus Todo Backup Free</i></b>, which you can download from </p>
<p><a href="http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm</u></a>
 . </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at </p>
<p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar</u></a>
 .</p>
<p>Some of these are free (last time I checked there were over 300), some have free trials (over 1000), and some are purchase only (over 200).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I also recommend that you get yourself an external hard drive to back up to so you don't have to use DVDs.&nbsp; They're much faster and reliable, and you can back up to them totally unattended.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck</p>

            No, no error message.&nbsp; It just displays the "in progress" screen saying "Backing up to E/" with the green progress bar partially filled.&nbsp; The light on the DVD player regularly blinks yellow but there is no whirring sound indicating that the DVD is being
 written to.&nbsp; After 18 hours, there is obviously a problem as it usually takes 45 minutes to an hour to write one DVD.&nbsp; I don't quite know what you mean by percentage.&nbsp; This is the only time it has done this.<br />
Thanks.<br />

    <title>People&#59; Address Book &#38; Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fleetchief  say:</h3>
<h2>            People&#59; Address Book &#38; Mail</h2>
                    <p>In error I enter a person twice in People, one with an incorrect email address (it ended in .com whereas the other entry ended in .ca).&nbsp; I deleted the incorrect entry from people, but when I use MAIL, both entries appear in the To: when I type the first
 couple of characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Mail still list someone who has been deleted from People?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how does one sync People and the Outlook 2016 Address book, so they both have the same entries, as I switch between the two when doing emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was mainly interested in finding out why a person deleted from People, still shows up in the list when doing To: in Mail.&nbsp; I was under the impression, obviously erroneously, that Mail got its contacts from People.&nbsp; Though the person is deleted in People,
 there appears to be no way to delete that person from the list in Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Office 365 is supposed to be fully compatible with Windows 10, I find it incredible that People is not automatically synced to the Outlook 2016 address book, and vice versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to me, that the Powers-to-be at Microsoft decided that a user would either use Mail or would use Outlook 2016 but NOT both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is similar to the problem that Mail and Office 365 do NOT use the same Custom dictionary and the dictionaries are NOT synced, though this was supposed to happen in the Anniversary Upgrade.&nbsp; So a custom word spelling saved in Mail still appears as a
 misspelt word in any Office 365 application, until it is added to the Office 365 custom dictionary, and vice versa again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems all arise because Microsoft decided to aim Windows 10 and Apps, to portable items such as tablets and Smart phones, and tended to ignore the millions of users that use PC's, especially Seniors, such as myself, who don't have a Smart phone
 and don't want one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every night, I use Disk Cleanup and then leave my PC to do its automatic backup at 0300.&nbsp; Every night I see listed the Retail Demo Content at 361Mb, and I check its box so that Disk Cleanup deletes it, but lo and behold&nbsp;there it is again on the following
 night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't anyone at Microsoft pay attention to fixing these little niggles that annoy so many of us users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ed</p>
<p>

            <p>The link between People and Mail doesn't seem to work. &nbsp;I've logged the issue under "Mail not linking to People app" and will be adding your problem to the list. &nbsp;Please check out that link

<p><span>and add your comments. &nbsp;I've given them testing options to prove our point and also suggested that they change "send" options for emails to look at the People app first before looking at the
 email cache. &nbsp;It's frustrating - a new contact in People won't even come through and previous ones with address changes won't update.</span></p>

            <p>Ed, did you have a look at the adress book from Office Outlook. Open it (Ctrl+Shft+B) and on the top of this window there is a field&nbsp;where you can choose which contacts should be displayed. Choose the People from your Outlook.com or Office.com account and
 they will be diplayed.</p>
<p>These are the contacts of the People app Win10 and Outlook.com. Even Groups can be used but are not shown in the People app on your laptop/pc. And, as far as I know (did not test this at the moment) are synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dictionary: can agree. But this is a BIG word - i n t e g r a t i o n</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk cleanup: find the automatic update for this and delete. I'm pretty sure Disk cleanup will delete the 361 Mb but they are downloaded every time again after disk cleanup has finished.</p>
<p>Maybe you can find it in Programs, maybe a task, maybe a run (once) in registry or something similar.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Not Working on Lenovo Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seattle media center user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Not Working on Lenovo Laptop</h2>
                    I have an HP desktop that works with Bluetooth flawlessly.&nbsp; I also have a Lenovo laptop that CONSTANTLY loses the Bluetooth icon and link to the software.&nbsp; What the heck is going on with the Lenovo implementation of Bluetooth?&nbsp; Is this a hardware problem
 or a Microsoft software problem?&nbsp; I have read the MS "fixes" on the support page for Bluetooth and they are, as usual, Comedy Central's version of computer support.&nbsp; Let's stop with the fixes from Veejay's high school age son and put some professional programmers
 on the job.&nbsp; No more support answers from the Best Marigold Hotel.&nbsp; Please!
                </div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m sorry for the inconvenience. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the Bluetooth is not working.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the below information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you getting any error message/code?<br />
</p>
<p>2. Did&nbsp;you make any changes&nbsp;to the&nbsp;PC prior to this issue? </p>
<div>3. Are you&nbsp;facing this issue on a local account or the Microsoft account?</div>
<div>4. Have&nbsp;you&nbsp;installed all pending updates on the pc?</div>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to run the Hardware troubleshooter:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Press Windows key+X.<br />

e.&nbsp;From the list, click on hardware and devices.<br />
f.&nbsp;Run the troubleshooter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to check the services for Bluetooth:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Press Windows key+R.<br />
b.&nbsp;Type services.msc and press enter.<br />
c.&nbsp;From the list, check the service for Bluetooth support.<br />
d.&nbsp;Right click on it, and click on properties.<br />
e.&nbsp;In startup type, select automatic.<br />
f.&nbsp;Under service status, select start.<br />
g.&nbsp;Click on apply and then ok and check if it helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Uninstall and Reinstall the Bluetooth Drivers<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to uninstall and reinstall the driver:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Uninstall the Bluetooth Device Drivers<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard.<br />
b) Click on “Device Manager” from that list.<br />
c) Search for the Bluetooth device from the device list, right click on it and then select “Uninstall”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “Delete the driver software for this device” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers
 from the computer.<br />
d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the restart, you may again open the Device Manager and then click on the “Scan for hardware changes” button at the top of the Device Manager window and check if Windows 8.1 detects the Bluetooth device and installs an appropriate driver for it automatically.
 If that happens, then check if it resolves the issue. If the issue persists, then go with the next step.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.<br />
b) Type “Updates” in the search bar and click on the icon “Windows Update” from the search result.<br />
c) On the “Windows Update” window, click on the link: “Check for updates” from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.<br />
d) If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.<br />
If Windows Update does not offer the latest Windows 8.1 driver, then try the next step.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Update Driver Software from the Manufacturer’s website:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Lenovo website and search for the latest Windows 8.1 drivers available for the device model and then install it by following the instructions given in the website. You may click on this link to download the latest drivers for the Bluetooth device:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If Bluetooth is turned on, and the driver is up to date, but your device still doesn’t work, try removing the device and re-pairing it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Go to Start screen.</p>
<p>b. Enter Devices and&nbsp;select Bluetooth.</p>
<p>c. Select the device, then&nbsp;select Remove device, and then try pairing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Make sure that the Bluetooth-enabled audio device is on and discoverable. How you do this varies with devices, so check the info that came with your device or go to the manufacturer’s website.

<p>From what I have heard from reviews and from friends that have the game, it is much better than Dragon Rising. The AI is still mentally challenged in this one but if you are playing co-op with friends it is one of the most challenging and realistic military
 shooters you will ever play. That is what Gametrailers said.</p>

<p>Get it from Gamefly so we can play! I have it from Gamefly but I haven't opened it yet. Looking for people to play co-op with.</p>

<p>Isaac, This is what I think of the game, keep in mind though that this was addressed to OXM in their forum...that is who I was speaking too.</p>
<p>"As a subscriber for a while now I pay attention to your magazine's reviews and use them partly in making my decision on whether I am going to purchase a game or not.</p>
<p>In regards to your operation flashpoint red river review I "almost" passed on this game, and I must say I am glad I did not. &nbsp;As a former "Squid" I have to say the radio chatter is the most authentic and close to real life I have ever heard in my 30 years
 of gaming in any video game. &nbsp;Now I realize that if you have not served then you would not know that however to discuss how much "cursing" there is and other negative things that were said about this game I see none of them. &nbsp;I have not had 1 single glitch,
 the explosions, the blood spatter, the radio comms and even the graphics are top notch, not to mention the bullet physics, This game truly does make call of duty's look and play like a joke.</p>
<p>I even used a tactic that the Vietcong used on us in vietnam and to whomever programmed it in the game that it actually worked deserves credit for it...and if the person who reviewed this game knew anything about military history or had just spent a little
 bit more time on it they would have seen the things that I saw, again I dont expect video game geeks to understand everything but I do expect that if something is not understood then dont make it negative. &nbsp;Maybe a reviewer that has just an ounce of experience
 in the military should review these types of games in the future, &nbsp;Just my opinion and a helpful suggestion."</p>
<p>Again, this is "my" opinion which might not be the same as most.</p>

<p><span>If you are a fan of Op <span>Flashpoint</span> games then I think you will enjoy red river. The game as not changed much from dragon rising. The commanding mode is still the same, but the AI in your squad is a lot better they almost think for there
 self when your to busy in a gun fight to tell them what to do.</span></p>
<p><span>The game as no head to head <span>multiplayer</span>, just Co-op, but there are
<span>alot</span> of game modes you and your friends can enjoy. I completed the main campaign from start to finish in co-op with 3 of my friends.
</span></p>
<p><span>The only issue I had was after a couple of weeks playing it,&nbsp;my friends and I became bored of the game modes, I went back to battlefield and my friends went back to COD. And I ended up trading it in for something else.</span></p>

<p>Skype 8.23 for a windows 7 pro laptop.&nbsp; This version was installed automatically via upgrade without my knowledge, apparently on June 17, 2018.&nbsp; This is also the date that the welcome/login screen changed, to a vertical blue box with a big Microsoft logo.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The blue box has a name and requires only that I select the name that is presented.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All upgrades prior to this one, over 14 years, were done after I logged in for any given instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recent message box that requires me to allow program changes appears when I try to open Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous upgrades did not operate that way; I would be logged in and then upgrades would run automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I could determine the version number was to check the application via the control panel, given that I could not login to Skype. &nbsp;

<p><span><span>This new Skype application is updated each time a new version is released. The update requires administrative privileges, and therefore you are receiving this UAC prompt. Here is
 an example of such UAC prompt, which appears when I start Skype in "As Administrator" mode. In your case, the prompt is triggered by an update.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>I appreciate your help and information.&nbsp; And what you provide appears to suggest that this is all okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I still have some questions, given that any updates I've seen to skype on my machines over many years have not taken this approach, have
 not presented me with a UAC window.&nbsp; The updates have simply been run as soon as I login, without asking me to allow the program to change things on my computer(s), but in any case allowing me to login.&nbsp; Hence, can you answer:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When did this new update approach start, from Microsoft?</li><li>Is this new approach only for Windows?&nbsp;&nbsp; Colleagues who use Mac have not encountered this.&nbsp;
</li><li>Does this apparently new application update approach coincide with the change that occurred about a month ago, in which the blue vertical box (with Microsoft logo) appeared when I started the program each time?</li><li>The new login approach that began a month ago appears to be configured, not by me, to have different requirements for entering skype name and password, as compared with the old way. &nbsp; Before I encountered this update roadblock a few days ago, I did some
 exploring and was unable to to find ways to change these login steps.&nbsp; Auto login or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Password required or not.&nbsp; Skype name required or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions?</li><li>I believe, not yet with certainty, that the new look I encountered a month ago, inside the application, makes it more difficult to edit contacts details.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, adding prefixes to skype names so as to allow particular sorting and collocating.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Is this your experience? </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Are you getting any error message/ error code while upgrading to Windows 10?</span></li></ul>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I would suggest you to install the latest monitor drivers from the manufacturer website and then try to upgrade to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation Tool can be used to create a USB
 or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page:
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When upgrading to Windows 10 using media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to boot from media, you must have upgraded
 to Windows 10 previously. Boot from Windows 10 media directly without upgrading to Windows 10 previously is not supported and will have activation issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Aero is Automatically disabling with 4 Monitors - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Aero is Automatically disabling with 4 Monitors</h2>
                    So here's my machine:<br />
<br />
i7 920<br />
Geforce GTX 275<br />
Geforce GT9800<br />
12GB DDR3<br />
<br />
Should be able to run anything, no sweat.<br />
<br />
But when I try to hook up 4 Monitors Windows Aero automatically disables with the error message:
<em>"The color scheme has been changed to Windows Basic - The current color scheme has exceeded its allowed memory so the color scheme has been automatically changed to improve performance."<br />
<br />
</em>How do I allocate more memory? <br />
How do I stop it Auto disabling?<em><br />
<br />
</em>I dont want to be told that it's because my graphics cards arn't good enough cause Aero works fine on them independantly.

<p>Hi Gaiseric,<br />
<br />
If you receive a message that some visual elements, such as window frame transparency, have been turned off, or if you receive a message that the theme has been changed to the Basic theme, one of the following might have happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>A program that you're running is incompatible with Aero themes. When this happens, some visual elements are automatically turned off. When the program is no longer running, the visual elements that were turned off are turned on again automatically.
</li><li>Your laptop might be running low on battery power. Windows might turn off Aero themes or window transparency to save battery power.
</li><li>Your computer's hardware configuration or screen resolution was changed. If you changed your screen resolution, video card, or monitor setup, your computer might no longer meet the minimum recommendations for running Aero themes.
</li><li>Your computer doesn't have enough memory to run all of the programs that you have open and also run an Aero theme. If Windows automatically changed your theme to the Basic theme, and you want to change it back to an Aero theme, close some windows to free
 up memory, and then follow the steps in the link below. </li></ul>

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t boot- Stuck on Keyboard selection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich and  daynastaiert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot- Stuck on Keyboard selection</h2>
                    <p>I uninstalled a printer driver today. In order to complete the removal it asked me to reboot my computer. However, my computer now freezes on a screen that says to choose a keyboard layout. The mouse and keyboard are non-functional at this point as nothing
 in the USB drives will work. I can't do anything to get past this screen. Seems like there is an issue in Windows 10 but I can't figure out how to correct the problem. I don't have a Windows 10 disk as I got the free upgrade and I don't have a disk with the
 older version of windows either. Another user had a similar problem and recommended downloading windows 10 onto a boot USB/CD in order to reinstall Windows 10. however, my table (Microsoft Surface) will not run the Media Creation Tool because there isn't an
 app for that in order to create the version of Windows 10 to fix the desktop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the site I tried to use in order to get a version of Windows 10: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be very helpful as the computer is totally useless at this point!

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to boot to Windows desktop,&nbsp;I suggest you to download the <strong>
Windows 10 ISO </strong>and create a Media Creation tool from&nbsp;another computer and then perform Automatic Repair using the same ISO media.</p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Refer to the section <strong>Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool&nbsp;</strong>in the above article for creating the tool).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to
<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>, do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the
<strong>Install Windows</strong> page, tap or click <strong>Repair your computer </strong>
link to start the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2.&nbsp;In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
3.&nbsp;Click, <strong>Advanced Options </strong>and then click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
4.&nbsp;After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> There will be no data loss by performing Startup repair. It will format c: driver and reinstall Windows 10. It will remove all the installed apps and updates.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You might require to change the <strong>
boot priority </strong>in BIOS in order to allow the computer to boot from CD/DVD or USB.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            microsoft xbox one minecraft full game gift card</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Microsoft xbox one Minecraft gift card for $19.99 at Target. The card tells me to scratch off the back to reveal a pin number and then to go to the website https://code.giftcards.com and put in my pin number and email address and that will
 give me the 25 digit code I need to download the game on xbox one. The problem is that the website does not work properly. When I put in my code, it continues to give me a message saying we can not process your request please try again later. I have been trying
 since November 2nd and it is now November 7th. The website does not have a number to call and the gift card itself also does not have a number to call. I have tried filling out the email form on the website and have checked my email and spam folder but still
 have not received a response. I have tried taking the card back to Target and they cannot help me since I've already scratched off the back to reveal the pin number. They did however tell me that they have a lot of problems with these Microsoft gift cards.
 I have also talked to 4 different people at Microsoft and no one has been able to help me. I am beyond frustrated at this point and out $20. I have no idea why you sell a Microsoft xbox one gift card with a random pin # which then tells me to go to a different
 company website (Blackhawk network) instead of just letting me scratch off the back to reveal the 25 digit code I need. Microsoft customer support continues to tell me that this is not one of their cards but it is because it clearly says Microsoft on it. Here
 is a link to one of the cards on the Target website- https://www.target.com/p/minecraft-xbox-one-digital/-/A-53214870</p>
<p>Can anyone at Microsoft please help me?! </p>

<p>Hi Jenny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. Do try redeeming the code from another device and another connection, it could be that either the device or connection you are using could affect the website interaction. If the issue persists its recommended to contact the distributor
 of the card your purchased about issues with it, since the code is not a 25-digit Microsoft token, we would not be able to assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how this goes, thanks again.</p>

<p>This right here does not have anything to do with Microsoft - (The card tells me to scratch off the back to reveal a pin number and then to go to the website https://code.giftcards.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears is a site related to how Target has their gift cards setup. Walmart does a similar thing, they have their own site for their own cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to work with the company that you got the card from. Once you redeem their custom code correctly, then you'll get a 25 character Microsoft code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither Xbox nor Microsoft can do anything about your Target code until you get your 25 character code.</p>

    <title>Computer hangs downloading Microsoft malicious removal tool update on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> midnightgemini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer hangs downloading Microsoft malicious removal tool update on Windows Vista</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Monthly Microsoft's Malicious Removal Tool won't download (July &amp; August)</strong></p>
<p>Both in July and August, on Patch Tuesday, when downloading Microsoft's malicious removal tool, the download begins, and then just "hangs".&nbsp; I've waited for 30 minutes or longer for the download to complete, but it just continues to "hang."&nbsp; I then cancel
 the download, but the download window pops up a minute later showing it's downloading, and it's just hanging again. I've had to resort to using alt + ctr + delete to go to the task manager to stop the process, and once after doing that I got the blue screen
 of death.</p>
<p>I've never had problems with the malcious tool removal downloads. I still use the same virus protection company (Trend Micro) and the free version of Malwarebytes. I've since used both programs and ran scans and have been given clean bills of health from
 both programs.</p>
<p>Should I try turning off Trend Micro and Malwarebytes and then try downloading the August Malicious Tool Removal update?</p>
<p>If someone says yes, try that, what should I do if the download continues to just sit there, and hang as it has previously done? Using task manager requires using it several times to make the process stop, and then I must reboot several times, in safe mode
 in order for my pc to function properly.</p>
<p>Rather scared about what is happening.&nbsp; I am using Vista SP2. I have tried to download the tool remover in 2 different administrative accounts and still have the problem.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>MSRT is a Malware scanner that only scan and remove top and sever Malware and infection and NOT all and it is also scanner only NOT real time protection&nbsp; , therefore you will need Anti-Malware and it should be on.</p>
<p>Check your system date and time and make sure it is correct also do defragnment and clean up and make sure you have enough space in harddisk .</p>
<p>If problem happen contact Microsoft Update Support.</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>MidnightGemini,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to Cyber_defend_team’s response</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 web browser are you using? Internet Explorer</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 this issue confined only to this particular download?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you able to install other Windows Updates without any issues?<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, the issue could be related to multiple security softwares present on the computer which may be conflicting Update download process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>Disable the security softwares;
 follow the steps mentioned in the link below</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable-antivirus-software</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Enable
 the security software back once everything is done.</span></p>
<p><span>We need to figure out if the security software is causing this issue so, if the download hangs again, kill the process using task manager as you previous did.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>Boot the computer in safe mode
 with networking and check to see if the issue persists. To do this, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>Access the advanced boot options menu by turning on your computer and pressing the&nbsp;<strong>F8 key</strong> before
<span>Windows</span> starts. On the advanced boot options menu select&nbsp;</span><strong><span>safe mode with networking</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Let me know if the issue persists in this mode.</span></p>

<p>RE: Cyber Defend teams response... I regularly defragment and disk clean-up my pc. I also have lots of room left on my hard drive.. I have almost&nbsp;3 Gigs of room left. I also use CCleaner on a daily basis.</p>
<p>RE: Ajay K</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; I use Internet Explorer and MSN Explorer as browsers. When downloading any Microsoft updates, I am assuming that it is done through Internet Explorer.. I use MSN Explorer for my Home page and for email receiving and sending. I have been using this system
 set-up since purchasing this pc 3 years ago, with no problems in download Microsofts updates.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; When installing Microsoft updates, all updates download correctly... only the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool do not update correctly. This problem began in July and now is happening again in August.&nbsp; All previous monthly Malicious Removal Tool updates
 downloaded correctly.&nbsp; Because I first had this problem in July with the Malcious Tool Removal download, this month in August, I downloaded all of the other Microsoft updates first, then after they finished downloading correctly, I went back and tried to download
 the August Malicious Tool Removal download by itself, but I ran into the same problem as I did in July with it "hanging." &nbsp;In July, all of the downloads went smoothly, until it got to the Malicious Tool Removal update, then that one "hung" and would not finish
 downloading. I did check my Update history, and all downloads for July and August show they downloaded correctly, and the July and August downloades for the Malcious Tool Removal updates show that they were canceled.</p>
<p>3) Yes, I am able to download all of Microsoft's updates, except the Malicous Tool Removal updates. I have 4 administrative accounts with 1 of those accounts just created a few weeks ago, and I tried downloading the malicious tool removal update in 2 older
 administrative accounts and also in the new account with no luck.</p>
<p>I will try your steps.. I will close out Trend Micro and Malwarebytes and try&nbsp;to download the malcious tool removal update&nbsp;and will then re-enable them if the download goes through.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your assistance, and for speaking to me in terms I understand :-) I will report back on my progress with this problem. Mary</p>
<p>There was one item I forgot to mention in my original question... is it necessary for me to download both the July and August Malicious Tool Removal updates, or can I just download the August update one? Also... I've read that after a monthly malcious tool
 removal has been downloaded, that the next time you turn on your pc, you will see a balloon that indicates the scan is in process... I have never seen a balloon and have no idea if the scan has been done or not. Is there anyway to detect if the scan has actually
 happened?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll reply back with the results of trying to download with virus/spyware programs turned off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best way is to let Windows Update chose , if Windows update offer both July and August download both but usually you need latest one only that contain all preview months. You won't see interface of scanning but when you restart your PC and it start then
 it will do scan. If threat detect it will show you that a new Malware detect and removed.</p>

<p>Ajay K... update</p>
<p>I temporarily closed Trend Micro, but could not find any way to close Malwarebytes without deleting the entire program, so I left Malwarebytes open. I attempted to download the August Malicious Tool Removal update and it did the same as before... it hung.&nbsp;
 The bar that shows the progress of the download does nothing.&nbsp; I waited 30 minutes to see if it would download, and then I clicked on the cancel button but it would not cancel, so I then used task manager to shut the download down.</p>
<p>I then opened up the Windows Update program and&nbsp; instead of seeing the update information, I saw the download window for the malicious tool remover and it was still hanging... so again I used task manager to shut the download down. (task manager showed the
 download was still running)</p>
<p>I then went to start, and clicked restart and got this message, "Please do not power off or unplug your machine. Installing update 1 of 1."&nbsp; (there were two periods that would move from left to right next to that message, which I assumed meant it was downloading
 the update)</p>
<p>I timed this process and it took 25 minutes and then my sign in window came up.&nbsp; I signed in and checked windows update history and it shows the August malicious tool removal as being successfully downloaded.</p>
<p>My concern now is why is the download of the tool still downloading 30 minutes later, then I close the download out, and then it takes another 30 minutes to do the download.&nbsp;When I initiate the download, nothing lets me close it out... I can't cancel it
 and task&nbsp;manager seems to stop it, but actually it is not stopping it. &nbsp;All previous downloads of malicious tool removals have taken like 1 to 2 minutes to download.. now they are taking over an hour and that's with me using task manager several times to attempt
 to stop the download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am concerned that every month I will have this problem. For now, the August download is done, and I'm going to skip the July download for fear of getting the Blue Screen of Death again.</p>
<p>Any suggestions or fixes on what might be causing this type of download to take so long would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks for your help!&nbsp; Mary</p>

<p>Cyber Defend.. I had problems with letting Windows "automatically" download new downloads, so I prefer to do the downloads at a time when I know other programs are not running. I did finally get the August download done but with problems .&nbsp;(see my note above
 to Ajay update)</p>
<p>I knew that the scan would happen the next time I restarted my pc, but I read that a balloon would alert you that it was scanning, and I never see a balloon.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea of how long the scan takes to run?&nbsp; My virus program takes 2 hours 10 minutes, and so does Malwarebytes. I do the scans weekly, sometimes several times per week, but on my schedule, not an automatic schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!&nbsp; Mary</p>

<p>MSRT would&nbsp;NOT show any message of scanning after installed , it ONLY shows message if something detect and remove and in other cases nothing would show up of scanning. About that problem of slow performance try to contact Trend Marco support and make sure
 you have the latest version&nbsp; of it.</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;</span><span>Mary,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>The
 update is cumulative</span></strong><span>, meaning it is not necessary to install the previous version of the tool when updated version is already installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Malicious
 Software Removal Tool runs in quiet mode. (Only)&nbsp; <strong>If it detects malicious software on your computer</strong>, the next time that you log on to your computer as a computer administrator, a balloon will appear in the notification area to make you aware
 of the detection. If you have not been notified of an infection, no malicious software has been found that needs your attention.</span></p>
<p><span>By checking a registry key,<strong>you can determine whether the tool has been run on a computer</strong> and which version was the
 latest version that was used. For more information, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></p>

            <p>February 2015 Malicious Software Removal Tool is exhibiting the same behaviour now, some 4.5 years later (more or less)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also dld 'd the two Office Compatibility Security Updates, today, no problems, then the 2/15 MSRT hangs without completing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have checked the automatic update, background (BIT) download, Windows Event and Installer Services are all on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running MSE, Microsoft Security Essentials, latest definitions update, scanned system last night with no "hits" and it has never been a problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Closing update window to at least complete the first OFFICE Compatibility Pack Security Updates, and will try MSRT for 2/15 again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or workarounds, possible causes, or any OOTB (Outside Of The Box) insights, theories?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes I am running an OLD Dell XPS-Z 800 MHz PIII, but I have 3 GB freespace on the "C" windows hdd, and WXPPro-SP3 with all previous updates, patches, etc.</p>

<p>
</p><p>By the time I logged off this page and closed other MS webpages, the Update Windows, with MSRT for 2/15 the 3/3 updates, had completed and closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>False query, I believe -- will check with Update Services when I restrart the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, perhaps amount of data and speed of system it took ca. 70-90 minutes for the 2/15 MSRT monthly update to complete?</p>

<p>Hey Tania,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. Unfortunately, since the Windows 10 and Switch versions of Minecraft are on different platforms, you will need to purchase the latter in order to play with your friend.&nbsp;</p>

There is 11 different versions (console types) of Minecraft.&nbsp; Each one is a separate purchase.&nbsp; While there is cross play between all of the types, it still requires a different purchase for each console (or PC) type.

            As mentioned you will need your own copy for the switch. My son loves this game way to much, He's glued to his Switch. Cross play still has certain requirements that need to be met. You can always check the Official Mojang site for more info as well.&nbsp;

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I recently had what seems like it was a somewhat common problem, where my computer wouldn't let me log on, and when loading safe mode it stalled for a while on crcdisk.sys. I did a few system restores, but they never seemed to work, so I did one back as
 far as I could. Everything has been fine since, aside from the Network, Volume and Power icons missing from the taskbar. It seems to function normally in all three ways, I just can't see the icons.</p>
<p><strong><span>I have checked the properties, and the bars were grayed out, I also attempted to follow<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/01/01/fix-network-clock-volume-and-power-battery-system-icons-missing-with-disabled-or-grayed-out-check-box-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">a

            The registry keys should be there somewhere. Try searching for the strings on the registry editor that is: In the Registry Editor, Edit menu -&gt; Find -&gt; Find what: Type, "HideSCAVolume" (without the quotes).

<h2>            Mouse cursor has disappeared and second monitor isn&#39;t working in Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: no cursor + other problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somebody please give me a good reason to keep that POS W8. My computer has now decided that it will no longer display the cursor, also the second monitor has decided that it no longer wishes to display after the P.O.S.T. I have very limited use of my keyboard.
 I have attempted to do a System Restore, but W8 displays a menu of 3 selections to choose from, unfortunately the cursor keys will not work on this type of menu. I have 2 wireless mice to use on my computer and neither one will work, one is a&nbsp;Dell that came
 with the computer, the other is a Logitech MX700. I have attempted to reinstall the Logitech, but that function is not possible.&nbsp;Monitor #2 as I say function stops displaying after the P.O.S.T., I then get a No Signal message and the power&nbsp;light turns to amber.&nbsp;I
 need some assistance from someone out there that is obviously more intelligent than I. Thank you ahead of time and have a very peaceful day.</p>

<h2>            The Boot Configuration Data file is missing with error code  0xc0000034</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Boot problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an msi GP72 2QE Leopard Pro bought last November. I have got a problem with it since yesterday. When starting, after showing the msi logo, a bleu screen appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your PC/Device needs to be repaired</p>
<p>The Boot Configuration Data file is missing some required information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File: \BCD</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000034</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your PC administrator or PC/Device manufacturer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a recovery CD (dumb, I know :/), but I do have a copy of Windows 8. I've tried different repair tools, but none of them seem to work. I've even tried installing Windows 8, formatting my hard drive (which I guess was a bit hasty, but I wanted
 the computer to work yesterday), but that also didn't work (I don't remember the error code, it had something to do with the boot).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know what could be the cause of this problem? Is there a relatively quick way to solve this or is this likely a hardware problem and should I return it to the shop?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply! I've tried starting my laptop without external devices and I'm always plugged, I didn't see any difference unfortunately.
</p>
<p>I've downloaded and the ISO file and burned it on a dvd, but it appears not to be bootable. Also installing my old copy of Windows 8 didn't work either way. That's why I'm fearing this might be a hardware problem? Is that possible?</p>

<h2>            SKYPE 8 MAC - Skype number not working - busy - REFUND &#40;and apologies&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a UK Skype number (0151 528 5670) but when the number is called, a voice announces the number is busy. As I check the possible reasons in your support page, I find that the Privacy settings should be changed, BUT BUT unfortunately the Skype for
 Mac version 8 does NOT support privacy settings anymore. Yes, not supported ...(I use
<span>Skype version 8.18.0.6)</span></p>
<span>Skype version 8.18.0.6)</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Well, any suggestion before refunding the cost of the number ??? I look forward to a prompt action on your part :)</p>
<p>And obviously apologising for the waste of time and usual unprofessional way of selling unavailable products? Should this not be mentioned in CAPITAL letters BEFORE selling it? Good to see the MSFT virus has spread to Skype :).</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t add or delete Outlook.com account&#47;alias in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eureka&#33;&#33;&#33;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add or delete Outlook.com account&#47;alias in Windows 10 mail app</h2>
                    <p>I just created a new alias in Outlook.com and set it as my default address.&nbsp; Next time I restarted my Win10 PC, I was prompted to fix the account.&nbsp; I tried, but was told by an error message I'd have to delete the old account and add a new one.&nbsp; Sounds reasonable,
 but this is Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to delete the old account.&nbsp; I can delete other accounts, but not the one the app wants me to fix or delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, when I attempt to add the new address/alias, I get Error code: 0x800ffff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to summarize, the Microsoft account is now broken in the Microsoft mail app.&nbsp; Microsoft guidance is to fix it, which Microsoft doesn't allow, and then to delete it, which Microsoft doesn't allow, and then to add back in correctly, which Microsoft doesn't
 allow.&nbsp; Who is steering the ship at Microsoft, and is he conscious?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to remove all the accounts and then try to create a new one and then make that account as a default account. Once you make that account as a default account, try to add the main account as default account and check if it's work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to the Microsoft article to delete the account from the outlook.com.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IE/windows/outlook/add-alias-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IE/windows/outlook/add-alias-account</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After deleting account try to add the account in the mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest you to run the app troubleshooter and then try to install all the updates and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem. Really would help if the basics were addressed. The settings are often impossible to change to how you want them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to delete the default account by adding another outlook account but there is not option to change the default account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried uninstalling and reinstalling but have the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would pull my hair out but I don't have any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please fix these problems.</p>

            <p>I have this exact issue, and I cannot find a solution at all. I know Windows 10 is quite new on the market, but I was expecting at least some sort of solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed to a new primary alias recently. While this alias is correctly reflected everywhere else on this machine, and my other two Win10 machines (Their mail apps work just fine too), my mail app on here is stuck on the old address, and is non-functioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am advised to delete the account, which there is no option to do. When I try to add my new outlook alias as a new account, I hit an "Error Code 0x8000FFFF".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really wish there was some sort of direction to tackle this, besides a reset. If I ever find a solution, I will update this post.</p>

            <p>Just found this fix from another thread;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same issue and found a reg key that has the alias email, I changed it and the mail and calendar app now uses the correct account</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click on the start button and type "regedit". Run the Registry Editor.</li><li>Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Active Sync -&gt; Partners then click on the folder that's underneath</li><li>&nbsp;look for one with a "Email" key that matches your Alias. &nbsp;Change the Email key in this account to correct one</li></ul>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>The error notification eventually went away after a few days and reboots, but this fixes the email displayed and the address new emails are sent from. I'm sure it would have fixed the original error. Was digging around in registry but only looked in Windows
 Mail folders...</p>

            I had the same problem. thanks for the help, it solved it. I find it quite strange though that one needs such level of sophistication to solve such a simple issue. Microsoft needs to put some more work into fixing these bugs

<h2>            Error code error 0x80072f7d in Calendar</h2>
                    <p>Good day</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated to Windows 10, and so far it seems relatively bug-less. I also love the new add an account feature in calendar where you can sync it with your other accounts, in my case my gmail account. However, when i try this it doesnt work....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on Settings&gt;accounts&gt;add account&gt;Google, then entered my details as prompted. It loaded my account stuff, then the moment i accept the permissions it asks for, it brings up an error message:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e33adb7c-d596-46c9-a2d2-57c15e1c9b23" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me what's going on and how one can merge one's accounts? (I am connected to the internet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, my Edge browser doesn't work either. It opens, loads, then closes within a few seconds. Any help on this would be appreciated as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Why it asks me for PIN after april update &#63;</h2>
                    <p>My PC asked me for some PIN after april update and I have never setup a PIN on it, moreover I had setup a PIN on an old laptop, I tried that PIN but it didnt work. My PC didnt even let me login with my password that I had set when installing it. I had to
 login with my microsoft account that I havent used in years and I barely could remember the password (thank god I didnt use a secure password). My question is .... WHY ? How can I revert to login with password ?</p>

            Hi bkas87, this is a bug in version 1803 . . .
<br />
<br />Cancel the PIN prompt and login to your PC
<br />
<br />Go to Windows Defender Security Centre icon on the tray. 
<br />
<br />Under 'Account Protection' go to  'Set up Windows Hello for faster, more secure sign-in'
<br />
<br />Click 'Set-up', it will prompt you to set up a pin - don't. 
<br />
<br />Click "Dismiss" 
<br />
<br />After that, there should be no more prompting at startup
