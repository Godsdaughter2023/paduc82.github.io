    <title>I have questions about creating shortcuts across multiple accounts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I have questions about creating shortcuts across multiple accounts without admin rights</h2>
                    <p>Ok. I have questions about this whole scenario but first let me lay down a series of events.&nbsp;<br />
First of all, I lost power at my house a little over a week ago at about 11:00 am. The place that I work also lost power at the same time. I was at home when the power went out and since I had nothing to do and it was snowing out, I went to bed. I work the
 night shift so the time was around when I go to bed normally just a little bit earlier then I would have liked. Apparently power was restored between 1:00 pm and 4:00 pm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go into work that night because by that time, 9:30 pm, the power has already been restored and work is still on. I get in and the first thing I do is check emails (Microsoft outlook 2010). Now I'm not technically supposed to be able to view my bosses emails
 but he trusts me and wants me to stay up to date on what is being sent back and forth since I am supposed to be in charge when he is not in. This lead me to check the sent emails to make sure that what we are supposed to send in every week has been finished.
 In the sent folder, I notice an email sent that morning at around 11:30 am to 12:00 pm (the time that both I and where I work had no power) containing information from one of the higher ups in the company. I bring this to the attention of my boss, who brings
 it to his boss, and so on until it gets to IT. While all of this is going on, I'm going about my work like normal, not thinking about the email or anything involving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next week I come in I find that all of the work accounts have had their passwords changed. All I think is "oh, ok, good. They must have found the problem and changed the passwords as a safety precaution." So I keep on working, learning the new passwords
 to the accounts I need to use, except for my bosses because he said he couldn't tell me. This seemed odd to me because it was never a problem with him before but I figured maybe he just wants to stay safe until we get more information on what happened. Now
 the end of the week rolls around and on Friday morning, I get called to the office. I wasn't sure what it was about. Did I get called in to go over one of my applications that I had submitted? Did I do something wrong that I didn't know was wrong at the time?
 Did I say something that was taken out of context and being used against me to get me in trouble? I have no idea. I get into hr and the first thing I am asked is "I bet your wondering why your here", to which I replied " yeah a little bit". "Well, your here
 because there has been a security breach in the system and it all links back to your personal email." At this point I'm more than a little concerned. From here on it is kind of a blur since this was a lot of information to take in at the time. From what I
 remember, I was told that there was a shortcut created from the higher ups account to my bosses account at about 11:50 am that was used to transfer files from the higher ups account to my bosses. From there it was sent to another account in the company via
 outlook. According to them, the shortcut was created with my personal email. They said that the word around the building is that another employee and myself were really good with computers and were like professional hackers. I like to think that I am good
 with computers... I am Not that good. I can't program but I can figure little things out like how to work around small problems, or use keyboard shortcuts to make my time on the computer easier and even build my own PCs. That's about it. They said that this
 has been a problem since 2013. (This entire conversation came with printed screenshots) the only thing I saw that linked me to my bosses account was that I had him send me some of the emails from work starting back in 2013 (coupons and holiday lists, little
 things that were small and safe). They proceeded to question me like a criminal and asked me if I was involved in any way, did I do it, do I know who did it, have I heard anyone saying they are good at hacking? Things like that. " if you tell us now it would
 be better for you in the long run". I have no idea what they are talking about and didn't even know this was possible without admin privileges. They told me to delete the personal email account that was linked to this incident to distance myself and if I'm
 not involved I shouldn't worry. I pointed out that I was the one who found the email and brought it to their attention, to which they replied "you could have done that to throw suspicion off of your self". Is this my life now, a bad spy movie or crappy sitcom?<br />
</p>
<p>So I guess my questions are, is this possible? How could my personal home email be used to create a link between 2 accounts at work? How could this be done without admin privileges? Should I have deleted that email or saved it for an investigation? Should
 I get authorities involved to cover myself? Should I go for a lawyer? Or is this only possible from the IT departments side and I'm just the scape goat? This entire scenario is foreign to me and I have no idea how to do any of this or how to proceed with this
 information. Help?<br />

            <p>The email was sent from my bosses account when he was not at work to another departments email. We have emails for each supervisor and and collective emails for each departments leads. So as an example, if there is a shipping department, the supervisor for
 each shift would have his own email provided from the company and their leads would all have one communal email to share between them. But each department has the same setup and the leads from each departmet have their own communal email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all of the emails associated with my place of work are connected to the same network through Citrix. We have servers that house the bulk of the data but use little server boxes to log into each account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The passwords that were changed were the passwords to log into each account. When I say account it kind of appears to me like how you would make multiple accounts on one computer. Like if you create your own login on a new computer and other logins for other
 family members. Yours would be the main account or admin, while theirs would just be little accounts. Unless I am wrong, I am not a part of the it department so it is kind of hard for me to tell.</p>

                    I recently had a Microsoft update plus I installed a commercial program and I also checked for a possible trojan where it was mentioned that it would put a strange file in the System32 folder. I noted the following files were in the system32 folder (i.e.
 7B296FB0-376B-497e-B012-9C450E1B7327-2P-0.C7483456-A289-439d-8115-601632D005A0<br />

The files cannot be moved/copied or deleted as windows states they are being used by another program. I&nbsp;could&nbsp;delete them if I booted into Safe CMD mode but they just came back again.<br />
<br />
Also, I then got a message that my copy of "windows was not genuine". (This aspect seems to have been fixed with help from Darin.)<br />
<br />
So what are these files?? Are they part of a virus/trojan etc or harmless? (I've tried 3 anti-virus programs and none seems to be able to recognise it.)<br />
<br />

    <title>Video Connection Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> strikehawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Connection Issue</h2>
                    Hello I need help with a situation when it comes to video with Skype. I have it for my main computer when I'm doing a video call, it has it where it says poor connection with me and the caller. Even the person I'm doing a video chat with has it where it
 says poor connection, has it where it even will freeze or slow thing or cut off. I thought it was my wifi but I got out my laptop and it used the same wifi, for my laptop it doesn't have a problem and its with the same person I'm calling for video so I don't
 have a problem with video chat with my wifi. I try to replace the connection that my computer used to connect to the wifi which is a netgear i put in but I'm still having an issue. Any idea what could be the cause of this.

            Try connecting wired to see if anything changes. Allowing Skype explicitly in any firewall software, might rectify the problem. Background applications that consume a lot of system resources may have an effect on your connection or the response time of
 the application. Any of these types of delays, might create issues.

            Ok I try to turn off some things like my firewall during the video chat and other things like creative cloud. It was going well but i saw a bit of slow but then I had it where my computer crash during the video as in the screen went black and cut off for
 the person I was talking about. He was doing a screen share showing me what was on his screen. Could that have anything to do with it.

<h2>            Can&#39;t uninstall Twitter App double</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a recent windows update, like one week ago, a problem occured with the twitter app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, a second app is appeard in my Launchmenu, and bothering me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a quick video to show my issue :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://streamable.com/unv5m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://streamable.com/unv5m</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So basically, one app works fine, and the second cannot be uninstall. It's only an icon who link to the store but it's really bothering me.</p>
<p>There is a way to delete this icon, or simply hide it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to list the app with powershell but the bug app doesn't appear in the list. It's like an artefact of an old version who doesn't want to disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My laptop is a Surface Pro 4 with Win10 Pro 16299.</p>

            Hi Laura
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Since October 2016, Skype accounts are now linked to Microsoft Accounts just like other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive. 
<br />
<br />Since then, Yahoo, Gmail and Facebook are no longer supported options for signing into Skype. 
<br />
<br />If you attempted to sign in, it would require that you migrate your Yahoo account to a Microsoft Account.

            Hi PENNY
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support on this issue. (This is not a bot support but staffed by human agents)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea9ab06f-f334-401e-a5d7-662c9c45de0e?upload=true" />

<p>I hope both these (<i>and more</i>) make a return. Also, having Mastodon back for the Threepeat would be pretty awesome. And thank you lord for finally having a Tank that actually crushes cars. Only took half a decade into the "<i> next gen
</i>", but it looks worth the wait. </p>
<p>So, any hidden gems you'd like to see return?</p>

<h3> stacy purcella  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows key &#43; Ctrl &#43; D - can I delete this shortcut&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am a court reporter, and one of the main editing functions in my reporting software is Ctrl + D. However, a lot of times I accidentally press the Windows key + Ctrl + D since the Windows key and Ctrl are right next to each other on my keyboard. But when
 this happens, it shuts my reporting software down. Then when I open it back up and go to the file I was working on, it gives me an error message saying it can't open the file in read-only mode or something similar to that. And the only way I can get back to
 that file is to restart my computer.<br />
<br />
I understand the keyboard shortcut (Windows key + Ctrl + D) is a new one for Windows 10. Is there any way to delete this shortcut?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Light keeps flashing.</h2>
                    <p>Hey. &nbsp;I'm at my wits end on this one. &nbsp;Just like the title says, my Xbox One light keeps flashing at me for no reason. &nbsp;It doesn't matter what I'm doing, whether Netflix or playing an actual game on it. &nbsp;The light keeps flashing like it's trying to sync the controller on it, when I&nbsp;usually have it hard wired into the USB port. &nbsp;The sync button is free of anything that could hold it down, and my controllers are as well. &nbsp;Has anyone else had this issue? &nbsp;I've looked up many solutions on Google, but it just gives me the situations where it's flashing while it's off. &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />

<strong>1.</strong> If you are doing ANY over-clocking STOP - set all back to the usual factory<br />
recommendations.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Strongly suspect memory - try using the old memory - reduce the new memory<br />
to less to see if the issue clears up. Remember memory tests do not detect all<br />
errors though be sure to run memtest.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Try to resolve why DriverVerifier is locking up - that may be connected to the<br />
actual BSOD issues. Use Clean Boot as previously suggested.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Kaspersky could be playing a role - uninstall it and run their removal tool to see<br />
if that has any effect. <br />
<br />
Kaspersky Removal Tool<br />

<br />
</a><strong>5.</strong> Check with GigaByte Support, their on-line documentation, drivers, and<br />
diagnostics. Check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and<br />
the major on-board and separate device drivers (see driver update methods<br />
in the&nbsp;previously posted troubleshooter).<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = F2a<br />
BiosReleaseDate = 03/05/2009 &lt;- update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers,<br />
and the major on-board and separate device drivers.<br />
SystemManufacturer = Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.<br />
SystemProductName = GA-MA790X-UD4<br />
BaseBoardManufacturer = Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.<br />
BaseBoardProduct = GA-MA790X-UD4<br />
<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Use the other methods in the troubleshooters below and those previously
<br />
posted.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 109 &lt;- see the previously posted troubleshooters.<br />
</strong><br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>BCCode: 1E&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001E&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remove ALL power and reseat all the cards, memory, and cables (both ends when<br />
possible)</strong> - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Those are for a PC and about all<br />
that can be done for a laptop is reseat the memory and clear the vents. Make sure the BIOS,<br />
low level chipset drivers, and major device drivers are all up to date by check manually at the<br />
makers' sites.</p>
<p>Many Bluescreens are caused by&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers<br />
which are not the most current even though the computer is new. Check manually for updates<br />
using the methods for updates as&nbsp;indicated in the troubleshooter linked above and/or the
<br />
methods below (which are the same).<br />
<strong><br />
</strong><br />
<strong>BCCode: 1E&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001E<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>This is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT
<p>An unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT
<p>A breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
<p>A memory access violation occurred. (Parameter 4 of the bug check is the address that the driver attempted to access.)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>ntstatus.h </em>file located in the<em>inc</em> directory of the Windows Driver Kit.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p><em>If you are not equipped to debug this problem</em>, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video adapters.
 Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you may find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should pinpoint the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, this indicates that a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure a kernel debugger
 is connected and the system is started with the<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame will supply additional information.</p>
<p>If the specific cause of the exception is unknown, the following should be considered:</p>
<p><em>Hardware incompatibility. </em>First, make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</p>
<p><em>Faulty device driver or system service. </em>In addition, a faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS
 file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, the service can be removed by starting the system using the Recovery Console and deleting the offending
 system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve the error. You should also run hardware
 diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is a system BIOS incompatibility. BIOS problems can be resolved by upgrading the system BIOS version.</p>

<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000003b<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0x3B: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION<br />
<br />
</strong>Try removing and reseating all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug (on a PC) and clean out the dust bunnies and&nbsp;vents. On<br />
a laptop about all that can be done is reseat the memory and clean the vents. (Of course remove<br />
ALL power prior to opening the case.)<br />
<br />
<strong>3b is usually a graphic's driver (display adapter/video driver), other possibilities include<br />
but are not limited to antivirus/antispyware/security programs and even memory (mapping).<br />
<br />
BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000003b<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>This error has been linked to excessive paged pool usage and may occur due to user-mode graphics drivers crossing over and passing bad data to the kernel code.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000003b&nbsp; &lt;-- read this link<br />

<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
My best guess is memory though there could be two or more causes of the <br />
issues.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

Thanks, but I tried that, it seems to fixes the errors. However, it does not fix the problem. IF I run it again, it does the same thing all over again clears and nothing happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after clearing caches,&nbsp; WU&nbsp;seems&nbsp;Stop&nbsp; on 0% and does not updates It notices
 me that I have update but will not load&nbsp;at all. I was able to load Silverlight update manually thru Catalog, But Windows Defender, and 1607 updates will not load.&nbsp; I also&nbsp;have reinstalled the windows 10 program and resulted in&nbsp;the same problem. This all began
 with the anniversary update, it has&nbsp; also caused a problem with my&nbsp;outlook&nbsp; which is on&nbsp;off online and has not been able to work.&nbsp; Any other idea?

<h2>            Sound not working and Settings app crashes on App Volume and Device Preferences</h2>
                    My Windows version is given as Windows 10 - Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.765).&nbsp; Two days ago (May 14), after installing several updates via Windows Update, my system sound stopped working.&nbsp; I can't get any sound from either the built-in speakers or through

            Hi Oliver.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Let's fix your Sound while at the same time finding out what's corrupted your Settings app which can go to the install or the account:  
<br />
<br />A.  Re-register the Settings app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br /> B. If the Settings app keeps closing or malfunctioning then also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />C.  I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems.  If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1)  Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Next try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Good morning XBOX Live forum. I am the Gamer Tag user <strong>[mod removed] </strong>
and have been services with your company for 4-5 years. My account was stolen from 5 weeks ago Sunday night as mentioned in the case number
<strong>[mod removed]</strong>. I am the original owner of that account. Now I understand your investigation's team's conversation that I am not able to recover the account over a &nbsp;"factitious" name registered on the account but I can assure you I am the original
 owner based on being the owner of the billing information. Please do not turn me away as I paid and worked for that account for 4-5 years of loyal service.</p>

            <p>Go into Device Manager and find the IEEE 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller line.&nbsp; Click on the little triangle in from of it to expand the entry.</p>
<p>It should read VIA 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller....&nbsp; right click on that line and then on the icon to Update Driver software.</p>
<p>If it still cannot find the correct driver, you can always 'force' the issue.... from the right click, select Properties. Click on the tab that says Driver.... Under Driver Details it should be C:\Windows\System32\DRIVERS\1394ohci.sys but if Windows still
 insists that it cannot find one, cancel out of that screen and click on the Update Driver..... but do NOT let it search, click on the line Browse my Computer for driver Software.... then on Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer..... click
 on Next.....With the Show Compatible Hardware line checked, it should come up with three choices....

<p>1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller (Legacy)</p>
<p>VIA 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any of them should work but I know from experience that most folks have had success with the Legacy one with slightly older camcorders.</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes!</p>

            <p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

Many of you will be initiating a clean install instead of an in place upgrade. Before you do that though, you will need to ensure your data can move to the new version of Windows or that new device you will be buying. In this article, we take a look at backing up your files, specifically, we look at backing up manually. Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported. A manual backup is also handy for migrating your personal files to a new PC or an important way to ensure your data is kept safe."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How
