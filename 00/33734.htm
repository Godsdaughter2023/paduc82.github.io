    <title>Why Should I Renew my XBox Live Gold&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why Should I Renew my XBox Live Gold&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been a gamer for more years than I care to mention and, in the last few years, have moved from the PC gaming to the XBox platform.</p>
<p>Although I have happily renewed my family's XBox Live subscription every year I will not be doing so for the foreseeable future. The reason? I can no longer tolerate the vast amount of lag switchers, cheating and foul/ racist language that I constantly hear
 when ever my kids or myself join on-line gaming sessions.</p>
<p>I report cheating, bad language (made out of context) and anti-social behaviour all the time. It's a facility that Microsoft have added for this purpose...but I now question if any of my reports are ever heeded. &nbsp;I also wonder if Microsoft ever intend on
 providing users reports with feedback as to what actions they have or intend to take. Somehow I doubt it. Microsoft, has a duty of care towards their paying customers, weather they want to or not. It's a responsibility that they are taking money for, but showing
 little signs of acting upon. I might be wrong on this and will happily take corrective advice.</p>
<p>Put the message out there (Microsoft) that you will not tolerate anti-social behaviour. Put the message out that you respect your customer's views and rights to a decent service.</p>
<p>I Pay to Play. I do not pay to get abused nor have my gaming experienced ruined by immature cheating and foul language. This needs to be addressed, sooner than later, if Microsoft intends to bolster up its membership with the forthcoming XBox One console.
 I for one, will be considering the Play Station as a viable alternative. I understand that I do not need to pay to play on-line and hence have less of an issue with my tolerance level towards the aforementioned on-line behaviour of some unsavory &nbsp;users I have
 had the unfortunate luck to meet on-line. But don't get me wrong it's still wrong and, dare I say, stupid to abuse people, on-line or not. he difference with PSN is that I will not have to pay for the displeasure - I can take it or leave it.</p>
<p>Now, I know this post will probable attract some negative feedback, but I expect that. This was written to raise a debate and to 'vent my spleen'. But please note; It's neither big nor clever to call people names, threaten, bully or cheat on. YOU, more than
 likely, would never do that in Private.</p>
<p>It doesn't cost to be kind.</p>

<p>PSN will begin requiring Plus (a paywall subscription like Xbox Live Gold) when the PS4 is out. Xbox Live has in place many options to limit being exposed to vulgar behaviour, I'd suggest changing privacy settings' voice and text option to friends only and
 block users and file complaints where necessary.</p>

<p>While I see why you are mad, the enforcement team states that they look at every complaint they get. While it may take some time for any action to be taken in some cases, they'll eventually finish their investigation and hand out any suspensions or bans
 that they see are appropriate. After all, people inquire about account suspensions and console bans all the time in the last 2 sections of the support forums so if the File Complaint feature didn't work properly, then why are there so many people asking why
 they are suspended or banned?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheating and harassment will always be a part of the online gaming experience no matter what platform you play on. As long as you file complaints, avoid, and block communications with those types of people, you are doing what you can about these users. If
 it's such a problem, play only in a party with friends. Also, Sony is requiring PS Plus for online gaming on the PS4 and given the people that'll jump ship, expect the same problems there as here, only difference is the platform you are playing on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also wonder why do people act so tough online yet they'll think twice about doing this in person? I believe that hiding behind a name online tricks people into thinking that they can do whatever that want online while in real life, your name and reputation
 is on the line. This results in some&nbsp;normally nice people offline being so rude online. Also, some people are simply that way in life as well or don't know better.</p>

<p>I agree with Rusted Ace2013 If those people get banned then that will prevent online harassment for other people because the people doing it won't be there.</p>

<p>I'm sorry to disappoint, but PSN is only free for the time being on the PS3. Once the PS4 has hit the markets, Sony decided that it will require a subscription service just like XBL.</p>

<p>[/quote]Playing with bad apples will be prevalent no matter which console you choose - it's not a problem with any game company, it's a problem with bad apples being bad apples. If you're reporting and reviewing these people, then great! You're doing all
 you can as an XBL user to rid these people. Fortunately, Microsoft has made it possible to block your children from most uses of profane language and harassment, through the use of

<p>you can block people on psn.You can even file complaints too.difference is psn won't ban you for filing a complaint which the xbl enforcement team does.And psn plus gives way more value and is ten bucks cheaper then xbl.And on the ps4 the cost only applies
 to retail games that are going to use psn servers for online play.f2p games,mmos and any titles that the dev or publisher wants to use their own servers have the option to not require psn plus.xbl requires you to have gold to play f2p titles.so world of tanks
 which i can play for free on my pc will rrquire me to have xbl gold to play on the ms's console.And the reason is because ms is becoming more like EA.Always looking to nickle and dime gamers.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response, guys. Appreciate it.</p>
<p>To be fair I only really play one game and I think I'm probably getting too old for that! We have two Xboxes and I have spoken to my son and he has decided that he's had enough of his - so he'll probably move to the PS4. I myself would rather stay on the
 MS ecosystem (as it ties up to my other devices in the household nicely), but I'll wait to see how the console war pans out. For now I won't be renewing my XBL subs.</p>
<p>It would be great if we could have private servers to host games such as COD. That way, we could police the gameplay and users behavior. This use to be the one big thing on the PC platforms.</p>

<p>[/quote]<br />It is part of PS+, so get that and you are good to play online as well. I don't know how much they are, they can usually be found around the price that Gold is though. A year subscription is $50 I think.</p>

<h2>            printer goes offline during sleep or hibernation mode</h2>
                    All my computers running Windows 7 (32 &amp; 64 bit) can not print to any printers via wireless when coming out of sleep or hibernation mode.&nbsp; This problem is recent and I wonder if it is related to a recent Microsoft patch.<br />
<br />
The printers are up to date with drivers.&nbsp; The only way to solve this is to do a restart of computers.&nbsp; Please help.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 Firewall is preventing me from using the local network</h2>
                    <p><span>Hey all,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometime in the last week, Windows Firewall started blocking me from using my home network. I can access the internet fine, but I can't access any other computers or printers on the network.<br />
</p>
<div>Just FYI, I use only Windows Firewall / Windows Defender (no 3rd party security software)<br />
</div>
<div>If I try to browse the network, I see this message:<b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Network discovery and file sharing are turned off. Network computers and devices are not visible. Click to change...</b><br />
</div>
<div>When I do that, if I click on<b><span>&nbsp;</span>Turn on Network Discovery and File Sharing</b>, the error message immediately returns. I can't turn on Network Discovery or File Sharing manually, either.<br />
</div>
<div>In Services, Computer Browser is off. I can start it, but then if I refresh the Services list, it's off again.<br />
</div>
<div>Now, if I turn off Windows Firewall, Computer Browser starts automatically and I can access the network just fine. While Windows Firewall is off, if I click<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Use recommended settings</b>,
 Windows Firewall turns itself back on and, again, I can't do anything on the local network.<br />
</div>
<div>(and let me re-iterate, all network stuff was working fine last week...browsing computers, printing to network computers, etc.)<br />
</div>
<div>I've also tried the<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Restore Defaults</b><span>&nbsp;</span>link in Windows Firewall and after doing that, nothing improves. Still cannot do anything on the network
 with Windows Firewall turned on.<br />
</div>
<div>The only things I've installed in the last week are Defiance (through Steam) and the Neverwinter client.<br />
</div>
<div>Anybody else having this issue? I've seen lots of references to similar problems online, but none of the resolutions I've found have worked in my case.<br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated. Since Win 8 only has 90 days free support (!?!?!?!!?!) I'm SOL from Microsoft unless I want to pay $150 for support for a year.<br />
</div>
<div>Thanks<br />
</div>

            <p>Sathish, thank you, I understand what a firewall is and what it does, however, the basic concept of firewall usage doesn't solve this problem, because it's the network itself that isn't being allowed through the firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no specific rules blocking it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It simply has stopped working in the last week or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled both Defiance and Neverwinter to see if that would help, but it hasn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in fact there were 4 inbound rules added for Neverwinter that still remained even after I uninstalled the software and even after using the Restore Defaults feature in Windows Firewall (so, I'm not sure what Restore Defaults does if it doesn't complete
 reset Windows Firewall to its original "factory" settings).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course I removed those rules but still no joy.</p>

            How strange, I've the same issue and the same time frame. To start with the Firewall wouldn't turn on, but after updating Windows, it started working again, but now that its back up, I can't turn on my network. If I go into the setting and turn on network
 discovery, and save, when I return to check them, they have changed back to off.

            only thing changed before homegroup fail was windows 8 updates installed. YOU CAN NOT turn off windows firewall on private networks, only PUBLIC, that's reverse of what it should be.. #1 clue something wrong. Disabling windows firewall in services fixes
 the homegroup issue instantly... AND by the way, you CAN NOT select a "service" only an app in rules, so no way to fix this bug till MS puts it in as an option. This not the first time, MS had this issue with windows 98, why we had to buy windows 98 SE (second
 edition). I'm about to throw win 8 away and reinstall windows 7 again.

<p>Download the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
media creation tool </a>and run it to create a bootable usb windows 10 installer. &nbsp;As to the partitions, you need to delete all of them during the install and the installation will recreate them. &nbsp;Note that you need the 64bit version. &nbsp;When you boot from the
 usb the windows 10 64 bit installation will start and ask you whether you need pro or home to which you should respond
<em>PRO.</em> &nbsp;If you have problems booting from the usb&nbsp;post back to this thread for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
recovery image</a> for your sp4 to a usb and reinstall windows 10 pro. &nbsp;It will be reasonably up to date with drivers and such so the install will be easier and much faster. &nbsp;Unless you are very familiar with installing windows I recommend the
<strong>recovery image</strong>. &nbsp;Be sure to format the usb as fat32 before you copy over the recovery image. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2011</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Had to have my hard drive on my laptop replaced and my Windows 7 reinstalled. Unfortunately, Windows Live Mail 2011 is no longer available/supported by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 7 GB's of email data that I need to access. I have it backed up on an external hard drive as well as in the cloud. To boot, the great majority was through Pop3, not IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anywhere I can obtain a copy of WLM 2011?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My technician has told me the data format in WLM is not transferable to Outlook as the program is not on my laptop. If it were, it would be no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>WLM 2011 is nowhere to be found unless you can find someone like me who saved it.&nbsp; You can however still find the 2012 version.&nbsp; It is almost the same except for the fact that groups don't work right at all.&nbsp; If you WLM folder was saved and relocated on
 your new drive, when you start WLM 2012 for the first time, it should find your files and set it up for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are working from backup, you will need to use the import facility in WLM to bring the data back in.</p>

</p><p>Tried installing it twice and received an error message saying unable to install. I believe MS stopped supporting this version in January 2017.</p>

            <p>That is correct.&nbsp; MS announced it will no longer support WLM.&nbsp; In fact, MS does not intend to support any mail program that resides on a personal computer.&nbsp; They can make much more money by having you use webmail where they can put ads in your face, based
 on the profile they build about you from reading your mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed WLM2012 with no problems as recently as a month ago.</p>

            I am really sorry to hear that.&nbsp; MS produces a lot of stuff that is of not much value.&nbsp; WLM is one of the best, if not the best email program ever.&nbsp; At least half my clients use it.&nbsp; There are some alternatives.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have read about one called emclient

</p><p>My tech did tell me later that they have found WLM 2009 for installation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping to find 2011, but given the current circumstances I will have them install and then I can transfer my data to Outlook. Found this good article on how to:</p>

<h2>            Trying to install Java 6 but Windows Installer says already installed</h2>
                    
<p>Hello:</p>
<p>I am having an issue with Java.&nbsp; Two months ago I upgraded to a new computer running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.&nbsp; I recently downloaded a new program which requires the JRE to run, but it gave me the error that "the JRE is missing, please install".&nbsp; However,
 the latest Java 6 update 22 was listed in my Programs list through control panel.</p>
<p>I tried running the test applet on the Java website, but the applet would not run.&nbsp; I followed all the instructions there to try to get the applet to run, but to no avail.&nbsp; The final instruction was to uninstall and reinstall Java 6.&nbsp; I figured that maybe
 some of the files might have been damaged during the transfer, so I went through Control Panel and uninstalled Java 6.&nbsp; I then ran CCleaner to make sure all the registry entries were gone, along with any temp files.&nbsp; I then restarted the computer.</p>
<p>When I tried to redownload the program from the Java website, the Java installer begins, then a pop up window comes up entitled Java Setup with a warning:&nbsp; This software has already been installed on your computer.&nbsp; Would you like to reinstall it?"&nbsp; Now,
 it shouldn't be seeing any Java installation at all since I uninstalled the whole thing and did a registry cleaner as well.&nbsp; But I went ahead and answered yes, which caused the following window entitled Windows Installer to pop up with a red X stating:&nbsp; This
 action is only vaild for products that are currently installed."&nbsp; Well, no kidding!&nbsp; But if I answer no, it exits me out of the installer and quits.</p>
<p>I have tried the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility, but the Utility does not see any Java files.&nbsp; I have tried a third party uninstaller, Revo, and it also does not see any Java files.&nbsp; I have cleared all caches, histories, temp files, etc., but still get
 the same two windows when I try to install.&nbsp; I am at the end of my knowledge train, so I need some help.&nbsp; Obviously, the Windows installer knows that the program is not installed, but the Java Setup program appears to think that it still is.&nbsp; What more&nbsp;can
 I do that I have not already done?&nbsp; I need to be able to run Java on this computer.&nbsp; Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Create a System Restore point and an Image Backup using Backup and Restore to an external USB drive.</p>
<p>Do not use CCleaner, instead run regedit (registry editor) and search the registry using "java" (without the quoates) and delete any keys you find.</p>
<p>Next use Windows Search and again search the C: partition for any folders that have jave as part of the name and delete those as well.</p>
<p>Now try installing JAVA.</p>

    <title>NAT Type Strict - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newsthet  say:</h3>
<h2>            NAT Type Strict</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I have a problem with NAT on my XBOX ONE. I tried almost any solution online and nothing worked.</p>
<p>my router is set to Enable UPnP. when i use utorrent for example I see that It auto adds ports to the list.</p>
<p>also called my ISP and was told that they aren't blocking.</p>
<p>I tried manually forwarding ports, the trick of holing 4 buttons after network check, setting xbox to power up not as energy save mode.</p>
<p>what else can I do?</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

<p>Hi buddy,</p>
<p>I had the same issue before. I fixed it by turning off everything that connects to my router, then resetting it. Making sure things are powered down completely and not just in standby. Then after my router reset, turn on the Console and see if you then have
 an open NAT. I found that here I did, so I turned on the other devices one by one, giving it about 10 mins between each one, and see if any affect it. Turned out it was my Android tablet that was interfering with the NAT, probably some app or something flooding
 one of the necessary ports. After a factory reset of the tablet though, everything has been pretty smooth.
</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Definitely second everything Sn1p3r said, and also, can you tell us more about your network setup? For example, do you have a cable modem/router running into a second router (sometimes called "cascading" routers?) I ask because this is the setup I have and
 even though Comcast told me they set it up correctly, after several months of issues, I fixed it myself.</p>
<p>The fix is, router ONE (the one that the cable goes into straight from the wall) needs to be placed in something called "Bridge Mode," and then the port forwarding can be set up on router TWO. (In addition, you want to leave UPnP, or "Universal Plug and
 Play" enabled like you have it, as this should reduce competition between devices using the same ports.)</p>
<p>If this sounds like your setup and you need more details on how to accomplish any of this, just reply here! :-) If not, just forget I said anything! :-D</p>

<p>Hey, I tired first solution so far didn't work, I'm going try it again later today.</p>
<p>My router is DSL-6850u, it's a modem+router with a dual WiFi (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz).</p>
<p>XBOX ONE --&gt; 5 GHz --&gt; (DSL-6850u) --&gt; ISP</p>
<p>XBOX ONE connects to the 5 GHz. (for some reason the 2.4 GHz link can't get Teredo Address).</p>

<h2>            Occasional Blue Screens of Death. Need help to fix</h2>
                    On occasion, I get a BSOD along the lines of "SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED" AvidMbox.sys. This has been an issue since upgrading to Windows 10, from Windows 7. Now however, Ive gotten a new BSOD that states "SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED"
 bcmwl63a.sys. Is there a way to solve this? I've uploaded my most recent memory dump file and dxdiag in hopes of a solution. The following is a hyperlink to the compressed folder on google drive (I didnt see an upload option here): EDITED OUT Previous Link.
 Changed bcmwarl63a.sys to bcmwl63a.sys

            Hi valcincal
<br />
<br />The minidump files indicate your Broadcomm WiFi device driver (bcmwl63a.sys) as the cause of your system crashes
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your device on the manufacturer's website, then download and install the WiFi driver they recommend, that driver may be older, but it will be compatible . . .

            Hi there... I work at Telstra and give you some advice on your question. Although the T-Box has a couple of USB ports you can't actually connect it to a hard drive or a computer to transfer recordings or downloaded movies to watch on another device. &nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 and Minecraft Beta</h2>
                    I have Minecraft Beta on my Windows 10 computer. &nbsp;It works fine, but I'd like to allow my son to use it on his separate Windows account on our main desktop computer. &nbsp;How can I allow him access from HIS side (it is downloaded through the main administrator
 account on the PC)? &nbsp;Also, I have another copy on my laptop. &nbsp;Is there a way to access a game from both (on the same home network) at the same time so we can play a game in the same world together?

<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=528556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 help them establish good habits by setting up limits on how long and when they can be spending time with their screens. The easiest way to get started is to get your child set up with a Microsoft account, add them to your family, and then have them sign in
 to Windows with that same Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>

            Wow!&nbsp; This reply has literally NOTHING to do with my question.&nbsp; Was this a computer-generated reply or did you fail "reading with comprehension" in school?&nbsp; Go back and re-read the question slowly without distractions.&nbsp; I KNOW how to set up a child account
 on the computer.&nbsp; He already has one.&nbsp; I'd like to know if I can be on a laptop, while he's on a desktop PC on the same network and we can have characters in the same Minecraft world together.&nbsp; I have already got Minecraft to work on HIS Windows login on the
 PC.

            <p>I'm excited about the possibilities of the new Windows 10/Mobile Device Minecraft Beta.&nbsp; It will be fun to maintain a family realm.&nbsp; I've to have hit a snag on security and profiles.&nbsp; I have the kids set up in Microsoft as part of my family, but till now
 we've only had one XBOX account.&nbsp; It appears the privacy settings are controlled via XBOX settings.&nbsp; I can't see the kids XBOX accounts with my account and it tells me to have a parent change the settings when I try under their accounts.</p>

<p>Sadly, no.&nbsp; Just the unrelated replies you see above.&nbsp; I pretty much gave up.&nbsp; I was thinking about getting a Hotspot generator and linking through that on a separate account.&nbsp; I could use the generator for other things, so if it doesn't work, no worries
 (I am a mobile DJ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some venues don't have public WI-FI, so I could use it for those events, if someone requests an unusual song I don't have).&nbsp; If you happen to find an answer, and think about it, drop me a message here or on my email: uniteddjs(at)twcny.rr(dot)com.&nbsp;
 I would appreciate it.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if you are still looking for an answer about users and Windows 10 and Minecraft, but I'm pretty sure you would get more applicable answers by using a
<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Minecraft Forum</a>, instead of the Windows 10 forum. Setting up Minecraft on multiple machines is not a Microsoft question, but a Minecraft one. I'm not a Windows rep, but my kids do
 play Minecraft. Hope that helps.</p>

<h2>            Media Center - Some TV recordings suddenly turn black with no audio part-way through</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I've been experiencing a problem with Media Center where some (though not all) of my scheduled TV recordings, when played back, suddenly show a black screen and lose audio for the remainder of the program. The length of the recording remains the
 total scheduled length of the show as well, so Media Center is not crashing or anything while its recording. I have no idea why this is, as other recordings are perfectly fine and I have never had this problem watching programs live on TV either.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I should note that this is only happening with one channel, but it is also the channel where I'm making 90% of my recordings from, so I thought this could be a computer issue.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am running Vista x64.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks for your help.</strong></p>

            Hi Teevor,<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you playback the video in Windows Media Center or Windows Media Player? <br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you able to playback the video successfully in Windows media player?<br />
<br />
Let us try to reduce the hardware video acceleration and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Display Settings by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, clicking Personalization, and then clicking Display Settings.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Advanced Settings, click the Troubleshoot tab, and then click Change settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some video card drivers do not permit you to change settings.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the Hardware acceleration slider toward None to reduce or turn off video hardware acceleration.<br />
<br />
Also, try to re-record a TV show by changing the recording settings and see if that makes any difference while performing video playback.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the start screen of Windows Media Center, scroll to Tasks, click settings, click TV, click Recorder, and then click Recording Defaults.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Quality, click the - or + button to select the desired image quality: Fair, Good, Better, or Best.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now try to playback the recorder video and check if that makes any difference from your earlier video playback.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to go through the link that talks about <strong>managing recorded TV shows in Windows Media Center: frequently asked questions</strong>

<h3> donzibod  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP - Reboot Crash Error - STOP&#58;c0000139 Unknown Hard Error</h2>
                    I own a Windows XP OS which has been running fine for about 8 months.<br />
However, whenever I try to reboot the system, after the loading screen appears, a blue screen flashes for a second and then disappears - too quick to read what it says.<br />
I chose the option of disabling restart through F8, and discovered the following error on the blue screen:<br />
<br />
STOP: c0000139 Unknown Hard Error<br />
Unknown Hard Error<br />
<br />
I've looked everywhere on the Internet but just can't find a solution. I've tried safe mode, previous good settings, but to no avail.
<br />
I'm wondering if there's any other solution besides reformatting the Windows system.
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<p>I have a user that needs local admin or power user privileges to his machine.&nbsp; He is part of a Win2k8 server domain.&nbsp; I have logged in as a domain admin and tried to add his account to the proper local group (Using Local Users and Groups under manage
 computer) but under the location selection, only the local machine is an option.&nbsp; The option to set it to the domain to add domain users is not available.&nbsp; I have done this many times with our XP boxes but this is a first time for a newer Win7 machine.</p>

10. In Domain text box, type the domain name.<br />
11. Click Next<br />
12. In What level of access do you want to grant this user pane, select a desired option, e.g.&nbsp;Administrator radio button.<br />
13. Click Finish.<br />
14. You are returned to User Accounts window and the currently logged on user is now listed in the Users for this computer list box as follows:</p>
<p><br />
UserName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Domain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Group<br />

<p>However the answer is just a GUI Wizard form of what I had already tried under the "Manage" section.&nbsp; Using the example I get " Error: The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed".&nbsp; If I click the browse button
 for the domain, I get an error " The program cannot open the required dialog box because no locations can be found".&nbsp; This is the same basic problem when trying to accomplish it manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PC is on the domain and has been for some time.&nbsp; Any domain user has been able to log onto this machine.&nbsp; I have even removed it from the domain and added it again with the same results.&nbsp; This one has me stumped.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Backup stuck on 30&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaylee-g  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Backup stuck on 30&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a Windows 7 computer that I built myself, and I'm trying to back up to an USB-connected external hard drive.&nbsp; I was able to make a backup a few weeks ago, but I had to get my computer repaired (CPU and RAM failure), and since I've gotten it back,
 I've been unable to save a backup.&nbsp; I'll go to run the backup, and it's fine until it reaches 30%.&nbsp; There, it grinds to a snails pace, maybe going up 1% every 1-2 hours.&nbsp; I tried downloading another backup software and that also runs into a similar issue (estimated
 backup time 4+ hours and counting).&nbsp; I'm only trying to backup a windows image and "My Documents", if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have done or checked:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; I ran a registry cleaner, which seemed to cause some issues for Windows, so I did a system restore to before I installed it.&nbsp; I have not done a system restore to before I took the computer to the shop, because I 'used' all my recent restore points trying
 to fix whatever was causing my issues (didn't know it was hardware problems at the time).&nbsp; I am hesitant to restore my system all the way back to the previous save point (from March) because of all the programs it would affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; It's not a space issue, because the external hard drive is 1 TB and the size of the backup itself is only 337 GB (according to Window's Action Center).&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; I've checked the external and internal hard drives using the Check Disk function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; I ran a system file checker after using system restore that found and fixed some corrupted files, but running a backup after that still lead to the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; I tried just letting it run for ~6 hours and it got up to 33%.&nbsp; I'd rather not leave my computer on for 3 days waiting for my backup, especially since it never too this long before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; I've updated all drivers for the motherboard, CPU, graphics card, and checked the drivers for the both of the hard drives (up to date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If anyone has any ideas of where to go from here, I'd really appreciate it.&nbsp; I can't write CDs/DVDs on my setup, so I haven't tried that yet.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying, Anusha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to complete a backup of just the system image (no documents), so I think it's a file in my Documents folder that's causing the problem.&nbsp; I'll have to look through them all and try and figure out which one it is.&nbsp;
</p>

            Hello Koln,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />Why are you so anxious about this upgrade ?
<br />
<br />What upgrade is it ?
<br />To perform it in good conditions,
<br />Uninstall any third party antivirus
<br />Clean your files 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026616/windows-10-disk-cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402661...</a>
<br />Backup your files on HDD for security
<br />
<br />Then perform upgrade.

            Microsoft does not care. You are on your own. Patricia's advice is very sound. I recommend the exact same. I will add: pray to the Diety of all things computer. Take a deep breath and hope for the best. Absolutely no one knows what will happen this time.

<p>I have&nbsp; seen by me own&nbsp; that many web pages and content write well due to the social validation they have been able to attract despite having inferior quality content. But this can only be achieved by&nbsp; force and lots of money.
 For a small or medium-sized business, the only way you can get social validation is by quality content writing at [link removed by moderator] When your content is great, when it delivers value, when people find what they are looking for . When they share your
 links on their timelines, Search engine sees these actions as social validation and then uses this validation to rank your links.</p>

<h2>            Backspace or double letter,number has a 2 second pause</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed since I upgraded to Windows 10 that if I need to backspace an entire word that I have to pause 2 maybe 3 seconds between punches to get it to work.&nbsp; This also happens when I have a double letter or number.&nbsp; This is on both my brand new laptop
 and older desktop.</p>

            Did the update of drivers and I have the most current. I did buy a new keyboard and that didn't resolve the issue. And as I stated I am having this problem on 2 computers. 1 brand new laptop and my older desktop.

            <p>I had this issue on Outlook only with the backspace.</p>
<p>The second backspace would lag for a second, making me push backspace again, deleting more characters.</p>

No idea why this worked, but it did.<br />

Bonus: Tony0082, to delete a whole word, use CTRL + Backspace</p>
