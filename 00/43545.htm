<h2>            unable to install Update for Windows 8 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB2779768&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This update -&nbsp;Update for Windows 8 for x64-based Systems (KB2779768)</p>
<p>Download size: 5.4 MB - came to my machine today for installing, but after four installation attempts and four reboots it will not install.&nbsp; No other issues with windows 8 update until this one.</p>
<p>I downloaded the manual version of this and ran the installation, but it does not show up as being installed in the update history and the auto windows update continues to show me that it is awaiting installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any comments and help suggestions are apprceicated.&nbsp; I do not apreciate purchasing the all new windows 8 64 bit and encountering issues as if it were Windows 98 or Vista.</p>

            <p>Hello Shuiabkhan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all thank you so much for your reply and the extensive actions to take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did all of the things you suggested, but all resulted in the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Kapspersky Pure 2.&nbsp; I disabled it and ran the update, but reaction turned out the same:&nbsp; downloaded, installed, reboot to complete, reboot goes into a bit of the final part of the update and then "restart" comes up and an auto reboot.&nbsp; Update failed.&nbsp;
 I now have roughtly seven failures on the update history.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address your other concern, I didn't do anything to the operating system prior to this update coming to me yesterday.&nbsp; This instal of Windows 8 64 bit is only two weeks old.&nbsp; This is the only issue that has come up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if things would be okay if I just skip this update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ClarenceE.</p>

<p>I "hid the update" for now until I see an answer to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;now have four updates hidden, they continuously fail to complete. I see the same&nbsp;sequence, 30%, reboot then 98 or 99% and&nbsp;a fail and&nbsp;removal.&nbsp; All four updates fail as a group or individually; yet another afternoon wasted trying to install updates.</p>

    <title>TURN ON AUTO RENEWAL&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            TURN ON AUTO RENEWAL&#63;</h2>
                    I turned off auto renewal last week to be greeted with no more sales adverts,so this week I brought a pre paid 12 months and still tells me to renew?. Looked up the support pages and when I go to subscriptions on my account I don't get the link telling
 me "click here to auto renewal". So far seems the only way to get sales adverts to appear will be to pay again through the dashboard,don't get me wrong I can still buy the discount games just there not being advertised....anyone else had this problem?.

<p>There used to be an option for this on the website but since it's update the feature is gone. I tried looking for it myself. I think the only way to turn it back on is to call support now. If you need to call them the number is 1-800-469-9269 US/Canada.</p>

<p>Having a prepaid card should not affect what's showing as far as game discounts. I've always used a prepaid card and they've always shown for me. Keep in mind though that the dashboard does refresh each time you turn it on, so it may be possible that they
 just haven't been up there a couple of times. They should also show when you go to Browse Games.</p>

<p><b>Can I split payment between my local currency and a credit card?</b></p>
<p>Yes. For most purchases, if the amount of local currency in your Microsoft account is not sufficient to pay for the content, you can charge the remainder to your credit card or PayPal account. PayPal availability varies by region. However, you must first
 select to purchase using your credit card or PayPal account and then you will see the option to use the remaining currency in your account. Split payment may not be an option for all content purchases.</p>

                    <p>Hey there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My download of Forza 7 from the microsoft store keeps stopping at around 61% and never goes any further.</p>
<p>I've read a lot of things on the internet from using the app troubleshooter to reseting the windows store app. Nothing seems to be working</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an Alienware 15 R3 with gtx 1070. i7 7700k, 16gb ram, 128 ssd +1gb HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to start asking for a refund. My experiences with the microsoft store have been horrendous so far.</p>

<h2>            Having problems with loading 64-bit drivers and even Windows Program downloads are giving me error messages</h2>
                    I am running windows7, and in system properties it says I system type: 64bit operating system, but I am repeatedly having problems with loading 64-bit drivers and even windows program downloads are giving me error messages about which version it is. Furthermore
 concerning me is that I have a folder named "program files" and a folder named "program files (x86)" which I read is a sign of the 32bit version. I would like to get this figured out soon as this is a new machine and if I need to return it or whatever sooner
 is probably better.

            I had been having trouble getting the 64bit version of flash player loaded I think I am running the 32-bit version now and the Flash website still doesn't recognize that I have either version I believe.<br />
<br />
Also when I tried to update direct-x and install windows defender and "windows malicious software removal tool" &nbsp;These are the errors I get...
<div><br />
<div>This version of Malicious Software Removal tool is not compatible with the version of windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need a x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and them contact the software
 publisher.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You do not need to install this software because windows Defender is included in Windows Vista. You can access windows defender from the security section of the windows control panel.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The direct-x error said that there is a newer or equal version of D-x on the system so I am no longer worried about that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, when I first got to machine there were a list of 20 or 50 updates all referencing various things and stating "64-bit" that wouldn't all load themselves. I did finally get them done by selecting a few at a time and restarting the computer like 10
 or 12 times to get them loaded in small groups. I don't know the exact info on all the updates all I know is if I tried to do them all at the same time I would get a message when the computer started back up while it said "configuring windows" &nbsp;it would say
 something about the setup failing or something similar and it would load windows, but then windows update would still say that there were updates that needed to be done.</div>

<p>You get a message that states, "You do not need to install this software because windows Defender is included in Windows Vista."?! and you say you have Windows 7?&nbsp; You may also want to look at this article to be sure of what version of Microsoft Windows
 you are running:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am assuming you have Windows 7 and suggest you go through all of these steps in the order given (I could actually care less if you have 32-bit or 64-bit where these steps below are concerned):</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>. Remove whatever is found.</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The less you have running all the time, the better the things you want to run will perform:</u></strong></p>
<p>Use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoruns</a> to figure out what all is starting up when your computer does/when you log on. Look up anything you do not know about using<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google</a> (and/or
 ask here.) You can hopefully figure out if there are things starting when you computer does (or you logon) that you do not need and then configure them (via their own built-in mechanisms is the preferred method) so they do not start up - using your resources
 without reason.</p>
<p>You can download and utilize <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Explorer</a> to see exactly what is taking up your processor/CPU time and memory. This can help you recognize applications you might want to look into alternatives for and/or get rid of all together.</p>
<p><strong><u>Free up some hard drive space and get it organized:</u></strong></p>
<p>Open an elevated command prompt by clicking on the start orb and browsing through All Programs --&gt; Accessories and right-clicking on "Command Prompt" and choosing "Run as Administrator".</p>
<p>Type in the following in the command prompt:</p>
<p>dism /online /cleanup-image /spsuperseded</p>
<p>... and press ENTER.</p>
<p>The process takes a few minutes to complete, it ends with the sentences “Service Pack Cleanup operation completed. The operation completed successfully”.</p>

Did you use the links I gave you to confirm your version of Windows?&nbsp; Mind posting the EXACT version - here?&nbsp;&nbsp; Something along these lines:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate Version 6.1 (Build 7601: Service Pack 1)<br />
System Type: 64-bit Operating System</p>
<p>Just because your system runs well does not mean you are free of all malware.&nbsp; MalwareBytes is one of the top ones - in fact - all the ones I mentioned are pretty much the best/most trusted.&nbsp; If they are giving you trouble - there is probably a reason (maybe
 even malware) why.</p>
<p>I have a link to Java?&nbsp; You can have 32-bit and 64-bit Java Runtime installed - do you have both?</p>
<p>Are you using the 64-bit Internet Explorer most of the time?&nbsp; Or 32-bit?</p>
<p>I appreciate all you already do - but you came here asking for assistance - perhaps you should try doing some of the things being suggested instead of shooting them down because you think you do something equivalent?&nbsp; ;-)</p>

            Spybot cleans better than Malwarebytes. I've seen it time and again. Trust me my younger siblings are always cluttering up their computers and then I get a call from my folks to fix things. Malwarebytes seems to get rid of everything except the cause of
 the problems. That is just my experience.
<div><br />
<div>You posted a link to a sight for Java. Look at your post.<br />
<br />
Internet explorer is a program I try to never run. I like browsers that don't make my experience more difficult.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Since this is a problem that my computer has had since I first booted it up unless the manufacture added malware or the&nbsp;distributor&nbsp;managed to do so without starting opening the box or starting windows... I don't think the problem is from malware. I think
 that pretty well makes sense.</div>

Spybot Search and Destroy *used* to be one of the top tier products - it fell off long ago.&nbsp; A combination of eSet NOD32 and the full (resident) MalwareBytes prevents the problems from happening in more cases than I can count - and I know people who are just
 on the edge of trying to mess up their machine on purpose.&nbsp; *grin*</p>
<p>No - I see no link for Java - I gave no link for Java.&nbsp; JDiskReport is as close as I got - as it uses Java.&nbsp; Until you mentioned it, that was as close as it came to being mentioned.</p>
<p>If it was a problem since the beginning - shoud have returned the system.&nbsp; Something was wrong from the beginning and/or you are prone to exaggeration; either way you could make a backup IMAGE, restore to factory defaults and see if the problem exists once
 you have it fully patched from the fresh start.&nbsp; If it doesn't exist - you know it was likely not there from the beginning.&nbsp; If it still does it - something wrong with the machine.&nbsp; (I don't see the latter happening unless it is bad memory or disk.)</p>

            The link was for Flash not Java. My bad.
<div><br />
<div>It's all been minor odd things that have been hinky and since I have a year guarantee for manufactures problems, and I have an upgrade to windows 8 coming I am not sure even what is wrong much less if something specific is wrong. I am confident it isn't
 malware since it has been happening as soon as I started trying to upgrade. I just wanted to figure out what is going on and hopefully how to fix it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I thought about the backup image thing, but I know it was doing this from the first day. Maybe windows 8 will magically make my problems disappear.</div>

    <title>Dell Premium Active Pen tilt not working with Apps that should - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dell Premium Active Pen tilt not working with Apps that should</h2>
                    <p>I've just bought a Dell Inspiron 2 in 1 7586 and the Dell Premium active pen. I've tried using the tilt feature on the windows ink Sketchpad and the app Sketchable which I think both support tilt but I cant get it to work on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted Dell and they say that both the pen and laptop are tilt compatible but that the apps might not support all pens and to contact the developers. (Tried to live chat with microsoft but it just sent me back to Dell/ here).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>and yes ive tried a few apps that are supposed to support tilt but tilting my pen does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ive tried the suggestions by Ian Ser but no luck unfortunately.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that you tried on other apps as well.</p>
<p>We want you to use the pen on a different device for the same app as we need to isolate the issue and get the root cause.</p>
<p>If the issue still persist then we predict it to be a hardware issue, in that scenario you need to contact Dell.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Skype for Windows 10 (installed from Store) unfortunatly is one of the worst applications there is.</p>
<p>The user interface has been remodeled very badly and personal settings are very limited.</p>

<p>Go to&nbsp;https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</p>
<p>but don't click on the big blue button. Instead go to the Downloads menu on the top left, and then when you get a new blue button that says "Get Skype from Store", click the little triangle to the right and choose "Get Classic Skype".&nbsp;</p>
<p>That will download the 7.xx version of Skype and you can use that on Windows 10. Just make sure you differentiate between the Classic Skype and the one native to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Akasha,<br />
<br />
1. When exactly are you getting the error message?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
This issue might occur due to some third part program causing the issue or memory problems.<br />
<b><br />
Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to perform clean boot and remove the program that is causing the issue.

<br />
Note: Follow <b>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</b> from article KB929135 to reset the computer to normal mode.<br />

<p>If you use option "create installation media for another pc" from media tool, the iso file can be used to determine how you want to install windows 10. Burn iso to dvd or download to usb. Rufus tool is great way to get windows 10 with usb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is rolling out this version at stagger pace. If you wait, you may have less problems with download. But if you are comfortable using ISO file, go for it.</p>

<p>Hi, the 8007-045D error indicates that no storage device was found during the update process. If the console will still reach the dashboard check in settings, system, storage, does your storage device say Unformatted ?</p>

<p>My hard-drive is in the console and i can access all the games files and apps etc. But as you said it says their is no hard-drive in the console. I dont think it says Unformatted anywhere when i go into Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage i cant find where is says Formatted/Unformatted
 it so im guessing it isnt unformatted.</p>

<p>Did you try clearing the system cache at all ? Clear the cache three times one after the other, power the console off and back on, does that help any.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Do you have a USB flash drive you can configure as a USB storage device on the console, remove the hard drive and try updating the console with the USB flash drive as your storage device rather than your hard drive. If that works then at least we have an
 indication it's your hard drive causing the problem, that may entail checking the hard drive for any corrupted files, or even formatting the hard drive but if you could try the USB storage method first that would be the better option.</p>

<p>Ok, have you tried manually updating the console using a USB flash drive or CD ? The instructions on how to do that are in the link I posted a little earlier.</p>

<p>Before you try that though, can you do the LB RB X LB RB X thing again just to try clearing the update and see if that works.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Does it happen with all the songs that are played in the Windows media player?<br />
2. How are you adding albums in windows media player?
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may run the Windows Media Player troubleshooter and check for the issue.<br />
Open the Windows Media Player Library troubleshooter<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library-troubleshooter</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may try to rebuild the Media Library and check if that helps.<br />
To rebuild the library, follow the steps mentioned below.<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shutdown windows media player. <br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop the media sharing service. <br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Start; type Services.msc<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the “Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service” and select Stop.<br />
e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to “c:\Users\”your username”\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Media Player.
<br />
f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now delete the files named CurrentDatabase_***.wmdb and LocalMLS_*.wmdb.
<br />
g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start the media sharing service.<br />
h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now start Windows Media Player and watch it build up your library again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows Media Player library: frequently asked questions<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-HK/windows7/Windows-Media-Player-Library-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-HK/windows7/Windows-Media-Player-Library-frequently-asked-questions</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: Make sure you delete the duplicate from the file folders location, just deleting from library will not resolve the issue. If you do not do that it will again recreate two entries after rebuilding.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>This issue might also occur is if the Windows Media Player library database has become corrupted.<br />
&nbsp;To resolve this problem, clear the Windows Media Player database. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;a. Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
&nbsp;b. Click Start, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;c. Select all the files in the folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
&nbsp;Note: You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.<br />
&nbsp;d. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
&nbsp;Note Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 4:<br />
</strong>&nbsp;If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
a. Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
b. Click Start, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft, and then click OK.<br />
c. Select the Media Player folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
d. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 doesn&#39;t save ratings and &#34;date last played&#34;-information</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I recently upgraded to Windows 8 and built my music library. When I play music and give ratings, WMP12 seems to save "date last played" and star ratings, but when
 I restart my computer some of the newly given ratings are randomly deleted and most "Date last played"-data is deleted. The songs I played first the previous day have "date last played" saved, but the remaining&nbsp;80-90 % are blank. For example, if I listen to
 an album, I can see that today's date is saved after each song in the "date last played"-column, but if I restart, maybe only the two first songs have this information saved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The star ratings given before I upgraded to Windows 8 seem unaffected by this. They seem to be saved within the files. Some album covers also disappear randomly,
 but only the small thumbnails in the Library view. This seems to affect mostly, but not exclusively, my jazz-albums. They have the musical note image. This does not affect the main cover shown in the Now Playing-view or the small thumbnails in the playlist
 and far left bottom of the screen in library view.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I have rebuilt my library twice, but it doesn't help. I'm guessing it's something in my settings, so I have a link to settings screenshots below. I have also moved
 the CurrentDatabase-file and other files in the same folder to Folder.OLD, but when the library was rebuilt the problems remained. I really liked WMP11 for Vista, and I'm disappointed that WMP12 seems so buggy.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Windows Media Player 12.0.9200.16420</span></p>

<p><span>Windows 8 Pro 64-bit</span></p>

            <p>Hello again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>2. VLC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the methods in the following order:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1: Tried it several times. It did not work. For some reason, it still says "library is corrupted" after every time I've tried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3: Tried it once. It did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 4: Tried it, nothing was found and it did not affect anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2: Tried it and it seemed to work after the first reboot, but I listened to music all day yesterday and WMP only saved the two first songs as&nbsp;played. The ratings I changed yesterday are not saved either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The album art problem was solved. I had to delete all the hidden album art images and save new folder.jpg-files by extracting the covers from the ID3 tags. As for the data saving, I do not understand why it does that.</p>

            <p>Hello again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that the problem is not that I reboot the computer. The problem appears when I restart WMP.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made a short playlist and listened to a couple of songs. I took a printscreen and then closed WMP. I immediately restarted WMP, and already&nbsp;five of the last played songs were not saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Printscreen before and after WMP restart:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/FGOMFi2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IMAGE</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that the first few songs are saved, but none of the later.</p>

            Microsoft appears to be in denial of this serious problem of which Microsoft is very aware.<br />
Either Windows Media Player 12 or Windows 7 (and following versions) are blocking the change of mp3 file tag information, even by administrators and even when write access is confirmed.<br />
<br />
Many are upset with Microsoft because of this.&nbsp; From Microsoft's response to you, it appears that they want to put Windows users through all these painful Methods 1,2,3, some of which reload the entire library and achieve nothing.&nbsp; It appears that instead of
 admitting the problem, Microsoft wants you to think and believe that it is your problem, not their problem (which of course they know).<br />
<br />
Microsoft, please FIX the problem and enable permanent editing of mp3 tag information (especially star ratings) or ADMIT IT and stop making your users suffer more with your attempts to cover up your failures and blame the user.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many have experienced that
 changes that you can appear to make sometimes to mp3 file information in Win 7 Explorer, these changes disappear when the computer or program is shut down and restarted.&nbsp; It's like Microsoft wants to control and prevent the change of mp3 tag information.&nbsp;
 Maybe it's a copyright protection effort that is way out of control, preventing features that shouldn't be prevented, and that they refuse to ADMIT.<br />
<br />
from the helppage named Newly-imported tracks default to ratings "bomb" - MediaMonkey:<br />
"Despite claims to the contrary, I cannot find any evidence that WMP or Windows 7 Explorer write any rating data to the mp3 files, not in the POPM or any other id3v2 fields.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; this is not a problem with write permission to the mp3 file in my test since
 I am running as Administrator and have verified that the file is not set to read only."<br />
<br />
search this post "Windows Media Player 12 user reviews and ratings - CNET"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the reviews are negative and tell you to find another music player.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you need a different operating system other than Big Brother Microsoft?
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Is that what you want Microsoft? to driver users away from your products again.&nbsp; Apple would love that?<br />
Or do you want to ADMIT and FIX YOUR PROBLEM and let users set star ratings for their own song again? and save last played information as many want.&nbsp; Perhaps the most important mp3 file information setting is the 'volume leveling' feature to make songs in your
 playlist at similar volumes - this feature of mp3 tags seems to have disappeared as an option in media player.<br />

            Some suggest going back to Media Player 11 (if possible.&nbsp; My experience is that it seems that Microsoft blocks using older Windows Media Players on its newer operating systems - by mating media players to op systems).&nbsp; Of course then you have to reload
 your entire library and manually prevent Microsoft from adding EVERY mp3 and media file and playlist to your library that exists on your computer, instead of just using the primary music folder or two that you want in your library, which you can set (and have
 to reset again before reloading your library, or Microsoft will scan your whole computer). &nbsp; The Libraries 'feature' of Windows 7 may affect editing mp3 file information, but I've moved all my files outside of Libraries, because Libraries creates more problems
 than benefits (I haven't found a single benefit to Windows 7 Libraries).&nbsp; If you could move your song file and Media Player actually tracked the new location, so you don't have to remake your playlists, that would be a benefit.&nbsp; Seems like a computer (or media
 player) should be smart enough&nbsp; to track the movement of song files (with or without 'Windows 7 Libraries', or MERELY RENAMING FOLDERS which makes you remake your playlists.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Ulead is a software program that runs with some digital cameras.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I’d&nbsp;suggest you to start your computer in a clean boot state and see if&nbsp;the issue persists.
<div>A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>
<div><span>See<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></span></a> for instructions.</span></div>
<div><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in
<strong>Step 7</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;the above mentioned KB article.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Let us know if it helps!</span></div>

<h2>            Had a problem with a player playing in my world of Mine Craft.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello I had a problem with player in my world on Mine Craft.&nbsp; This person would change my building and my friends buildings and things that we are making.&nbsp; I was playing private so this person couldn't get in.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few messages back and forth he deleted
 me as a friend (I was going to delet him but, he beat me to it.).&nbsp; Now yesterday I left my xbox on so my friends could play (and it was about 6 people) while I was away one of the players put&nbsp;his player to bed (because he was going out to dinner with his wife
 but stayed in the game)&nbsp;when he returned his guy was dead and his pockets were empty.&nbsp; Now I have done this several time and never died and never lost the stuff in my pockets.&nbsp; Also when I returned yester after being away for 6 hours my guy was alive and pockets
 still full.&nbsp; Now [REMOVED - DO NOT POST OTHER GTS] (the problem person) who deleted me was now on my list of meeting people and it was&nbsp;1 hours before I returned.&nbsp; How did he get in my game it was joinable but, NOT open to friends of friends.&nbsp; The persons pockets
 that were empty gamer tage&nbsp;is [REMOVED - DO NOT POST OTHER GTS]. &nbsp;[REMOVED - DO NOT POST OTHER GTS] is not and was not a friend of [REMOVED - DO NOT POST OTHER GTS] but, met [REMOVED - DO NOT POST OTHER GTS] 1 hour ago.&nbsp; I am mad that [REMOVED - DO NOT POST
 OTHER GTS] got into my game and I am more&nbsp;angry that he had things in his pockets and wouldn't and won't give them back.&nbsp; The other players [REMOVED - DO NOT POST OTHER GTS] have both spoke to [REMOVED - DO NOT POST OTHER GTS] and told him&nbsp;the right thing
 to&nbsp;so to give the stuff that belongs to my map back.&nbsp; I was wondering if some how&nbsp;you guys could get the resources back that belong to my map?&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank&nbsp;for you time and sorry I am not a good writer.&nbsp; This [REMOVED - DO NOT POST OTHER GTS] is very disrespectful
 of other person projects that they have built by changing things and being a bit argumentitive.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Hi there! It's okay if you are not a good writer, as I'm not either. :D</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is to report the player by following these steps:</p>
<p>1. Press your guide button and scroll over to recent players. Then, choose the gamertag you want to report.</p>
<p>2. On the next screen, choose the "File Complaint".</p>
<p>3. Choose the reason why you are filing the complaint. There are two menus, one is general and the other is specific.</p>
<p>4. Choose "File Complaint" again. That's it!</p>
<p>Also, please do not name and shame on these forums. If you file a complaint, then the XBOX Live PET will take the best course of action.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Oops...also forgot to say that you can also set the game to a private game by the start of the world by clicking on "Invite Only". If a player wants to join, they would have to send you a message.</p>

<p>Also as this is a dispute between friends (even though you are not now) Sadly microsoft won`t get involved and they will not be able to get you your items back. As stated above me just follow those steps and move on from it. Sorry no one can help you. Also
 please remove gamertags you listed in your opening post. </p>
