<h2>            Unable to find compuer audio and microphone settings after Skype upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have no idea what has happened but my&nbsp;Skype application recently upgraded itself.&nbsp; When it ran,&nbsp;it prompted me to configure the audio and video settings.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Skype was unable to find my&nbsp;audio devices, the integrated camera&nbsp;was discovered fine
 but the audio (speaker and mic) drivers were not found.&nbsp; What is going on?&nbsp; Hangout is working fine, the problem seems to be with Skype only.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype version 8.30.0.98</p>

<p>Same exact problem here.&nbsp; After Skype auto updated on my Windows 10 computer to Skype version 8.30.0.98, Application version 14.30.98.1000, when I running Skype the microphone and speaker volumes are very low while they are OK for all other applications.&nbsp;
 When I run Skype &gt; Settings &gt; Audio &amp; Video I get a list of errors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Video - Camera - No device found</li><li>Audio - Microphone - No device found</li><li>Audio - Speakers - No device found</li></ol>
<p>The video is working despite the error message, but the sound is not.&nbsp; All of the device drivers on my Dell laptop where recently checked for updates and updated if necessary so they are all up to date.&nbsp; Obviously something is broken on this release of Skype
 and Microsoft needs to fix the problem ASAP!</p>

<p>Wow Ruwim.B, that was a really <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>dumb</strong></span> answer!&nbsp;&nbsp; Been there and done that as the problem has been going on for three days now.&nbsp; I did a reset of Skype and it now recognizes my microphone and speakers.&nbsp;
 Tomorrow when I Skype with my elderly parents, I will know for sure, if the reset worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to get its act together when they roll out updates, like the big Windows 10 October update that they just had to pull because it was wiping out people's Documents folders.&nbsp; Is Microsoft offshoring too much of their development and testing?&nbsp;
 I've got backups just in case though üòÅ</p>

<h2>            family safety filter does not start&#47;is &#34;disabled&#34; at forced shutdown&#47;restart</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I use the Family Safety filter on Windows 8, and I manage it via the web. No local accounts exist on this machine. It appears that after forcibly shutting down the computer (i.e. holding down the power button) and then booting it back up disables the web
 filter. This includes unlimited access to any website, and this activity is not logged. This has happened on Windows 8, and I rather not attempt to forcibly shutdown and restart to see if it happens on 8.1 as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have checked the event logs to see if there are any issues with any services starting, but I see none. Just a message about how the computer was not properly shut down.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Losing admin privileges from an Administrator account are caused by the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Antivirus running a scan on your computer while logging in to your profile.<br />
</li><li>Upgrading Windows from an old version to the current.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The safest way to repair an Administrator account is to create a new Administrator account and transfer your files from the old to the new account. To create a new account, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Settings</strong> in the <strong>Ask me anything</strong> search box and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Accounts</strong>, then <strong>Family &amp; other people</strong>, and then
<strong>Add someone else on this PC</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Enter your desired username, password, password hint, and then select <strong>
Next</strong>. We'd like to remind you that adding a password on a local account will have no way to recover it.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To make it as an Administrator account:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select <strong>Change account type</strong> and under <strong>Account type</strong>, select
<strong>Administrator</strong> and press <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Restart your computer. After that, it will ask you to choose which account to sign in.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if we're able to help out and feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            The store on my windows 8 laptop is not working</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo ideapad with windows 8. About a month ago, I reset my computer because it wasn't working. Now the windows store that shows will not work. It says that there are network connection problems and to try again in a few minutes. Well, I checked
 to see if there were any problems and there weren't. I hope you can respond right away because it is&nbsp;causing my other apps to start crashing down too.

<p>ravee0891,<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
You said this just happened a few days ago?&nbsp; Do you know if anything changed on your computer just prior to this happening, such as any new hardware or software installed, or any updates applied to any of your software?<br />
<br />
The first thing to try is system restore.&nbsp; This will take your system back to where it was before the problem happened.<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
<br />
Click Finish.<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, try booting into Safe Mode and see if you can access your second drive that way:<br />
1.&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
<br />
Click the Start button , click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.
<br />
2.&nbsp; Do one of the following: <br />
‚Ä¢ If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
‚Ä¢ If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.<br />
3.&nbsp; On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).<br />
4.&nbsp; Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.<br />
When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.</p>

What exactly do you see when you go into disk manager?&nbsp; Do you see the second logical drive?&nbsp; If so, does it show the amount of used and free space?&nbsp; Does it have a drive letter assigned to it?<br />

                    <p>Windows 10 Photo App will not let me access, move or print my photos!&nbsp; I did not opt in to import my pictures here.&nbsp; It just happened one day when I was importing pictures from my iPhone which had always be stored in My Pictures.&nbsp; Now I cannot change my
 import setting back to what they were previously.&nbsp; I am concerned I am going to lose all my photos as this app deleted from my phone before they were saved to cloud!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received no responses from Microsoft in regards to previous feedback given.&nbsp; They obviously don't care enough to respond.&nbsp; I have seen so many other similar complaints that have not been responded to as well.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I want to know how to get my pictures out of this App, how to turn off or delete this app and how to import my pictures back into My Pictures?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Kathy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, but please be rest assured that I am here to help you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to preserve the rights of content owners who protect their music or video products in this manner. You must have the media usage rights required to play, burn, or sync protected
 content.</p>
<p>Updating the DRM license will help. By default, Windows Media Player will automatically attempt to acquire usage rights silently unless the server requires some input from you (such as registration information or a fee). You can turn off automatic rights
 acquisition. If you do so, you will be prompted to obtain rights for any new content that requires them. To prevent Windows Media Player from acquiring rights automatically, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open <strong>Windows Media Player</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In Windows Media Player click <strong>Tools </strong>from the file menu. If you do not see the file menu press the
<strong>Alt </strong>key. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In Tools click <strong>Options</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Click the <strong>Privacy tab</strong>, and then clear the automatically check if protected files need to be refreshed check box.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade deleted windows7 and didn&#39;t install... left with no operating system &#40;2x&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone! Hope someone can fix this issue I am having...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Win 10 upgrade via Windows Update. It downloads, installs, then fails... and I am left without my previous Windows 7 install. Upon restart it just spells out that there is no operating system. I had everything unnecessary disconnected except
 for external monitor. There is no error message whatsoever so I can't even check what it could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>recently I switched to a SSD which meant I had to reinstall my Windows 7 with the original serial on that new SSD (phone activation). Surely that can't be the problem??</p>
<p>
</p><p>System: Win7 64bit, i5, 4gb, toshiba satellite l650, 128gb SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, then try to perform Automatic repair on your computer with Windows 7 installation media and see if it helps.<span>&nbsp;The issue could be if there is some system file corruption.
 So I would suggest you to perform Automatic repair before reinstalling the OS. For performing the task I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you use the Recovery Environment (Windows RE) to troubleshoot startup issues, first try the
<strong><span>Startup Repair</span></strong> option in the
<strong><span>System Recovery Options</span></strong> dialog box. If this does not resolve the issue, or if you have to manually troubleshoot additional issues, use the Bootrec.exe tool.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since you are unable to boot the computer, you may have to create a bootable Windows&nbsp;installation media and then perform an Automatic Repair and if it doesn't help then you may
 try to restore your computer to the previous date.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
</span><em><span>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></em></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to rebuild
<strong><span>BCD</span></strong> using the
<strong><span>Bootrec.exe tool</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To run the Bootrec.exe tool, you must start Windows RE. To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply. recovering the windows isn't much of a problem since i created recovery media after the second failed attempt to install windows 10. But I still want to install Windows 10 (computer check shows it's compatible) but i have now
 attempted this four times and it failed each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any way to get a standalone copy of windows 10 to attempt a clean install? are there any other things that could prevent the installation (e.g. RAM?)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-wlinstall/movie-maker-support-ending/5296561c-431d-4c5a-a113-64d700d700ef">
as said here</a>. However, I have yet to see what you have came up with. Do you have a replacement for Windows Movie Maker as planned? Thank you for taking the time to answer my question.

            Hi Painkillergod
<br />
<br />Ar you attempting to install or repair a Windows installation?
<br />
<br />Boot tour system into BIOS (usually the F2 key on the manufacturers logo screen
<br />
<br />On the boot tab, set that USB flash drive as top of the boot order, then save that setting and restart your PC
<br />
<br />Depending on whether your System has UEFi or legacy BIOS, if you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />If you still have trouble booting from the USB, try plugging that USB Flash drive into another USB hub - on the other side or panel on your PC/Laptop . . .

<p>1. Are you sure that the USB drive is bootable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Are you following the computer manufacturer's instructions for booting from a USB drive? These instructions come from the manufacturer - Microsoft is not involved.</p>

    <title>Both installation and update errors 0x80070643 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellen.l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Both installation and update errors  0x80070643</h2>
                    <p>For years, I'v had a problem with installing Java. Don't ask me now how I got around it, but for ages I was stuck on the one version of Java that was already on my computer because every time I tried to update to the latest Java: it failed. I don't particularly
 care about Java, the version I had was good enough for what I needed. The only reason I bring it up is because I've since had a completely new computer built with a fresh, clean vanilla install of Windows 7 and everything on my computer... and I still have
 the same problem.<br />
So, when I say I'm not keen to jumping to doing a fresh install of the entire OS, it's because I've effectively already done it, and it didn't help.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Now that the Sims4 Demo is out, I wanted to give it a try. I download it just fine, but on installing it tells me that the V c++ redistribution package didn't install and thus I can't install the game(I was really hoping the spoiler boxes would work to tidy
 up the logs for this post)</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://1drv.ms/1nBUsW4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Here's the log for it</strong></a></span></p>
<p>So I go searching for answers(gotta love Google). I find NOTHING in specific to the sims, which considering how new it is (back then) I'm not surprised. So I go straight to the website for the Visual C++ Redistribution installs and try installing it straight
 from there, hoping that it's just many corrupt downloads in a row of the sims files. Nope. the pop up dialogue box says simply &nbsp;0x80070643 - Fatal error during installation</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://1drv.ms/1rMnzee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>The log for that one</strong></a></span></p>
<p><br />
So I search for that error now. Surprise Surprise the number one suggestion is uninstall reinstall. okay, fair enough. I consider myself fairly computer competent, I should have seen that coming. So I do the basic uninstall, restart try again. Nope, same thing
 again. I do the full clean proper big uninstal and still nothing. Everything I'm finding is either too far separated from me to instil much hope or the answers they have, and that the OP's reply that they worked, I've already thought of and had no luck. There's
 also a Windows Update for an old version of C++ Red. that I tried to&nbsp;install&nbsp;just in case, but it didn't work. I get error 643, but same thing for that one, the answers I&nbsp;found&nbsp;on-line&nbsp;arn't working for me.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>So I figure, why not try to install the Microsoft Visual Studio that the c++ packages are designed for. The way I understand it, the files for the Visual Studio are too big to do straight from the internet, so I'm told to install a "Secure Download Manager"
 that I can then use to go further. Buuuuut, the SDM pops up with "An internal error occurred" and just gives up. No log files that I can figure out how to find, no error code, just stops and quits.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>Thus, I've hit a dead end. So, I start getting a bit desperate and go further from what I think applies to me. I've seen some forums and Microsoft support stuff that talks about .Net framework, so, you know, I'm desperate.
</p>
<p>Still no luck. Dialogue box says Fatal error during installation.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://1drv.ms/1nBURYH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Here's the short version of that log</strong></a></p>
</div>
<p>It has a full version but I can't be bothered to do that one unless it's necessary.</p>
<p>UGH! At this point I decide, before I un install anything else that I probably won't be able to put back, just check, just put a question up. I'm desperatly hoping that maybe I'm just having a colossal blonde moment (too frustrated to worry about political
 correctness). God knows I've restarted my computer enough, I've tried it with all different levels of firewalls and security etc, I have all the permissions (well, I assume I do), I've used repair tools and cleaning tools and god knows how many other steps
 that I've found along the way. brave, and possibly stupid, me even did a step by step regedit proposed solution. the cmd sfc/snannow says I'm clean, the fixit tool itself crashes, the Windows Update&nbsp;Diagnostic&nbsp;says it makes changes but doesn't make anything
 work. There have&nbsp;been other programs that I can't be bothered trying to go back again to get the logs for, this should be enough, if anything can help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tl;dr</p>
<p>
</p><p>Throughout many different programs and competent computer user troubleshooting I keep getting error 1359 -&nbsp;0x80070643 which has to do with a Microsoft Installer (MSI) package. While I am fairly savvy, I'm hesitant to start messing around with stuff that
 I don't even understand fully what it is. and, yeah, I'm not up to this.</p>

            To save potential future forum searchers the trouble of having to read the rest of the thread in order to understand what situation this answer applies to, I'll just put a brief-ish summary of things.<br />
I couldn't install or update/upgrade most things, but not nothing. When I would try I would either get error code 1359 (internal error occurred) that would then lead to the next on further looking, or just straight out 0x80070643/error 643 or variations of
 that. A trend, as far as my untrained eye could find, was a "problem with the MSI" aka Microsoft Installer.<br />
In my own searching for an answer I (completely) un installed (expecting to re install) all the vc++ redistribution packages I had, Visual Studios itself, Java, Adobe, and the .Net Framework (+more). Unfortunately, it didn't fix the problem and the list of
 things I couldn't install just kept getting bigger. I was following everything I was finding in other forum threads etc and nothing was helping.<br />
I couldn't find any viruses, I ran fix it, the check disk and system file checker (chkdsk and sfc in a command line) were all running cleanly and saying nothing was wrong.<br />
From the MSI errors I was seeing, when I decided to give up on my own searching and ask someone about my specific case, I decided Microsoft was my best bet.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2509997/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>This&nbsp;</strong></span></a>is a pretty comprehensive list of steps running from the seemingly obvious to the slightly scary higher end stuff.
 None of that came up with anything though.<br />
Eventually I was told to go to another forum to see if anyone there had anything else. Since Microsoft was my first step and I hadn't posted anywhere else, I went to EA supprt. (The sims4 demo was one of the other things I couldn't install). It took a while,
 but for anyone who wants to read the full transcript: <a href="http://1drv.ms/1rM8lpo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here you go</strong></a><br />
<br />
<strong>ANSWER FOR ME!&nbsp;</strong><br />
There's an update through the windows update "Security Update for Windows 7 for x64bit systems&nbsp;<span>KB2918614</span><span><span>". I un installed it, and after almost 3 hours of waiting for my computer to shut down (on the screen "preparing to configure Windows")
 Viola!~!!~!</span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span>I went and installed all the major things I needed for basic functioning (many happy dances ensued) and went to do the updates that up to this point I couldn't. I checked that that&nbsp;</span><span>particular</span><span>&nbsp;trouble update wasn't going
 back on, and when I didn't see that number I installed all the rest. After waiting for the next reboot, I went to install some of the smaller stuff and found I was getting the same old error again. When I went back to my "installed updates" I couldn't find
 that exact old one, but there was one by the same title that had the very last digit different. Assuming it was just the latest iteration that was still the problem I un installed that one. reboot. YAHOOOOO!&nbsp;<br />
Yes, I would rather not have something called a security update not up to date, but I'm certain enough that that is the problem that I'll just have to live with it until it gets fixed.<br />
So, yeah.&nbsp;</span></span><span>KB291861* where I am only assuming the * can be any number for the iteration of Security Update for Windows 7 for x64bit systems.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for all your help Gerry and Sneha!!!</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The method you've described is exactly the method I've used to adjust the sensitivity on every other mouse I've owned, and is the first place I looked. The issue here is that there is no "sensitivity bar" slider, or any other option that I can see, when
 I go into the mouse settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I have installed the specific windows 10 64 bit driver for the Arc touch mouse, so when I go to the mouse settings what I get is the screen shown below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been into each available option but I don't see anything to do with mouse speed / sensitivty, or am I missing something?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
</p>

<h2>            Xbox says I never bought a game I did</h2>
                    <p>So I was downloading Fallout from the AppStore on its final day without any problems. I bough the it and it started to install. Yet the following morning I awoke to see that it hadn't move do off 83% so I done some troubleshooting and ended up cancelling the download so I can redownload it. However, when I went to my ready to install it was nowhere to be seen and when I checked the App Store it showed me the full price for the game as if I never bought it. I did get my money back as well so I'm really confused on why this happened.</p>

            <p>Hey there Colonel n00b.<br /><br />Sorry to hear about the purchasing error you're having. To start out, are you able to verify that the transaction shows as complete over on <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com</a>? If not, it's possible the transaction didn't complete. Keep us looped in with what you find :) If the game shows as purchased there, try a restart of your PC and give the download another try.</p>

<p>That doesn't make any sense. If you wouldn't jeopardize your account why you would make a bio like that? For what reason? A bio is a place for you to explain a little bit about yourself if you feel like it. Personally, I left mine blank. Regardless of whether
 or not you hosted lobbies I can see how that bio would get you banned. Sorry, dude, but that's the way it goes. I guess you'll know for next time at least though, right?</p>

<p>I called Microsoft and they gave me a 1 month free code. There is something not right if you ban an account then send them a 1 month code.

<h2>            Deleted the boot partition on my Windows 7 drive, cannot restore it.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, like an idiot, from within Linux I removed the boot partition on my windows 7 drive. However the rest is intact, I can access the drive through Linux and all of the data is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to restore the boot partition on my drive and be able to access Windows again without having to re-install everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run Windows boot repair using the installation CD with no success. I used Bootrec and tried /FixMbr, /FixBoot and /RebuildBcd to no avail. It recognises that Windows 7 is on the drive, but even when I run one of the commands (supposedly succesfully),
 I am still not able to boot into the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my Linux distro I can check all of the partitions and I get the following:</p>

<div>
<p><span>SDB here is the Windows drive. sdb1 is where the boot partition should be,
 however I have read that it should be vfat, not ntfs. </span></p>
<p><span>What happened is I had accidentally reformated sdb1 for Linux. I have since reformatted it as an NTFS partition, as I had no option to format it as vfat.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looking at
</span><a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2031836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a><span> post,
 where someone had a similar boot problem to me, it seems he was able to identify the boot partition as the vfat one and then boot into it.</span></p>
<p><span>I</span><span> would have thought BootRec would have been able to restore that partition
 to the way it should be but I have had no success. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am happy to provide any extra info which can be of help. My last option would be a clean install, but that would mean losing years worth of personalising my OS and installations
 etc.</span></p>

</p><blockquote><span>That would mean losing years worth of personalising my OS and installations etc.</span>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I create and maintain an image of my system partition.</p>
<p>Windows will boot happily with FAT or NTFS partitions. My current boot partition uses NTFS.</p>
<p>I would check if the boot partition is marked <em>active</em>. In its root you should see the file
<em>bootmgr</em> and the folder <em>Boot.</em></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 defaultuser0</h2>
                    <p>I found the defaultuser0() folder unders the users folder. So I tried to delete it by &nbsp;opening the control panel-&gt;user account, but default user0 was not listed in it (But it was showing in cmd-&gt; net user), so I opened &nbsp;netplwiz-&gt;advacned and in it, under
 Advanced user management; I clicked on advanced which opened up lusrmgr.</p>
<p>In lusrmgr, under the users list I've deleted the defaultuser0 profile, and then when I checked in the C:\Users folder the defaultuser0 folder was still present. So I shift+deleted the folder, and now my question is will it create any new problems to my
 system ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>After deleting the profile in lusrmgr I also checked the net user command which only showed my account.</p>

<p>-&gt; This profile folder is a legacy folder from Windows 7. You can safely delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>I also checked the net user command which only showed my account.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; This is risky stuff. In this forum we deal on a daily basis with people who have only one single admin account. When something goes wrong with it they are in deep trouble and they wish they had planned ahead a little and created a spare admin
 account, same as they have a spare house key. Having one turns a major problem into a minor nuisance.</p>
