<h2>            Windows 7 public folder icon missing</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I see this problem has affected many people but what fixed their problem does not work for me.<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 Ultimate x86, up to date, installed but can not access the public folder unless I go directly to C:\Users\Public myself.&nbsp; I have everything shown and not hidden, except the system files, and no public folder shows up anywhere.&nbsp; No open/save
 dialog shows the public folder as an option.&nbsp; I even tried registry fixes and they did not work.<br />
<br />
What am I missing?&nbsp; Where did MS hide the public folder icon and why does it not show as an option in any open/save dialog?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />
<br />
Charles<br />

            Hi costin99andronic
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            A. Analysis Results
<br />
<br />File Name: 021319-7656-01.dmp
<br />IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)
<br />IMAGE_NAME:  ntkrnlmp.exe
<br />
<br />B. Third Party Drivers
<br />
<br />None
<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. Most of the time, third party drivers are the cause of BSODs. To know if a driver is one of the causes - Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

<p>read reply from Elder L.</p>
<p><u><span>This information provided by Jose Ibarra.</span></u></p>
<p><span>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).</span></p>
<p><span>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</span></p>
<p><span>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</span></p>
<p><span>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the ISO file from here:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></span></p>
<p><span>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD (do not install UniBlue or the Ask Toolbar - ever!):</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></span></p>
<p><span>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></span></p>
<p><span>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before
 Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</span></p>
<p><span>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</span></p>
<p><span>Press any key to boot from CD...</span></p>
<p><span>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</span></p>
<p><span>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</span></p>
<p><span>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</span></p>
<p><span>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</span></p>
<p><span>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></span></p>
<p><span>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</span></p>
<p><span>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</span></p>
<p><span>chkdsk C: /r</span></p>
<p><span>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep
 an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</span></p>
<p><span>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</span></p>

            With those two messages, you might need to do this first/too:<br />
<br />
It sounds like your Windows file associations have come undone. This means that XP no longer knows what to do with files by looking at the file extension (like .exe for executables, .doc for MS documents, etc.).<br />
<br />
If you did not do it yourself, something did it for you - most likely malicious software.<br />

On the left, click the Win XP Fixes, File Association Fixes, and read the directions at the top of the page.<br />

Download the EXE File Association Fix to your desktop, unzip the file and apply it using the instructions from the top of the page, then reboot and test.<br />

            You may need a different cable - some are not compatible with particular versions of Windows - but you would do best with a serial port card. See

            Hi Gina.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Install the latest HP printer software and firmware for your exact model printer from here:  <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a>.  The full software package is required to have all of your printer settings available and to scan from the printer top.  Firmware is essential to how the printer functions.
<br />
<br />Then go through the Settings to see if you can turn off these popups you don't want.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Do an&nbsp;extremely thorough check for malware and then change your email password.<br />
<br />
Be aware that it is possible for someone to send email that "appears" to be from your<br />
account but that actually isn't - called "Spoofing". Which means its "Possible" the emails<br />
were not actually from you at all, though they may have your contact list. Have someone<br />
that is receiving the emails to check the header to see where it is actually sent from and<br />
NOT just the reply to address.<br />

<br />
=============================================<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />

    <title>Ready boost what usb size do I get - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellishnoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ready boost what usb size do I get</h2>
                    
<p>I have two old PCs that I had run xp on, one is pentium 3 with 512 mb ram, the other is pentium 4 with 512 ram.<br />
I have already installed windows 7 on the pentium 3 and it runs better than it did on xp, but was wondering about this Ready boost, as it seems for these pcs which I intend to install windows 7 rc on both, using ready boost would greatly help the little ones.
 Both have usb 2, the pentium 3 has usb 2 as I installed a pci card with usb 2 on it, and the pentium 4 has usb 2 as standard.<br />
Now what as a minimum should I get as a USB flash drive, does anyone recomend a brand, and would I have to adjust the page file which is currently set at 750mb min-1500mb max<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
<br />
Elli</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You should let Windows set your page file size.<br />
<br />
Readyboost can help, more RAM and ReadyBoost is even better and RAM is fairly cheap these days.<br />
<br />
The max readyboost drive supported in Vista is 4 GB - if you get a driver larger than 4 gig you can use the
<br />
remainder for storage.<br />
<br />
You need a very fast drive and pay little attention to manufacturers claims they are ReadyBoost Ready as<br />
even some slow drives claim that.<br />
<br />
ReadyBoost does it make a difference<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can happen if you have the Rescue and Recovery program on your computer and you upgrade to Windows 7 before installing an update. To resolve the issue
 you will need to download and install the update before upgrading or download and install the latest version of the program. You can get the update or download the latest version of the program from the following Lenovo web site:</span></p>

<h2>            Error message when trying to upload to YouTube &#34;The following problem occurred in your movie &#40;0x80131620&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Does anyone know how to solve this youtube uploading problem (0x80131620) with windows 8 movie maker?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey guys, I was wondering if any of you know how to solve a problem I have been having with Movie Maker on Windows 8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that whenever I try to upload a video to my YouTube channel, it gets up to the final stage of uploading and then when it hits 1% on the last stage it comes up with this message, "The following problem occurred in your movie (0x80131620)".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried everything that I know of&nbsp;to fix this such as uninstalling and re-installing&nbsp;movie maker and&nbsp;repairing windows essentials 2012&nbsp;but&nbsp;it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, if anyone know how to fix this properly then please get in touch ASAP for I have many vids to post, I would really appreciate it thanks :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you are not able to publish your video to YouTube from Movie Maker. To isolate the cause of this issue, please provide us the following information below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to upload your videos directly&nbsp;from YouTube?</li><li>What is the file size of the video that you're trying to upload? What is the length of this video?</li><li>Have you tried to upload other videos with smaller file size and did you encounter the same issue?</li></ul>
<p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying. I can only upload to youtube through my ipod and iphone. Whenever I try and upload&nbsp;straight from YouTube it sayd it will take around 500 mins to do which is way to&nbsp;long for my file size. But sometimes when I try to upload using&nbsp;YouTube
 it says "the wlmp file is a project file, not an actual video". I have edited it and&nbsp;everything but still nope. The size of my latest vid is&nbsp;5,74&nbsp;KB and lasts for &nbsp;1.30.20 and doesn't upload through movie maker&nbsp;and it is the same with&nbsp;every video I try to
 upload trough movie maker which still gets the same message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate your help and I hope you know how to fix this problem.</p>

            <p>Hello EKDrifter458,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that you were uploading a <strong>.WLMP</strong> file. We would like to inform you that .WLMP file is a project file and not a movie file.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>Project File </strong>is created by adding clips, video files, audio files, and pictures to a folder in
<span>Windows</span> Movie Maker. It contains information about the arrangement and timing of clips, titles, transitions, and effects that are on the storyboard/timeline. It has also a file extension of .WLMP and can be edited from
 where it was last saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Movie File</strong> is created by clicking <span><strong>File</strong></span>, and then clicking
<span><strong>Publish Movie</strong></span>. It is a single digital media file that can be played back in
<span>Windows Media Player </span>and other media players, published to a recordable CD, published and attached as a file attachment to an e‑mail message, recorded to a tape in a digital video (DV) camera and then played back from tape
 or on TV, or, if you use <span>Windows Vista</span> Ultimate or
<span>Windows Vista</span> Home Premium, published and burned to a DVD. It has a .WMV or .MP4 file extension. For example
<strong>myMovie.wmv</strong> or <strong>myMovie.mp4</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To save a project file into a movie file, please follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click <span><strong>File </strong></span>(blue file on the upper left part of the screen in Movie Maker), and then click
<span><strong>Save Movie</strong></span>.</div>
</li><li>Choose Recommended for this project and save it as either <strong>MPEG4</strong> or
<strong>.WMV</strong> file (see <strong>Save as type</strong>)</li></ol>
<p>After saving your project file into a movie file, try uploading the file again and see if the issue will persist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll await for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi EKDrifter458,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back. Just to clarify, may I know what is the file size of the movie (.mp4 or .wmv file) that you saved? Please take note that if the file size is big, the movie may take more time for it to be uploaded to YouTube.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, kindly ensure that the video can be uploaded directly in the YouTube website so that we can determine if the error is caused by your YouTube account or your internet connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how things turn out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            <p>I have saved it as an MP4 file, I&nbsp;have tried uploading a smaller&nbsp;video which is 13,765 KB and 15 seconds long&nbsp;to Youtube via Youtube itself but that said it would take up to 20+ mins to upload which is way to long for vid of this size. Movie maker which
 sometimes works if I leave it for a couple of days I don't know why it does that, and I have also tried it&nbsp;with ArcSoft Showbiz which came&nbsp;with my Hauppauge HD PVR and that keeps saying connection aborted when I am uploading it. I have also tried it with Sony
 Movie Studio Platinum 12 HD but it still doesn't work. </p>

<p>Please tell me is there a solution or someway to fix these problems :)</p>

<h2>            OneDrive paused automatically</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 home and OneDrive personal, and a laptop and use WiFi for the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I constantly create documents and directly save them to my laptop's OneDrive - Document folder. And the documents will automatically saved to the OneDrive Cloud storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I don't like Windows 10 Updates automatically pushed to my laptop, I set my WiFi as metered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now OneDrive got "paused" automatically. It is a pain to have to remember to re-sync OneDrive manually all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way, in my situation, to stop OneDrive to "pause" automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

            Hey Del,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, so as long as the connection is marked as metered, OneDrive will pause automatically. There is currently no group policy, registry entry, or option in the OneDrive settings to make quick work of it, at least for the moment (and since you are running Windows 10 Home, Group Policy or other power user settings are deemed improbable to manipulate).
<br />
<br />I'd recommend you take it to Microsoft and give them feedback on their Feedback Hub to provide such a setting. If you don't have it already, here you go: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/feedback-hub/9nblggh4r32n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/feedbac...</a>
<br />
<br />Hopefully that clears it up.

<p>Are you quite sure there isn't some way to override the automatic pausing of OneDrive when Metered Connection is set?&nbsp; Was it the Fall Creators Update that automatically paused OneDrive when a Metered Connection is being used? It wouldn't be so much of an
 issue if the Procrustes Creators Update hadn't taken away the choice of whether to automatically download and install new updates other than by using a Metered Connection.</p>

<h2>            Office 365</h2>
                    Every time there is an auto update of Windows 10, it destroys Office 365.&nbsp; It take a few hours to try to fix, uninstall several times to clear&nbsp; and then re-install.&nbsp; Outlook has to be re set with a new profile to retrieve all Calendar records. Such a huge
 waste of my time.&nbsp; WHY does this happen?

            You should perform repair not reinstall. Repair fixes the issues related to these.
<br />
<br />First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br />How to repair instructions -

<p>Great advice but these are options I try every time and neither work.&nbsp; That is why it takes sooo long.&nbsp; You use on line repair and wait for an hour then get a failed message.&nbsp; That is why un install is the only option that will work, usualy through Control
 panel and web site and you have to keep trying before re install will work.</p>

<h3> kbarad  say:</h3>
<h2>            urlmon.dll missing ordinal 429 after windows 7 update &#40; kb2847204 &#41; - Why did I get this update at all&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After installing an update for IE9 (kb2847204) there is a change in urlmon.dll which breaks quite a few programs. &nbsp;Reports I hear includes firefox, several sidebars, and in my case Nexus Mod Manager (I'm a gamer at times).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now apart from the obvious question of why are there there updates which break the contract of established DLLs (something that no half decent programmer should do, especially from the OS side), I have a significantly bigger question:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is microsoft installing updates for IE9 when I have uninstalled IE from my computer completely?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>IE is heavy, complex, and like any explorer is highly exposed to millions of potential attackers. &nbsp;Among the advantages of a 3rd party browser is the fact that unlike IE it is not so deeply embedded in the system and if compromised it doesn't automatically
 compromise most of the windows system files also. &nbsp;Plus I prefer the Chrome interface. &nbsp;Every update is a risk of a mistake in the patch (yes it happens), it is also another installation to manage, another increase in the installation size and registry complexity...I
 would like to avoid updates which are unnecessary and only install ones which actually have benefits. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to avoid MS updates which only relate to IE vulnerabilities or am I going to have to read every single one now?</p>

</p><p>Answers in the text above. &nbsp;As an advanced user I can say they weren't so tedious. &nbsp;I'll add that the first thing I did when there was the problem was check if there were newer updates. &nbsp;It seems that windows update is a little...unpredictable in when or
 if it offers an update. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>It is Windows 7 Ultimate (64 bit, SP1). &nbsp;It is activated</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled IE the correct way, by turning it off in the windows features (as it is not installed and uninstalled in the traditional way). &nbsp;This is a part of the question: why are there updates for IE triggering when it is no longer part of the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can answer 6 and 7 because I know what I installed and where to look - command line "java -version" (since my path is configured correctly), and a check of the flash version in chrome://plugins (as the pepperflash version is integrated, there is no separate
 installation).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AVG is a 32 bit application and so it is Program Files(x86), but the date of the folder is 26/04/2014. &nbsp;It was one of the first things installed after the initial windows installation. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>While the executable for IEXPLORER.exe is not present, some of the libraries are still there. &nbsp;Turning off windows features in my experience DOES uninstall them, it doesn't just delete shortcuts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: connected less than a day before installing AVG. &nbsp;Getting an antivirus was first priority after connecting the computer to the internet, followed by updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: 2930275 - 29/04, 2916036 - 29/04</p>
<p>
</p><p>3: Urlmon.dll - created 29/04. &nbsp;Last modified 20/11/2010. &nbsp;Note, with this version there is no issue with missing ordinal 429 with applications that call this library</p>
<p>
</p><p>4: There are no more offered updates and there are no hotfixes hidden (only the optional language packs and Bing desktop). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking back it is possible that IE was uninstalled after installing some updates. &nbsp;I may have remembered to uninstall it only when the update to IE9 was offered which may mean that when&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">kb2847204 was
 installed IE was still present, but the followup updates were not offered because IE was uninstalled. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The matter may be that while IE is uninstalled when disabling the feature, the updates for IE are not installed, and that some IE updates modify system libraries and APIs, not only IE relevant files.

            <p>&nbsp;I don't think it's worth worring about.&nbsp; I agree with Gordon, I've never seen Defrag make an iota of difference in 22 years of running PCs.&nbsp; PC World magazine ran some tests several years ago and published an article saying they couldn't find any circumstances
 where it made any difference.&nbsp; The only time I've seen where it might make any difference would be after applying something like a service pack, where you're updating a pot full of system files.</p>

    <title>Restore Public Desktop Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> facecard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore Public Desktop Folder</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem in a lab on Dell Optiplex 745 computers. In this lab, there are 29 computers originally running Vista SP2. I cloned all 29 computers to Windows 7 Professional SP1. After I cloned these computers, I discovered on 15 of them, the Public Desktop
 folder is missing. All of the other Public folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc...) are visible. This is happening to all profiles (Admin, teacher, student) accounts. It doesn't matter who is logged on to any of the 15 computers. This is NOT a single profile
 corruption issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Show Hidden files, folder, drives, and I unchecked the 3 Hide..... boxes. It doesn't restore the Public Desktop Folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried RESTORE REG file. Nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to search for Public Desktop folder. Nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have restarting the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am performing ALL of these tests under an admin account. Since there is student files on these 15 computers, I cannot re-clone these computers nor can I perform a repair on these computers. I don't want to risk the loss of data. There has to be way to
 restore the Public Desktop folder WITHOUT cloning or repairing these computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to logon to one of these computers as LOCAL ADMIN to fix the problem. Also, I have tried Administrator account to fix the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of these accounts doesn't fix the problem&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to restore the original DEFAULT Public Desktop folder to C:\USERS\PUBLIC. Creating a new folder and calling it Public Desktop doesn't solve the problem. How I know this I tried putting a folder in this newly created Public Desktop folder and it didn't
 appear on my desktop. This is how I know that just creating a simple folder doesn't work.</p>

<h2>            Need to find current system restore points</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find my current Windows 10 Home, version 1803, system restore points? When I searched with this question, and several versions of this question, the results only say how to create system restore points. I'd like to know how to FIND existing restore
 points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi Todd, this is the only way to find those from inside Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type restore - that will show 'Create Restore Point' in the resulting list - click that
<br />
<br />If you do actually have restore points already created, at the top of the resulting dialog, the 'System Restore' button will be active. If you do not have previous restore points created, it sill not
<br />
<br />Please Note, if you did previously create restore points and that button is greyed out, then Windows 10 updates have probably wiped those out to maintain system integrity
<br />
<br />When you receive a major Windows update, all restore points are deleted so if you restored your system, old and new system files would not be mixed, resulting an an unstable system . ..<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02eb070d-71c6-47cd-9a8e-692778acb3a2?upload=true" />

    <title>Slow computer and Temporary folders - can you delete them - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melissa novice lindsay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow computer and Temporary folders - can you delete them - &#37;temp&#37; - what is the source of the temporary folders</h2>
                    I am trying to free up space on my computer and have been advised that you should delete temp folders and files - but I am unsure if these may be required in the future and also how they are created.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do you - &nbsp;dump all files in the temp folder via the delete function in the IE10 Tools menu&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also conducted a search on %temp% and deleting the&nbsp;contents of the Temporary Local AppData file in the Users folder. I basically went into %temp% and accessed around one thousand files. I am not sure if this may affect my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1 - Home Premium (32-bit)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It has 4.00 GB 3.49 Usable</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Windows Task Manager Performance indicates - Commit MB 5854/7156.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am also unsure whether or not the Recycle bin would take up space on my system too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If someone could assist me - I have included a couple of screen snips to show what I am seeing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>The Internet Tools clean temporary files is safe to use, it is where the web page elements are stored as you view a site. They are kept because it can make browsing faster if you go back to the same site but the difference is minimal with a reasonable internet
 connection speed. You can limit the size of the folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To safely scan your system and delete unwanted Windows files use the Disk Cleanup tool. This will list what can be removed and how much space would be recovered..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that it will not find a significant amount unfortunately. You need to analyse what is taking up the disk space to work out a solution. Treesize Free from Jam software will give you a breakdown of the drive so you can identify any options to move
 or delete files.</p>

            <p>I have uploaded some more information to the above folder to try and assist in troubleshooting my issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also am having trouble with the system saying that&nbsp;it is busy with my External Disk Drives and it will not allow safely remove the device as it is busy and I also have my Microsoft Word 2007 crashing constantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you could please instruct me how you do the above as I am not that comfortable with touching anything on the computer as I am very new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so sorry with my silly question. I guess it is hard without psychically seeing the contents and operating programs,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been on just about every forum - regarding deleting temp folders- but I am unsure of the origin of the temp files. I have been told that it is safe to - but then to keep them in the recycle bin&nbsp;- just in case. I am wondering if that would slow down
 the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in search of if the items that are in the %temp% that I have done a couple of screen snips to give you an idea of the size and folders (some are .zip and .tmp).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have come across the error on one of my External Hard Drives with a temp file - called MSI57628.TMP - I have this extension associated with Microsoft Word at the moment as I lost some documents at one stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also am wondering if it is alright to delete desktop.ini, thumbs.db and documents that start with ~.docx&nbsp; and ~.doc that are around 1 KB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other new features that have come to assist people would be great. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am afraid to use CCleaner as people warn me of the registry. Anything with a bit of a warning - I am apprenhensive about.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malwarebytes is conflicting with my current AV at the moment so that is not an assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>CCleaner is fine so long as you don't use the registry module.</p>
<p>In Internet Options, Temp file size, reduce the 250 to 50mb, this only impacts on your internet cache usage (ie speed of loading previously viewed pages)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without knowing exactly what you were doing at the time in Task Manager your cpu useage at 96% seems rather high</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malwarebytes doesn't usually conflict, providing you are manually running it and have not purchased the pro version which runs in the background&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There is just so much going on in your screen captures, so many instances of IE and Chrome for example. I have a total of 3 iexplores with 2 web pages open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would strip the system down as far as possible, remove all unwanted programs and any that could be reinstalled once&nbsp;a base system is working. Disconnect all&nbsp;USB storage and any other devices not needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would start by downloading the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Norton Removal tool</a>&nbsp;and storing them locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work through the Programs and Features and clear it out as much as possible, disconnect from the&nbsp;network if you are worried but get rid of Norton, Chrome, Seagate etc., even IE but that is in the Windows Features. Also printer utilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the msconfig - Startup tab and check what is being loaded, it is almost certain that at least one of the programs uninstalled will still be loading something so run the cleaner and tool above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then run the MSS and check the system for any problems. Keep an eye on the processes tab in task manager as this list should reduce considerably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once cleaned down re enable IE and install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/pc-security/mse.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a>&nbsp;but make sure it is from the Microsoft site. Scan the computer once up to date then scan each of the external drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once ready reinstall only the software you need. Keep it simple and when downloading utilities from the web watch out for the tick boxes for extras added on, Adobe Reader and Flash player are classic examples, use the basic up to date printer drivers, not
 the full software suite unless you actually use them. If you don't use the GoFlex software don't reinstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you really want Norton you will have to remove MSE 1st but I would stay with MSE&nbsp; and see how you find it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>What do you mean - once cleaned down?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once ready reinstall only the software you need. Keep it simple and when downloading utilities from the web watch out for the tick boxes for extras added on, Adobe Reader and Flash player are classic examples, use the basic up to date printer drivers, not
 the full software suite unless you actually use them. If you don't use the GoFlex software don't reinstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I have included a list of programs and features in my skydrive - very apprehensive about uninstalling programs - just in case I require the program down the track of my utilities require it</em></p>

            <p>No problems with reinstalling Norton once you have finished, I am just suggesting something a simple as Security Essentials while you get things sorted, just uninstall it before putting Norton&nbsp; back on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you click on a link you should get an option to run or download. The latter allows you to store the file on your PC and run it after disconnecting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCleaner should not be used unless you really know what you are doing so leave well alone. Uninstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have both Microsoft Security Essentials and Norton 360 installed. These are both Antivirus programs and will conflict. There is a distinct possibility this is where a major problem lies, the problem is one can corrupt the other so the real solution is
 to uninstall both and only reinstall one. As I have said I prefer MSE for its simplicity while trying to sort things out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Live Mesh has been superceded by Skydrive so all those can go, there is a full Skydrive client instead. You have both Acrobat full and Reader so reader can go.</p>

            <p>So basically you are informing me that Security Essentials is far superior to Norton.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just did another scan and I find MSE hard to navigate - I do not know what it has scanned and the status of my machine - other than it is protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion of double checking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there would be a conflict if I keep both Security Essentials with Norton N360 on my lap top?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have included some screen shots of what the set up on my CCleaner - but I have never run it based on scare tactics from several people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the Live Mesh advice as I think the lap top&nbsp;came with it. I do not the other programs that are in a different language - so quite unsure of whether to uninstall the programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you mean by I have Acrobat Full and Reader - so reader can go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I certainly do appreciate the time that you took to have a look at the shots - I am only new and do not know how to display screen shots of my issues</p>

<h2>            Green Blinking Light - Disc Tray Problem&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay today the On button on my Xbox started blinking, and when I closed the disc tray it just opened up again. I resolved the problem with the disk tray, but I have not yet found a solution to the green blinking light! The blinking light isn't always there
 when I turn on my console, but if it isn't there when I turn on my console it will arrive a couple of minutes later which automatically puts me on the dashboard, exiting the current game/dvd I'm on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have owned my Xbox 360 for two and a half years and I have never had any problems with it until today. Also I have never open my console or messed around with it. I look after my console very well.</p>
<p>A solution to my problem would be very nice :-)</p>
<p>Thankyou :)</p>

</span>According to the update description, a restart is not required to complete the installation.<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>After reviewing the handy Video that describes the “in-place” upgrade, it sure looks to me like an upgrade from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I do not need, much less want, Windows 10 Pro.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>The forum article clearly states that it “may help resolve some issues with the system.”<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, there are no guarantees with the “in-place” upgrade.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My PC skills are “average” at best and marginally comfortable with Windows 10 Home.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t have the stomach to deal with any additional Windows 10 Pro issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>I’ve spent quite a bit of time on this issue.<span>&nbsp;
<span>I’ve spent quite a bit of time on this issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Based on the number of Bing and Google hits on the Windows 10 Update topic (especially KB4056892), I don’t think my issue is unique.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I believe the recently released KB4088776 update will generate the same issues.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So it doesn’t seem to me that an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro should be the solution.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is this really my next and possibly last resort?</span>

<p>Thanks for the reply and advice.&nbsp; I did download and install the KB4088776 update from the Microsoft Update Catalog as you suggested, but the result is the same.&nbsp; It requires a restart to complete the installation, but the restart doesn't work.&nbsp; As for your
 other suggestion, I'm just not interested at this point in re-installing ANY version of Windows 10 to fix this issue.&nbsp; There's a large universe of users that apparently are having the same or similar issues, and I'm having a hard time believing that Microsoft
 is going to tell us to re-install the OS (OK, maybe a little naïve on my part, but we'll see.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you got me thinking.&nbsp; IF I were to re-install Windows 10, I know I can protect my personal files, but would I have to re-install my Apps (Office 365, Quicken, etc), Printers, Networks, etc.?&nbsp; If so, then definitely a re-install is not in the works for
 me at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your advice.</p>

<p>Yes, optional store apps &amp; optional programs like Office, winzip, etc would need re-installing.</p>

</p><p>If I have windows update problems I'll usually run the troubleshooter twice in a row followed by a restart- which I've seen others have success sometimes doing. &nbsp; But the error number, and a search of it is a really good start otherwise. &nbsp; Microsoft support
 has several pages spread around with the most likely fix, if you have an error number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time it wants a restart click the desktop then hold down ALT key while pressing F4 &amp; use that drop down box. &nbsp; Its a more complete restart bypassing the fast startup type shutdown/restarts.</p>

<p>The Windows 10 1803 Media creation tool is now out:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tool will upgrade Home or Enterprise versions to The April 2018 version of the same version you already have.&nbsp; It will also let you choose whether to:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep or delete your current programs </li><li>keep or delete your personal data.</li></ul>
<p>It will allow you to update directly from that program on that computer (if you have administrator rights) or to create the installer on a DVD or USB (8GB or larger) for use on a different (or the same computer later) that already has Windows 10 activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may work in cases where using Windows Update fails.</p>
