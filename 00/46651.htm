            <p>Hello there, sorry to hear about your problems about that game. Please delete the game again.</p>
<p>Clearing the system cache sounds good, but please try to solve your issue by clearing it 3 times in a row.</p>
<p>This method is very helpful for other players.</p>
<p>If it still won't work, please report again.</p>

<h2>            Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting this error when trying to print a page from microsoft word. I am using EPSON L110 printer. After searching online i have tried with all the solutions like</p>
<p>1. making other printer default and again making the present printer default</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; From control panel after selecting the printer i have tried to print a test page and received this error message - "Operation could not be completed (error 0x000007d1). The specified driver is invalid."</p>
<p>3. Tried uninstalling the printer and restarting the pc and installing new drivers from internet. But again same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started arising after i updated my laptop with windows update on 23-5-2018 and just before that day i,e on 22-5-2018 i had printed a document from same laptop. So i think this problem has occurred due to the windows update and i am unable to
 roll it back also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Soourabh</p>

    <title>Manufacturer codes for Windows 10 Retail versions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> z.a.o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manufacturer codes for Windows 10 Retail versions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Does anyone know the manufacturer codes for the retail versions of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some sites label a certain code as Retail, while other sites will label the same code as OEM. Then you have a lot of sites just not stating at all which version they're selling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I want to buy a Retail licence version of Windows 10 so that it's not tied to my motherboard like the OEM licence. I need to be sure before purchasing. Finding this launch so confusing comparted to previous versions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just to clarify, I'm looking to buy a copy of Windows 10, not do the free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you want to buy Windows 10 retail copy. I will certainly help you with this. OEM copy is mostly sale with the PC you buy from the any manufacturer. You can buy Windows 10 retail copy from Microsoft Windows store. To do so kindly refer the below
 given link:</p>

            Thanks for providing that link. But, is there any chance you could tell us the manufacturer codes for all of the Retail licenced versions so that we may recognise them in other stores? Thanks again.

            Hi Arvindh, this is most likely caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear you're experiencing this issue!
<br />
<br />I'm Ramzi, an idependent advisor, here to help you.
<br /> BSOD can be cause after drivers change, memory default, disk error, etc..
<br />
<br />Some of the most useful things that you can do to fix the BSOD include the following:
<br />
<br />    Scanning for malware
<br />    Performing a System restore
<br />    Dealing with hardware issues
<br />    Installing the latest drivers
<br />    Booting the PC in Safe Mode
<br />    Correcting some BIOS settings
<br />
<br />On the prompt command, please tape: chkdsk /f  then See if the DOS shows any error on the disk
<br />Also, make a memory test. On the search bar, tape memory and selec the memory test option.
<br />Another solution that you can try is to perform a check of all your drivers.

<br />If you manually cleaned out your temporary folder, then no that did not cause this, if you used a 3rd party cleaning utility, then that may well have caused this . . .

    <title>Why do I have to be signed in to play Minesweeper - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rtbones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I have to be signed in to play Minesweeper</h2>
                    I have to say - the "you should always be logged in" aspect of Windows 8 really, really bugs me.&nbsp; Yes, I know about the local log in you can set up (thats what I do).&nbsp; But anytime I try and do something like play Minesweeper, the dang thing wants me to
 sign in to my Microsoft account!&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; I want a setting that bypasses/ignores/give the proverbial middle digit to any and all of the achievements or whatever else Microsoft feels I "need" to be logged in for.&nbsp; I dont want ANY of them.&nbsp; Yes, I know you can
 cancel the login if you are logged in locally but what a pain in the ****.<br />
<br />
My question - is there a way to tell Minesweeper (which you download from the Store) that I *DO NOT WANT TO BE SIGNED IN* to play so that it bypasses the ubiquitous "sign in to your microsoft account" screen?&nbsp; I dont give two hoots about achievements, I'm not
 an XBox gamer, I dont need or want the world to know what my scores are or what I'm playing.&nbsp; I'd really like to just play Minesweeper without Windows asking me to sign in EVERY TIME I start the game.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that sounded angry, but I am just a bit frustrated with it all.<br />

<br />
Yes, but I think you have missed my point.&nbsp; I dont want to be signed in all the time.&nbsp; If I need to sign in (like, to download something from the store), fair enough.&nbsp; But games like Minesweeper used to be included with the OS.&nbsp; I dont care that I have to download
 them now, but since I am not an XBox gamer, and dont care to share my scores or what I am playing or earning achievements, why cant MS give me a way to BYPASS the idiotic "sign in here to get achievements" screen everytime I launch the game?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Maybe my post should have been better titled as "Why do we have to be signed in online all the time?" or "What is the obsession with always-online?"&nbsp; If I have signed in LOCALLY, dont ask me to sign in online to play a game that is single player and on my machine
 locally.&nbsp; At least give me a setting I can change so I can bypass the "sign in to MS" screen.<br />

RTBones again!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I agree with you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;just did a search that almost literally asked&nbsp;your question:&nbsp;&nbsp;WHY DO I HAVE TO BE ONLINE FOR EVERYTHING?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want to be signed in for everything.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want to be online all the time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want my Microsoft account&nbsp;to automatically log me into ANYTHING.&nbsp; I'm fed up with Microsoft controlling my life.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My physical location on the planet makes it impossible to be online all the time.&nbsp; My laptop is turning into a doorstop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded the Solitaire suite, which demanded access to my Picture Library.&nbsp; Why, so it can put something there - but is it also searching my pictures?&nbsp;

<h3> dgieg53  say:</h3>
<h2>            Basic System Device</h2>
                    
<p>I am already in the Windows Vista Device Manager and have right-clicked on my two Basic System Devices in the C/Drive that have yellow mark on each of the devices.&nbsp; When I click onto Properties the message I get is: The drivers for this device are not installed.
 (Code 28) and you are told to click "Reinstall Driver" for the driver to reinstall.&nbsp; Nothing is reinstalled because I get the next message that Windows is unable to reinstall to your Basic System Device.&nbsp; So now what do I do because if I don't have this available
 I can't use my jump drives or external drives.&nbsp; Right now Microsoft is on my XXXX list because no one knows what their doing and I get nothing of&nbsp; value from anyone to help fix this!</p>

After the above :<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<h2>            Using laptop for PS4</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 15 3000 series with windows 10, can I play my PS4 on it? It requires the use of the HDMI so I'm not sure.

            Hi Stanley, 
<br />
<br />Yes you can share your screen, though it depends on the operating system you are using (Windows, Mac, Android . . etc.) 
<br />
<br />Click the '+' icon on the call screen to bring up additional call options
<br />
<br />Click 'Share screens'
<br />
<br />If you do not have that option, what operating system are you using Skype on?

If the answer is&nbsp;yes, then strongly suggest that you use Kaspersky Rescue Disk 10 to scan and remove malware.<br />
It's very effective since the infected system's Hard Drive is <strong>not</strong> Active when the system is booted&nbsp;from the Linux-based Rescue Disk -<br />

 if I press keys, I can do CTRL ALT DELETE and that works. But I can't get rid of this white screen, can't even open task manager.

<p>1. Have you made any recent changes to your computer?</p>
<p>2. Which antivirus application are you using?</p>
<span>3. What is the model of your HP laptop?<br />
<br />
</span>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below and update us on the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<strong>Step&nbsp;<span>1: </span></strong><span>Y</span>ou may boot into 'E<span><span>nable low-resolution video (640×480)'</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span> and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps, to boot into low-resolution video.<br />
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>a. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>b. Start tapping F8 key.</span></p>

<p><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>If the issue doesn’t reappear, there is possibility that the display drivers are not functioning correctly. You may uninstall the display driver and reinstall it.
<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a.&nbsp;Type devmgmt.msc, press Ok.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>b.&nbsp;In device manager, expand display driver &gt; right click on it&gt; click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>c. Reboot the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>d. The display driver will get installed automatically.</span></p>
<span><b><br />
Step 3: </b>You may also download and install the latest display drivers from manufacturer’s website or from Windows update site and check.</span>

<h2>            Remote Desktop icons shortcuts .RDP files wont open after Windows 10 July August 2016 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>I had this problem, only on my laptop, right after the Windows 10 July/August 2016 Anniversary Update got downloaded and installed. NONE of my .RDP icons/shortcuts would work. They wouldn't launch/open or even Edit the connection settings! I had to manually
 enter the IP addresses into the Remote Desktop Connection dialog-box for every remote machine I wanted to connect to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a ROYAL PAIN, but I found the solution at this link below, because NOTHING on this topic could be found under Microsoft's Widows 10 forums when I searched using keywords from my subject here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&lt;Removed link&gt;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Excerpt below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that RDP.files won’t open on systems running the <a href="http://windowsreport.com/windows-10-anniversary-update-crashes-freezes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Anniversary Update</a>&nbsp;is extremely&nbsp;frustrating for businesses, because users depend on this feature to open their own computers from home.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a workaround available to fix&nbsp;this issue, but it’s not a permanent solution.</p>
How to open RDP.files on systems running the&nbsp;Anniversary Update
<p>1. Type <strong>display&nbsp;</strong>in the search box<br />
2. Select <strong>Display Settings</strong><br />
3. You’ll see a text in red “<strong>A custom scale factor is set</strong>“.<br />
4. Click on the text underneath “<strong>Turn off custom scaling and sign out</strong>“.<br />
5. Sign back in.<br />
6. MSTSC should now work with an RDP file passed as a parameter.</p>

<h2>            I cannot find the folder Spool&#47;Spooler under C&#58;&#47;Windows&#47;&#39;&#39; and cannot therefore apply your recommendation</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Dear Mr Harshavardhan Rathod,</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I have now tried the Method 3. ''Clean Print'' but could not complete&nbsp;its step 8 ''Find the folder
<strong>Spool/Spooler</strong> under C:/Windows/''. I could not find any folder under C with this name... I therefore still cannot use the scanner.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Yours sincerely,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>--------------------------------------------------------</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Dear Mr Harshavardhan Rathod,</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for your detailed recommendations. I did the following:</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Method 1. </span>
</span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>I had at one stage a windows including 3 messages:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>a) the driver for SM Bus Controller is not installed;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>b) Unknown device does not have a driver;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>c) Hardware changes might not have been detected.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I asked in the dialogue box to&nbsp;fix 1) and 2) but this failed.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Method 2.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>I had initially forgot to mention that I had been on the site of Canon and downloaded the last version of the driver for&nbsp;the printer but with no avail. I did it again&nbsp;as recommended in Method 2 but
 without any result.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I then tried again to scan (no result) and had the following message (which I have received on and off for weeks):</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>SCAN GEAR</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Cannot communicate with scanner for these reasons</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>-scanner is turned off
<em>(not true!)</em></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>-scanner is disconnected
<em>(not true!)</em></span></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><strong>Please, check and try again. Scanner driver will be closed. Code: 2, 145, 50</strong></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Method 3.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>I have not done anything yet because I do not feel comfortable&nbsp;accessing the registry. I will do it after you have reviewed and perhaps commented on&nbsp;what is above.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Your assistance is really appreciated. Thank you.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Yours sincerely,</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Canon PIXMA MG5200 Printer &amp; Scanner stop in the middle of their job
</span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>Over the last few weeks, my printer/scanner developed an erratic behaviour. Examples: only 2 of 3 pages are printed on only half of a page. Scanning is&nbsp;impossible, the scanner
 stops in the middle of the scanning or does not start although it makes the beginning of the&nbsp;usual noises. I&nbsp;re-installed the Canon CD, the Windows&nbsp;updates are OK, I have a McAFee antivirus. When I run the Canon&nbsp;diagnostic, it says that everything is OK. The
 problems developed over the last few weeks and is getting worse. Windows today could not start at all but did after I ran Start with Repair and Restore Point. Any help would be appreciated.

<h3> ex koot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag Availability</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>My name is <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> and i just had a quick question. &nbsp;I was wanting a gamertag that is available according to the website checkgamertag.com. &nbsp;The gamertag is "Koot", because of the shortness of this name i was surprised that it was
 available. &nbsp;But when i went to change my gamertag to this, it told me it was not available. I understand that old gamertags get recycled.</p>
<p>Now i had a chat through microsoft support, here is the reference number if you would like it&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong><span>, And i was told to contact the Advocacy Team which i hope this is reaching them.</span></p>
<p>If you could help let me know when this gamertag may actually be available for use since no one is using it and it still wont let me take it, that would be awesome. &nbsp;A timeframe would be much appreciated as iv been waiting for this gamertag to become available
 for years now.</p>
<p>With your reply please please please send the reply to the email -&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp;if at all possible</p>
<p>Thank you and have a nice day</p>

<p>Sorry, but support gave you incorrect information. No one would be able to tell you when the gamertag will become available. Gamertags from the original Xbox were released several years ago, but they are not normally recycled. The tag system is in use on
 other Microsoft services, so even if it is not being used on the Xbox, it could be in use elsewhere. Also, the system doesn't see things like spaces as making a gamertag unique. So even if you're searching for "gamertag" it may not show as in use even if it
 in use as "gamer tag".</p>

<p>Koot XY, Xbox do not recycle Gamertags. Additionally, Xbox cannot honor the website that you have visited and checked the availability of the Gamertag Koot because that is not an official Xbox or Microsoft website.
</p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken, the recycling of Gamertag has been issued and supported before but due to complications with old Microsoft Account Emails where owners come back and wants to use the same account, the said recycling has been discontinued.</p>

<p>The reason they don't recycle tags or announce it if they do is last time they did a lot of tags were snapped up &amp; sold on which is against the CoC/ToU.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with old email accounts.</p>

<p>It has something to do with email accounts. Some gamers who were inactive have Gamertags which other players like to take as they contacted Xbox Supports asking for a way to get that. This was allowed before but as what I've said, due to complications as
 some gamers wanted to go back using the same account, the said feature has been discontinued.</p>

<p>I have no intention of arguing with you. If the site is legit, then it should have a Microsoft or Xbox as part of the link with it like gamertagcheck.xbox.com. The same goes with other legit websites: enforcement.xbox.com | support.xbox.com | myservice.xbox.com,
 etc. For this, please do be careful as there are websites that can hack a Microsoft Account Email when visited.</p>

<p>You would need a capturing device in order to use an xbox as a display on your laptop. Your best bet would be to get a monitor of your choice, anything with dvi or hdmi would work and some speakers and your set. Most likely would be the cheapest route and
 you would have full resolution without any hicups because the computer cant keep up.</p>

<h2>            I need help changing from a child account to an adult account</h2>
                    
<p>I just turned 17 and my dad said he would change my account from a child to adult account. When he tried to sign in on his parent account it said it was deleted. Now he can't change my account to an adult, and my xbox live has run out and I can't accept
 the new terms of use. Is there a way to change my account or do I need to let go of all my data and restart?</p>

<p><span>1) You have the parental email address written down, right? If not, go to the Xbox and try to accept the Terms of Use and it will be shown to you.</span><br />

 and the reference number from the email sent to you in Step 3, and submit a UE Request.</span></p>

<p>There won't be warranty service for the Surface Book 2 in Estonia until such time (if ever) that Microsoft officially sells this device there. Surface is serviced where it is sold. So if you buy one in the US and bring to Estonia, you would probably have
 to find a friend in the US, ship them your Surface if you ever needed warranty support.

                    <p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe some out there can help me out, or has had this problem and you've gotten it resolved. It's driving me nut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, I have a personally built my machine, it has;</p>
<p>Mother Board - Z97 Extreme6</p>

<p>Video Card #1 - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 - Working perfectly, when installed by it self.</p>
<p>Video Card #2 - NVIDIA GeForce GT 740 - Has a Yellow icon with "!" in the middle, indicating driver problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed all the latest drivers from NVIDIA/www.GeForece.com to no avail. Now here is the kicker, I can pull one card, either one and run one card at a time and they both work. I even swapped which slot their in and again they both function perfectly
 one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But they fail to run when their both installed, the GTX 460 will always run when both cards are installed and the GT 740 always fails and shows a driver issue icon. But again one at a time and they both function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pryor to installing Windows 10 I had both these cards running in Windows 8.1 Pro environment and never had a single problem. Now with Windows 10 Pro, I can't get them to run simultaneously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help or is it a Microsoft issue.</p>

            I had a similar issue, I took put the NVIDEA driver using the install, did a restart and it loads the correct driver. &nbsp;Windows appear to not like the driver and loads its basic driver instead, with no driver it loads a good one automatically via the update
 route.

            <p>Hello and thank you for your reply. Let it be known that I tired all of your suggestions prior to post here for help. I even download a tool that removed all previous drivers and cleaned up the register also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To include deleting the NVIDIA Folder in the root drive of "C", all the drivers both new and old were removed and I restarted the system and it install some basic drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went to NVIDIA for the 10th time if not more and allowed their automatic system to dictate the suggested drivers and once again it came up with the same driver package which resulted in the same yellow driver icon with "!" in the middle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I build all my own systems, always have and probably always will. But this problem here, I have never ever encountered. As stated previously if I pull one of the cards out the other will function fine and visa versa, I even moved the cards around from one
 slot to another to no avail. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But one at a time and each card functions fine, they were both in this machine and ran perfectly with Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am truly at a loss! Anyone else having this problem. I know I have the right drivers, I have removed and reinstalled so many times and using the automatic/manually from both inside the machine and at www.GeForce.com and all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the sfc scan, it did not locate any problems at all. I did the compatibility process to no avail either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>H.E.L.P.!!&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hello DPMYoung</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion, but prior to me posting this I had tried this, I mean I tried everything I could think of, even clean up the register with a tool, deleted all folders &amp; files from NVIDIA.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted and Windows installed it's basic driver, the only file it could find, do to the fact there was absolutely nothing in the machine from NVIDIA/GeForce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once all files were removed and the register was cleaned out, I proceeded to GeForce.com and allowed their tool to scan my system and it did and it came up with the same file package it had in the pass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I allow the system to do it's thing. I have Google this and I see that there are numerous folks out there having the same problems.</p>

            <p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to report that I fixed my problem, after spending all night and morning, into this after noon, I was repeatedly installing, uninstalling, running tools that cleaned up the register and removed every trace of NVIDIA/GeForce files and starting all over
 again more then a good dozen times, I continued to go backwards using older drivers and changed my OS to my last known good environment when all 4 of my monitors were up and running on Windows 8.1 Pro and I finally got my 4 monitor system back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In testing I pulled either one of the cards out and one card at a time they would run. I pulled the GTX 460 and left the GT 740 in and it would function fine, then I pulled the GT 740 and installed the GTX 460 and it would run perfect. So I knew by this
 that both cards were functioning and that from the beginning it was a driver issue, because thats what the little yellow icon indicated, but I also had a code 43 and some other random code would pop up also</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GeForce GT 740 and the GTX 460 would not run in the Windows 10 environment with the most recent updated drivers from NVIDIA/GeForce.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GeForce website keep telling me to install a new driver set for Windows 10, the&nbsp; driver was - WHQL, Version: 353.62 - Release Date: Wed July 29, 2015.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated I went back to my last good known running environment which was Windows 8.1 Pro - 64-bit, so I downloaded this "347.09-desktop-win8-win7-winvista-64bit-international-whql" and installed it, then I rebooted and all is fine, all 4 of my Monitors
 are back up and I am one happy guy again!! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew it was a driver issue from the beginning, but never expected it to be the new driver set to be causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my suggestion to everyone is to revert back to your last good environment, using the last drivers you had in your machine and hopefully you will have the same results I have gotten.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!!!</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hello, in response to an email asking me if the problem had been resolved. The answer is no!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My fix that I posted, I learned after a few days was only temporary, due to the fact that Windows Update forces updates on you with no opportunity to turn it off. The new drivers that Nvidia / cheap force.com provides still has not resolved my problems when
 it comes to my two video cards in the new windows 10 environment, as stated before both video cards are operational, tested one at a time they function fine. But in the windows 10 pro-environment what do cards implemented the driver icon still returns and
 my 4month your system is taking box 22 video cards only. So if anyone other has a fix other than everything that I've listed and try to the point of removing all nvidia drivers running totals SFC, correcting and removing everything out of the register, still
 that will permit my system to run a quad or four monitor system environment. Microsoft please fix this or Nvidia / GeForce please give this some attention. As a result of all the testing I know that both video cards are good and in working order.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I need now is for one of these two companies to correct the drivers so I can install them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's a driver problem, but I need you guys to build the proper drivers so I can install them, as it is right now all the updates in the world will not fix this unless you build the correct driver set for these two video cards I listed here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Plz don't tell me it's a driver problem, I already know that, I've stripped this system of every NVIDIA driver, removed every register entry, and have taken this system back to basic drivers, only to go to www.geforce.com to manually &amp; automatically update
 my system all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I need the correct driver from the Manufacture or Microsoft in order to correct this problem.<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Be aware also that Win 10 Pro auto-update can (and does, in my case) override the individual manually installed graphics drivers, followed by an instant black screen of death. I have had multiple occasions (after an auto-update) where I have had to restore
 the system, delay auto-updates, manually install newly released drivers from the manufacturers' website. Hey presto - a (perfectly) working system!<br />
<br />
Extensive testing has confirmed that the issue is caused by the graphics drivers being auto-updated by MS - auto updates also installs the same driver for both cards. I've now blocked updates via group policy editor until MS provide a facility to select which
 drivers are auto-updated.</p>

            <p>Hello aussie7969, </p>
<p>You can use this link to get a refund for the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant. <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/esd-support-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://support.microsoft.com/gp/esd-support-phone-numbers</span></strong></a><br />
Enter your country information and it will provide a phone number to call for refund.
<br />
<br />
You don't say if you are trying to install using the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant or if you created a disk from the .ISO.
If you are still interested in getting Windows 8 installed, try the steps below for when it hangs during the installation:
<br />
<br />
Disable all non-essential hardware such as printers, external hard drives etc. <br />
Verify all Windows updates are current on your current Windows operating systems.
<br />
If you are running Avast Antivirus, you will need to update it. <br />
<i>- when updating, choose the 'Program' option
<br />
- after the update, restart the PC.<br />
<br />
</i>If you are&nbsp;running McAfee Antivirus, there are some versions that are not compatible and may block the installation of Windows 8. You will need to check on the McAfee website to see if your version is compatible. You can uninstall it temporarily to get
 Windows 8 installed and then reinstall the antivirus again. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
As a general rule, you can check to see if your antivirus is compatible on the Windows 8 Compatibility Center at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link here</a>.
</p>
<p>Run the following troubleshooter and then try the download again:
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2714434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2714434</a><br />
<br />
Next, run a clean boot if using the Windows Update troubleshooter doesn’t help with the download.
<br />
<br />
Using clean boot, we can try to determine which app/program might be causing this issue.
<br />
Note: If you are using AVG antivirus, they have an updated version that you can download for Windows 8 as&nbsp;the older version could be causing a problem. When updating, choose the “Program” option. After AVG has updated, reboot your computer. Then try the download
 again. If it still fails, there may be a conflict. </p>
<p>Step 1: Follow the steps to perform clean boot:<br />
a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> window type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘OK’</b>.</p>
<p>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck the <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</p>
<p>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</p>
<p>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</p>
<p>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. &nbsp;</b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></p>
<p>f) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </b>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns.<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
<br />
</b>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing
 the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>Step 6: Resolve the problem.<br />
</b>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.</p>
<p><b>Step 7:<br />
</b><b>Note:</b> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> window type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.<br />
c) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <b>‘Restart’</b>.</p>
<p>If the clean boot didn't point to a conflict with software, then run Checksur.

<p>I'm trying to keep calm but like others I am deeply frustrated with this experience. I dialled the number for my country (Ireland) as per the website support to receive a message from the telecom provider that the number is not in service!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How do I retrieve my licence key (to access support) when I purchased online?</p>
