<h2>            I need to re-open my closed Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I closed my Microsoft account in error, not realising the impact on SkyDrive, Windows 8 etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been through the "Can't access your account?" links however it does not recognise the account email address but also does not let me create a new account with the same email address&nbsp;either.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My skype account is a separate account that was created long before Microsoft bought it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of yesterday somehow (skype glitch? or account hacked?) my date of birth in skype was modified and now Skype treats me as a child and does not allow me to log in and shows this:&nbsp;https://www.screencast.com/t/lq8HOfNIo8Z</p>

<h2>            Formula Result not showing up in cell</h2>
                    <p>MS Office Professional Plus 2016. &nbsp;This is the Function Arguments Window.&nbsp; The result is correct.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04af84ad-1355-4607-9dc0-feed852fe886?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04af84ad-1355-4607-9dc0-feed852fe886?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>This is the sheet value.&nbsp; I have tried general format, number format </p>

            Hi TV, this error is usually generated when there is a lot of iteration performed by the formula, you are iterating down the whole column B twice in your formula - that is a lot of calculations/logical checks . . .
<br />
<br />Microsoft recommend this fix for that error
<br />
<br />Click File - Options.
<br />
<br />On the Formulas tab, under Calculation options, check the Enable iterative calculation box
<br />
<br />In the Maximum Iterations box, type the number of times you want Excel to recalculate. The higher the number of iterations, the more time Excel needs to calculate a worksheet
<br />
<br />In the Maximum Change box, type the amount of change you’ll accept between calculation results. The smaller the number, the more accurate the result and the more time Excel needs to calculate a worksheet

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this post is very outdated but I will reply just so it may help someone who is looking to solve the same issue in 2017!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely, you were trying to change the format of a "text placeholder" and not a "text box"</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the edge of the object you are trying to edit</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Under the Format tab, select Selection Pane</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the object is listed as a "Placeholder" of some kind in the Selection Pane, you will not be able to adjust the text position because it is some type of preformatted PowerPoint box that is associated with a type of list [without a symbol, bulleted, numbered
 or some combination].</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Delete the object, click on the tab "Insert" and draw your textbox manually and make all the adjustments you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone confronted with the same problem!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>When <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12258/how-do-i-use-skype-call-forwarding?q=call+forwarding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
call forwarding</a> is activated, you will be charged <strong>only </strong>when a call is forwarded to a phone number you selected as your call forwarding number. If you choose to activate voicemail or forward the call to another Skype account, then you wont
 be charge for anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need&nbsp;Skype credits or an active calling subscription that will cover the country you want to receive the calls in. If you will be using Skype credits to pay for the forwarded calls, then you will be charged by Skype's call per minute rate.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enable call forwarding: </p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to your account on the Skype website.</li><li>Scroll down to Manage&nbsp;Features and tap on Call forwarding. </li><li>Enable the&nbsp;button for call forwarding and select how many seconds you want the call to ring before it forwards to your number,
</li><li>Choose mobile number and then select the country/region and enter your phone number.
</li><li>Tap on Confirm and you are all set. &nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Delete calendar is grayed out.</h2>
                    <p>I have two desktops that had Outlook 2013,&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;and icloud. I set up a home and work calendar for icloud.
</p>
<p>The home computer started having a "Microsoft Outlook has stopped working" issue. After trying several attempts, I decided to roll back the Office to 2010.
</p>
<p>On the Office 2010, I found&nbsp;an calendar named Calendar for the first email I created which I understand I can not delete. A Calendar - icloud and another calendar I call J calendar.&nbsp;Both&nbsp;have the&nbsp;delete calendar grayed out.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I determine what J calendar is associated with? </p>
<p>How can I delete the calendars?</p>

            <p>Ah, yes, if its the only calendar, you can't set a different one as the default. Holidays and Birthdays are read only (outlook.com populates them automatically) and they can't be set as default. They can be deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com can sync with iphones so you don't really need iCloud, unless you can't use outlook.com with the work computer.&nbsp; If you can get rid of iCloud, move the contacts and appointments to the outlook.com calendar before signing out of iCloud, preferably
 on Outlook 2010 (large numbers of appointments sync up better on 2010). &nbsp;Use a list view, select all, copy and paste into the other calendar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you set up the iCloud in outlook, it creates the iCloud data file and sucks the appointments and contacts from outlook's default folders to the iCloud folders. Outlook cannot use the iCloud calendar as the default calendar but iCloud is supposed to
 move the appointments in the Outlook Calendar to the iCloud calendar periodically.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what the folder list looks like when you have iCloud set up. You cannot remove the sets of folders I have highlighted.&nbsp; If you have other calendar and contacts folders, they can be removed.

<h2>            OneNote keeps losing notebooks</h2>
                    OneNote is losing notebooks (sometimes without backing them up), sometimes takes the contents of the one it drops and puts in into a different Notebook whose contents are overwritten as a result. Any suggestions? I've had 3 Level 2 techs try to fix it
 by remote access to my computer. Is there something you know that they don't that could help? I would like OneNote if it wasn't too risky to use for anything important. Help!

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Notes can routinely end up in any of several places that you might not have come across before. Since you have mentioned that you already contacted Level 2 techs, we would like to confirm the steps that they did to isolate the issue. Also, if you can provide
 us the reference number of your contact so we can check it on our end. This is for us to make sure that we won't be repeating the same methods provided by them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Anna Bon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the techs documented the calls as completely as they said they were doing, you will see all of them by looking up my case # 1394991783.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked with Raymond L, Julie T., April Jhade C who attempted the first remote session but disconnected before connecting., Jonalyn B, Donna P., Ariel A who did a remote session, Reeza who connected me to Jaymar, who also did a remote session. Then
 his colleague Bon did a remote session. Next Joe connected me to Alijemar who did a remote sessioin. Next, Jason connected me to Juvy L who did a remote session and was the most constructive to that point. And she set up an appointment for today with Farah
 who also did a remote session. She had a group of colleagues working with her, and we're all still confounded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had 2 appointments scheduled for calls from you guys that didn't happen. A couple of days ago I was told I'd receive a call between 7-10 my time and got an email saying that evidently I wasn't available, but that was inaccurate as I was available
 the entire time and no call came. In fact, at the time the email was time-stamped as having been sent I was on the phone with Jaymar because I had reached out since the promised call didn't come. In that email that mistakenly asserted I must not have been
 available, I was told I would receive a call yesterday at 1:30. When that also didn't happen, I reached out again and was on with Juvy L. No opinons offered yet, just simple recounting of facts, but what do you imagine my opinion is of someone not honoring
 their promises? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The issue (other than your customer/technical service) is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have 3 different lists of Notebooks:</p>
<p>1. OneNote has a list. </p>
<p>2. The Backup function in OneNote has a list of its own, and </p>
<p>3. OneDrive has a different list of its own. </p>
<p>
</p><p>None of them are in complete agreement with each other. I find that somewhat shocking because I think the agreement between them should be absolute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would expect and I think everyone expects that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, when they create a Notebook in OneNote it is automatically backed up to Backups because that's the way it's set up. (one tech told me I should always to manual backups because sometimes the automatic backup isn't complete, as she said was the case
 with the notebook she had to recreate section by section because of a missing first page in the backup she said was necessary).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, we also expect that when we create a notebook in OneNote that it is also backed up to OneDrive with the sync function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of the above are happening 100% of the time for me. I have had notebooks disappear overnight in OneNote that fortunately were found in one or another of Backup or OneDrive. I twice found the contents of missing notebooks contained in a notebook with
 a different name &nbsp;- with no other content in this other notebook. I didn't recognize the name of the notebook the missing content was now in and don't know if there had been any data in there before, but if there had been, it was now written over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've learned &nbsp;from the testimony of several Level 2 techs that this is an issue that other techs have experienced before. Since it's a known issue, I have to ask why aren't you addressing it? If my data in OneNote isn't safe and by extension no one else's
 know their data is at risk is ethically indefensible and exposes the company to tremendous liability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you want to dismiss the issue by saying I probably just made some mistake (and write this off as "pilot error") you need to know that 2 of your techs actually had one or another of these things happen to them and they saw it with their own eyes.
 One tech recreated a missing notebook, taking about 2 hours to do so, copying each section one by one into a new notebook. At my suggestion, she even renamed it once to give it unique name in case the missing one returned somehow. And then about an hour later
 we both saw that both were gone from the OneNote listing of notebooks. That's when we discovered the content in a differently named notebook. It happened to your tech, too, and she got to see it. It can't be dismissed to 'user error" in this case when it's
 happening to the techs, too. There is an actual issue with OneNote that needs to be addressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the next morning another notebook had vanished overnight, and its contents went into that same other notebook the first missing notebook's contents had gone into. Fortunately, the first missing notebook's contents weren't lost because it miraculously
 reappeared. Yes, it came back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm willing to bet OneNote is not intended to work this way, but work this way it does. For me and others, I'm told by some of your techs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that was clear enough. I get that it's complicated. I've had 4 techs remotely access my computer to try to figure it out and fix it, and none have succeeded. Several lower level techs admitted the issue was beyond their skill set, but it have proven
 to be beyond the skill set of several Level 2 techs. When I asked to kicked up to Level 3, then, I was told Level 2 was the highest. It seems I need someone more knowledgable than the ones I've met so far. They've all been nice and pleasant to work with, but
 until Juvy L last night, the syncing was even worse than before people started helping me. I still have an issue to some degree with syncing. Several notebooks don't sync, and several that say they have synced still aren't in OneDrive, so wherever they synced
 to is not my OneDrive that the others synced to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go on but I'm tired of typing, and I've gone through all of this so many times I'd like to never have to recount it again. Just get OneNote to work properly. I kind of like it, but now am scared to use it for anything that matters. Since it's happening
 to others, could it be a coding issue?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Anna Bon" never replied to my answer to her post. There has been some progress in terms of support, but the problems have not been fixed. Someone referring to himself as a Level 3 tech has worked with me for 3 or 4 days now, remotely accessing my computer
 for at least 2 hours per session. (Remember my mentioning above that a Level 2 tech told me there was no such thing as a Level 3 tech, that he/Level 2 was the highest.) Nothing has happened to shake my conviction that OneNote is too risky to use for anything
 consequential. It's too unreliable. My repeated experience has proven to me that it will lose data and not back it up properly or at all. Everyone I've spoken/corresponded with agrees the list of Notebooks in OneNote, OneNote's backup file, and OneDrive should
 be in agreement. They have never been. That's a bug. Further, not all notebooks sync, and some say they have and thereby have saved the notebook in question to OneDrive but there is no trace of that notebook in OneDrive. There is the additional issue of OneNote
 taking the contents of one notebook and placing it into another notebook with a different name, overwritting the notes that were in that notebook before. I've seen that happen 3 times now, and the techs have seen it happen two of those times because it happened
 to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Anna Bon, what action is taking place as a result of this exchange? From your choice of words in your reply to my original post, it's clear you work for Microsoft. You reached out to me but haven't followed up to my &nbsp;giving you the more information you
 asked for. What's up? &nbsp;<br />

<p>That sounds plausible .... but it's wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A list of notebooks <strong>in OneNote</strong> shows notebooks which are <strong>
open</strong> in this Onenote and can be different for each OneNote you use.</p>
<p>A list of backed up notebooks shows all notebooks you <strong>ever</strong> had open in
<strong>desktop OneNote</strong>. Some can actually be closed.</p>
<p>A list of notebooks on OneDrive doesn't include local notebooks (which can be part of the two lists above) and can include notebooks which are open
<strong>only</strong> in other OneNotes than the desktop OneNote (Onenote for Windows or one of the mobile clients).</p>

<p>Hi Bernd, Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me start off with clarifying that when I wrote, “Everyone I’ve spoken or corresponded with agrees the list of Notebooks in OneNote, OneNote’s backup file, and OneDrive should be in agreement,” I was referring to the many Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3
 techs from Microsoft I’ve dealt with over the last two weeks. I don’t know who you are other than something who kindly tried to throw some light into this murky situation (thank you), but you are in the minority. The other people are paid by the program’s
 creator/owner to troubleshoot it, and are people we should probably consider to be the experts on it. They are in agreement with each other. And, yes. It does sound plausible.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if we accept your observations as accurate, they still don’t address the problems I’m having.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To your comments, I only have and only work in one OneNote, so the stuff about working in multiple OneNotes doesn’t apply to my situation. Further, in this process, all the techs found Notebooks missing one place or another they were expecting them to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some experiences: A notebook I visit regularly went missing one day, which caused me to reach out to Tech support for the first time. It was not on the list in OneNote that pops up when you click Open and it shows you a list of notebooks to choose from.
 It was also not on OneDrive. Fortunately, it was in OneNote’s Backup file. A tech recreated the notebook with the original name and saved it, and then gave it a unique name a bit later. The unique name never backed up to Backups or OneDrive. Curiously, though,
 the original name did show up in OneDrive after she rebuilt the notebook even though it wasn’t there before. I guess it synced before she got around to changing the name. For a while, the notebook existed with both names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some of the session, both were showing in OneNote’s lists of notebooks, but later that same session, they both vanished from the list of notebooks in OneNote. It had disappeared again! Hunting around, there had been a notebook I didn’t recognize by name
 before but which only appeared in Backups, not in the list of notebooks in OneNote nor on OneDrive. Earlier I had not been able to open it from Backups when I clicked on it. Now that it was showing in OneNote, I clicked on it and much to both of our surprise,
 the content of the rebuilt notebook was in it. Did you follow that? OneNote took the content of one notebook and put it into a different notebook with a different name.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next morning, one of the two missing notebooks reappeared in OneNote’s list of notebooks – by the original title which the tech had changed to something unique. Because the original title had shown up in OneDrive, seemingly synced in the few minutes
 between she saved it and then renamed it something unique, I’m thinking a later sync put it back into OneNote. The uniquely named notebook has never shownup again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also that morning, another surprise was that anotherm different notebook had gone missing from OneNote. Checking that notebook whose name I hadn’t recognized the day before that surprisingly had the contents of yesterday’s missing notebook in it, I was doubly
 surprised to find the content of today’s missing notebook - without the content that had been in there the day before. Today's content overwrote yesterday's. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The saga has been going on like that for two weeks. Today, it is much better with a lot more agreement between the three lists, with these 2 exceptions: There is one file in OneDrive that doesn’t show in either OneNote or OneNote’s Backups – despite your
 second point that if it had EVER been open in the desktop, it would be in Backups. It has been opened in the desktop, was in fact created in the desktop, and - your assertion to the contrary - &nbsp;is not in Backups. BTW, there have been times that it has been
 in Backups. It just isn’t today. (I keep a chart that I use to track these things. I’m not going just by memory).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also another notebook that shows up in OneNote and OneNote’s Backup file, but it is not on my OneDrive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And although you disagree, all the techs I’ve spoken with or corresponded with think all notebooks are supposed to be backed up and synced to OneNote.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whoever is accurate is somewhat immaterial. What is material is that we users expect that OneNote is keeping our data safe by first, backing up our work and second, then syncing it to our OneDrives. If that's not the case, you should let all of us know.
 Regardless of whether or not that turns out to be true, though, it’s still not OK for notebooks to disappear, or for OneNote to overwrite the contents of one notebook with the contents of another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OneNote – You’ve got issues!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p>Bernd. Hope this was helpful. I feel like I’m getting to the end of the process of making sure my content isn’t lost forever, but there’s another thing at play here --- If no one tells you there’s a problem with the program, and documents it, then you don’t
 know there is something you might need to fix. You’re welcome. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it seems you (MS) does know there are problems. I say that because one tech working remotely on my computer for hours told me as we were on the phone that she had a crowd of other techs around her trying to figure out what to do that she wasn’t
 able to do, and they told her they had ALL seen similar issues before. That makes it a known issue. Even though they had all had experienced the issues similar to what my tech was dealing with&nbsp; on my computer, they still didn’t know how to fix them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I should try Evernote instead. Is it more reliable?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Yes, I'm from a minority who wants to throw some light on existing problems. Participating in this forum from the beginning.</p>
<p>Reading your descriptions I saw you mentioned renaming a notebook (giving it a unique name). You should know that there is some sort of a trap. If you rename a notebook in Onenote it doesn't really change its name (on OneDrive or in Backup). Only the name
 which is <strong>displayed </strong>in OneNote gets changed. And when you close the renamed notebook the new name just disappears. This behaviour could potentially explain some of your observations.</p>
<p>The reason behind this silly behaviour is to avoid killing existing connections to e.g. mobile OneNotes, because a name change changes the path to a notebook.</p>

<p>Thanks, Bernd. Interesting!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That begs the question -- where or how you can rename a notebook, then? It seems that, by the reason you give, changing it at any one place would create a problem for every other place (your destop app, your mobile app, OneDrive, etc.). There must be a way
 to rename a folder without causing all problems across all your other platforms. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(The original notebook and the notebook renamed with a unique name both existed side by side in OneNote, briefly, and then the content was found in another notebook in OneNote with a title only previously seen in the Backup folder. I think I saw the phenomenon
 you describe another time when OneNote didn't like an "&amp;" in a title and I changed it to an underscore. For a while, I had notebooks listed in OneNote with both spellings, but only the underscore one was backed up and synced to OneDrive. They had exactly the
 same content, so I eventually deleted the "&amp;" one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Were they both opening the same notebook and were just 2 different pathways to it, or were there 2 notebooks? Meaning, did the renaming actually create a new notebook? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Renaming can be done only on the source, on Onedrive (or in Windows for local notebooks), using your browser.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether some of the existing OneNote's are now able to detect this renaming (technically there are solutions to this not so new problem). In the past they couldn't and missed their notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Renaming <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">should </span>never create a new notebook.</p>

            There are hundreds of threads in this forum on this exact issue. The motherboard has developed a fault and the only solution is to replace it with a new one. This is an expensive solution and will probably cost more than new phone, if Nokia care can find
 a replacement board - what reason did they give you when they refused to fix it ?<br />

            There is no definite limit to the number of contacts that you can add to a distribution list. The exact limit is based on the total file size of the contacts. If you use only the very basic information for contacts, your distribution list limit may be
 as many contacts as possible. The typical number of contacts that you should add to a distribution list is between 50 contacts and 70 contacts. However, if the contacts contain lots of information, the distribution list limit should be as small as 25 contacts.

            Dear RandySoto, 
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users using my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />Thanks for your question!
<br />
<br />Can you open your Gmail via browser and try to access the shared calendar from there? You can also clear the cash. 
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Kristina

            Im trying all i know and still no success, Ive tried what you said and it only works for events that are already on outlook not for new ones, sharing gives me the error above and the only way Ive been able to just see my events of outlook on google calendar
 was with publishing a calendar on outlook and copy paste the ICS code on google calendar.

            It is not exclusive for Office 365, but unfortunately sometimes works not smoothly.
<br />You can check the service health here: <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />You can use .ics as workaround and you can try after some time again to delete and import the calendar.

    <title>Open OneNote without opening Notebooks&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan neumann &#40;dan.neumann&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open OneNote without opening Notebooks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OneNote is crashing on launch. There are many notebooks open, so when OneNote was opening successfully, it tried to sync a bunch of notes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to try just opening OneNote but having it <strong>not</strong> open all the notebooks that it opens and tries to sync. I suspect there is an error with syncing that is causing the app to crash. I did manage a work-around by taking the machine offline,
 opening OneNote, and closing all the notebooks, but I would like to have another option in the future for opening OneNote without opening any notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hi Dan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Crash issue can have many possible causes, the sync error may not be the exact one. I would like to focus on helping you on the crash issue, I would suggest you follow steps below to see if it makes help:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.Go to Library &gt;Containers</span></p>
<p><span>2.Move the folder "<strong>com.microsoft.onenote.mac</strong>" to Trash</span></p>
<p><span>(Note: This will reset your OneNote desktop app without any existing notebooks opened. If the method is helpful for this issue, you could back up the notebooks before removing it.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue remains, I would also like to confirm some points :</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            &#34;Trial will expire&#34; warning persists after purchasing and installing commercial version of Office Home &#38; Business 2010  &#40;Using Windows 7 Ultimate Edition&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>For several months I used a beta trial version of MS Office 2010.&nbsp; Two weeks ago I received a notice that the trial would expire, and suggesting that I purchase the commercial product.&nbsp; I did so.&nbsp; The installer would not allow me to install until I removed
 the trial version.&nbsp; After removing the trial version, I installed the commercial version and started using it.&nbsp; Today, however, I noticed that all the programs (Outlook, Excel, etc.) claim to be a "Trial Product," under the label "Microsoft Office Professional
 2010."&nbsp; This appears under the "File" menu, "Help" tab.&nbsp; It tells me that the trial period will expire in 16 days.&nbsp; It also says "Product Activated" under "Microsoft Office Home and Business 2010."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under "Licensing Operations" I am presented with the option to purchase (which I already have) or, remove the trial product (which I already have done.)</p>
<p>Is this just a bug that I should ignore?&nbsp; Or should I be concerned that a portion of the trial product still appear to still be on my computer?</p>

 went on and now I&nbsp;cannot reset the language; when I select the settings "gear wheel icon" it doe give me the drop-down however it simply says "working on it .." I have waited for sever hours on several occasions and not go. ... Is there some other way for
 me to change my O365 language setting at the O365 portal? ....&nbsp;Many Thanks ... Han s</p>

<h2>            Shared Calendar shows the calendar creator name as the organizer for all events</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to create a shared calendar and share it with others. The problem I am facing is that if anyone creates an event in the calendar it doesn't show the name of the person who created the event instead it shows my name (since I created the calendar)
 in the originator field. Is there a way or a workaround to make that more clear by showing the event creator name next to the subject or anything that can indicate who created the event ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried the workaround where you add the originator field in the Active Appointments view but that also didn't work and showed my name.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Currency symbols in the cells - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phoon&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Currency symbols in the cells</h2>
                    <p>Can I ask if anybody can advise me how to resolve this problem I have in my Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that when I use the Format Cell function to select a particular currency symbol for the amounts in the spreadsheet, the currency symbol will change to a default currency symbol after I saved and reopened the file again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example in my spreadsheet table I have USD 1,000, JPY 2,000 and EUR 3,000 in 3 different cells.&nbsp; I used the Format Cell function to select the 3 currency symbols for the 3 different cells instead of manually typing the currency symbol together with the
 amounts.&nbsp; What hppened after I saved and reopened the file again, the 3 currency symbols are all changed to CNY today.&nbsp; Yesterday the 3 currency symbols were changed to EUR. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In cells where it is just a number and no currency symbol used from the Format Cell funtion, the amounts were largely not affected.&nbsp; However I do noticed that in some cells where they are supposed to contain numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, they are now changed
 to as follows:</p>
<p>

<p><span>Dear Rachelle,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- The issue does not affect other documents, is just affecting the particular Excel spreadsheet which is very large.&nbsp; Other Excel spreadsheets have no such problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The issue started only only 1 week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am unable to send you the spreadsheet as it is confidential</p>
<p><span>When browsing the Web to see if there are people who raised similar issues previously.&nbsp; This is what I found which was shared on 6 Aug 2010.&nbsp; The problem is very similar to mine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Excel 2007 changes cell format by itself at random</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I have a very large workbook with multiple sheets formatted for different currencies and numbers. At random I find excel will change all the cell formats on the sheets to either the wrong currency, change a currency to a number, change everything
 to the date instead of a number or change the number of decimals places.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what fix was offered to the person, but will like to check with you if you are aware of what I can to fix this problem in my spreadsheet now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the currency symbol changes whenever I select and apply a currency symbol for one of the cell.&nbsp; After that all the other cells will change the currency symbol to the currnecy symbol which I have just formatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing me a lot of time and effort to manually fix it but when the currency symboy changes again, I have to repeat the whole exercise of changing the currency symbol again in my spreadsheet. Now I have decided to stop changing the currency symbol
 until the problem is fixed.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Rachelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encountered another problem with the same spreadsheet now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to save the file, there is a warming message that appeared on the screen saying "The pictue is too large and will be truncated".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does truncate means?&nbsp; Does it mean that certain information in the spreadsheet will be deleted and not saved?</p>

<p>The best thing to do is never to use currency symbols in cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one column put amounts only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a separate column (called Currency) put the ISO currency codes (e.g. JPY, USD, GBP, EUR, NZD etc).&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel Threaded Comments - Available in build 1810&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel Threaded Comments  - Available in build 1810&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I find that a document hosted on our SharePoint has had all its comments become threaded (Looks like a user applied this in error in Excel Online), as the Threaded Comments feature seems to work correctly in Excel Online. I have replicated their process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However Threaded comments do not appear to work correctly in Desktop Excel (see below). Is this a feature still in Beta?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not available in Desktop Excel then why is it available online when as far as I can tell there is no way to revert changes people make ?</p>
<p>I have seen screenshot online from someone on 1809 and it looked to be working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Example: </p>
<p>Right click context menu is missing options to reply which triggers the convert to threaded process.</p>
<p>All comments now have an error about it being Threaded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my organisation we use Office365 ( the Online versions are used to a much lesser degree. )<br />
Most of the Organisation I support are on 1810, or should be shortly, build 16.0.11001.20097.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp; Tim</p>

<p>Per my test result, this feature is not available under Office version 1811 (Build 11029.20079) which is current latest version for Monthly channel user. Basically, for now, this feature is only available
 under Monthly (targeted) channel.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this feature, please check
<a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Become an Office Insider</a>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This new feature will roll out to normal Office 365 subscribers eventually. If you don't prefer the insider program, please wait for the future updates.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
