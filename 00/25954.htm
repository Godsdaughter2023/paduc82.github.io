<h2>            Nokia Power Keyboard SU-42 has died</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I live in the UK, I bought my Lumia 2520 tablet in the USA in early December 2013 whilst I was there on holiday. As luck would have it, at the time I bought it I qualified for the free Power Keyboard which was delivered to my friends house in Boston
 in February 2014 and he shipped it to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the tablet, the case made it even better and for the most part, it has been flawless. Over the past few months though it occasionally stopped responding to key presses, but would come back to life with a re-boot of the tablet. &nbsp;This week it has failed
 to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It still makes a noise when connecting or disconnecting, the 2nd battery is still visible and charging but in Control Panel it says "Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)". When you connect it says "USB device not recognized, the last USB
 device you connected to this computer malfunctioned and Windowws does not recognize it".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried rebooting with the case on and off, uninstalling it, disabling it in all combinations&nbsp;of connected, disconnected, adding when shut down. I have pressed the ribbon cbla behind the pins, cleaned the pins, given it a good thump, and no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it has failed and is under warranty. Hovever, how do I go about making a claim given the circumsatnce of how I bought it. I have the reciept for the tablet and the claim form for the keyboard but there was no additional documentation for the keyboard</p>

            Since you are out of the region of purchase the best option is to take it to a care point and maybe explain other than that you would need to ship it back to the USA,if a UK agent offers to repair most likely you will foot the bill.

<p>Thanks, only issue with that is that Microsoft don't have any Care Points in Scotland. 8 in London alone, even 2 in Wales, closest one to Scotland is Preston or Lancaster. Guess I can phone one of them.</p>

    <title>Extracting commandbar FaceIDs for use as image in an image control - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dale.fye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extracting commandbar FaceIDs for use as image in an image control</h2>
                    <p>I've figured out how to extract both the PICTURE and MASK properties of the FaceId of any of the Office commandbar controls, and save those two properties as images on my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = CommandBars.FindControl(Id:=rs!FaceId)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stdole.SavePicture ctrl.Picture, "E:\TempPic.bmp"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stdole.SavePicture ctrl.Mask, "E:\TempMask.bmp"<br />
</p>
<p>But what I want to do is create an image picker that displays a set of these images in a form, either in an image control or as the picture property of a command button.&nbsp; Unfortunately, neither the image control or the command button has a Mask property,
 so the background of all of the picture images are black, rather than what they are supposed to be.&nbsp; The attached image shows the first 15 faceIDs, with the top row displaying the image saved with the PICTURE property and the bottom row showing the image created
 with the MASK property.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/972faba0-15e9-428f-b89e-3083b369a1b2" /></p>
<p>Is there a way to combine these to properties, or to save the image as a gif or other image type, which can then be assigned to the PICTURE property of an image control or a command button?</p>

            <p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>I see you're not wasting any time pushing ahead with your project!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this will help: https://imagemso.codeplex.com/</p>
<p>It includes source code (in .NET).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a route via the Windows API calls; functions like BitBlt and MaskBlt but this takes several calls and makes people roll their eyes when they see how much time and effort it may take.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Tom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes,&nbsp; I really would like to get the first iteration of this application on the street, and feel that the current interface to the various Office faces is unworkable (20 at a time means over 150 clicks to see the entire catalog).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already seen the URL you posted this morning (or last night) on the gmail site.&nbsp; But that appeared to use the ribbon gallery to display those images, and I was hoping to do this without resorting to the ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Miriam had sent me something similar and I found this (http://erlandsendata.no/?p=2692) which has a pretty good list of the images as well.&nbsp; But these are mostly Excel and a lot of the other Office images are missing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With an Access form, I can generate a gallery of 250 controls on a single form, and could probably easily display 500 on a page if I used two subforms, so it would be a lot less scrolling, if I can get those images (Picture and Mask) combined into a single
 image.&nbsp; Alexey Semenov, who is a frequent contributor on Experts-Exchange also recommended a tool called ImageMagicK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to distribute several thousand images, so it would be nice if I could create these at runtime, and if the BitBlt and MaskBlt API calls are fast enough, that might work.&nbsp; I'll take a look at those.&nbsp; Thanks for the reference.</p>

            <p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>The other thing you can do if all you want is to have a bitmap with a white background: BMP is a very simple file format and you can literally process the pixels in the two files (image and mask) at the same time and write code: if mask&nbsp;pixel = black then
 use image pixel else use white pixel.</p>

<p>I am using Windows 10 Professiona</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 365 trial; however, I am going to purchase the non-365 version<br />
I am getting an error message, but do not have a way yet to provide a screenshot<br />
I thought the protocol said "Outlook"<br />
My email provider is google/gmail<br />
At this point I am not concerned, because I believe that the MO package I am going to purchase does not include Outlook which is fine.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Guest link no login required redirects to login page</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using&nbsp;Office 365 Enterprise E3, I set up in Admin&gt;External users&gt;Allow&nbsp;sharing with anonymous guest links for your sites and documents and now the "Allow external users to access this site" is enabled with the option "Allow sharing with anonymous guest
 links for your sites and documents."</p>
<p>This is obviously active now. Before setting this up &nbsp;I could only see in the Share dialogue "account required" and now I have the options "view no sign-in required" and "edit - no sign-in required"</p>
<p>So, I generated a link view no sign-in required and set the expiration to "never" (<a href="https://mhdeffectiveservices.sharepoint.com/Public%20Site/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=qiiREP06s6gu%2f4nvbfiQejTMSX5hvDDRcT22h1tNV%2fU%3d&amp;docid=02f88e8a4f66645dfb79e8f8355bd4fcb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mhde***rvices.sharepoint.com/Public%20Site/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=qiiREP06s6gu%2f4nvbfiQejTMSX5hvDDRcT22h1tNV%2fU%3d&amp;docid=02f88e8a4f66645dfb79e8f8355bd4fcb</a>).</p>
<p>I tried to access the link from different computers and different browsers but it always display the login page.</p>
<p>I saw a similar question posed by&nbsp;JoanPasay&nbsp;but she tried to share from One Drive. Anyway she said she raised a ticket and it was solved, this isn't much help for me now.&nbsp;Kerwin
 Yang MSFT Support&nbsp;was involved in that thread.</p>
<p>Hope you can help me.</p>

<p>Hi Florina,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Do you also set “Allow sharing with all external users, and by using anonymous access links” for individual site collection (in SharePoint admin center&gt;site collection&gt;choose the site collection&gt;click Sharing)? Make sure the external sharing settings in Office
 365 Admin center, SharePoint admin center&gt;Sharing, SharePoint admin center&gt;site collection (for individual site collection) are all chosen to Allow anonymous access.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Moreover, do all the documents have the same issue with no sign-in required guest link? If you change to another site collection and enable the Allow anonymous access option with the steps mentioned above, will the no sign-required work properly?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>It's all OK from credentials point of view. I also allowed sharing for one drive just to test it and be able to answer your question.</p>
<p>See PDF attached.</p>
<p>Same problem. I create a link "view no log-in required" and it redirects strait to the login page. I see other people experienced the same issue, so what should I do? The product is not working according to it's specs, it's really frustrating...</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your answer.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Thank you for posting your question regarding restricting access to email on your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn't an option to set up a password for specific parts of the phone, with Windows Phone 7.&nbsp; We do recommend having a screen lock password set up to prevent anything from happening to your phone, but if you are allowing someone else to use it then
 you'll need to keep an eye on what they're doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a lot that you can still do with the phone with the screen locked, so it would depend on what exactly you are allowing your child to use your phone for.&nbsp; You can see what all the options are, take a look here:</p>

It seems like that is dead and has been very well buried since early this century.&nbsp; A common recommendation to others who have been searching for it seems to be that they should be using Share Point Server instead.</p>

    <title>pcsx2 on Windows 10 Technical Preview&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amgedismail  say:</h3>
<h2>            pcsx2 on Windows 10 Technical Preview&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Well,</p>
<p>My system is DELL Inspiron 15z 5523 Intel Core i7-5537U 2.00GHz CPU</p>
<p>had the Intel HD Graphics 4000 version 10.18.10.3277 from DELL and nVIDIA GeForce GT 630M they installed very fine on Windows 10 Preview.</p>
<p>However, when I suddenly tried the PS2 emulator "pcsx2" the FPS drops down while in game and scenes.</p>
<p>Because of that I switched between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Tech Preview for re-checking. The FPS doesn't drop down on Windows 8.1 but it does in 10 Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is that a Windows issue before it is still Preview? Graphics driver somewhat still in compatible with this Windows or even issue with compatibility issue with pcsx2 and Widows 10 Preview?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell because I like the use of Windows 10 better than Windows 8.1</p>

            I'm guessing a combination of graphics drivers and the DirectX stack; DX12 isn't released yet, nor are drivers for it leading to inefficient use of DX accelerated hardware at the moment.&nbsp; Also, I doubt the hardware specific Dell driver that redirects games
 usually to your GeForce is fully functional and pcsx2 is probably using the onboard Intel.&nbsp; You could try a different point release for your GT630 or try to force pcsx2 to use a specific graphic card in the context menu.&nbsp; If neither work......you're going
 to have to wait until DX12 in patched in I suspect.

<h2>            Office 365 for Education vs Google</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello Everyone,</span></p>
<p><span>This topic is geared more for ones that are using Office 365 for Education.</span></p>
<p><span>I work in the Technology Department of a K-12 school system in the US.
<span>&nbsp;</span>In 2016 we migrated from an on premise Exchange email system to Office 365 for Education A1.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>In 2016 we migrated from an on premise Exchange email system to Office 365 for Education A1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We use Windows servers and Active Directory to manage user accounts for our Windows systems and Office 365 (using Azure AD Connect).<span>&nbsp;
</span>We have never used Google so we went Office 365 to start with when we started to migrate to the cloud.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This school year we got a new superintendent for the school system which they started in July 2018.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They came from a school system that was using Google for Education.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is a possibility I was told last week that they may want us to switch from Office 365 to Google because they are more familiar with Google’s way.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is a district near us that is just now moving from Google and are switching to Office 365 that I heard about.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I’m curious how many other K-12 school systems use Office 365 or have switched from using Google Apps/G-Suite to Office 365.<span>&nbsp;

</span></span></span><span>Was your school system debating between using Office 365 or Google and Office 365 was chosen over Google in the end?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If so why was Office 365 chosen over Google?</span></p>

<p>Hi Brent – BCPS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your concerns in our forum. We appreciate for your interest in Office 365 products and would like to suggest you continue to use it. Office 365 provide many features
 for customers and improve working collaboration. Here’s the link regarding Office 365 for Education features:

<p>Hello Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, however it is not as simple as suggesting we continue to use it.&nbsp; Because if the superintendent decides they want us to switch to Google then we will not have a choice and will have to switch.&nbsp; So what I'm trying to is see if others
 in the community either switch from Google to Office 365 or picked Office 365 over Google while they were making plans to move to the cloud.&nbsp; Just pointing out features is not going to do the trick.&nbsp; I'm trying to get more information from other school systems
 to try to build a case for us to stay with Office 365.&nbsp; Does Microsoft have anything that compares Office 365 for Education against Google for Education feature wise?</p>

<p>Hi Brent – BCPS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand your concerns, but by my search there’s no relevant Microsoft official article could provide a comparison of features between Office 365 for Education and Google for Education. However, features
 in Office 365 for Education get improved and enhanced. We appreciate your continued interest and strongly suggest you continue use it. With Office 365, you can get a different experience like Class feature in Teams, Class OneNotes, and so on. You can also
 view more features in the link I posted in my first reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p>Hi Clarissa,</p>
<p>SharePoint Workspace is replaced by <strong>OneDrive for Business Sync Client</strong>,&nbsp;which provides the ability to sync SharePoint/OneDrive for Business contents. And yes, you can install the application with your plan/subscription.</p>
<p>To install it, browse to <a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
your Office 365 software download page</a> &gt; click OneDrive &gt; select language and version &gt; install.</p>
<p>If you have further concerns about this, please let us know.</p>

            <p>Hi Lumia Master,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the question you have about 7.8 and mtp transfer.&nbsp; This upgrade has not officially been released by Microsoft yet and so the full suite of features is not fully known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding transfering music from your PC to your 7.5 phone, this can be configured to sync over a home WIFi without the need for a USB cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a link on how to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Moving all emails in a conversation - except new emails</h2>
                    Is there a way that when I move one email in a conversation eg a reply that I'm sending, to another folder it will move all the other emails? I don't want to select "Always move emails from this conversation" as I still want to see new emails in my Inbox.
 I also need to apply this to all email conversations.

<h3> allan ng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 - Joining JMRP</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
We currently host our email via Office 365 and we recently noticed that some of our emails are being filtered as spam, so I decided to sign up to the Microsoft Junk Mail Reporting Program (JMRP) to learn more of this and to see if our mail emails are being
 marked our email as spam.<br />
<br />
However, I am stuck at the step where I need to provide the IP address of our mail server. &nbsp;I put in the Office 365 IP range I found online (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2).
 &nbsp;This will require me to select an email for authorization to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another IP address I am supposed to use here? &nbsp;Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Allan&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my research, the JMRP is used for the Outlook.com/Hotmail.com account not Office 365 account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, according to your description, the Hotmail and Outlook.com filter your emails. Obviously,<span>&nbsp;
</span>the issue is related to the Hotmail and outlook.com mail server. so we suggest you post a new thread via clicking

<h2>            Access database to track attendance - multiple sessions</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manage a small sports charity with around 150 members.&nbsp; We currently have a members database (in excel) and a different suite of spreadsheets to track attendance per session.&nbsp; I would really like to manage all of this in one place.&nbsp; Member info, payment
 info and their attendance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to build a database on access that will alllow me to track attendance of our members across all of the sessions we deliver each week.&nbsp; Is there a way for me to create an access database that allows me to assign a member to the sessions they attend
 (some attend 2/3 per week for different types of session) and then monitor which sessions they attend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seperate from this I will then manage how and when members have paid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to be able to pull reports off that help me show:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attendance per member</p>
<p>Attendance per session</p>
<p>Payments per member</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I'll need to create different tables but don't know how to link them efficiently.&nbsp; I definitely don't know how to assign members to more than one session to track attendance and then report on it collectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the sports club type approach isn't possible then something that a school would use to track attendance across the various classes on a student's timetable would do exactly the same thing that I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>
<p>

            The foundation of any database is a proper table structure. To build a proper data structure you need an understanding of the principles of relational databases. These principles are known as Normalization and there is a lot written about it that is available.
<br />
<br />One of the concepts you need to understand is that of Entity/Attribute. An Entity Is the basic building block and attributes describe the entity. For example, Members are an Entity, the attributes of a member are things like names, addresses, contact points, and other demographic info.
<br />
<br />So I see the need for the following entities; Members, Sessions, Payments and Attendance. The conundrum that is the base of your question is understanding the many to many relationship and how to model it. A member can attend multiple sessions and a session can be attended by multiple members. Many to Many. You use a Junction table to model this:
<br />
<br />tblAttendance
<br />AttendanceID (Primary Key Autonumber)
<br />MemberID (Foreign Key)
<br />SessionID (FK)
<br />
<br />From there you can build queries to report on attendance per session. 
<br />
<br />This medium is not really suitable for a tutorial but rather asking specific questions. I've tried to give you some background for research along with a answer to the one specific you asked. Looking at models or templates for a school situation will probably help you.

                    I have upgraded from Publisher 2003 to Publisher 2013 (Office 365). A font I use a lot (Gill Sans MT) appears different (although name appears the same), and is larger so many text boxes overflow. I have hundreds of publications that use this font, so
 it's a great problem. Any advice?

I don't have the links handy but one of the 'bugs' associated with Pub 2013 is that text renders at slightly different size in Publisher 2013, and/or the line spacing is different. The bottom line is that MS is aware of it, and many users have complained but
 nothing has been done to fix the problem yet. In the short term you have to tweak your layout if you want to use Pub 2013.<br />

Thanks so much for the helpful response.
<div><br />
<div>I have since discovered the compatibility problems with MS Publisher 2007 and 2010 go beyond this one font. As you mentioned, line spacing for many fonts is affected (including Arial and Times New Roman). I have over 1000 pages created in earlier versions
 of MS Publisher that look different (line spacing is tighter), and would need to be tweaked to be acceptable. &nbsp;(I now have Pub 2007 and Pub 2013 on the same machine, Windows 8, so can compare side-by-side).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have been on the phone with Microsoft Support, and their solution for me is to go into all of these pages and tweak them. Not much of a solution!&nbsp;</div>

I must apologize. I should have waited until I had more time to respond the first time as my answer was incomplete and not that accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all the text rendering&nbsp;'bug' is associated with Windows 8, not with the specific version of Publisher. You can take a Publisher 2007 file produced on XP, Vista, Windows 7 and then open it using Publisher 2007 on Windows 8 and the text will render
 differently. It appears that the height of the font or the amount of line space it requires is different in Win8. Here is a good link to a thread where this issue is disscussed and documented.
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-publish/documents-format-changes-when-working-on-the-same/892f528d-4750-47d6-a7da-8bb6e5273c0c">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-publish/documents-format-changes-when-working-on-the-same/892f528d-4750-47d6-a7da-8bb6e5273c0c</a>&nbsp; Interstingly one of the posters in that thread seemingly found a 'solution' by installing the Windows
 7 version of the font on the Windows 8 machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, there is another part of the answer and that is that MS changed one of the default settings as of Publisher 2010. In Publisher 2007 if you right clicked text in a text box &gt; Change text &gt; Paragraph you will find the line spacing to be set at 1sp and
 0pt after paragraphs. As of Pub 2010 MS changed that to 1.19sp and 6pt. I think they did this to match what the default had been in Word and wanted some consistency. Now if you open a Pub 2007 formatted publication in Pub 2013 then the original formatting
 will stick, but if you try to copy and paste from a Pub 2007 text box to a Pub 2013 text box then sometime the formatting changes, and this has created problems for users.</p>

<p>So, what you may be seeing may be the default line spacing that has been changed in Pub 2013, or it may be the different way that Windows 8 renders text in Publisher. If as you say you have both Pub 2007 and 2013 installed on the same Win8 machine you can
 open the same old Pub 2007 file built on an older operating system and I would expect the publication to look the same...and the formatting to be skewed a bit in both. You can save as a pdf from both and compare that way.&nbsp;The main culprit then is Win8 not
 Publisher.</p>

<div>Seems you are correct and this is a Windows 8 issue with Publisher 2013. I have checked the file on a computer with Windows 7 and Publisher 2013 installed and it looks as it should.&nbsp;</div>

Your test results are not totally consistent with what has been reported thus far. Other users have reported that this issue is independent of the version of Publisher. Once again other users have reported that if you produce the Publisher file originally on
 a Win7&nbsp;or older operating system machine and then open it on the Windows 8 machine the text layout is skewed, regardless of what version of Publisher you are using on the Win8 machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure that when you open the file in Publisher 2007 on the Windows 8 machine that the line spacing/text height was&nbsp;correct? If so was this test file originally produced on Win8 or on a Win7 or older operating system machine?&nbsp;It has been reported that
 if you produce the file originally on the Win8 machine and then try to open it on an older OS machine that the layout is skewed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an important point as I think the other users have all been using either Publisher 2013 or Publisher 2010 on Windows 8, and you may be the first that is reporting about the issue using Publisher 2007 on the Windows 8 machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to what MS will do about this, yes I hope they fix it as the backward and forward compatibility of&nbsp;Publisher files is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime I would suggest that you keep your old Publisher files seperate from your new Publisher 2013 files. Even
 if you have to open and tweak the layout of an old file in Publisher 2013, then save it as a copy in a Pub 2013 folder. That way if MS eventually makes old OS files fully compatible with Win8 files you won't have to tweak the layout again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be very hestitant of changing Win8 fonts with Win7 fonts at this point. If you do it I would be sure to save a copy of the Win8 fonts so you could reverse the change in the future. It is hard to say what impact changing the fonts would have on other
 programs running on Win8. Furthermore it is my understanding that there is a new 'improved' Windows 8.1 coming soon, and if the problem with Publisher files is fixed with that version of Windows, then doing something as drastic as changing font versions might
 be a mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please report back about my questions about opening files in Pub 2007 on Win8 and I will try to report back to you and this thread if I hear anything new about this 'bug'. Thanks for contributing to the understanding of this 'bug'.</p>

            That is not true actually (in my experience anyways). You get the same problem with Windows 7. Here at work we have all Windows 7. One person using Publisher 2013 on Windows 7 Pro another using Publisher 2007 on Windows 7 Pro and you get text problems
 when viewing the file created in the other version. Either way whatever the issue - all of these products are Microsoft products so they should issue a fix.

<h2>            How to disable alphabetical search in apps list&#63;</h2>
                    After an update to Mango and installing a lot of apps, my phone has the alphabetical search. I know that many people like it, but I actually prefer the simple list and scrolling down them without the big alphabets squares annoying.&nbsp;
<div><br />

<br />
You might be right.. I looked into it a bit and it seems it turns on around 50 apps but does not disable if you uninstall after that. Probably simply because not many people start uninstalling a lot of apps after reaching that number. I still consider it a
 bug, however, and hope Microsoft noticed it too and fix it in Tango (the next update).

            There is currently no option to disable the alphabetical jump list. It shows when you reach around 50 apps and hubs.

<h2>            Microsoft Office Bounty Bug</h2>
                    <div>Hello, my name is Alexander. I'm from Russia, and my English so bad. I found one bug/security vulnerability in Office. I can found it in Office 2007/2016/2019 and Office 365. In my University all documents and presentations have password protect. Today,
 i found an opportunity open and edit secure documents and presentations. And I didn’t need any hacking software, I used only Microsoft Office and browser.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>That's work for Word, Excel, Power Point and other product with password protection.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>If you are interested in correcting this error, let me know. I often create important documents for university management and I would very much like, like many other authors, to defend my copyright and to be sure that the material written by me cannot
 be changed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since I live far from the richest family, but I am very fond of computers and programming, as well as the search for vulnerabilities - I decided to write to you and try your luck to get into the program Bounty Bug. Thank you in advance for your reply!
 And once again I apologize for my English, I just study it.</div>

<h2>            I can&#39;t turn on window defender</h2>
                    &nbsp;I just got windows 8 and every time i try to run windows defender and i just get a message saying widows defender is not turned on. I do have norton security on right now but that is just a free 60 day trial, is this the reason why i can't turn it on

            Defender turns itself off if it detects another AV program.&nbsp; This is deliberate to avoid accusations of MS trying to create a monopoly.
