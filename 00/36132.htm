<h2>            Skype to Skype Calls Disconnect, even the Echo Test</h2>
                    <p>I am running the latest version of Skype for Windows 10. I also installed Skype for Desktop. Neither version works with calls or video. They both connect and then after a few seconds will disconnect abruptly. This also happens when I try the Echo Test Call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to proceed with fixing this problem. I can't talk to any of my overseas friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help</p>
<p>Tom L Jones</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Horizon Life servers.</h2>
                    <p>As of late (1-2 weeks) I am having issues when trying to connect to the Horizon 4, Horizon Life servers on PC. Whenever the game loads I am forced in to a solo session and will never manage to find an online session. I have been able to play online Seasonal
 Challenges but I can't get in to lobbies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My NAT type on the Xbox App is OPEN. I have disabled UPnP whilst opening the following ports on both inbound and outbound connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>- 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>- 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>- 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>- 500 (UDP)</p>
<p>- 3544 (UDP)</p>
<p>- 4500 (UDP)</p>
<p>- 60209 (UDP)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also created rules within my Windows Firewall to open the above ports on both inbound and outbound connections. As well as doing this, I have used the cmd commands for teredo I have seen on various forums etc..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make a correct troubleshooting of your compute do this &gt; Put the ip of your computer in the DMZ of your router.</p>
<p>Unable any antivirus and firewall of your Windows.</p>
<p>DO NOT GO on any website cause at this point your are totally not secure.</p>
<p>Now launch the game and try to play.</p>
<p>If its working its meaning that your settings are wrong so adjust them.</p>
<p>If not, go to their own support page ( when DMZ is resetted , and antivirus and firewall enabled ) &gt;&nbsp;<a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.forzamotorsport.net/</a></p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;microsoft ensures a reputation system that recognizes false reports&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Lately "avoid me" reputation has been a huge problem. I've found myself reading every article I could find on xbox one's reputation system. Reading things such as
<br />
"though the company is keen to reassure everyone that the system can't be gamed by others trying to punish you for no reason, as only sustained negative actions will invoke penalties.", seriously makes me laugh. Was that originally made to be a joke? Somebody
 correct me if i'm wrong, but i'm almost positive the avoid me situation hasn't been much of a problem, or there hasn't been many complaints since xbox one was released, until the mass amounts of halo players that started to fall in June after playlists ranks
 were released.<br />
<br />
I bought a Xbone last November and played nothing but halo online and my reputation stayed green right up until June when ranks were released. Being the highest rank in one of the playlists, I'm an easy target for people to block/report and in the first week
 or so I went from green to red. When I posted my inquiry I get an automated code of conduct message...I know the rules and I don't abuse them, even if I did use vulgar language from time to time and got reported for it, that's straying from the point of the
 system not being what Microsoft said it was going to be. Like the last couple of days, I was in "orange" I played cod for 8 hours, went to halo for an hour got blocked by a few people and went to red again. Then today went to green, figured sweet they finally
 realized I've been false reported so many times, and I kept refreshing the enforcement page, in 5 minutes I had another cheater report WHEN I DIDNT EVEN PLAY ANYTHING, and then back to orange rep. Which basically means I'm going to red again.<br />
<br />
So i'm paying for a service that i'm not able to use because i'm being abused by a system made to ensure this type of thing didn't happen, as are many many other people. It's been obvious to me that the same people are blocking/reporting me everyday, possibly
 making fresh accounts, as it's easy with gold sharing, but it goes unnoticed, because of course it's mainly the Halo community and how toxic it can be for those who can't stand losing, especially with ranks involved now. It's not like CoD or Battlefield where
 if you lose you still rank up. But I hate to say it, if this doesn't get fixed, and I continue to fall to red simply because i'm good at the only video game I enjoy playing, I will be forced to take my business to PlayStation. I can't keep spending all my
 free time on xbox trying to increase my rep when so many are working against me to keep it down. And like I said, it's not just me, it's a good number of really good halo players, who all started falling to avoid me around the same time, coincidence? I mean
 the facts are right there.....We get called cheaters for being good, but the real cheaters are those who know the exploit to prevent people from playing, and abuse it. This is just my rant, one of the many furious gamers, victim of the flawed reputation system,
 thanks Microsoft.</p>

<p>If your reputation falls to "avoid me" which is red, you cannot match anybody unless they are also in red. There are ways to bypass, like on CoD, you can join through friends who are already in games, I also heard that Battlefield Hardline allows you to
 find games, but games such as halo MCC, Gta 5, Forza, you can't find other people.</p>

<p>It seems your problem/issue is more enforcement related. In my years in this particular forum (xbox one general), have never seen any proof that Microsoft is reading anything here, so not very likely you will get any official response or acknowledgement.</p>

<p>BlazxNN, this is me correcting you because you're wrong.</p>
<p>There are numerous factors that you're not taking into account.</p>
<p>1. The same person reporting you multiple times for the same thing will still only count as 1 report.</p>
<p>2. Multiple reports for the same thing from multiple accounts on a single console count as a single report, since the enforcement team can see that kind of info when reports are made.</p>
<p>3. The enforcement page here on the site isn't always accurate - I know this from personal experience. You're better off looking at your reputation on the console.</p>
<p>4. The enforcement team will never punish you for being too good - they have stated this.</p>
<p>5. The constant foul language is likely why your reputation dropped.</p>
<p>6. If your actions really are why your reputation has taken a hit, going to a different console won't make a difference as they have a similar code of conduct.</p>
<p>7. Multiple reports from different people for the same thing in a short time span will only count as 1 report (as will multiple claims from multiple players in a single game).</p>
<p>8. It takes multiple different reports from multiple people over the course of weeks or months to affect your rep.</p>
<p>9. Enforcement actions have no time limitation - for example, you can have action taken against you today for something you did 2 years ago.</p>
<p>Now, for some advice:</p>
<p>1. Play with friends.</p>
<p>2. Communicate only in party chat.</p>
<p>3. Follow the XBL Code of Conduct (e.g., don't use foul language).</p>
<p>4.Try a different game.</p>
<p>5. Take a break for a while.</p>
<p>Once your reputation drops, the ONLY way it can go back up is by playing games without getting any CONFIRMED reports against you for a long period of time (we're talking months here, not weeks or days).</p>

<p>That's definitely wrong, although when you check your reputation on the enforcement page it may not be always accurate, but I know for a fact the same guy has reported/blocked unblocked
 and blocked again, and has made new accounts to do so, and my reputation dropped instantly. So i'm not wrong in the
 case that it works, because it has been tested numerous times. It was even done on stream by a halo player.

<p>Takes all kinds to make a world, and if there is a way to mess up other peoples enjoyment. You better believe that people will find and exploit it.
</p>
<p>I used to play online but the rep system for the 360 made me quit playing online altogether. So it's solo or no go for me now. I do miss playing Halo 4 BTB/Sp Ops MP though.
</p>
<p>From reading threads here. Seems rep plays an ever greater role with the Xbox One, so I'll have to consider that as well while budgeting for a current gen console.

<p>Burning, i'm afraid you're too far on the bandwagon to understand the issue at hand here. Trying to convince me the rep system is true when i've witnessed many times already it is not. You could tell me, "well if you're in party chat all the time maybe your
 friends report you" and I would say so then that would mean one report, doesn't just count as one report, correct? Basically telling me that my rep falls because i'm a bad player, when i'm probably one of the most level headed players in Halo lol. The biggest
 issue I find is that when you match a team that knows they can't win, they block you. Blocking means you can't match that person again, which also counts as negative feedback. People now know this, and abuse it. Please don't sit there and tell me I'm a bad
 player or a bad sport in game. If you were in my shoes, as a good player in the Halo community right now, you'd be here just as I am i'm willing to GUARANTEE that.</p>

<p>BlazxNN, if you ask me, if what you say is true, then you should be doing something about it. On the Xbox 360, they had a false claims report feature, where if someone wrongfully reported you, you could report them - I suggest you use it. The One doesn't
 have this feature, but that's because it has something better - the ability to leave comments. If I were you, I would report each and every account that supposedly belongs to this unscrupulous individual and leave, in detail, what he's doing to discredit you.
 This will help build up a case and evidence as the enforcement team will be able to look into his multiple accounts' info (even going as far as seeing if it's coming from the same location or IP address, for example) and take action against him and begin the
 process of setting things right for you. </p>
<p>The worst case scenario? You're not telling the truth and nothing changes (and if that's the case, I highly suggest you stop it and follow my advice up above in my last post).</p>
<p>Look at the bright side of things - once you hit rock bottom, there' s only 1 direction left to go. ;)</p>

            <p>The setup file, AllsharePCSW.exe, was downloaded from Samsung and always worked on Windows 8 and 8.1. In fact the file worked fine on some early versions of the Technical Previews of Windows 10. This is the only software that I get the problem with. I have
 tried to disable the Windows Firewall as suggested but I still get the same problem. I use this software all the time to watch videos stored on my computer on my Samsung TV. The software works fine if I install on Windows 8 or 8.1 first then upgrade to Windows
 10 so for now it is fine. If, in a years time, when I purchase Windows 10 and for some reason I need to do a clean install the whole process will take a long time, as I shall have to install Windows 8 first then upgrade to Windows 10. Thanks for your suggestion
 though and if there are any more ideas I would be most grateful and try them all.</p>

<p>Haha yep sure enough I put that in the wrong spot. &nbsp;The modem is provided by comcast - but isn't in my duplex (share with the other half). I used to have a linksys router and managed an open NAT after some tweaking. I'm not sure what the modem is, however.
 I'd have to ask the neighbor when he's back in town.</p>

<p>the "modem" Comcast provided is almost certainly a "gateway " &nbsp;which is a modem and router combo , that means you are using 2 routers and will get double NAT most of the time....and you mentioned port forwarding &nbsp;and upnp , both will confuse the router sometimes.....I
 would try and reset the router to factory defaults by holding the little reset button for 30 seconds &nbsp;and see if that helps....but most likely this is tied to the Comcast device , not yours ...</p>

<p>I have the same router. Have you made sure you have given your Xbox a static IP in the router settings? And then entered that IP address in the port forwarding setup? &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have and its still not working, you can try to narrow it down and find out if its your router or your modem, by turning off port forwarding and then enabling DMZ and assigning your Xbox from the drop down. That basically opens up everything to and
 from your Xbox. </p>
<p>If that works, you at least know that its your router and not the modem that is causing your problems. You can keep the DMZ enabled and continue using like that, although a lot of people worry that DMZ leaves your console vulnerable. I guess it can be thought
 of as a last resort. </p>
<p>Let me know what happens, and i can assist you further. </p>

<p>Thank you both. I definitely haven't given my xbox a static ip in the routers settings. I'm not exactly sure how to do that so I'll try to google around unless you know the instructions. I'll try tonight and report back.

<p>I followed the instructions from portforward to assign a static IP address in my router but I'm still getting a moderate for NAT. &nbsp;I haven't heard back from my neighbor on the model of our modem either. &nbsp;I'll see if the DMZ trick changes anything.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10  stuck at &#8220;Getting Windows Ready&#8221; after a restart</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspirion 15 with windows 10. Normally the “getting windows ready” screen fixes itself after an hour or so, but this time its been stuck on this screen for over a day. I’ve tried changing the UEFI settings (that got me stuck again), I’ve taken
 out the battery and drained the power supply to try that (still stuck), I’ve tried just letting it go, I’ve tried powering it down and then powering it back up.</p>
<p>I honestly have to idea what to try from here, and I can’t do a complete restore because I don’t have the license key for this laptop.</p>
<p>Any help at all would be appreciated</p>

            Hi Mercedes, It sounds like you were getting an update and things went wrong!
<br />
<br />Press and hold the power button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down

<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<h2>            My password is too long. &#40;troubles signing in&#41;</h2>
                    I tried to sign in on my xbox 360 to download Dead Space 3 as it won't let me buy it on my pc, phone, or xbox one. I tried signing into my account on 360 and it required by password, so i blindly typed it in, and after multiple attempted tries i later
 noticed there was a character cap for the password. I know i can shorten my password, but it still confuses my as to why there would be a character cap in typing in the password. Just pointing it out. I'm going to shorten my password to fit the limit, but
 I hope this can be fixed for later, unless there is something i'm doing wrong.

<p>The xbox 360 password box was limited to 16 characters.&nbsp;</p>

            I use the xbox one, and only got on my 360 just to download dead space 3, as it was free for gold, because It didn't like me trying to download/buy and said I had to do it on my xbox. But thanks, my password is 20+ characters so i guess I was way over
 the limit. Microsoft should still fix it for security reasons.

<p>You can still make a strong password with less then 16 characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance just as an example this is how I do most of my passwords</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ill use my last name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>capitalize the first letter&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>before the last letter I will put in the 4 digit house number of the house that I grew up on&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>put in the last letter&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and then put in one of the special characters above the numbers on the keyboard</p>

            Another thing I just thought about is if you try and play any 360 backwards compatible game on the ONE your going to run into the same problem. So you will want to keep your password below the 16 characters or your gonna run into the problem even on the
 One.

    <title>BSOD - Blue Screens after Windows 10 re-installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bornaberta  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD - Blue Screens after Windows 10 re-installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have an ACER Aspire V3 772G, and it started throwing various bluescreens a month or so after my upgrade to Windows 10. Bluescreens often occur when installing updates and I even got one when I tried to completely re-install Windows 10. After that
 re-installation completed successfully however I still get them very often, mostly when I play games and sometimes when watching videos. Very rarely during normal operation (facebooking, using Office and such). Some of the error messages that appear are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (NTFS.sys)<br />
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</p>
<p>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (STORAHCI.SYS)<br />
FAULTY_HARDWARE_CORRUPTED_PAGE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 x64 on an ACER Aspire V3 772G &nbsp;(16GB RAM, i7 4702MQ, GTX 850M)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that this is only a software issue or do I have to be worried about hardware failure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would post more data about the errors if I knew where to find it.</p>

<br />
I installed the new Chipset driver and I will try to reproduce the issue to see if it happens again. Just before I read your reply, I got another one: BAD_POOL_CALLER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if the issue will occur again, however I would like to know if it is in any way possible that this is a hardware issue, since I actually got a blue screen during a fresh installation of Windows 10.</p>

            Also, I forgot to add: No it is not related to anything specific. It happens when I play certain games (like Team Fortress 2), it never happened when I played Space Engineers, sometimes it does happen while watching videos online. Sometimes it is completely
 random - during reboot or installing updates.

            Hi, it's me again, though under a different user name (college account). Installing the driver did not fix it, I just got a new one. Again the DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (k57nd6a.sys)

            <p>I had the exact same experience. I first upgraded Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, and the upgrade went as it should.</p>
<p>After a while I got the BSOD (storahci.sys) and the computer was not possible to boot anymore.</p>
<p>I reinstalled Windows 10 and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>Then I started disconnecting disks, and when I disconnected the two 3Gb/s SATA 7200 rpm disks Windows installed and it's still working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The downside to this is that I lost 4 TB of storage which I have to replace with other disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try reconnect them after the next Intel Chipset drivers is released.</p>

<p>First thing to check is Acer's Support Site for any manufacturer firmware updates. &nbsp;It can also be useful to scan their User Forum (if there is one) for any similar reports of problems.</p>

    <title>I need to permanently disable Windows 10 upgrade assitant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaeltsho  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need to permanently disable Windows 10 upgrade assitant</h2>
                    <p>So here's the problem, and it seems nobody at Microsoft is willing to address it. I have disabled Windows Update. Windows update should NEVER RUN. Yet, I turn on my computer (that was in standby, that should not have powered down EVER) and my computer says
 it's installing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;</p>
<p>DO</p>
<p>NOT<br />
WANT<br />
UPDATES</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to uninstall the updates and remove the "Windows10Upgrade" files and folders. They come back the next day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I NEED to permanently disable this and have it to never run. I bought a product that should work out of the box. I do not want updates. I pay for the internet I use. I am not going to pay for the internet that Microsoft graciously uses for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I pirated Windows I wouldn't be dealing with this **** because all Windows servers would be blocked, but I decided to play by the rules and actually purchase a Windows 10 Pro key. This was apparently a bad idea.</p>

No, that does not work. Windows Update service is DISABLED in services.msc. Yet, for some reason "Windows10Upgrade" re-enables the service I have explicitly disabled and re-downloads the program.

<p>So I have a temporary fix, but I still don't like it. Windows 10 is no longer trying to update itself and no longer downloading crap to my hard drive that I don't want. I cannot delete the file that creates the "Windows10Update" folder (says I need to be
 system to delete it. I'm the administrator - I should be able to delete anything I want) but I can block it from running in Group Policies. I have everything blocked in my Hosts file now so that hopefully nothing else from Microsoft will try to download without
 my EXPLICIT permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shouldn't have to do this. I have updates DISABLED. If I don't want to run updates, it better not run. Microsoft does not decide what I do with my computer - I do.</p>

<p>Not correct. Windows 10 is sold as a service. That includes regular updates.</p>
<p>It is also sold "as is" which was in the contract you agreed to (and should have read) when you installed Windows 10 as your Operating System.</p>

    <title>About the New MSPaint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> starfishlove  say:</h3>
<h2>            About the New MSPaint</h2>
                    Hey there Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I've been working with paint for older windows versions for a long time, and have just recently invested in a completely new system, your windows 7. I discovered that the new MSPaint&nbsp;--which comes with this new system --&nbsp;is very poor for creating pixel art,
 and, although it has many great options like the brushes and so on, it lacks greatly&nbsp;in one very important way.<br />
<br />
Frankly, all of the pixel must be colored by placing your brush, pencil, etc. in the VERY corner of a single pixel, and it really messes up what you're doing, especially if you are used to the freer selection on MSPaint. I love the rest, but really, this needs
 to be fixed. I have practically thrown my computer against the wall in the anger I feel toward this one setback.<br />
<br />
Also, I tried to download the older version of paint, but it is not compatible with this computer. This problem is aweful for all of the fans of Paint for its ease of use, and everyone I know who uses paint has said that they hated it mostly for this reason.
 Please tell me you can fix this.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. </span></p>
<p><span>I will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the below methods and check if that helps. </span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: <strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Initially I suggest you to start your computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well.<strong>
</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The word
<strong>Safe Mode</strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article below to start your computer in safe mode</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows Startup settings (Including Safe Mode)</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: <strong>System File Checker</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>You may run Microsoft System File Checker tool SFC /SCANNOW to scan the system integration and fix any corruption.</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>sfc /scannow (System File Checker) </strong>command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files.</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Toshiba Laptop wont recognize my iphone</h2>
                    Went to plug my iphone into my laptop today and a message popped up saying that 'The USB device is not recognized' and when i clicked on this message it says that my device malfunctioned previously and the laptop has basically blocked the device. Is there
 any way that I can unblock my device so that I can plug my iphone in and go onto iTunes? It has never happened before and my phone usually plugs in fine and itunes automatically opens.

            <p><span>Hi Harriet,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could occur if the device not removed correctly when it was connected to a PC the last time or if the USB drivers are corrupt. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, I would suggest you to switch OFF the iphone, restart it and check if the issue occurs. If yes, I would suggest you to connect the iphone to a different USB port to check if the issue is with the USB port. If you face the same issue
 with all USB ports, then I would suggest you to connect a different USB device to check if the issue is with the USB driver. If other USB devices are recognized correctly, then the USB drivers are fine. If other USB devices are also not detected then there
 could be an issue with the USB drivers. In this case, I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Run the automated hardware and devices troubleshooter that can automatically detect and fix most of the incorrect settings that could cause issues with hardware devices. Refer to these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key +F</em></strong> to bring up the
<strong><em>search</em></strong> Charms bar.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong><em>settings</em></strong> in the drop down menu below search and type
<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><em>Troubleshooting </em></strong>and select the
<strong><em>view all</em></strong> option on the left pane.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><em>Hardware and devices</em></strong> troubleshooter and follow the prompts.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, try the steps suggested in this article and check if it helps:</span></p>

            Hi Signets.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These special steps lead up to if necessary choosing to save nothing when running the media which almost always works, and is close but not as good as a Clean Install which is also offered as an option.  Your files should always be backed up if you value them at all. 
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then immediately after it fails try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean Installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.

            Hi Signets, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps downgrading my NVIDIA driver, and the one it installs causes VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE</h2>
                    <p>I got the BSOD 4 times this morning, a record for me with Windows 10. Each time, doing random things: remoted in to &nbsp;work, checking for Windows Updates, looking at Facebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in work now so I don't have access to most of the pertinent info, but - NVIDIA has a later driver for my graphics card, but Microsoft Update keeps insisting upon downgrading it every time I try to install it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent hours last week, removing the driver to the basic Windows one, rebooting, installing the NVIDIA latest one, rebooting, only to have Windows Update back out my upgrade... &nbsp;I finally gave up. But random and continuing BSODs, culminating in today's
 4 (I finally had to go to work, so I had no time to pursue the issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to prevent MS from updating THIS driver. Not ALL drivers but definitely this one. I want to at least have a chance to see if the later one will solve the BSOD - I don't even know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW DO I STOP THIS!!!!</p>

</p><p>What do you mean "connected to the domain"? It's a home computer, networked.</p>
<p>No recent changes. It's been doing this off and on for months. Today's 4 BSODs just really tipped the scales.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the memory diagnostic tool when I get home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to update device drivers, I've been doing it for years. When it searches for the latest one, it claims the one Microsoft is offering is that - so says the driver is up-to-date. The fact is, the latest one on the NVIDIA website, is newer. I've
 tried installing that one but as soon as I reboot Microsoft Update decides it needs to be replaced with the older one, so I'm back to square one... and a BSOD at random intervals.</p>

<h2>            How to change the keyboard layout on Windows 10 TP&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After upgrade to Windows 10 I have some issues with all my symbols.<br />
I am from Denmark, so i have Danish or Scandinavian keyboard, but i think the problem is that Windows 10 only have English keyboard.<br />
However my other laptop work just fine..<br />
When i hit a symbol i like to make, it just makes another symbol.<br />
Ex. if i try to make a question mark, this symbol appear _<br />
<br />
Is there anyway i can get it the symbols back in place again_<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop that doesnt work is a Packard Bell Notebook Easynote EN LS11HR<br />
With Windows 10 running now. Before Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Alexander,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the issue description, it seems like you are using the “<strong><em>English</em></strong>” keyboard layout on the computer with the Danish keyboard hardware and that is the reason why “<strong><em>?</em></strong>”
 mark appears as the “_” symbol. On “<strong><em>English</em></strong>” keyboards, the “<strong><em>?</em></strong>” mark is available at the same place where you have the “_” symbol on the Danish keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, I would suggest you to add the “<strong><em>Danish</em></strong>” keyboard layout and then switch the current keyboard layout to “<strong><em>Danish</em></strong>” on the computer and check if
 that resolves the issue. Please refer to the Microsoft Help article given below and then follow the instructions under the section “<strong><em>Change the keyboard layout or input method you use to type</em></strong>” from that article:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/add-language-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Change your language or keyboard</span></a></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Hope this resolves the issue. Please get back to us with the result.</span>

<p>
</p><p>The right&nbsp;layout is only recognized after the login, I found it out because windows was keeping on telling me that the password was wrong!
</p>
<p>It's like the layout is not recognized in the login screen!</p>

            This doesn´t work. I added my own language, the keyboard layout and set it to override the input method. The symbols on my keyboard still won´t match those on the screen. Please offer some help to resolve this problem, it´s really annoying to constantly
 have to guess where the right symbol is.
