<h2>            Lot of Problems Windows 8.1 &#58; Can&#39;t Modify Permissions, Missing Uninstall Button in Add&#47;Remove Programs, Missing Description in Local Security Policy</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've installed yesterday the Windows 8.1 Update and got in a lot of trouble...</div>
<div>Besides the graphic card and the audio card not working well, but that's not a Microsoft / Windows problem (missing drivers), I've encountered a lot of issues :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>I can't no more uninstall any program from the Add/Remove Programs, in the windows I can't see the buttons to uninstall etc. The strange thing is that the buttons "exists" but the description is missing, also when I click on the "invisible" button I got
 an error stating that the application might already be uninstalled which is obviously not. Here is a screenshot :<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84b9aafb-53d6-423f-8731-57047dff06d5" /></li><li>The second problem is related to folder permissions, here on some folders whenever i try to switch to the Security Tab and edit the permissions i get an error stating that i need a name specified in the CLSID key (whatever that means :S)</li><li>Last but not least I saw another strange thing, i was trying to modify some settings in the Local Security Policy and noted that most of the descriptions are gone, here another screenshot :<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/263e93ae-54b3-4026-b83d-61221f32ac83" /></li></ol>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div>It seems something bad has happened to my system.. I've already tried an sfc /scannow in a cmd prompt with administrative rights but nothing has changed. Unfortunately format is not an option at the moment.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please can someone help me get through this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank You</div>
                </div>

            <p>Windows 8.X...the gift that keeps on giving...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I opened a pdf attachment to an email, and it opened into the "tile world" 7th circle.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'll set aside for a moment the fact that if I never, Ever EVER! see anything that even dimly looks like "tile world" again, I'll be a happy man.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't want to use SkyDrive. I don't want to use the stupid "file type" folders that are embedded in 8.X. I want to save, and work in, SUBJECT based folders that *I* create.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, after getting opened into the "tile world" 7th circle with my pdf, I stumbled around in the dark, and finally found how to display the upper level directory where I wanted to store the file. And it said that I didn't have permission to open it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is INSANE! The is my personal, stand-alone machine, and there have never been, and never will be, any users other than me. The issue of "permissions"
<em>should never even come up</em>!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Who signed off on the release of this turkey? Some refugee from Obamacare?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And more importantly...how can I fix it? I had this problem with 8.0, and I thought 8.1 had fixed it, but apparently not.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If Microsoft <em>wants</em> to drive users to one of the other two competing ecosystems, they've devised a very good process to do it. I'm embarrassed to say that I used to be a big Microsoft supporter.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Recall this bug-ridden turkey, and put everyone on 7.X until this thing actually works. Microsoft might consider doing some regression testing too.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Totally fed up.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It started around the time I upgraded to 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. File rights are wrong, and i cant edit them</p>
<p>- except for in my own userfolder., where its obviously fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Cant uninstall anything. No problem installing</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Names missing from the security rights</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft, Come up with a solution instead of beating around the bush.<br />

                    Alright, so I am using windows 8 on a Toshiba brand laptop. My problem is, at random times a pop up saying,&nbsp;"You are about to be logged off, Windows will shut down in 1 minute" and after one minute, my computer shuts down. This can happen from 10 minutes
 after I start my computer, to hours, it's completely random, but very annoying, as sometimes it occurs when I am in the middle of rendering videos that I need to get finished. And this is interfering quite a bit. Does anyone have a clue as to why this might
 be happening?&nbsp;

            You are probably having auto update on something.&nbsp; It may be Toshiba updates, or it may be Windows updates.&nbsp; I leave all my updates set to manual and check for updates daily.&nbsp; This way I know when I need to re-boot and I don't lose any work, and I know
 when an update comes in or fails so I have a better idea of what is going on if my computer starts to act up.

            <p>Your deleted items folder is likely corrupt.&nbsp; Close OE and delete the deleted items.dbx file.&nbsp; OE will make a new one and that should fix the issue.&nbsp; Its a good time to backup your messages if folders are getting corrupted.&nbsp; You could lose all your messages.&nbsp;

    <title>checking for updates stuck after update of windows update agent - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            checking for updates stuck after update of windows update agent &#40;Vista&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>I recently did a factory reset on a HP laptop running Windows Vista 32-bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>*The reason I did a factory reset as when I went to Windows Update it would only show two updates and would not not download them successfully. I&nbsp;even tried to do them manually but they wouldn't install. Windows Update&nbsp;was stuck on those 2 updates and wouldn't
 update to show others. I tried a System Restore but that too was unsuccessful. In the end I started from scratch.*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have downloaded Windows Service Pack&nbsp;1 and 2. Had ALOT of problems downloading Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.256 but it has finally installed successfully. Problem is now when I check for updates it just hangs.
</p>
<p>I don't have any anti virus software running (because I think that may have caused problems before the factory reset). I'm trying to get all the updates to install first,&nbsp;before&nbsp;I install Norton.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked around and and tried most things but the clean boot&nbsp;as it will erase all the system restore points.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am relunctant to try that because from what I have read the problem reappears after installing Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.256.</p>

<p>I have tried the Fixit tool seveal times but I don't know if that is a hindrance or a help. It keeps coming up with errors that are supposedly fixed, only to show up again after my laptop is restarted.</p>
<p>

6 Some security settings are missing or have been changed <br />

            <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did a complete restore of a sony&nbsp;vaio ar630e with windows vista home premium. My experience went as follows but maybe not exactly to the "T".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I erased the discs with "vaio data erase" 3 times which equaled 1 hour for each processes 'cause after booting from the first&nbsp;complete recovery and observing the OS start up it seemed to me there was corruption. It was obvious since I had all kinds of weird
 colors on the screen at start up and during the boot, the BIOS splash had a plaid look to it, lol.&nbsp;I could only come to the conclusion the disc was badly corrupted from about 7 years of solid usage, lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the erase and the another complete recovery it was much better and so I proceeded to connect to the internet setting it so that it connected automatically&nbsp;and update windows defender, which I had to allow a couple processes to be successfully run.
 It was the recommended action. The computer was always connected to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed vaio update and updated all the drivers from update. This takes a while and a few restarts. It updated a bunch of stuff a&nbsp;couple important ones&nbsp;were the video driver and wireless network driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I set the power options so that it set&nbsp;on high performance,&nbsp;disabled the screen saver, and set it so that it would never sleep. After that I proceeded to allow all important and recommended windows updates to happen. This part takes a long time and
 the computer needs to restart quite a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got to service pack 1 windows update for some reason would not install it correctly so I manually downloaded it on another computer to a dvd and installed it manually on the vaio. I had to open the properties in the service pack 1 files and click
 on "unblock", "accept" and "ok" in order for me to be able to open and run it. Takes about an hour to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After service pack 1 is installed comes more updates and restarts. Keep in mind along the whole way of windows updates you may have some "failed updates". If you do just keep installing them until they install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got to service pack 2 the same thing happened as service pack 1. I installed it the same way too. This takes about an hour and restarts a few times&nbsp;if I recall correctly. Might be a little less than an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After service pack 2 was installed comes more updates and restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Then comes windows update agent. </strong>This one seemed like it wasn't installing correctly or working correctly after it seemingly looked like it installed. I downloaded it manually like I did with the service packs and installed it the same way
 but it also seemed not right. I remember getting ready to go to bed and before I left it I opened windows update and clicked the button to install updates and when I woke up 5-6 hours later I looked at it and it had 165 updates ready to install, lol. I let'em
 rip and left it be, lol. Came back later and I may have restarted it but I know there were more updates. Not long after that The 'puter was completely updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the whole process using just windows defender and allowing any processes to run if it asked me. It just pops up when it&nbsp;finds them and asks&nbsp;you to allow it. Basically it was&nbsp;the recommended action every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all the updates were done and &nbsp;I restarted the computer a few times&nbsp;then installed microsoft security essentials and let it update and ran a quick scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing all this took a really long time&nbsp;and I didn't stay in front of the computer the whole time. Some of these updates take a long time and should not be interfered with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I'm doing the exact same thing to the other hard drive in the same computer. I'm at the windows update agent part now and it's acting like it's working but no updates are found yet, lol. If I find anything about improving this part of the updating
 process I'll post it. I haven't manually installed the windows update agent yet. I'm just letting it run for a long time to see what gives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One&nbsp;hard disk drive&nbsp;now has a great working system and I'm going to try to find software to create a system image of it.&nbsp;If I'm lucky I'll have 2, lol. It'll be interesting to see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps some.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 10/19/2015 1:46 pm: It's been a few hours and windows update just started to notify me that there are updates downloading. It'll probably need another couple of hours to be ready to install and I'm pretty sure it's going to be something like 167 of
 them, lol.</p>

                    <p>For a long time Taptiles has not had advertisements. Now they are back! However, watching the advertisement does not give the extra 30 seconds it should. You get the same length of time whether you watch the advert or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this be fixed? Do I need to update the game? I do have some extra packs added that I bought so I do not want to delete the game and reinstall unless it is guaranteed that the packs I bought will be available.</p>

            <p>Hi, Soorajr,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never borrow another's CD.&nbsp; It is called soft lifting and illegal.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The goal of Product Activation is to reduce a form of piracy known as "casual copying" or "softlifting." Casual copying is the sharing of software between people in a way that infringes on the software's end user license agreement (EULA). An example of casual
 copying is if someone were to obtain a copy of Office XP and load it on his or her PC, then share it with a second person who loaded it on his or her PC, then share it with a third person who loaded it on his or her PC, and so on. This form of piracy is prevalent
 and has been estimated by some industry trade groups to account for a staggering 50 percent of the economic losses due to piracy. Worldwide, the piracy rate is estimated to be 37 percent; in other words, one out of every three software products in the market
 is pirated.</p>

            I have a similar problem and even after following these steps it still does not work. Instead of displaying emojis it &nbsp;comes out as '':$'' or '':D''. I don't know what is wrong, I've never had this issue before.

            I noticed it today. At first I thought I had mistyped something but apparently other people are having the exact same issue. Also, it's pretty weird that only three emojis can be displayed, the rainbow, snowflake and the shocked one. At least that is how
 it is for me. Hopefully they fix it soon :c

<p><span><span>Reset the Xbox 360 clock by performing the steps below and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Press the Xbox Guide button on the controller to enter the Dashboard.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi Seth2441,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the antivirus program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check to see if the following helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Temporarily disable the computer`s anti-virus
 program and check if the issue persists. If no issue occurs, then you might need to firewall settings within the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Ensure to enable your anti-virus back on the computer
 after you finish these steps. It is not recommended to disable these settings on the computer. This is just to troubleshoot the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Try updating the network adapter drivers and
 check if it helps. Log on to the manufacturer website to do so.</span></p>

<p>to set the TV as an extended desktop &amp; switch the TV to show its VGA input.</p>
<p>I then went to Control panel, Display, Change display settings.&nbsp; I dragged the TV icon in that page to swing it round to where it was [physically] in relation to the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also saw that it offered different display settings for the TV but had to settle for the same as my PC screen uses [this seems logical but I was tempted by the fact that it offered the higher resolutions].</p>

    <title>Being able to see how many people are playing the game before purchase - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exeagle21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Being able to see how many people are playing the game before purchase &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I guess there is no feed back or suggestion section any more ?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I for one would love to see a feature, Being able to see how many people are playing a certain game online. My reason is i'm tied of wasting money, To find out no one plays a certain game online
<br />
<br />
For example i bought call of duty on the pc with in a matter of weeks its now dead and only
<span>875 are currently online at au time zone i can never get into a game.&nbsp;<br />
<span>875 are currently online at au time zone i can never get into a game.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So i thought well there has to be alot more people on the xbox one cause not many people can afford gaming pc's&nbsp;</span>ill just go buy it on the xbox one (the game plus season pass latter ) i &nbsp;load it up i try to find a game and there is no one always (no games
 found) &nbsp;constantly&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
Now what i'm asking is the ability when you click on the game in the store on the right side have ( players online xxxx) if its a&nbsp;multiplayer&nbsp;game&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are&nbsp;negatives&nbsp;to this as microsoft would&nbsp;lose sales on a&nbsp;certain&nbsp;game because&nbsp;people&nbsp;will&nbsp;be able to see if there are anyone playing it&nbsp; and if its only 100 people then they ant going to bother&nbsp;purchasing&nbsp;it&nbsp;<br />
</span>&nbsp;<br />
now im not saying have this on every single game they have on xbox one but the games people play competitive or most popular online games like (COD,BF)<br />
<br />
I remember back in the day call of duty modern warfare 1 2 and 3 as well as black ops you could see how many people where playing and what parts of the world they where
<br />
<br />
I remember waking up early morning and seeing over 600 hundred thousand players &nbsp;and never had an issue finding people to vs.... for some reason they took it out now i have no idea how many people are actually on
<br />
<br />
<br />
remember i am australian so most of you in the other parts of the world wouldn't have any trouble finding a game with 800 players im sure but for us here &nbsp;we need more to find one sadly lol&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
So my suggestion and im probably wasting my time i highly doubt the xbox people read theses forums.. I dont know if anyone else has wasted money on a game then finding out no one plays it (i usually by games for MP and play only certain sp games ) so people
 might not give a flying f if they got it for single player to.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
but it would be nice to know for the most played games like COD or bf4 and any other future online game ( game called warframe) &nbsp;i just want to know how many people are currently play the game befor i even buy it&nbsp;<br />
<br />
(im pretty sure steam does it shows how many players are actually playing the game)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
so befor i go and wast another 190$ please add this............</p>

<p>Yep ghosts is pretty much dead, about 3000 playing globally on the xbox one, but advanced warfare is doing pretty well, but for you to say you cannot find a game full stop is a bit weird as I can still find a game on call of duty 2 on the 360.</p>

<p>BF has a list of the amount of people online on BF4stats.com</p>
<p>I am sure there is one for COD as well..</p>
<p>You are in the AU.. you will have a limited number of people in your servers...</p>
<p>I do know what you mean about being able to see... but think of it like this...a game releases... people play it.. a new game releases... people leave the previous game and play the new one... &nbsp;if you want to find a populated server for an older game.. it
 better be a good game with replay-ability </p>

 then do a reinstall, can anyone help please</p>
<p>I already deleted the associated account and then did a new install but it still will not open the calendar. It works fine on my laptop but I need to have it on my phone working</p>

            Hi Brenda, 
<br />
<br />While I don't have a fix, I do want to tell you aren't the only one having these issues. I've seen it reported by many over the past week. I'm thinking an update may have caused this. I know MS is working diligently to get it resolved. 
<br />
<br />I'll try to find anymore info I can on this, but I wanted to pass along the info I did have.

<p>I've had the same problem on my faithful Lumia 930 (running Windows 10) since it updated a few days ago. This is really frustrating as I rely in particular on Outlook Mail on my phone when I'm out and about (as I am a lot) to track progress with job applications
 and other stuff that's pretty important to me right now.</p>
<p>I just wasted my time doing a hard reset and restoring everything, only to find Mail and Calendar still unable to open.
</p>
<p>Reading others' comments here confirms my fears. It looks like Microsoft really dropped the ball on this one. Being a Windows phone user is thankless enough these days (the platform's undeservedly a dead man walking and there's zero appreciation by MS of
 customer loyalty) without major screw ups like this.</p>
<p>It needs fixing and quickly.</p>

<p>Hi Brenda, I am having the same problem. Outlook Mail and Calendar updated yesterday to build 16006.11001.20083.0 for my WP10 (nokia Lumia 930 - a basically bullet proof phone) and now neither app opens. Don't waste your time with hard resets or uninstalling/reinstalling
 etc - it doesn't work. Unfortunately we have to sit and wait for MS to unwind their latest efforts, or we can dump our phones in the trash and buy something that works. There are so few of us left....are they trying to finish us off??</p>

<li>This is clearly a MS update problem that needs resolving quickly Like everyone else I tried several times to get it up and running, just wasted my time. I rely heavily on having the calendar working so it's very frustrating having to wait until they resolve
 the problems we all have with a new and working update</li></ol>

            I’m looking up and down, still no dice! 
<br />
<br />Potential work around, what email provider do you use? It’s not ideal, but you could use a web browser to go to your providers email Ex. hotmail.com, Gmail.com, yahoo.com etc. and log into your email. You’ll be able to use that and check it periodically until this outlook issue gets sorted out.

<h2>            Trouble upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try I receive a C1900200 error code. &nbsp;Sometimes this happens during download, other times at the copying files stage of the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 8GB Ram, 2TB hard disc space with 29.4GB available on the C drive and 1.64 TB on the D drive. &nbsp;The processor is AMD A10-5800K running at 3.8ghz. &nbsp;There is a 350MB system reserved partition with 253MB free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled all virus and malware checkers and disconnected all devices apart from mouse and keyboard. &nbsp;I have performed a clean boot and tried upgrading by a Windows download and through using the media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a problem with windows updates apart from Windows 10 in that I get a message saying that Windows is unable to automatically check for updates, even though that is the setting. &nbsp;Applying a Microsoft fix appears to cure this but the problem re-occurs.
 &nbsp;There is no problem in manually downloading updates.</p>

<br />Check your antivirus software

<br />In your antivirus app, look for settings related to blocking access or permission to use your webcam. For help, visit your antivirus software company’s website.
<br />Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results.
<br />    Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers.
<br />    Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If it’s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />    If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.

<br />Roll back your webcam driver
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers don’t provide a rollback option.)
<br />    After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If rolling back didn’t work or isn’t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt; Delete the driver software for this device, and then select OK.
<br />    In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Scan for hardware changes. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.

    <title>File can&#39;t be deleted&#47;renamed because &#39;it&#39;s no longer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File can&#39;t be deleted&#47;renamed because &#39;it&#39;s no longer on the desktop&#47;windows can&#39;t find it&#39;</h2>
                    So, I was installing a game today, (yandere simulator) and i usually just click wizard since i use winrar, and it automatically makes shortcuts on my desktop, so it's easier for me to access, anyways, i was installing it, the folder with the game and assets
 was on my desktop, i already had a &nbsp;folder from the game because i installed the new version. When i moved something from the old one, i put it into the new one, moved the old one to the recycle bin and deleted it, well, at least i thought it was the old one,
 when i opened the new folder, i checked the assets, and the photos i put in it weren't there, i just brushed it off because i deleted the new folder, spent some time making the new photos again, and then i re-installed the new version. When i used right click
 to delete the old folder, it says that it's no longer on the desktop, even if i can move it. I tried renaming it, i can't, it remained stuck in a loop of trying to click the x button to exit it. I restarted my computer, the file was still there, it had the
 game and the assets in it, i deleted those easily, but the empty folder is still there, i tried using the unlocker for files, but it's not locked, just sitting there annoying me, it doesn't take up any space,only stays empty on my desktop, i don't want to
 reboot it because i'm kinda scared if everything will be deleted or something, i have never had this problem before with these folders, i use windows 10.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0befb6b6-5174-49d5-813f-73d5029377c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0befb6b6-5174-49d5-813f-73d5029377c1" /></a>&nbsp;When
 i try deleting it, it says: "Could not find this item, This is no longer located in C:\users\(my pc user name)\Desktop. Verify the item's location and try again." pressing try again does nothing, displaying the same message again and again. Any answers? It
 bugs me very much.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot and selecting Last Known Good Configuration.<br />
<br />
19 is&nbsp;likely a driver or possibly bad memory, Antivirus/antispware/security&nbsp;programs can also cause these issues.
<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see if a driver was
<br />
updated prior to this occurring.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory is not as likely as drivers, have you added memory? Memory tests will not catch mismatched and<br />
some other memory issues - some of which is having slow memory in front of faster memory or the memory<br />
types do not match.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; Memory - find Memory Diagnostics tool at top of list - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<p>
</p><p>Is the problem that you aren't being prompted to reinsert the sheet to print the reverse side?
</p>
<p>Also: Have you downloaded and installed the latest drivers for Windows 10 (available at the link above)?</p>

            <p>It depends on which print icon comes up - on some things the old format comes up to select print and on this one I can print on both sides by setting the properties to that request.&nbsp; But when the Windows 10 icon comes up it does not allow you to make that
 selection.</p>

            <p>Duplex printing can be achieved on most printers even when not listed as an option. There are a couple of things to be aware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does the printer print on the top face of the paper or the lower? Most that feed from the back will print on the top, those that feed from the front and eject to the front will print on the lower face as held in the paper tray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Does the printer print the last page 1st (collated mode)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using that information and printing odd pages separately from even pages it is normally possible to achieve double sided printing.</p>

            No but you can do it manually - worked on former system, but Windows 10 has its own print screen, which does not include a selection for printing on both sides.

<h2>            Windows store badly broken. Frustrating&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Windows store is badly broken on my PC. It will only update currently installed apps and it does this automatically as it should, but I can't download ANY new apps at all. I've tried all of the fixes that have been posted within the community to include
 resetting the store using wsreset.exe, clearing the stores cashe, and even tried creating a new user account and it still will not download anything. I am running the anniversary update for windows 10. Do i need to forget windows 10 and reinstall my old copy
 of windows 7 to keep from having all these problems with 10? inserting error screen when trying to download from store. Anyone have a fix for this as I am really frustrated with this crap? FYI I have been getting this screen for about a week now.

            <p>Wow, I'm sorry you're going through this too, but I'm so happy I'm not the only one. I have the exact same issue and I've gone through all of the same steps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently this has something to do with the background intelligent transfer service cache going bad. If you run the troubleshooter for the windows store, it'll ask if you want to run wsreset, but if you skip that, it'll show the details of the problem.
 If you click on the details, you'll see that the BITS service cache is corrupt. I made a post similar to yours with steps I've gone through to fix the issue (without success).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that managed to work for me was if I made another account on the same machine. That account could download new apps without issue, so I know it's not the installation. I cleared my old account and then reinstalled it, after which things went
 downhill once again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that whatever is being done that makes it not possible to download new apps, is being copied to our accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support I got was way less helpful in that I was told just to create a new account and lose the one I've been using for years with all of my movies, games, and apps I've purchased. Since that was plain ridiculous, I said there was no way I was going
 to do that. It's been silence ever since. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me that this is a huge flaw in this account based system. If something goes corrupt with your account, the only solution is to start over (forget about the fact you've spent money with the last account). I'm keeping records of this issue in particular
 since I think this is a major flaw. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my original post and the response I got: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store/unable-to-download-new-windows-store-apps/994234ee-1a82-4ffb-9299-f046b2461871?auth=1">

</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found this thread with a ton of other people having the same exact issue. A couple seem to have fixed it, but the majority seem to still be without a fix:

            I also ran the troubleshooter by typing "troubleshooting" in the search bar and clicking on view all then run the windows store troubleshooter skipped the reset procedure and it said that windows store cashe is corrupt. It advised to reset and try again,
 but I have done the that several times to no avail. this crap makes me want to get away from windows all together. Since the upgrade to windows 10 there has been one problem after another with either the store, the taskbar, or the start screen. As of this
 post windows store is still broken.<br />

            <p>Sorry about that wall o' text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I originally submitted it, there was nice formatting and whatnot. I was using Microsoft's Edge browser, which apparently doesn't save the formatting on posts like these. I switched to Chrome and re-edited the post to show the information I was trying
 to get to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note where I managed to narrow down the issue to the BITS corrupt cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also managed to show that no matter what you do, your account somehow manages to copy this corruption back. So according to the response I got back from the support technician, I needed to remove my account and make a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also linked my original thread and another, much longer one with quite a few other people who have been having this issue as well. I'm just happy to see its not just me that has a "broken account".</p>

            I believe that you are right, it seems as if Microsoft has allowed their customer accounts to become corrupted. I also tried to download new apps from my laptop as I sign in to it and my desktop with my Microsoft account and I get the same exact error
 screen. I wonder if anyone is having this problem if they use their machines by signing in with a local account instead of a Microshit account. Just wondering cause Microsoft doesn't seem to know how to fix their own products.

<p>Seems like every thread is only getting one answer (unique per thread even with the same problems) from support, and then it's left to be buried under other threads. So either this will get fixed, or it'll just be a new feature for Windows 10 and the app
 store.</p>

 actually reverted me back to the previous version and build number. I was running the anniversary update which allowed extensions in edge browser. There must be problems with that version of windows. Anyway after getting everything setup once again I can now
 download new apps from the store, so it seems as if the problem is fixed. I know reinstalling is a pain in the a**, I believe that is/or the only fix for me. The version and build I am on now is Version:1511 Build number:10586.545. The anniversary update that
 was causing all the problems was Version:1607 Build number14393.82. You can check your version and build number by right clicking start button and selecting run then type winver in the box and hit enter. Hope this help you.</p>

<h2>            AGP cards with WDDM driver</h2>
                    Does anyone have a <b>concise </b>list of what AGP DVI cards have WDDM drivers for Windows 7?<br />
So far I have found these ATI cards by searching amd.com for <b>AGP WDDM 1.x</b><br />
<br />
Radeon 9500+ and X* series: WDDM 1.0 and DX9, <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Legacy/Pages/radeonaiw_vista32.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Catalyst 10.2</a><br />
Radeon HD series: WDDM 1.1 and DX10+, <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/9-4/Pages/radeonaiw_vista32.aspx?&amp;lang=English" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Catalyst 9.4</a><br />
<br />
Is that correct? Can anyone list nVidia WDDM cards?<br />
<br />
Wikipedia describes the various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDDM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WDDM </a>versions, but I don't understand most of it. I am looking for good WMP12 video, which is worse than WMP11 under XP was with Radeon 7000 and Matrox G450 cards.<br />
<br />
PS: don't reply Windows 7 Compatibility Center, it only says <b>compatible</b> for everything.<br />
Should also mention it has be available on eBay or dumpsters, not over $50, etc.<br />
PPS: I was just looking Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_ATI_Graphics_Processing_Units" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AMD Graphics Chips</a>, and realized I should be using those Rx00 series above.<br />

<p><span>There is not a specific list. I would suggest you to use your favorite search engine to search for cards with WDDM.</span></p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>nVidia has WDDM graphics drivers (at least Vista version) for all cards from Geforce FX 5000 series and later. AGP nVidia cards with at least Vista drivers, are only the series FX 5000, 6000 and 7000. Anything from Geforce 8200 (or 8100) and newer is PCI-E.
 However, there might be some exceptions in the 8000 series, but these are rare and hard to find. Your best bet for performance are the medium to high end models of 6000 series (6700, 6800, 6900) or 7000 (7600, 7800, 7900). But I would rather upgrade to a newer
 hardware than pay a lot for old models. I suggest doing a market search first. How much is going to cost you for the minumum upgrade (motherboard, CPU, RAM, VGA) vs how much you find a used high end AGP card. If the used card costs more than 50% of the upgrade,
 don't even think about it! Do the upgrade! You won't regret it. The performance boost will be higher with even the lower new VGA models.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Important: Windows Vista drivers will work on same version Windows 7 (eg 32-bit or 64-bit) but it is not certain that they will work in Windows 8 and 8.1! Windows 7 drivers should work in same version 7, 8 and 8.1 If you see some difficulty, try running
 the setup in Vista or 7 compatibility mode. You can even try installing manually through the Device Manager as a worst case scenario. If running in compatibility mode, also enable the "run as Administrator" to make sure the setup completes without any issue.
 I would even disable antivirus (Windows Defender if no other installed) to make sure the setup won't be interrupted and fail.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To play safe, avoid Windows 8 and 8.1 on old systems, install 7. Also don't forget to install latest DirectX 9.0c runtime as mosts games look for specific files not present in DirectX 10 or 11 and they won't run unless you install it! In Windows 8 and 8.1
 when installing DirectX 9.0c it asks for adding dotNET 2 &amp; 3 support. Reply, yes, so the installation will be successful.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>
