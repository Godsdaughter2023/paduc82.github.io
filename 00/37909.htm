<h3> dharmiksikligar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Wifi Error</h2>
                    <p>Dear,Team</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is in reference to update for Windows 10, I would like to bring into your notice after updating to windows 10 there can be found an error in regards to the wireless adapter in the laptop, i am using Lenevo laptop. i have been trying to sort this out
 since 2016/17 as earlier i had updated to Windows 10 but due to similar issue and many unsuccessful attempts i had to retore to my previous version of windows however i assumed that after this many years there might be some kind of solution available but it
 was wrong to assume that and by that coming days i might turn my self into developer without any technical knowledge as this issue had driven me to all that is available on internet except the solution for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi Dharmic.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an xbox one that has recently stopped allowing my son to chat with his friends. The microphone symbol is showing with a line through it at all times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some research into this as well as tried live chat and cal back, but seem o be getting nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have bought a microsoft recommended headset, we have two wireless xbox controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried what I believe to be absolutely everything up to a reset of the console, but keeping games and apps, but still to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could help I know my son would be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Problem now resolved, for some reason both controllers stopped working at the same time. Microsoft support cannot explain why, but having tested another controller that works they agreed to replace both *(even though one was outside the warranty period).</p>
<p>

            Hi Abhishek, it is normal to have an EFI Partition on a Windows 10 system, what is not normal is being able to see it . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />This is a known bug in Windows 10, leave it alone and it will disappear as mysteriously as it has appeared after a few days - it is nothing to worry about!       
        </p>

            It is an important partition that exists for recovery purposes. So, if you need to reinstall Windows, access recovery tools such as System Restore, Startup repair, Command Prompt and perform a Reset or Refresh.

            This is normal-What problems are you having with this?
<br />I would try to explain the purpose with the following:
<br />Suppose your C:/ gets corrupted and there is no recovery partition.
<br />EFI partition allows you to boot to advanced Startup options where you can:
<br />Initiate a startup repair.
<br />Do a System restore
<br />Etc..

<h2>            Error when attempting to map network drive shared drive on XP Desktop  from VISTA laptop&#58; &#34;Not enough server storage is available to process this command&#34;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have been able to connect ok to a shared folder on my VISTA laptop from my XP desktop,<br />
but when I try it the other way around (to connect to a shared drive on my XP desktop FROM my VISTA laptop), I get the following error message:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mapped network drive could not be created because the following error has occurred: Not enough server storage is available to process this command."<br />
<br />
Desktop is HP Pavilion a1410n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows XP SP3&nbsp; Home Professional 3 gB RAM<br />
Laptop&nbsp; is HP dv5z<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Vista Home Premium&nbsp; SP2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 GB RAM<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any suggestions.<br />
Thanks so much.<br />

<br />
Thanks so much for the link to that article.<br />
It was most helpful.<br />
<br />
I also found this forum post helpful:<br />
<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/networking-forum/networking-support/114373-cant-map-new-network-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techsupportforum.com/networking-forum/networking-support/114373-cant-map-new-network-drive.html</a>
<br />
<br />
In particular, it said to check the event log for the computer you are trying to connect to (the remote computer) to look for an event ID 2011 which would have been entered at the time you last tried to connect and failed.<br />
I did this by alt-clicking on MY COMPUTER icon (of the remote computer) and choosing MANAGE, then clicking on EVENT VIEWER folder (in left pane) , then SYSTEM folder under that.<br />
On the right pane, I found a listing for event ID 2011 at the time I had last tried to connect.<br />
<br />
To test this, I went to the VISTA laptop and tried to connect to the XP desktop again, giving another error message on the VISTA laptop.<br />
When I went back to the XP desktop that I was trying to connect to and looked at the event log again, sure enough ANOTHER event ID 2011 was listed with the new time of my added attempt to connect.<br />
<br />
This confirmed that it was likely that the IRPStackSize was the problem, as your article suggested.<br />
<br />
I then printed out the article HOW TO BACKUP AND RESTORE REGISTRY at:&nbsp; <span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</a>
<br />
then backed up the registry (both by running a system restore/save and by exporting from the top level of regedit).<br />
<br />
I then went into regedit on the XP Desktop&nbsp; to the<br />
</span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\SERVICES\LANMANSERVER\Parameters
<span>folder described in your article.<br />
There was NOT an entry for IRPStackSize in the right pane, so I followed the instructions to add one, and set it to decimal 15.<br />
I rebooted and tried to connect but still got the same error.<br />
The article had said that the default value was 15, so I assumed that adding the IRPStackSize entry for 15 did not change anything.<br />
<br />
So I went back into regedit and changed the value of IRPStackSize from 15 to 18, rebooted and it solved the problem.<br />
<br />
I found the following articles also useful in solving this problem (aside from the one you gave):<br />

<br />
<br />
I typed this all up so that it might help others who may encounter this same <br />
<strong>"Not enough server storage is available to process this command"</strong> error when trying to
<br />
map a network drive (or just trying to connect)&nbsp; to an XP computer from another computer.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for the lead.

<h2>            Need to have larger text under desktop icons for Windows 10...</h2>
                    Hello all. I do not know what I clicked on but all of a sudden my desktop icons became really large. I found a way to get the icons to their normal size but the file names under the icons are too small. I tried the "Windows button + X button" and went
 to control panel, then appearance, but that did not work. The text in the windows are also smaller than I can read. I need help with increasing the size of the file names under my desktop icons and in the "windows".<br />

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really dont know what to do anymore.</p>
<p>Windows 10 just freezes or crashes. I dont get blue screen of death, just either a frozen screen or screen just turns off without any error message</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restart I obviously get that error that windows 10 didnt load correctly</p>
<p>if I try Start up repair option doesnt work</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I have tried so far:</p>
<p>- malware bytes and antivirus found nothing, tried scanning quickset as well and nothing was found</p>
<p>- system scan from cmd: sc/scannow</p>
<p>- disk command repair corrupted files</p>
<p>- even tried setting up windows updates to manual</p>
<p>- checked and updated all drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesnt matter how many apps or browsers I have opened, there is no rule, its freezing or turning off completely random</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked WMI- every 2 seconds there is an error message and then an information message, all the same</p>
<p>ERROR:</p>
<p>Id = {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}; ClientMachine = DESKTOP-5RAIHPV; User = DESKTOP-5RAIHPV\ramon; ClientProcessId = 10724; Component = Unknown; Operation = Start IWbemServices::ExecNotificationQuery - root\wmi : select * from biosevent; ResultCode

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Not surprised your prime suspect is some of the Dell Bloatware, quickset.exe which is part of the Dell power plan options that interfere with the better version built into Windows 10 - just like most all bloatware does which is why no enthusiasts will run a factory install in the first place.  
<br />
<br />If you want to go from the worst install in the world to the best then follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />Otherwise go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But you'll actually save time and end up with a much better install if you do the Clean install.  Just read over the steps and ask back any questions so you are prepared.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I guess I have to do what I was a bit afraid I might have to do.</p>
<p>My challenge is that I have a special software installed by a 3rd party and every time I ask for assistance to re-install it I have to pay.</p>
<p>Is there no other way this can be fixed except for re-installing windows?</p>

<br />Troubleshooting issues like these requires absolute attention to detail, not reading the first steps and just ignoring all the others.  Otherwise I'd take it to a shop.  I was trying to save you a minimum $150 in repqirs.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did read :(</p>
<p>Am I stupid in thinking that if I take the 'Fresh Start' route, personal files would be kept but not the applications or special software I installed? This is not a software I can replace or have a key for which I could back up. Every installation is done
 directly by the company who created it</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your support. I have used&nbsp;<span>Media Creation Tool option trying to leave the proper clean installation as the ultimate solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So far so good, though WMI errors and system errors related to quickset.exe are still there, but the laptop has been running good today. At this point I believe that if Media Creation Tool&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;doesnt fix the issue
 then of re-booting suddenly and laptop freezing it might a problem with how Dell keeps the apps drivers updated so I'll just buy a new laptop from another manufacturer and follow the clean windows install before I do anything so thank you very much for sharing
 the tip regarding the importance of a clean Windows install as now I know it should be a rule of thumb on any new laptop or computer. I would not proceed with the clean install on this particular Dell laptop because if Dell doesnt have the drivers up to date
 I might still get errors and issues. Whilst looking for a solution with Dell as well I've noticed&nbsp;<span>Quickset.exe latest drivers are September 2016 which I think its very poor from Dell's side.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Uninstalling quickset caused worse errors surfacing up and even when I tried to modify and repair the app from the settings I got errors as the path defined as .msi source wasn't existing</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You've been very helpful, thank you&nbsp;</p>

Otherwise go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most
 thoroughly. <br />
<br />
Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page. Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3,
 Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />
If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> <br />
<br />
But you'll actually save time and end up with a much better install if you do the Clean install. Just read over the steps and ask back any questions so you are prepared.
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Gauntlet Seven Sorrows download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasdlp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gauntlet Seven Sorrows download</h2>
                    
<p>Like many posts I bought and downloaded Gauntlet Seven Sorrows for the XBox 360 S and found it didn't work. &nbsp; To date there is no fix that has worked to get the game to operate.</p>
<p>All prior posts attempted fixes and some new information form Support have been tried on my end. &nbsp;So, if you try to download this game you may run into a problem where it downloads and once you go to play it, you get the message that it won't play and to
 try and download it again.</p>
<p>The usual fixes attempted are to delete the game, clear the cache 4 times, check and remove corrupted files, remove your account and then shutdown and unplug the system for 2 minutes. &nbsp;After that is done start the system, add your account, go to download
 history and download it again. &nbsp;Once completely downloaded you should having a working game. &nbsp;In my case,,,no! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually I have done a lot of online searching and it seems to be a big problem with this game. &nbsp;Unfortunately Microsoft can't refund your money if it has been more that thirty (30) days since purchase so you are at the mercy of waiting to see if the developer
 knows anything. &nbsp;That likely will not occur anytime soon.</p>
<p>Last, make sure you have a hard drive in your XBox 360 if it didn't come with one. The S doesn't. &nbsp;And the game won't work at all if you don't have one.</p>
<p>So be careful and let me know if anyone found a real fix for this game.</p>

<p>You need an offical Microsoft hard drive for XBox original games that are supported on the XBox 360 to work. There is special firmware on the hard drive to support XBox original games.
</p>
<p>It sounds like you followed the steps on this page:</p>

<p>Do you have an official Microsoft XBox 360 hard drive?</p>

<p>Good question. &nbsp;I'd have to check on the HD. &nbsp;My kids are the one's who bought it and put it in. &nbsp;Are there MS markings on it if it is official?</p>

<p>If you look on Amazon you will see very cheap hard drives and if you look at the pictures you will notice on the bottom of the drive it says made in china. Here is an example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/320GB-HDD-Compatible-Xbox-Slim/dp/B008FHL56S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458916322&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=xbox+360+hard+drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.amazon.com/.../ref=sr_1_1</a></p>
<p>The official Microsoft hard drives are much more expensive and should have come packaged with the official MS logo. &nbsp;The drive I linked above is a cheap knockoff hard drive that does not have the correct firmware loaded to support Xbox original games.</p>

<p>Checked the HD. It is not MS but said it was compatible. &nbsp;Went back to their original Amazon order and it confirmed that it was MS compatible and all the reviews said it worked.</p>
<p>With all that said I suppose that because it is not an "MS" HD then that could be the problem. &nbsp;It may be then that there is truly no fix unless we get the MS HD. &nbsp;In this case I'll let the kids forfeit palying the game a chalk it up to a good $10.79 learning
 experience. &nbsp;Sad MS won't allow some kind of download of the firmware to make it work. &nbsp;:-(</p>

<p>It is unfortunate I agree. &nbsp;I think the official drives are cheaper now at least. I know it is a lot of money to spend to play one XBox original game, but in the long run it will be a good investment since the official drives from MS will probably last longer
 than the cheaper 3rd party drives. </p>

    <title>Delete or rename main user in c drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aloriwhite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete or rename main user in c drive</h2>
                    <p>I'm trans and I've changed my first name, as such I'm trying to remove any reference to my previous name still out there. &nbsp;When I got a new laptop and signed into my Microsoft account it automatically generated a user folder in c drive with my previous name
 on it because they still had my old email. &nbsp;I now want to change the name of that folder in c drive to be my new name, problem is, when I go to properties the name is Greyed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think, why not just create another user profile after I've changed the associated email? So I did and now I have two folders under user in c drive (along with public and default) one called aidan and one called alori.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough I *can* edit the one called Alori, I can change its name to whatever I want, just can't rename the one called aidan. &nbsp;Worse yet, when I try to delete the folder called aidan under C/users it says Lori is still using that, please close
 the program and try again (Lori is the account I'm logged into, but not the c drive user, I know, complicated)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting the user profile that created the folder in the first place, but no such luck, the folder called aidan is still there, and still unable to be renamed/deleted</p>

<p>Hi Alori,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user profile is a collection of settings that make the computer look and work the way you want it to for a user account. It is stored in the user's C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt; profile folder, and contains the account's settings for desktop backgrounds, screen
 savers, pointer preferences, sound settings, and other features. User profiles ensure that your personal preferences are used whenever you sign in to Windows. However, if you want to delete the user profile, we recommend to follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>You must be signed in as an administrator to be able to delete a user profile. You'll need to make sure that the user account you want to delete the profile of is signed out before continuing.<br />
</li><li>Press the Win+R keys to open Run, type SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe, and click/tap on OK to open Advanced System Properties.</li><li>Click/tap on the Settings button under User Profiles.</li><li>Select the profile of the user account, and click/tap on Delete.</li><li>Click/tap on Yes to confirm.</li><li>The profile of the user account (ex: "Example") will now be deleted. A new profile for the user's account will automatically be created the next time that user signs in.</li><li>You can now close the User Profiles and System Properties windows if you like.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Feel free to update us with the results.</span></span><span>

<p>^^ I'm the opposite. I don't like mobile gaming because when I'm not home I'm busy doing other things. I actually bought every Angry Birds game for my laptop. I like Peggle 2 on the ONE as well.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 sfc &#47;scannow cannot repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wreckwriter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 sfc &#47;scannow cannot repair</h2>
                    <p>So, after trying for weeks I finally got Windows 10 installed, updated my Nvidia video driver and promptly broke my Windows install. Been working on it for a few days, figured out the issue but cannot fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is corrupt opencl.dll. I've rolled back the video driver, no help. Tried DISM but can't fix it because I can't get a source of my Windows 10 version (1511 Build 10586.36). Tried creating ISO and mounting but DISM fails with can't find source so assume
 ISO is not correct version. There's ton of info out there but can't find a fix that works for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point BSODs are frequent, speakers now no longer recognized, all sorts of issues. You guys are my last hope before I restore back to 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot remove 1511 update because without it I couldn't activate with my Windows 7 key. had to clean install to get it going at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>I also have sfc/scannow reporting an issue with opencl, with no problems on my PC.&nbsp; There's whole thread on tenforums about the sfc/scannow opencl problem: http://www.tenforums.com/performance-maintenance/31695-sfc-corrupt-issue-regarding-opencl-dll.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quoting from the last post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Well you have the exact same card as I am running on Windows 10. The problem with Opencl.dll is only a Microsoft problem, and when you run SFC /scannow it reports it. If this is the only problem sfc finds, then do not worry about it. Your system will run
 just fine. Now, their IS some good news about this issue. Some of our members who are in the Insider program, and are running newer versions of future windows updates, (beta) have reported that the issue with Opencl IS FIXED. This means that finally Microsoft
 has addressed this issue and fixed it. Also thou means that unless you are in the Insider program and testing future windows releases. You and I are going to have to wait a while longer until MS gives us this fix in a future update. But, just knowing that
 Microsoft has finally fixed this issue is good news for me, even if I have to wait a while longer for it to appear in an update. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't seem like this opencl issue is the root cause of all your bsod problems.&nbsp; I suggest you try looking at the threads in the tenforums regarding bsod's to see how to identify the issue: http://www.tenforums.com/bsod-crashes-debugging/</p>

                    <p>Original title: why wont music file open after transfer to mp3 player.</p>
<p>Om my previous (desktop) pc I had no problems transferring files from cd's to media player to Samsung beat player. Now on a new laptop the files are ripped from cd's to media player to beat player, but when I try to play them on the beat player I get the
 message "Cannot open file". I have synced the beat player to the new pc and the previous files still open ok, I have followed the same procedure (on desktop pc) as I did previously but files still will not open. I would be grateful for a solution if anyone
 can help?</p>

                    <span>Hi, is there a solution to set a 48 inch smart TV as monitor? When I had an older PC system, the smart TV showed me the option to connect as VGA\PC, and I could use the option to adjust screen and worked fine. I bought recently a new PC
 system connected to the smart TV through a HDMI cable. But this choice doesn't show me in the menu to adjust the screen. All I can do is to set the dimensions manually, by percentage, to 85% both width and height. With all this settings I still don't have
 the full screen shown. My question is as I told you in the beginning: is there any solution to use a HDMI cable and also take advantage of the full screen for large monitors\smart TV's? Thank you for your answer.</span>

                    Once I upgraded to Windows 10 I attempted to registered a program online that I loaded on my computer and keep getting a "socket #10060 error Connection Timed Out". How do I take steps to reduce the number of timeouts so as to allow more time for the registration
 connection to complete? It is with the understanding that my system is using Windows 10 as an operating system.

<h3> fireflycaptmal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Headset Adapter - Low, Tinny Sound</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Astro Mixamp and Audio Technica AD700 headphones. When using the headset adapter game sound quality is poor. Its sounds low, muffled, tinny. Without the adapter, as well as when I use my modded headset adapter, games sound fine.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if my headset adapter is faulty or if I don't have it set up properly. I thought it would be as easy as plug it in and it works, just like my modded adapter. If this is what the sound is like with the adapter I am very disappointed.
</p>
<p>Appreciate and help and/or feedback.</p>

<p>You may need to adjust the volume on the adapter. When you turn on the controller the adapter is putting out both in game sound as well as chat. You may need to max out the chat volume as you are likely using another source for game volume. I'm no expert
 of course but I found if I didn't do that everytime I started playing I got an echo.</p>

<p>I already maxed out volume by pressing the person icon until I heard the beep. Did the same with the controller icon. Pressing +/- buttons, I didn't notice a change in volume.</p>

<h3> andrew king_21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 bootable DVD from existing .WIM image</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked all over but haven't been able to really find an answer on how to do this. I'm new saving and deploying images using WinPE as I used to use MDT at my old job. So far I have created the WinPE DVD and saved the Win 10 image that I created on
 a stand alone system. I'm now trying to figure out how to take that .wim image file it saved and turn it into a bootable ISO DVD that I can use to image other systems of the same model. All of the systems are stand alone and separate from each other. I did
 not SysPrep the image before&nbsp;saving it since all of the systems are the same make and model. In the near future I will be creating an image to use on multiple model stand alone systems. I figured I would work on this issue first before adding another headache.&nbsp;Also
 using a USB external drive is not possible due to them not being allowed on the systems. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>
