<h2>            Wifi only works at the login screen, not after login in</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the most peculiar problem with my windows 10 upgrade on my Asus GV60VX-JX136V laptop. When I boot up and get to the login screen the WIFI is turned off. If I turn it on I find my network with ease and&nbsp;connect automatically (as a bonus I can connect
 to the laptop from another machine in the homegroup). </p>
<p>When I log into windows after doing that, WIFI is turned of again and will not allow me to activate it. I did the troubleshooting and all I get is the unmistakable fact that my network card is turned off..using the&nbsp;WIFI on/off switch on my laptop does nothing
 either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device manager says my network card is functioning as it should with no issues. I even tried upgrading the driver using the drivers from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Funny thing is the other network adapter works fine while plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
I have a hard time believing it is a driver problem since it works from the login screen. Can anyone help??
                </div>

    <title>Mouse freezes constantly while running 3D applications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h0urg1ass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse freezes constantly while running 3D applications</h2>
                    I've been having this issue now for about three weeks and I have tried just about every fix that I can find on the internet.<br />
<br />
Here's a breakdown of the issue:&nbsp; I can use Windows 7 64, Ultimate perfectly fine with no issues for days on end until I launch a video game.&nbsp; When I launch a game, EVE Online for example, I will have anywhere from ten seconds to three hours of play time before
 my mouse will randomly seize up.&nbsp; This only effects the mouse!&nbsp; As long as I don't move my mouse at all after this issue surfaces, I have complete and total normal control of my computer.&nbsp; I can move my characters around with the keyboard, I can launch and
 close other applications, I can write a small novel, but if I touch the mouse, then my system locks up for 5-20 seconds.<br />
<br />
System specs:<br />
<br />
CoolerMaster HAF 932 Case<br />
ASUS Rampage III Formula (BIOS and Chipset are current)<br />
Core i7-950 CPU w/ Coolermaster Hyper 212+ Air Cooler<br />
6GB Corsair Dominator RAM<br />
MSI Hawk GTX 460 x2 in SLI<br />
Corsair 1200W Modular PSU<br />
120GB OCZ Vertex 2 SSD<br />
1TB WD Caviar Black 6GB/s HDD x2 in RAID 0<br />
Lightscribe DVD R/W x2<br />
Logitech G15 Keyboard (usb w/ cord)<br />
Cyborg R.A.T. 7 Mouse (usb w/ cord)<br />
Logitech USB Microphone<br />
<br />
<br />
What I have done to attempt to solve this issue:<br />
<br />
- Performed a secure erase of the SSD and reinstalled Windows 7 and all software (issue resurfaced immediately)<br />
<br />
- Updated every single video driver, and other driver in the entire computer<br />
<br />
- Updated BIOS<br />
<br />
- Pulled video cards out and tried them one at a time to see if they were faulty (both work fine)<br />
<br />
- Set power options to full power<br />
<br />
- Disabled USB sleep function in power options<br />
<br />
- Bought a new mouse<br />
<br />
- Plugged mouse into several different USB ports<br />
<br />
- Ran Memtest86 on RAM with no errors<br />
<br />
- Pulled out sticks of RAM one at a time to see if one was causing issues<br />
<br />
I am at a complete loss as to what to do next.&nbsp; This computer is completely brand new, I purchased every component, built it all in one night, it posted on the first try and ran perfectly now for about 2.5 months... and then the mouse started freezing.&nbsp; I didn't
 make any changes, I allow windows updates to perform automatically.&nbsp; I run AVG Antivirus on a regular schedule.&nbsp; I run Spybot S&amp;D and MalwareBytes on a regular schedule.&nbsp; I run Firefox with the NoScript addon to ensure that scripts don't introduce any malicious
 code.<br />
<br />
One last bit of information:&nbsp; About a week before this started happening I had some major issues with my Wireless Router.&nbsp; It is a WNDR3300 Netgear router and it was constantly dropping connections on me for a few days.&nbsp; I performed a 30/30/30 reset on it and
 flashed it with a third party DD-WRT firmware which solved my router problems.<br />
<br />
I don't know if these two problems have any connection, but they might considering that one issue surfaced very soon after the other issue was resolved.<br />
<br />
Any help I could get would be great, I'm losing my mind!

            So after two weeks and attempting literally hundreds of different things to fix this issue, including two fresh re installs of the OS, I find out that if I plug a ten year old optical PS2 mouse into my system, then the mouse induced system freezes and
 crashes all disappear.<br />
<br />
So where's the windows update that fixes this mouse issue?<br />
<br />
Especially since I did a little research and found literally hundreds of people reporting the same problem in dozens of different threads... this needs to be fixed!!

<p>I am having the same problem even when Im typing. Its very noticeable in games.I read the 250 page post about this and tried numerous things but none helped.</p>

<p>when i play CS 1.6 i don't notice it when using either the mouse or the keyboard by themselves but when I use the mouse to turn it stops mid turn and i keep walking almost like it stoped getting mouse inputs. my fps stays constant at 60 no drop at all. (
 not sure why its at 60fps on 1.6 I get 300fps in source.) But im getting noticeable input lag as im typing this.</p>

            Hi Aaron
<br />
<br />If you have your TV setup and connected to your laptop by HDMI or Display port connection, all you need to do is press Windows key + P and choose whether you want to extend or duplicate.

<br />1. Click on the Windows 10 Start button on your computer and then click on the Settings option in the little menu that appears
<br />2. On the Settings screen, click on the Devices tab.
<br />3. On the Devices screen, click on Connected Devices in the side-menu and then click on Add a device option (See image below)
<br />4. On the next screen, you will be able to select your Miracast Receiver from the list of connected devices (you will clearly see all devices connected to your computer).
<br />
<br />Your computer should now be projecting its screen to your HDTV without the clutter of cables lying around. You can now enjoy videos, movies or watch your family pictures on the large screen.
<br />

            I kinda knew it wouldn't answer my question because the question was only in the ballpark of my problem. I recently purchased a Dell windows 10 laptop to be used to project ppt slides through an adaptor I bought that adapts hdmi to vga. To no avail have
 I been able to do just that. My older windows 8 laptop was no problem because it had a vga port. This is an all wire connection. I questioned the bestbuy geek and he said that I need a driver to use windows 10 to convert hdmi to vga. I've searched hi and lo
 for a driver and don't even know what I need. Of course I threw the blister pack the adaptor came in away and are now on my knees asking for help. thank you for being there.

<h2>            Error Oxc00000e9 System Registry File is Missing or Corrupt</h2>
                    
<p>Hi My computer has&nbsp;suddenly stopped working and when booting states:</p>
<p>File\windows\system32\config\system</p>
<p>Status Oxc00000e9</p>
<p>System Registry File is Missing or Corrupt</p>
<p>I have used my Windows Vista CD and get the&nbsp;System Recovery Option Menu and have tried the Start Up Repair, but the OS system is not listed and when I try it without the OS system highlighted it says it cannot repair the system and sends a message to Microsoft.
 If I click on the system Restore option it states that I have to specifiy which installation I would like to restore but doesnt give me any options. Is there anything else I can try and do to get the system working or do I need to take it to a professional?
 How can I tell if someone is reputable?</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice</p>

            Hi Ganesh,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the reply. I have tried multiple things. I have been able to restart in safe mode. I backed up all my files.&nbsp;</div>
<div>After that I went to the Microsoft store, but all they can do is take in the laptop, which will take a few days. So I decided to actually buy the Windows 8.1 DVD and install everything again. That worked and I actually got into windows 8.1. But then at
 the first reboot, my laptop goes to the black screen again rightly after the Samsung logo disappears. System restore won't work since it is now a 8.1 machine.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I feel I am running out of options.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your help is really appreaciated!!!</div>

            I have got the same problem. The screen became dark after the message "Bonjour" (in french). Since I chose the default installation setting, I am wondering if there is not a problem with Skydrive trying to sync everything before the screen comes back ??
<div>It it is so, perhaps I have to wait 4 or 5 days before something happens on the screen again ?&nbsp;</div>

            Dear Xavier,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I found a way to get this over with... it took me a long time, but it appeared to be an issue with the graphics card driver. Still very disappointed that there are so many problems with people updating to 8.1. Not so good job Microsoft... it cost me two
 days and people in their own store couldnt help me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, pleas see this discussion:&nbsp;<a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-8-1-Installation-Fails-with-Blank-Black-Screen-392346.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-8-1-Installation-Fails-with-Blank-Black-Screen-392346.shtml</a></div>

<h2>            The application cannot find one of its required files</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I bought a students version Windows 7 but never actually been able to install it on my xp laptop. It's keep giving me an error. Here's the error:<br />
<br />
"The application cannot find one of its required files, possibly because it was unable to create it in the folder. Please make sure that the folder in which this application was downloaded is accessible and not ready-only."
<br />
<br />
I can't even download it again because its been more than 30 days and Microsoft won't let me download it again. I really hope someone can help me here. Thank you in advance.

            This is not Microsoft that is preventing you downloading it. If it is time limited, it is Digital River where you bought it. I would call them:Digital River Support&nbsp;1-877-244-8653. 6am-6pm EST Mon-Fri.<br />

</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

<h3> fg2001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 1809 pop up window behind main window, same problem opening a new application.</h2>
                    <p>This problem started after updating from latest 1803 build to the released 1809 build 17763.1.</p>
<p>It also happens with a fresh 1809 install so it is definitely a bug in 1809.&nbsp; Win10 1803 does not have this problem .
</p>
<p>I tried on 5 different desktops and laptops windows 10 64bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see many different cases where a new window opens up behind the main window instead of opening on top.</p>
<p>I see that a similar bug was reported with early release of 1709, but now it is back with release 1809.</p>
<p>Is there any fix available for this annoying bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to use the Task View to find if an application is actually started.</p>
<p>A basic example is the Windows Image Backup application, when you click start the window that shows the progress of the backup is hidden behind.
</p>
<p>This is just one basic case, but the same issue happens with many different applications, when they open a new window it ends up behind the main window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know when a fix will be available.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I followed your suggestions and did not make any difference, I don't see why it would ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following computers have the same problem:</p>
<p>1) DELL XPS 8700 Desktop</p>
<p>2) DELL XPS 8300 Desktop</p>
<p>3) DELL Optiplex</p>
<p>4) MSI GT70-0NC Laptop</p>
<p>5) Lenovo Yoga 920 Laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reproduce the problem open Control Panel -&gt;File History-&gt;System Image Backup-&gt;Create System Image then when it is ready hit Start Backup.</p>
<p>You will see the Create a system Image progress image opening a hiding behind the main window.</p>
<p>This only happens with 1809 even after a clean fresh install, it works fine with 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see the same issue when I try to open a PDF statement from a bank with Acrobat reader, it opens behind the main window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retested after update 17763.55, the bug is still there.</p>

</p><p><span>Hi Manjunath H,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>1) Method 1 did not make any difference</p>
<p>2) As for method 2 the values were already at the same defaults that were set also in 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Foreground Flash Count and Foreground Lock Timeout are set to the same default value 7 and 200000 as win 1803, but 1803 works fine while 1809 does not.</p>
<p>Changing the Foreground Lock Timeout from 200000 to 0 helps one of the problems with the online application opening a PDF file, but does not fix the problem with the Windows Image Backup which keeps hiding the progress windows behind the main window.</p>
<p>It looks to me that there is some other reason for this bug. I know that similar problems were reported with early version of 1709, now this bug is back in 1809 while 1803 works fine with the same setting.
</p>
<p>I also tried values of 3 and 200000 as suggested for the defaults, but that did not help either.</p>
<p>Let me know if there is anything else to address this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Any update on this?&nbsp; We have seen this issue as well and have also started seeing all IE browser sessions crashing since the release of 1809.</p>
<p>Computers are all patched and on the latest 1809 build.</p>

<p>Nothing yet, I havent't seen any news about a fix for this this bug on 1809.</p>
<p>I think the same bug was also reported on older version of windows 10 1709 and earlier, but 1803 was working fine, not sure why it is broken in 1809.</p>

<p>I have a similar issue, pop up windows within the same program (Power Pick Global) started going to the background after updating from 1709 to 1803 and/or 1809.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are running Windows 10 on Zebra ET50 &amp; ET55 tablets, using tablet mode, to get to the background windows (which should be in the foreground) our users now have to click the film strip looking icon followed by the left arrow icon, then they can select
 the window that went behind. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you skip selecting the left arrow icon you can click the background window and it comes forward but returns to the background lol.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a user perspective, it looks like the program is frozen since the area selection window that appeared previously, no longer appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPG is installed locally on each tablet and connects back to a 2008R2 server db.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stupid bugs like this are maddening, having to figure out workarounds on the fly is not value added!</p>

    <title>How to install an older graphics driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> filius1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to install an older graphics driver</h2>
                    I just installed Windows 7, but keep getting blue screens of death. &nbsp;I was able to figure out -- through a free third-party program, no thanks to Microsoft -- that it is being caused by my graphics driver. &nbsp;I have an Nvidia GeForce 7200. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I updated to the latest driver, but am still getting the BSODs, and they are still related to the Nvidia driver. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to try installing an older driver, namely the one that came on the CD with the graphics card. &nbsp;But it won't install because there's a newer driver installed. &nbsp;I can't get rid of the newer driver, because as soon as I uninstall it, it simply
 reinstalls itself next time I boot up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would appreciate any assistance.</div>
                </div>

            Also, when the computer restarts, it just automatically reinstalls the same driver, which is the one that's causing the BSOD. &nbsp;What I want to know is how to make it stop installing the same driver, and let me install the one I want to install.

            Try uninstalling it through the device properties:<br />
<br />
In Device Manager r<span>ight click the device<br />
Click Properties<br />
Click the Driver tab<br />
Then click Uninstall<br />

            No, it just says "Warning: &nbsp;You are about to uninstall this device from your system", and when you click OK it just does it. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have software called Driver Sweeper that is supposed to delete all driver-related files. &nbsp;But as I said, the problem is that upon reboot, Windows just reinstalls it again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's extremely frustrating that Windows doesn't let you install the driver you want to install, instead of making up your mind for you. &nbsp;</div>

            Windows 7 will install a "limited" driver that nVidia has provided to Microsoft.&nbsp;
<br />

Since you have a large problem with video card and their drivers, you may get a better "answer" on the forums @ www.guru3d.com.<br />

            I wanted to let you know that I figured out how to prevent Windows from re-installing the latest driver, which allowed me to install the older driver that I wanted. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The trick is to delete the driver files from the DriverStore. &nbsp; My understanding is that these are driver files that are installed when Windows 7 is installed. &nbsp;When you uninstall a device, the device is removed from the registry, and the driver files
 are uninstalled too. &nbsp;But the driver installation files in the DriverStore are still there. &nbsp;So, when you reboot, Windows detects the device and automatically installs the driver files that are stored in the DriverStore. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The DriverStore is located at c:\windows\system32\DriverStore. &nbsp;Next, double-click the FileRepository folder, and find the folder containing the drivers for your device. &nbsp;It may not be easy to know which ones they are, but in this case I knew it was the
 ones beginning with "Nv_disp", since they were Nvidia display drivers. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you try to delete the folder containing the files, you may get a message saying that you don't have permission. &nbsp;What you have to do then is take ownership of the file. &nbsp;There are instructions on how to do that here: &nbsp;<a href="http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=169555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=169555</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Once you have taken ownership of the folder, you can delete it. &nbsp;Then uninstall the device from Device Manager (or maybe you have to uninstall the device first, I don't remember which way I did it, sorry). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I rebooted the computer, Windows reinstalled the device as Standard VGA Display or something like that. &nbsp;Then, I right-clicked the display adapter and clicked "Update Driver", and chose the option to "Browse my computer for driver software", told
 it to look on the driver CD that came with the device, and it installed the driver I wanted.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After that, you have to make sure Windows Update doesn't download the latest driver. &nbsp;You do that by changing the Windows Update settings to notify you of updates, but let you choose which ones to install. &nbsp;Then, when it notifies you of an updated driver
 for the device that you wanted to use the older driver for, you right-click it and choose "Hide Update". &nbsp;That way it won't keep trying to download the newer driver. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks everyone for your efforts to help out. &nbsp;I hope this helps someone who is as frustrated as I was!</div>

            Hi Windows! 
<br />
<br />So do you have an iPhone or Android? I don’t have a ton of experience with the phone companion, but we can try to troubleshoot and figure this out. 
<br />
<br />You have downloaded the phone companion app on your pc, right? <a href="https://aka.ms/getphonecompanion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/getphonecompanion</a>
<br />
<br />Couple of other things that may help. Checking for updates, let’s make sure we don’t have any updates out there lingering. Also, will your phone connect to your PC via Bluetooth? Just want to make sure they can speak to each other. 
<br />
<br />Let me know and we’ll continue troubleshooting!
<br />- C

            Yes it is the microsoft launcher (renamed from arrow launcher) and it is the link in the app. I have already tried uninstalling the app and also resetting the app via the launcher settings.

            And you’re running what version of windows? 1709? 
<br />
<br />I wonder with the upcoming Spring Creator 1803 if they’ll get this all shaken out. Removing the phone companion option and making their “phone” option in settings sturdier. 
<br />
<br />So you said your phone is not displaying under “phone” - ok, let’s reboot, start from a clean slate. Remove the Microsoft launcher from your android. (What version of Android phone do you have? Are there updates available to install?) 
<br />
<br />Get back to me with this info and we’ll give this a shot again.

            <p>Hi Nurse,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i understand that you want to enable Bit locker on your computer and save the recovery code to USB drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps below to do so:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows + X and select Control Panel.</li><li>Click System and Security, and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.</li><li>Click Turn On BitLocker for the operating system drive. BitLocker will scan your computer to make sure that it meets the BitLocker system requirements. If your computer meets the requirements, BitLocker will inform you of the next steps that need to be
 taken to turn on BitLocker, such as drive preparation, turning on the TPM, and encrypting the drive.</li><li><span>After the TPM is initialized, the BitLocker setup wizard prompts you to choose how to store the recovery key. You can choose "</span><span>Save the recovery key to a USB flash drive" and follow the on screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need any further assistance with Windows, we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<h2>            How to get rid of duplicate files after a System Restore&#63;</h2>
                    I just got my new Dell XPS 15z with Windows 7 64-bit, and after it updated, the Internet wasn't working at all, so I did a System Restore. It was successful, and everything worked fine. However, now I have duplicate files of programs in Program Files and
 Program Files x86. I know x86 is the programs for the 32 bit programs, but can I get rid of one or the other? I feel like it's interfering with all my other programs.

<h2>            Right-click menu &#40;context menu&#41; contains blank lines or is completely empty</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since Windows 10, I have the problem that the context menu (showing up when doing a right-click somewhere) contains empty lines or is even completely empty. In all cases, you can still click on the empty lines and e.g. the properties window will show up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A reboot fixes the problem for some minutes until it shows up again. Re-installing windows 10 did also not solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any ideas?</p>

            <p>I too had this problem resolved by a Restart. Here were my specific problems:</p>
<p>1) Using File Explorer I did Right-Click on a file/folder. The resulting context menu was blank except for for unseen entries that had another dropdown box where the distinguishing right carat at end of supposed entry DID show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) When I brought &nbsp;up START and tried to get a context menu up for any of the START entries, the context menu area was not only as described in 1 above, but also only about 3 characters in width. In 1 above, the context menu was the correct size -- just
 blank entries. In 2 the context entry had correct vertical size indicating the the correct number of entries (unseen) was determined -- just the horizontal size was wrong.</p>
<p>3) I went to System Tray and did Left-Click on Sound and got NOTHING. What should have happened is a popup allowing me to adjust speaker sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After messing with just these problems for an hour, I did a Restart and all was cleared up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was I doing when this problem occurred? I was copying Windows.old from my PC to a portable Hard Disk. It apparently also had problems: After about an hour of coping and at 99% with just 5 minutes left, the copy (COPY from PC, Paste to Portable HD) hung
 there for over 25 minutes before I displayed DETAILS and it showed files still being handled. I eventually canceled this after trying to resolve the context menu issues. It did NOT resolve them. I also did a File Explorer RESTART which did NOT resolve the
 issues. Only a PC Restart worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use the Answer Desk but got someone after 25 minutes who could barely understand English who gave me a number to call -- Microsoft Corporate -- to report a problem! Well, you probably know that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has a clue to these problems, please holler back. If somebody knows how to expediently REPORT a BUG, I'd sure would like to know how to. thanks.</p>

            Do you have the "NVIDIA nView Wizard" installed? During the last two days, the problem did not show up again after I deactivated the automatic startup of this program (in Taskmanager &gt; Startup). It remains to be verified if this also solves the problem
 for a longer period of time or if it was just by accident that the context menu was fine in the last two days.

            <p>Sorry, but no NVIDIA. fyi I am on a Dell Inspiron 1400, 5 GB. When this occurred I was simply doing light browsing except for for one intensive copy function going on as stated. I should have taken the time to look at machine resources being used, but was
 too immersed in finishing the W10 upgrade from W7 install. The upgrade was complete and I was doing the last thing to complete MY plan, mainly copy windows.old folder to a Toshiba portable HD. The copy went all the way to 99%, but never finished, spinning
 there for at least another 20-25 minutes after it said it had nothing left to do, but was still reporting files being copied. I suspect it was accumulating memory and possibly we had a memory overlap. However, I had no noticeable performance problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What were you doing when or just before you saw the problem -- btw, what I saw matched your screen snapshots except the as time went along, the partial entries in context messages went to no entries at all except for the dropdown indicators in the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully we won't see the problem again. Do you see anything common between our systems or functions operating at the time? If it ever happens again, I'll also take snapshots AND monitor resources and processes/services running. Otherwise, thing are running
 fine and the upgrade was a breeze.</p>

            If you have a way to reproduce this reliably, post up here with those steps and I'll see that the bug gets routed the right way.&nbsp; It seems to happen pretty rarely, and is seemingly a sign of system resource exhaustion - which is why restarting fixes it.

I can confirm this scenario, too. It seemed to be random whether a few lines were filled with text or not.</p>

<p>I'll redo the windows.old copy Monday/Tuesday to see if it causes the problem again (and/or other problem too). I will also capture resources being used during the copy and particularly near end when it "hangs" at 99%. Hopefully I experience the right-click
 problem and can claim it is reproducible. Stay tuned. Thanks for getting involved.</p>

            <p>This happened to me too, also while I was moving the WINDOWS.OLD folder to another partition. Due to a few files that TrustedInstaller wouldn't let me move or delete (which also seemed to break the 'time remaining' estimate), I stopped and restarted the
 move a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The context menus were always broken <strong>exactly during</strong> the move operation. Every time, they were immediately OK again after the move was stopped (no reboot or even re-login). And every time, they were broken again when I restarted the move.
 Since then, I've never had that problem again.</p>

<p>Problem IS reproducible.I have it and several problems captured with Screen Snapshots and text explaining each. How do I get it to you? It is in a Microsoft .DOC file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The short, the DISPLAYING of the &nbsp;Context Menus gets corrupted ONLY during the long COPY job (Windows.Old to Toshiba Portable HD). The entries are really there, but blank and sometimes appear partially. For example, if you Right-Click a file and go ahead
 and click the blank area where PROPERTIES SHOULD appear, yo indeed bring up Properties. After I canceled the COPY (ran for 2 hours and never beyond 60% complete), the menus displayed correctly (also a Restart of PC clears things).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the end of my document:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This document should have enough to confirm AND REPRODUCE several ERRORS:</p>
<p>a) Right-click Context Menus corrupted or just displayed wrong out of Explorer, START, TaskBar, System Tray Expansion. This problem only existed by the COPY job was running. The menus were fine after canceling the COPY task.</p>
<p>b) Performance problem with at last COPY</p>
<p>c) I would also look into Windows Defender being in the way. Should have an option on COPY to BYPASS Windows Defender when copying huge files</p>
<p>d) Explore toolbar gets corrupted also</p>
<p>e) Defender ICON does not always appear in System Tray. Also, what happened to the nice option to change what appears in System Tray (always, notification, etc.) as in W7?</p>
<p>f) AFTER I canceled the COPY, ALL Context menus came back correctly, but my Desktop was cluttered with ICONS that turned out be prompts for programs to use for files????? That is, if you open a file that has no file association, you get a propt to select
 one. However, these did NOT come up on screen until I ended the COPY job by canceling the task.</p>
<p>g) Lost all the Quick Access folders in Explorer that I Pinned earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">10 54: Restart time to see what gets cleared!</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>h) Displaying Properties of a large file takes a long, long time to populate SIZE. This never happened on W7.</p>
<p>i) COPY job showed 42,957 items to copy at start. When I started deleted E:\windows.old it counted 89,319 items for the 23.4 GB that got there! Another COPY error! The DELETE of E:\windows.old (permanently, not recycle folder) started at 11:15 and finally
 ended at xxxxx. Why? Just delete the index! At least the Context Menus didn’t corrupt while it was deleting this long!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give me a place to upload my document with screen captures validating the above. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for spending your time on reproducing the error and describing it in detail!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just my two cents: Although the error occurred during copying a larger amount of files (it was not the windows.old folder), the problem with the menu was still there after the copy job was finished. After a restart, the menu was back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had the impression that the large copy job was interrupted after some time and did neither finish to copy all files nor notify the user about an error. This happened together with the context menu problem. After a restart, the same copy job worked
 fine and actually moved all files.</p>

<h2>            Promoting a Child Account to an Adult Account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm trying to manually promote my child account into an adult account but the solution listed here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/security/promote-child-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/security/promote-child-account</a>&nbsp;is
 not working for me. I changed my date of birth in the personal info section on Microsoft.com so that it would be considered an adult, but it's still treated like a child's account. For example, whenever I try to change my privacy settings, it tells me to change
 them with an adult account. Is there anything I can do to promote my account to an adult? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Get &#34;error 0x8007007a the data area pased to a system call is too small&#34; when trying to schedule a task.</h2>
                    
<p>Using WinXP Home SP3 version 2002. I get the above error when trying to schedule a task. I have stopped task scheduler service and deleted the log. I have restarted the service and tried to schedule a simple task and got this error, even when I tried to
 manually run the task when it expired. I am running this under my Admin account and password; I pasted a copy of Schedlgu showing the results when I just now manually ran the scheduled task command prompt as a test.</p>
<p>Any suggestions are greatly appreciated and thanks...Joe</p>

<p>When trying to execute a Scheduled Task (even one that used to work okay) you see the following in the Scheduled Tasks log file:</p>
The attempt to retrieve account information for the specified task failed; therefore, the task did not run. Either an error occurred, or no account information existed for the task.<br />
The specific error is:<br />
0x8004130f: No account information could be found in the Task Scheduler security database for the task indicated.<br />
<p>This means the database that holds the security and credential information for the Scheduled Tasks is missing or has become corrupted.<br />
<br />
If you proceed to resolve the issue, you will have to reenter the Scheduled Task password for all of your Scheduled Tasks, so you might want to be sure you know what all the account settings are for each of your Scheduled Tasks before you start or they will
 not work.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter - since the Scheduled Tasks don't work anyway...&nbsp; (under what user account and password is each Scheduled Task set up?)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Stop the Task Scheduler Service.<br />
<br />
Using Windows search (or explore manually), find the folder containing the Scheduled Task security information.<br />
<br />
The folder to search for and locate is called:<br />
<br />
<strong>S-1-5-18</strong> <br />
<br />
Depending on your installation, there may be several folders with that name, but you are only interested in one of them.&nbsp; The one you need to work on is the "All Users" copy and should be in one of these folders:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users.WINDOWS\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA&nbsp;<strong>&lt;-- this works for my installation<br />
</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; or perhaps for your installation, this folder:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA <br />
<br />
When inside the RSA folder, rename the S-1-5-18 folder to something you can remember, like:<br />
<br />
<strong>S-1-5-18.bak<br />
</strong><br />
With the Task Scheduler stopped, now would be a good time to delete the old Scheduled Tasks log file which is here:<br />
<strong><br />
c:\Windows\SchedLgU.txt</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (rename or delete the old log file)<br />
<br />
Restart the Task Scheduler Service and check the Scheduled Tasks log file and it should look something like this:<br />
<br />
"Task Scheduler Service"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Started at 1/1/2011 4:35:08 PM<br />
<br />
Every Scheduled Task you have will now need to have the account password entered again (even though the Scheduled Tasks "look" okay).</p>
<p>When you establish the credentials for the first Scheduled Task, a new S-1-5-18 folder will be created automatically.</p>
<p>Right click each Scheduled Task, choose Properties and Set (or reSET) the password on each Scheduled Tasks again, click Apply and OK to save the settings. You will have to do this for every Scheduled Task.<br />
<br />
See if your afflicted Scheduled Task will now run both manually and automatically.</p>

<p>Jose, I found the S-1-5-18 folder in the RSA folder and renamed it. The path was C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA. I stopped task scheduler service and deleted the log. Here is the log after restarting task scheduler
 and it did create a new S-1-5-18 folder. I use one and only one password on this machine and each scheduled task uses the same password. Do you have another suggestion? Thank you so much for your continued help...Joe</p>

<p>Hmmm.&nbsp; Let's stick with your Command Prompt job since it is fairly simple and see if we can get that working.</p>
<p>What is your XP version and Service Pack?</p>
<p>What is your current antivirus antimalware configuration?</p>
<p>If the tasks used to work, what do you think might have changed since the last time they worked properly?</p>
<p>It would not hurt to run some scans for malicious software:</p>
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>
<div>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<p>It could be my instructions are out of whack since I have only seen this problem twice before but did recreate it on my system today and also have the Command Prompt job for testing STs, and got the same error message (and then fixed it as I think I described).</p>
<p>It still looks like the ST database is messed up somehow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you find any other S-5-1-18 folders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my system, I stopped the service, renamed the S-5-1-18 folder, restarted the service and tried to run the task (and got the error).</p>
<p>Then I entered the Password for my Command Prompt task and that was the moment when the new S-5-1-18 folder was created.&nbsp; Restarting the service did not create the new folder - I had to actually manipulate a task.&nbsp; Is that what you noticed?</p>
<p>After I entered the password again, the folder was created and then the Command Prompt task worked fine.</p>
<p>Are you able to just delete the Command Prompt task completely and make a new one? I think the Set password part was the only thing I needed to redo on my Command Prompt task and then the new S-5-1-18 folder magically appeared.&nbsp; Is that what you noticed
 (repeat the process if you are not sure).&nbsp; It looks like you found some of my old post somewhere on the Internet about starting with the simple Command Prompt task!</p>
<p>It could be that there is some other step I need to add to my method.</p>
<p>Please double check the process and see if you can get your Command Prompt task to work and I will look around some more and at mine again too.&nbsp; It will not hurt to go through the process again of whacking the S-5-1-18 folder, etc.</p>
<p>Do you find more S-5-1-18 folders?&nbsp; Maybe those are the ones you need to be looking at, but I am pretty sure it is just the All Users one, but that may not be the same on your system.&nbsp; The one that did the trick for me was where I indicated and I believe
 yours is where you indicated.</p>
<p>Maybe my method only works on my system because my system is afraid of me.</p>

<p>I will try the above. I originally had created the task for disk defrag and I don't believe it ever worked. I did find one other S-1-5-18 folder. I'm using WP Home Edition version 2002 SP3. My antivirus/antimalware is AVG Free Edition from Grisoft/Ad Aware
 Free from Lavasoft. AVG updates and scans daily through its scheduler. I have to manually update and scan Ad Aware, usually 2-3 times a week, because it uses the task scheduler. I'll try the above suggestions including the downloads. I didn't really notice&nbsp;when
 the new folder was created, since I only liiked after restarting the service. I have tried deleting and adding the command prompt task after making changes and nothing changed.I'll let you know if these next steps work. Maybe you can intimidate my system too.</p>

<p>A defrag task can sometimes be tricky - sometimes because it is misunderstood and works as designed which is not always as desired... but we can fix that later.</p>
<p>I found my S-1-5-8 folder again, stopped the service, renamed the folder (I first deleted the old S-1-5-8.bak folder from before of course), started the service and no new S-1-5-8 folder was created.&nbsp; That makes sense since it is the task credentials that
 get saved in the S-1-5-8 folder and we need to set them next.</p>
<p>Then I went to my Command Prompt task and redid the username and password (I believe all you need is the password), clicked Apply and then at that moment, the new S-1-5-8 folder was created and then the Command Prompt task started just fine, so be sure that
 is the way things look for you.</p>

<p>Hi Jose, Here's what happened:</p>
<p>1. I deleted the S-1-5-18.bak folder</p>
<p>2. I stopped Task Scheduler Service</p>
<p>3. I renamed S-1-5-18 folder S-1-5-18.bak</p>
<p>4.I started task scheduler; at this time I looked in RSA folder and a new S-1-5-18 folder was already created.</p>
<p>5. I created a new scheduled command prompt task and retyped the username and password, and got the same error and it failed to run when I manually tried to run it.</p>
<p>Looks like a departure from your findings. If you're out of ideas, that's ok. It is a laptop I use for my repair business, and this is just a convenience for me. i won't make it or break on this little issue.</p>

            Hi Andrianos.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />See if this helps to reset Hello:  
<br /><a href="https://blog.goptg.com/how-to-reset-windows-hello-biometrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blog.goptg.com/how-to-reset-windows-hel...</a>
<br />
<br />Here are other steps for fixing Windows Hello:
<br />
<br />1) Turn off Fast Startup:  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />2) Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />  Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options
<br />    Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />    After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />    Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />3)  Modify Group Policy Settings  (for Pro version only)
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />    Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />    Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />    Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />    Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />    Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />    Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />4) Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform.  
<br />
<br />Go to the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model, Serial Number or Dell Service tag, compare the latest Biometric drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  download and install any newer,
<br />    
<br />   If no newer driver Right-click on Start button and select Device Manager.
<br />    Locate the Hello, Biometric device, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually, choose Driver tab, 
<br />    Select Update driver,  then Automatic.  
<br />    If no newer driver, choose Roll back or if not available, choose Uninstall, 
<br />    Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />    Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />    The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.
<br />
<br />5) Run Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6)  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> 
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
