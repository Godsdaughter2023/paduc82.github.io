<h2>            My Lumia 630 Dual over Freezes and bars incoming calls and SMSs</h2>
                    This behavior started after downloading the Windows 8.1Update and I feel like throwing this phone away. It disturbs me that everytime the phone locks, it freezes that I cant receive calls and it requires restarts to resume functionality. I need some advice
 and help.

            <p>Hi Muvundu,</p>
<p>Others have reported similar issues with the Lumia 630 DS since the Denim update.<br />
Make sure the phone is fully updated regarding system apps (in the Store app).<br />
Next consider if both SIMs are relatively new (and not cut to size) - or if is worth to get replacement SIM cards to try troubleshoot the issues you are facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check both SIMs for proper functionality in SIM slot 1 with SIM slot 2 empty.<br />
Observe that SIM slot 2 is 2G only on all dual-SIM Lumia phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lost connectivity and freezing issues in Lumia DS phones&nbsp;seems to affect users in poor coverage and users who travel in and out of roaming areas most.<br />
There is no official acknowledgement of these issues as far as I know.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Export Contacts in .csv format from Office 365 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi. What is a good way to export contacts from Office 365 for Mac into a .csv file, preserving all the right field labels?</p>
<p>Office 365 only offers "Export" into an Outllok for Mac file, which is not what I need.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<h3> luxzg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unlock based on - location, WiFi, companion device</h2>
                    <p>Please, give us an option to login to mobile devices (laptops, tablets, even phones) without entering password if we are on a "friendly location". Make it per-user setting, and give enterprise admins policy to allow/disallow this setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>- laptop</p>
<p>- login screen with 2 users: JOHN and MARY</p>
<p>- John hates passwords, but understands he needs them on the go, so he has setup his phone/smartwatch as a companion to laptop, and has setup his home WiFi AP with MAC address ab:cd:ef:00:11 and SSID&nbsp;HOME&nbsp;to be a safe location. When phone / watch / AP HOME
 are in range, his laptop does not auto-lock, and if he is booting it it will allow to login with just a click on his user account picture / icon, no questions asked. Also, if friendly devices leave range and laptop is idle for more than 1 monute it will auto-lock
 and on unlock will ask for password.</p>
<p>- Mary has no gadgets, and likes her privacy (maybe she has a lover that John knows nothing about ;) ) so she has password always on. Whenever and where ever laptop is noone can use MARY account without her password. Also, it auto-locks always after 1 minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are tons of things you could do with companion devices and known locations, not just setup correct printer when you're connected to certain network...</p>

            <p>Not requesting password in certain location is not a safe way because hackers could modify it and pretend they are in safe location as you using MAC Spoofing or IP Spoofing and just imagine they know what is your MAC Address is or your location is and they
 could simulate it and in this case it won't ask for password and for this reason such design is not safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other ways to login to your PC without typing password even in Windows 8, like Picture Password or if your PC support fingerprint reader or smartcard you could use them login without entering password.</p>

    <title>Inserting Endnotes on Excel linked tables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliefh1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting Endnotes on Excel linked tables</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking around I realised it is not possible to add Endotes to tables easily within Excel. So I thought it might be possible to add Endnotes to excel linked table within Word? It is possible to add the Endnotes to the table in Word however they disappear
 every time the Excel data refreshes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this? I have a cash flow table in excel and I want to add Endnotes for various items. I do not want to add superscript numbers to every item manually because when I add or rearrange items the numbers won't automatically update, as they
 would do with word endnotes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Charlie</p>

            I assume that the Endnotes are for explanatory notes.&nbsp; Could you do it by using the Comments facility to provide the notes?&nbsp; You can select to "Show All Comments" in Excel and they will remain visible in the Word document.

<h2>            Outlook Message &#34;trying to connect to server...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am new to home computing but familiar from my work. Outlook initially worked fine on my new PC, intranet connection, and basic office account. Then, apparently after a Microsoft automatic update, I get the message "trying to connect to server". I have
 tried all the simple fixes including re-installing and forcing another update (hopefully with a fix as this seems to be a Microsoft server problem). Nothing works. Forced to use g-mail, but would prefer my Outlook back. As is, I have given up.</p>

            Since I had nothing to lose, I reset the computer to factory conditions with my recovery medium. After this, Outlook will now connect to the Microsoft Exchange server and I am OK. Perhaps I am at fault, but Outlook worked fine until after an Update. So
 only time will tell. Hope it lasts. Much prefer Outlook.

<h2>            Group Calendar - Event item upate with selective attendee&#47;no invitation to whole group</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am an owner of an Office 365 Group and I find that when an "event item" in the Group Calendar was initially set up as an appointment only (ex. no invited attendee, "Send an invitation to the group" was unchecked), later when I
 try to <strong>invite selective members of the group to this already created event item</strong>, I experiencing the same behavior as this user has indicated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Groups-AMA/Group-Calendar-Appointments-Not-Invites/m-p/72864/highlight/true#M270</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, as long as one member in the group is invited to an event entered in the Group Calendar, the "Send an invitation to the group" is automatically checked and greyed out, prompting an email invite to EVERY MEMBER even though it could be just 15 out
 of group of 30 members that need to be there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something that Microsoft is aware of and would be fixed?</p>
<p>

                    <p>Since 1 month or so, the OneNote mobile app on my Windows lumia 830 is using obscene amounts of data. Sometimes it uses 250MB a day!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution for this?</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>it affects only OneNote.</p>
<p>i am connected via mobile connection as i am always on the go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might have something to do with my usage and some options. Look into the following.</p>
<p>I turned off the automatic sync and all data and picture sync options. Then it got much better. It used below 10mb per day.</p>
<p>After that I turned automatic sync on again. Every time I opened OneNote it used about 13mb of&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>My solution is turning auto sync on and leave OneNote open all day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Access 2010 - Help with syntax error in date in query expression error</h2>
                    <p>I am self-taught so there is my first issue. However, I have built a database for use at work. All features work great except one... I am asking for help to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relevant info:</p>
<p>Tables:</p>
<p>"Case" -- relevant field [violation_date]</p>
<p>"Monday_Court_Dates" -- relevant fields [Mondays] and [final_court_date]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have a function which calculates&nbsp;someone's final court date as being the next available court date&nbsp;(from [Mondays]) after&nbsp;190 days after the violation date. There is also a field [final_court_date] in which someone can manually enter a final court date.
 If a&nbsp;date is manually entered, the formula reads that field. If no date is manually entered, the&nbsp;date calculated pursuant to the formula is displayed.&nbsp;The formula is:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expr1: IIf(([Final_Court_Date] Is Not Null),[Final_Court_Date],(DFirst("[Mondays]","Monday_Court_Dates","[Mondays]&gt;#" &amp; DateAdd("d",190,[Violation_Date]) &amp; "#")))</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my forms - this date calculates and displays correctly with no issues. When I print out an agreement (using form&nbsp;and generating a report), it reflects this date correctly.
</p>
<p>However, when I run a query which includes that field... an error returns as "syntax error in date in query expression error"</p>
<p>After I click ok - the results of the query appear.</p>
<p>However, the issue is that ONLY the only cases that appear on my report/query results are those which have a manually entered [final_court_date]. None of the records using only the calculated court date appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if you need additional information.</p>
<p>Using: Access 2010.</p>
<p>

            <p>First&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; you can not use the First function to find the earliest date.&nbsp; First finds the first date in the returned records and because records are returned in whatever order the database engine thinks is efficient, the records can be returned in any order,
 especially after many records have been added, deleted or edited (the same can be said about the Last function).&nbsp; Instead of First, use the Min function to get the earliest date (Max for the latest date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, just concatenating # signs around a date value will not always result in the date in the field.&nbsp; The concatenation forces Access to convert the date value to a string that looks like a date.&nbsp; But, Access uses each user's Windows regional settings
 to convert a date to a string.&nbsp; That means users can change their settings to use non USA style dates and after you concatenate the # signs (to tell Access the date string is a USA style date) you end up with Feb 5 being changed to May 2.&nbsp; The safe way to
 do what you want is to use the Format function so the date is converted to a string that is the correct representation of the date value.&nbsp; For example, you could use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expr1: IIf([Final_Court_Date] Is Not Null, [Final_Court_Date], DMin("[Mondays]", "Monday_Court_Dates", "[Mondays] &gt;" &amp; Format(DateAdd("d",190,[Violation_Date]), "\#yyyy-m-d\#")))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, you can use the Nz function&nbsp;to make that&nbsp;a little simpler:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expr1: Nz([Final_Court_Date], DMin("[Mondays]", "Monday_Court_Dates", "[Mondays] &gt;" &amp; Format(DateAdd("d",190,[Violation_Date]), "\#yyyy-m-d\#")))</p>
<p>
</p><p>If using the Format function doesn't fix the syntax error, post back with the new expression you are then using.</p>

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email validation system designed to prevent email spam by detecting email spoofing, a common vulnerability, by verifying sender IP addresses.<br />
<br />
SPF allows administrators to specify which hosts are allowed to send mail from a given domain by creating a specific SPF record (or TXT record) in the Domain Name System (DNS).<br />
<br />
Only our administrators are able to review your request.<br />

    <title>Samsung Focus cannot get wifi connection without reboot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Samsung Focus cannot get wifi connection without reboot</h2>
                    I'm having this weird issue after updating to Mango with my Samsung Focus that I didn't notice before. &nbsp;Sometimes I can't connect to any wifi networks (despite being able to see them and normally being able to connect otherwise). &nbsp;The only solution I've
 found was to reboot my phone, upon which wifi will start working again instantly. &nbsp;This happens with both my wifi network at work, and my home router. &nbsp;I live in a shared home so I do not have access to either router's configurations to check any weird settings,
 but my phone normally connects to both without issue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I believe my home router is a variant of Linksys WRT54G (have to check later), probably with stock firmware. &nbsp;I have no idea what router my company is using. &nbsp;Both connections are WPA2/WPA2 enterprise as far as I know. &nbsp;A quick search on google and here
 didn't find any cases similar to mine. &nbsp;Can anyone help?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!!</div>

            <p>I wish i could help you but i have the same issue, except no reboot of my phone helps.&nbsp; I can connect to my home wireless network intially.&nbsp; It works great.&nbsp; I let the phone sit unused for a few hours, say overnight.&nbsp; I come back the next morning, it cannot
 connect to the wireless network.&nbsp; It sees the network, i enter the password, but it is saying the password is wrong....which it is not.&nbsp; Funny thing is, the password worked when i initially connected to the network?!&nbsp; So how could it change?</p>
<p>The only way for me to get the phone connected again is to modify something about the network via the router.&nbsp; Such as turning off and on the SSID or some other modification.&nbsp; I am using a Netgear WNR4000.&nbsp; I have tried multiple security methods, including
 WPA2&nbsp;and even WEP.&nbsp; The same issue is occuring.&nbsp; It only allows connecting to the network when it "changes."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have looked over the settings and it does not appear that there is an issue with the router settings as i have a lot of other devices connecting without losing their connectivity.&nbsp; Until Mango, this was not an issue.&nbsp; I have a Samsung Focus running on
 Mango.</p>

            <p>I'm having similar issue - it definately is a software/driver issue - and possibly Samsung specific.</p>
<p>Basically, I have a Samsung Omnia 7 with Mango and latest updates (v7.10.8107.79). My wife has an LG Optimus 7.</p>
<p>I find that I have to reboot my phone before I can use wifi at home - my wife's phone however doesn't have this issue and doesn't need reboot - this makes it clear that there isn't a problem with my router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, to help me discover if/when my wifi is actually working, I've installed a free WP7 app called ActiveNet Now. Prior to reboot, the wifi test fails - after reboot, works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very annoying!! I've only noticed this issue in last few weeks - at first I thought I had a slow connection or problem perhaps with my router and didn't put much thought to it...however my wife's phone has confirmed that there definately is an issue with
 my phone wifi works fine whilst my phone has problems (i've used them both at same time to confirm).
</p>
<p>For reference, wife's phone is LG-E900 with&nbsp;OS version 7.10.7740.16 (it has an update available - though I'm holding off for now in case it's a problem with the new update).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other info - we're both on the Optus network (Australia). Using Windows 7 PC. Wireless modem is ThomsonTG782T - using secured Wifi (WPA2) without Proxy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, other than rebooting my phone nightly before using wifi at home, not sure what the trigger is for needing a reboot - i.e. after rebooting phone, wifi works...if I wait a while and phone turns off and I turn it back on, wifi still seems to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

    <title>Help needed to get rid of Playtopus please... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grandad john  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help needed to get rid of Playtopus please...</h2>
                    <p>About&nbsp;a week or so&nbsp;ago, I was stupid enough to respond to a pop-up that told me a virus or trojan had been detected on my PC. It prompted me to press a prompt which would, allegedly, take me to the Microsoft site and give me the chance to download a nifty
 tool that would find and delete the threat. Like a fool, I responded as prompted, downloaded the tool then ran it. It quickly told me the threat had been detected and removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forgot all about it until I started getting pop-ups whenever I visited a web site. Even public service sites like BBC resulted in a pop-up telling me I'd been selected randomly&nbsp;for a survey and would be in with a chance to win an iPhone or whatever if
 I completed it. Of course, when I'd completed it, it wanted my name, address, etc plus my e-mail address. Stupidly I was taken in by this stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the next day, fed up with these pop-ups every time I visited a site, I looked a bit more closely and saw they were all to do with Playtopus. The small blurb at the bottom of the pop-up encouraged me that if I wanted to stop receiving these things, contact
 them at the given addy. I was so fed up with these things that all I wanted was to get rid of whatever was causing the pop-ups. I ran a complete Symantec/Norton 360 scan but it found nothing, so I logged on to the Microsoft site&nbsp;a couple of days ago and saw
 just a few messages about how to remove the trojan. After a few failed attempts, I managed to run the MS Malicious removal tool then reboot and run a complete MS scan which was clean. Great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, I find an error message every time something called RunDLL does its thing. The error msg says that ...\AppData\Local\PLAYTO~1\Updater.dll isn't found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<p>1 How do I stop that RunDLL trying to run the (deleted) trojan?</p>
<p>2 Playtopus.com is showing up in my IE history file. Is it safe and/or necessary for me to delete that entry too?</p>
<p>3 Is there anything else I should do, apart from not falling for this scam again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks (and sorry the msg is so long)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Your PC is probably infected by multiple things at this point despite nothing being detected by standard scans. Note that the MSRT is a specialized tool that targets a specific subset of detections. The Safety Scanner is a full scan, but it won't be effective
 at a root kit infection in most cases.</p>
<p>The thing you allowed and installed allowed the actual malware to embed itself onto the PC.</p>

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates
 a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>

<strong><span>2010 Academic 64-bit</span></strong>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt; </span></p>
<p><span>Just opened my e-mail and had a message back from Digital River:</span></p>
<p><span>“Thank you for contacting the Ultimate Steal online store. </span>
</p>
<p><span>We understand that you would like to have the 64-bit version of your Microsoft Office Professional Academic 2010.</span></p>
<p><span>We would like to inform you that 64-bit version is not available.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>However most users install 32-bit version of Office 2010 on both 32 and 64-bit Operating Systems because currently many common add-ins for Office will not function in the 64-bit edition. The 64-bit installation of Microsoft Office 2010
 products is available for users who commonly use very large documents or data set and need Excel 2010 programs to access greater than 2GB of memory. There may be technical issues with the 64-bit version and in order to install a 64-bit version of Office 2010
 product users must have a 64-bit supported operating system on their PC.</span></p>
<p><span>We are glad to be of service to you.”</span></p>
<p><span>I have yet to reply to it but I’m already annoyed. I ordered this with the impression that there was going to be an x64 installer (just like the retail copies). They can either give me the installer or give me a refund at this point. Yes
 I know I can run the x86 version in x64 (which is what I’m doing now), but I wanted Office 2010 mostly because it was going to be the first true x64 version of Office.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>For some reason I was not presented with an option to download the x64 installer.&nbsp; There was just 1 download link and it was the old X16-32007.exe.&nbsp; However their download link:
<a href="https://www2.buyoffice.microsoft.com/usa/unitdownloader.aspx?cache=XXXXXXX&amp;local_only=true&amp;receipt_id=XXXXXXX&amp;dname=O14.download.name.32&amp;id=XXXXXXX&amp;culture=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www2.buyoffice.microsoft.com/usa/unitdownloader.aspx?cache=XXXXXXX&amp;local_only=true&amp;receipt_id=XXXXXXX&amp;dname=O14.download.name.32&amp;id=XXXXXXX&amp;culture=en-us</a>&nbsp; you can simply change the download.name.32 to64 and it will start downloading X16-31970.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The XXXXXXX are your particular variables in your shopping session</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi all.
</span><span>The Digital River 2010 backup disk DOES contain the 64-bit folder to run from. Remember you need to uninstall all remnants of any Office 32-bit components beforehand. Microsoft has very thorough unique version-specific uninstallers
 at the Office support website you can run if there is any problem with the usual uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried pretty aggressively to get them to e-mail me the 64.bit exe file to run with the download but no one would. I guess you need to get to the right person. All their e-mails that said they didn’t offer 64-bit installation were misrepresentations.</span></p>
<p><span>The trial version workaround solution sounds pretty good if it works for everyone--saves having to buy the backup disk.</span></p>

    <title>Question about purchasing microsoft software from another region - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joppyjop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about purchasing microsoft software from another region</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Thai national temporarily residing in Denmark for work.&nbsp; I want to get the Thai version of the MS Office Home and Business 2013.&nbsp; These are widely available in shops in Thailand although the description of the product says it is an "APAC EM DVD" which
 I think means Asia-Pacific, Emerging Markets version.&nbsp; If I ask my relatives in Thailand to get it and bring it over to Denmark when they visit me here in Denmark and I install it on my laptop here would that be in breach of Microsoft licence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jop</p>

            <p>Greetings AnirudhGadhavi:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting to the forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several things we can try to get your phone up and working correctly again. Please try these steps in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to Applications &gt; Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Internet Explorer. Once here, tap Delete History. You can also open Internet Explorer from your start page, go to the ... and then go to Options/Settings and do it there.</li><li>Please shut down your phone entirely by holding down the power button for 10 seconds. While it's off, if possible (as not all phones can do this), take out your battery for a few seconds and then put it back in. Then turn on your phone again.</li><li>We'll want to refresh your email account, the primary one, on the phone. Please navigate to Applications &gt; Settings &gt; Email + accounts. You'll want to tap and hold on the account and then Sync. The main account is usually at the top of the list, and says
 Windows Live on top of it.</li><li>Try using both data and wifi modes only.</li></ul>
<p>If you are still having these issues after these steps, you may want to roll back to 7.5 on your phone. This can be done in the Zune software under Settings &gt; Device &gt; Update. (You'll want to find the backup your phone did when you updated.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hard reset may be another option for you to consider. This can be done by going to Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset my phone. Please be aware if you hard reset your phone, all content will be removed from your phone. Your contacts and paid applications will be
 saved to your account, so you can access them next time you log into your phone (although you will need to redownload your applications). As far as music and videos and pictures go, please make sure to back them up using the Zune software (<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/music/sync-files-with-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/music/sync-files-with-my-phone</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you and best regards,</p>
<p>Iris.</p>

<h2>            Just Created a Table Style and It Won&#39;t Show Up in Style Pane</h2>
                    <p>I'm working in Word Office 365.&nbsp; I'm creating a custom style for a table.&nbsp; I've created a half dozen table styles and none of them are showing up in the Style Pane.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with the List view such as "All Styles," "In Current Document," "Styles
 in Use," or "Recommended."&nbsp; Doesn't matter what List you are in, none of my newly created Styles show up.&nbsp; They're non-existent in any of the lists.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I'll point out, three times when creating the Table Style and being in that dialog box, when clicking on "No Border" from the borders drop-down ... Word Crashes.&nbsp; It's repeatable on my machine.&nbsp; Three times exact same.</p>

<p>Table Styles never display in the Styles Pane, even those that have been applied in a document. Instead they are shown at the beginning of the
<strong>Table Styles</strong> <em>Gallery</em> on the <strong>Table Design</strong> contextual tab of the Ribbon. When the entire Gallery is displayed there is a

</p><p>Although Skype does not host a call center, if you can provide at least a few details about the nature of your question, we here in the Skype Community on Answers could point you in the right direction!&nbsp; For example, do you have a question about a Skype

<p>
</p><p>No need to delete or remove the 1; simply proceed with typing the digits of your SSN number when prompted.&nbsp; Yes, the string of numbers appearing will make no sense as they accumulate on the screen and as you work your way through the various options, selecting
 each menu item in the multi-tier system where you have to make a choice.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have installed a stopwatch app to check to see if the phone has randomly restarted or rebooted, so far it has been about 5 hours with out rebooting. Installing apps and testing functions and features.</p>

            I have a similar problem with my Lumia 950XL. During a call I would get a reboot after 10-20 seconds.&nbsp;after some digging, testing and reviewing other sites. I decided that the problem was most likely caused by Bluetooth. with Bluetooth off, I experienced
 no reboots. with bluetooth on, the device would disconnect from bluetooth and some seconds later reboot spontaneous. Just to make sure it was not a hardware problem I returned my unit for another 950 XL and experienced the same behavior. I tried with multiple
 bluetooth devices (headset Plantronics, Microsoft Band 1) and the behavior is the same every time. So my conclusion is that it is a software issue and I hope an update will resolve it. Until then I keep bluetooth switched of, and I have not experienced a single
 random or spontaneous reboot.

            <p>I've got my Lumia 950, dual sim, now and it has rebooted 4 times now. I was actually not doing anything when it rebooted, two times happened while I was sleeping and I only noticed in the morning because I was being asked the pins again. The other time I
 was in the office and suddenly noticed the Microsoft logo showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I did a reset of the phone, installed the update .29, but still happened once more, and again not doing anything. I was watching TV and the phone was on the table and I noticed the logo showing up again, so I can't be more helpful than that.</p>

<p>If I shutoff Bluetooth my Microsoft band won't sync and I can't use my speakerphone, both unacceptable. Has anyone else noticed while typing&nbsp;a response to this forum using the 950 is painfully slow.

    <title>Stock quotes missing from MSN Money - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timashbaugh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stock quotes missing from MSN Money</h2>
                    <p>Where does MSN Money pull the data from&nbsp;for the stock quotes? There are a bunch of ETFs that are not found when typing in for the latest quote on MSN Money. For example type in FLAG and&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;will pull up Flagstar&nbsp;Bancorp&nbsp;FBC instead of the correct listing
 - FLAG - &nbsp;Forensic Accounting ETF - which trades on the NYSE, This occurs whether accessing&nbsp;the site&nbsp;through a PC, Laptop, IPAD, etc.. There are also many ISHARE ETFs not found through the MSN Money website as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is MSFT aware of this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MSFT wants folks who used Portfolio Manager faithfully for years to use the MSN Money website and My Watchlist, they need to have a comprehesive database that contains all of the stock/ETF/Mutual fund entities etc&nbsp;that trade on the major markets.</p>
