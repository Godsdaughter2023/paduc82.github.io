<div>Windows 7 Offline Privacy Statement for the Microsoft Error Reporting Service</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For the most up-to-date privacy information, see the online Windows 7 Privacy Statement at:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=104288</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>WHAT THIS FEATURE DOES</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Microsoft Error Reporting Service helps Microsoft and Microsoft partners diagnose problems in the software you use and provide solutions. Not all problems have solutions, but when solutions are available, they are offered as steps to solve a problem
 you’ve reported or as updates to install. To help prevent problems and make software more reliable, some solutions are also included in service packs and future versions of the software.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Microsoft Error Reporting Service also provides Setup Repair, an error reporting service that may run during Windows setup if a problem occurs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>INFORMATION COLLECTED, PROCESSED, OR TRANSMITTED</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many Microsoft software programs, including Windows 7, are designed to work with the reporting service. If a problem occurs in one of these software programs, you might be asked if you want to report it. &nbsp;If you host virtual machines using a Windows operating
 system, reports generated by the Windows operating system for the Microsoft Error Reporting Service might include information about virtual machines.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The reporting service collects information that is useful for diagnosing and solving the problem that has occurred, such as:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; * &nbsp;Where the problem happened in the software or hardware</div>
<div>&nbsp; * &nbsp;The type or severity of the problem</div>
<div>&nbsp; * &nbsp;Files that help describe the problem</div>
<div>&nbsp; * &nbsp;Basic software and hardware information</div>
<div>&nbsp; * &nbsp;Possible software performance and compatibility problems&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These reports might unintentionally contain personal information. For example, a report that contains a snapshot of computer memory might include your name, part of a document you were working on, or data that you recently submitted to a website. If a
 report is likely to contain this type of information, Windows will ask if you want to send this information, even if you have enabled automatic reporting through the “Recommended settings” option in setup, or Control Panel. This gives you the opportunity to
 review the report before sending it to Microsoft. Reports including files and data might be stored on your computer until you have an opportunity to review and send them, or after they have been sent.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If an error report contains personal information, Microsoft does not use the information to identify you or contact you. In addition, if you enable automatic reporting through the "Recommended settings" option in setup, or in Control Panel, the reporting
 service will send basic information about where problems occur automatically, but these reports will not have the detail described above.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After you send a report, the reporting service might ask you for more information about the error you experienced. If you choose to provide your phone number or e-mail address in this information, your error report will be personally identifiable. Microsoft
 might contact you to request additional information to help solve the problem you reported.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Microsoft Error Reporting Service generates a globally unique identifier (GUID) that is stored on your computer and sent with error reports to uniquely identify your computer. The GUID is a randomly generated number; it does not contain any personal
 information and is not used to identify you. We use the GUID to distinguish how widespread the feedback we receive is and how to prioritize it. For example, the GUID allows Microsoft to distinguish between one customer experiencing a problem one hundred times
 and one hundred customers experiencing the same problem once.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>USE OF INFORMATION</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft uses information about errors and problems to improve Microsoft products and services as well as third-party software and hardware designed for use with these products and services. Microsoft employees, contractors, vendors, and partners might
 be provided access to information collected by the reporting services. However, they will use the information only to repair or improve Microsoft products and services and third-party software and hardware designed for use with Microsoft products and services.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft might share aggregate information about errors and problems. Microsoft uses aggregate information for statistical analysis. Aggregate information does not contain specific information from individual reports, nor does it include any personal
 or confidential information that might have been collected from a report.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Except as described in this statement, personal information you provide will not be transferred to third parties without your consent. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as performing statistical analysis.
 We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers,
 including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the software; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Information collected by or sent to Microsoft by Windows 7 may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the safe
 harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CHOICE AND CONTROL</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you choose the recommended settings during Windows 7 setup, basic information about errors will be sent automatically to Microsoft. If a more detailed error report is required, you will be prompted to review it before it is sent. You can change this
 setting at any time by going to Action Center in Control Panel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>SECURITY PRACTICES</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you
 provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.</div>

                    I know how to add accounts to my windows app and I've done so before, but now it's not working. I took my hotmail account off because of some problems, and was going to add it back on, but when I push 'add account' a blank box pops up. It just says 'choose
 account' and there's supposed to be a list of choices, like outlook and gmail, but the box is blank and I can't click on anything except for 'cancel'. Can you please help me?

<h2>            Migrated users are unable to see profile pictures of on-premise users</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have come up in a critical situation, when i have setup a hybrid with exchange server 2010 and office 365.</p>
<p>When i migrated my users mailbox to office 365, they are unable to see the profile pictures of on-prem mailboxes.</p>
<p>On-premises are able to see profile picture of cloud users as well as on-prem users, also cloud users are able to see profile pictures of cloud users.</p>
<p>Now the trick is that when cloud users sign into Skype For Business, they are able to see profile pictures of the on-prem users in outlook, which they were not able to see.</p>
<p>Need help in this scenario...!!!</p>

<h2>            Assigning categories and forwarding email automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help suggest a solution to the following query. We are using outlook 2010 and 2013 in our company. We have a shared mailbox configured and additionally each user has it's own mailbox added to outlook. When the email comes in to a shared mailbox
 we have different colour categories with each employee name to it so that we can assign the email to each person by selecting relevant colour with the name. This is to differentiate to who should the email belong or who should action the email. Is there a
 way to create a rule or make outlook forward a copy of that email to the person automatically when a category with the person name is assigned to it? So when we don't look at shared mailbox we get notified the email has been assigned to our name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael.</p>

            You can solve that with VBA macros. Here're some <a href="http://vboffice.net/en/developers/trigger-actions-with-categories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
samples </a>for how to act when you assign a category, which you could adapt.

                    <p>Hi there, I've downloaded and installed windows 10 technical preview and must say the user interface looks pretty good,</p>
<p>one thing i'm missing is the This PC shortcut, now I found out &nbsp;how to pin the shortcut to my start menu but for regular users it would be hard to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Microsoft give the end user the This PC shortcut back or must they&nbsp;find it out for themselves&nbsp;how to pin it to their startmenu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be better to put the This Computer shortcut icon&nbsp;on the Desktop or on the Start Menu, just like in Windows 7 .</p>

<h2>            why does linkedin only show partial contacts</h2>
                    <p>Just bought Nokia Lumia 800. Integration of Outlook, Twitter and Facebook are OK. But when I try to link to LinkedIn it only shows the (alphabetically) first 15 contacts or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried most of the plain suggestions (SW update, reset to factory settings, delete LinkedIn account, check to see if Linkedin contacts are visible,..)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 500+ Linkedin contacts and would like to keep them close through Windows Phone.</p>

    <title>outlook.com archive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeh71  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook.com archive</h2>
                    <p>The "Archive" menu feature in Outlook.Com&nbsp;only appears when I've checked a message (viewing in list mode) or when I've clicked on a message to view the details.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By mistake several times, I've meant to hit Delete and instead hit Archive. I have not seen the "Setup message archiving" screen shown in a "how to" article on setting up Outlook.Com Archives on another&nbsp;blog. So I have no idea where the messages I've accidentally&nbsp;archived
 have disappeared to nor how I can get them back in my Inbox. I've confirmed they are not in any of my folders. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. If it matters, I'm using IE v8.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Device Recovery Tool <span>works on Acer, Alcatel, BLU, HTC (One M8 and 8X), LG, Lumia, NEO, UniStrong, VAIO and Yezz phones running Windows Phone 8 or later.&nbsp;It also works on HP devices.

<p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately that didn't help at all. The Windows Device Recovery Tool does not detect the device. It's also not compatible to the US Version (Idol 4S) it has a different DeviceID. For thenew Alcatel Idol 4 Pro there's no image available, so there is no
 way to recover it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I would like to know if there are plans to support the new Alcatel device or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            Thank you for getting back to us. It would be best to send this concern to our Software Engineers and Software Developers by using our Feedback Hub as they're the best team to provide you with more details regarding this. To launch the Feedback Hub app

<p>Not to be a jerk, but why can't YOU MODERATORS ask the relevant people about the lack of an Alcatel IDOL 4 S image? The phone has been out in the US since the fall of 2016, and it is now Sept 2017. The phone is sold in the Microsoft Store--I just bought
 two of them. The issue is well known. Putting the question into the Feedback Hub is a waste of time because it will not get enough upvotes to get any attention. OTOH, moderators could talk to the right person and have the answer in minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could at least try, no?</p>

<h3> holiday-sa  say:</h3>
<h2>            GoSearch Malware virus</h2>
                    How do I stop GoSearch from entering my PC permanently. It now happens once a day then it takes me to scan with Malware (free) and then to reinstate in Settings preferred search engine, where you find that GoSearch has placed itself on top, Scan PC and
 then reboot. Lot of productive time going to waste. Any help or advice will be appreciated. Thank you Peter *** Email address is removed for privacy ***

<p>Good day Bruce, Thank you for all the help. I scanned using all the recommended programs except HitmanPro because my Trial period is over as I used it before and the very last no8.</p>
<p>Many infections was removed but as I started up after a reboot the GoSearch and Winky web browser is back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attached screen shots. Sorry does not want to upload.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi thank you,</p>
<p>I actually did run Chrome Cleanup and it seems to be the end of GoSearch. Hope so. Rescanned with Emsisoft Emergency Scanner and must say very impressed with this program. So many on the market but which one do you buy. It will cost a fortune to buy all
 but I think will go for Emsisoft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi thank you for all the help,</p>
<p>When I was all done with the scanning process I rebooted and GoSearch was back. Somewhere cant remember, Chrome Cleanup came up which I then did and it seems to be the end of GoSearch. Hope so. Rescanned with Emsisoft Emergency Scanner and must say very

<h2>            Searching Flagged mails on All folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the Microsoft experts, please do not refer me to help pages. If I wanted them I wouldn't have post this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question is for "outlook.live.com" with "Outlook Mail" on the left top corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When inside some folder I understand I can press on the "All" &nbsp;in the right side and I will get list of options which one of them is "Flagged". When pressing on it I get a list of Flagged emails for the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">specific folder.</span></p>
<p>Is there a way to get Flagged emails for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
All</span>&nbsp;folders in one screen or do I need to go one by one to each folder and look for "Flagged" messages? &nbsp;In the example below I have flagged items only for the "Inbox" folder. How do I get the flagged messages for all the folders in the left without
 going one by one? I need to know because this will determine if I keep the folders or just move everything to one folder which &nbsp;is ugly but I have to do it if Miscrosoft ignored the users with multiple folders.</p>
<p>

            <p>A nightmare - I have approx 24 folders, flagged items in most. The folder system is very important to me as each corresponds to a different alias or group of senders that I wish to see or prioritise differently. But without a 'flagged' or follow up view,
 am I going to spend an hour or more a day checking each folder individually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Nor do pinned items work as required as you can't scroll the unpinned separately so have to scroll down a long way tos ee a new mail item if you have pinned instead of flagged - one MS Engineer told me Pinned was the replacement for Flags.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess going forward we can move all flagged items into your own 'flagged' or 'action' folder, though you then lose the original folder, but better than everything all in one folder if you only flag a small percentage of the mail..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I urge everyone to send feedback on such applying oversights, not to mention actual bugs. There is some nice new functionality - pasting images was long overdue for restoration for example, - but with so much loss of critical functionality, it's not worth
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an absolute doddle (ie very easy) to fix this problem and include 'flagged' as an option in the cross-folder search or to give a 'flagged' view or folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS do eventually respond to each item of feedback! Admittedly, their advice is mostly the usual crap from the ignorant - delete your cookies, try another browser - but they are reading them, so multiple complaints on same issue just might push stuff up the
 priority list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worse problems - the destruction (for second if not third time) of all my group lists and the mutilation of many of my contacts,m for example, and Reply not defaulting to using the correct alias which was used earlier in the thread, this giving away
 my secure core address!</p>

            <p>'designed differently' is a kind, or politically correct for an MS-MVP, way of describing the situation. The functionality of the previous system was well known - though not apparently to those at MS who have responded to my feedback who couldn't grasp what
 I was trying to do. The designers of the new system either made a deliberate choice to leave thousands of users in a mess, or cocked it up</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a deliberate design choice, we should have been told well in advance and we could have prepared for it, either by using another technique that would remain valid, or leaving Outlook. More likely teh 'designers' and testers had no idea how the system
 was actually used by many users. Like teh Android app which doesn't support aliases though that was a key advertised feature for many people choosing Outlook/hotmail originally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many bugs/features I could have pointed out in 30 minutes of testing.</p>

            <p>HEY - I have thought of and tested &nbsp;a work around that really works! On the desktop anyway. Not Android mobile devices necessarily. If I sell it for $100 to each user who has this problem, I could retire. Oh, I did already. Well, I could go on vacation.
 But because I am a nice guy, here's what to do. Your thanks and appreciation will be all I ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part 1 - new messages for follow up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take the first new message that you want to flag, right mouse and select Categorise. Go to Manage Categories and add a new category such as 'Flagged'. Go to Options - Layout - Categories and check the new category to appear in the folder list and, in filters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your new message will remain in original folder but will appear in the folder list under Categories-Flagged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can just categorise any other messages into the new category</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part 2 - your existing flagged messages. Unfortunately, the new rules functionality is extremely limited and the separation into sweep and inbox rules mean we can'ct construct a sweep rule to do this automatically as far as I can see. Sweep rules only delete
 or archive. Inbox rules can't test flags. Go through each of your existing folders, in each one filter your flagged messages, select all and categorise as in part 1.</p>

            I am missing something. If there is no solution for new messages the workaround is only about gathering all
<strong>existing</strong>&nbsp;flagged into one category and even then the there is the tedious work of going one by one into each folder and categorize all the flags. &nbsp;I stopped using the desktop version until they will add the essential feature they omitted in
 favor of other "nice to have" features. As someone else here wrote, looks like the designers weren't even aware of the existing functionality otherwise they would have left the feature which is extremely easy programmatically as they have all other fancy search
 options.

            Part 1 &nbsp;is the solution for new messages, very easy after the first one. Part 2 is a one time action to bring your old messages into the solution. If you ever want to find your flagged messages again, you'd have to do that anyway, probably every day! Categorisation
 takes no time once the category is set up. Up to you. The comment about the designers is also one of mine! The mobile solutions are dreadful, much, much worse than the desktop, for my requirements anyway.

            So what you are saying that every message I would like to flag instead of marking it as Flagged I will categorize as Flagged which is a new category I opened for Flagged items. I guess that can be a workaround. Which means I stop using the flagged internal
 mechanism of outlook.

<p>Same problem.<br />
(almost)<br />
Replacing laptop. Installed new Skype at new one. Yes, I signed in the right account (confirmed that).<br />
Tried to import contacts - ended up with outlook contacts, which I NEVER use for Skype - NONE of them!<br />
Still have access to previous Skype (I reject update) at old/dying laptop, and still can see the old contact list (about 40-50 contacts). Old Skype offered to backup contacts to &lt;*.vcf&gt; file, which I did, but how can I import contacts from this file to my new
 Skype??</p>
<p><br />
I also tried on-line Skype - it has 15 y.o. contact list (or older? I barely remember those people!)<br />
Yes, there is an option to recontact everyone, but&nbsp;it's cruel making people to send contact requests every time to each and every contact again and again, proving every time that I AM ME!<br />
<br />
PLEASE SYNCHRONIZE CONTACT LISTS somehow!<br />
<br />
Or tell HOW we can transfer contact list from one computer to another, from old skype version to new one...&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not even talking about transferring it between different accounts (but I know some people need that too).<br />
<br />
Please do something!<br />
I did try all ldeas that I found online, offer some new please, that would actually work!</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you see your Outlook contacts, it's possible that you are logged in to Skype using your Microsoft account access, not your original Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that you are logging in to your old Skype account, click this link:
<em><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics Ctrl+Click or tap to follow the link"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics</span></a></em>&nbsp;and enter your email address. It will display
 Skype name/s under that email address. From there, you can identify which account is your old one and use it to sign in to Skype instead of using the email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the back-up you created, you can import it&nbsp;to the classic version of Skype, which you can get from our website @
<em><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a></em>
</p>
<p>

<h2>            IE 11 font size decreases after printing &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my browser from IE 10 to IE 11.&nbsp; When I print a webpage (IE 11), once the print set-up closes, the font size on my computer screen gets smaller. If I refresh the page, or go to another page (via favorite, different link, type in a new
 url&nbsp;address, etc), the font size returns to normal. The zoom level&nbsp;continues to show 125% (no change in the zoom level).&nbsp; My operating system is Windows 7 (64 bit) and I have two Canon laser printers connected to my computer.&nbsp; I have another computer&nbsp;(IE11,&nbsp;Windows
 7,&nbsp;64 bit)&nbsp;with a HP printer, and I experience the same font change after printing.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

<h2>            Japanese Character Support</h2>
                    Hi, I have a N78, firmware 21.002 and I sync it with my mac trough Nokia iSync plugin. Everything seems to work fine, except for that I have some contacts in my addressbook in Kanji and I want to keep them as they are. Obviously in the phone addressbook
 they look like a beautiful series of squares. Same thing for japanese blogs, sites, and songs. Sice nokia sells also in Japan is so difficult to add japanese support at least for reading (I'm not asking for an input method, but just for the ability to display
 chacters). Thanks for any reply

<p>Sincerly I didn't want to pay for something so simple...

 but didn't worked for me... I'd like nokia to provide an official support (expecially if adding japanese character support is simple ad described in that blog...) I don't&nbsp;think would be so much of effort to put an installer in pc suite...&nbsp;Or&nbsp;maybe there's&nbsp;some
 obscure commercial-economical reason&nbsp;for not doing something similar? Thanks for any answer&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Access 2007 linked to Sharepoint 2010 - Microsoft Access database engine could not find object &#34;SharePoint List Name&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Sharepoint site was just upgraded to 2010, from 2007. When I was in SP 2007, I had 3 lists (including one large list around 30,000 items) linked to Access, which I used to query the data.&nbsp; Since the upgrade, I am unable to query from the large list referenced
 above.&nbsp; I relinked all 3 lists, and the two smaller ones function as normal.&nbsp; However, the large one does not.&nbsp; It is linked, and I can view the table in Design View, but when I try to query the data (or view the table in Access), I get the "Microsoft Access
 database engine could not find object "SharePoint List Name" error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried everything that I can think of to resolve this issue.&nbsp; Does anyone else have any suggestions?&nbsp; Thank you very much for your time!</p>

<h3> jeffcitron  say:</h3>
<h2>            521 5.2.1 &#58;  AOL will not accept delivery of this message</h2>
                    When sending email to an AOL account through Outlook (any version) and through multiple email accounts going through our company email server, we get the error code 521 5.2.1 :&nbsp;&nbsp;AOL will not accept delivery of this message
<div><br />
</div>
<div>None of the accounts have "AOL" in their description and we have tried several ports for the outbound setting. When sending using Mac Mail on the same computer as outlook, or sending directly through our mail server interface, the email goes through to
 the AOL recipient. OUr mail server people say it is nothing to do with their system, but I question that at this point. It either has to be something caused by outlook or something on our server settings. Any thoughts?</div>

Except when you search for that as I have you end up at hundreds of threads like this that have no answers. The singular "solution" I've found so far after much searching is only applicable if you have the word "aol" in your sender name, which I do not. Therefore,
 there are no solutions I have found anywhere that apply. Add to that the fact that AOL's own SMTP error page does not list this error and you have a very frustrating situation with no solution.

<p>#3 - In short, this is an issue stemming from AOL servers and they are the ones that need to address it</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#4 - To repeat something I state here repeatedly - when dealing with problems, there are two components to any issue - "the symptom" (&lt;521 5.2.1" error from AOL&gt; in this case) and "the cause". Multiple causes can result in similar to virtually identical
 symptoms. Bottom line - error 521 is something that is being returned from a server to Outlook, it is not generated by Outlook by itself</p>

            I hate people like Karl.&nbsp; If you don't have something useful to add then just go away.&nbsp; Telling people to go Google their problem is such a douche response.<br />
<br />
I came this problem because I setup my NAS to send me emails when something goes wrong (like backup is full so it failed).&nbsp; I had setup my NAS to use my work email server to send email to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and it was from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />
<br />
At first it worked for YEARS.&nbsp; But then all of a sudden the emails stopped and I received these errors:<br />
<br />
mtain-dk01.r1000.mx.aol.com #521 5.2.1 : AOL will not accept delivery of this message. ##<br />
<br />
The solution for me was simple....change the emails to be To:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***....From:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
All in all though, this error comes up when the email in question looks too much like spam or your email server was flagged as a known spammer.<br />

            <p>So to recap for others reading this</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is your suggested solution&nbsp;for anyone encountering this problem&nbsp;"to simply change their email address" any time AOL decides they don't like it all of a sudden? (Not to mention that your solution&nbsp;applies to any email client in use). What you identified was
 a way to resolve the problem which does nothing to address the underlying "cause" which is AOL's system. Am fairly confident that most people would not consider having to change their email address because suddenly doesn't like it being&nbsp;a viable solution.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Which change exactly resulted in the resolution - changing the TO or the FROM (or did you use a completely different email domain for both from what getting rejected?)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When problems are presented that are not specifically Outlook related, people are pointed to other resources that may be more relevant. Your logic that simply because Outlook was used is tantamount to someone having computer hardware problems&nbsp;and since the
 computer uses electricity, the power company should be the first point of contact for&nbsp;answer(s)&nbsp;otherwise offense should be taken&nbsp;when directed a more appropriate resource for resolution.</p>

<p>Thanks for try ing to help.&nbsp; This is a new Lenovo desktop ThinkCenter that arrived last Sept but in December, the hard drive died and was replaced early January.&nbsp; I have added nothing to the system whatsoever except updates to Windows and Office.&nbsp; The setting
 for location is properly set.&nbsp; The only hardware change is that I have an external drive attached that I save all of my files on. otherwise, no changes at all.&nbsp; I am not sure when I first noticed it but I THINK right from the start.&nbsp; IF I search for something
 that deals with location, I ALWAYS get BING results in Louisville, KY.&nbsp; I only use BING.&nbsp; But after getting frustrated with this issue, I checked other search engines and only one noted the proper location but I do not remember which search engine it was.&nbsp;
 But BING, Google and nearly all the others except one show me in KY somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first became frustrated, I went to location in settings to insure it was proper.&nbsp; As far as I know, that is the only place in this system that tells where I am.&nbsp; In settings, Location is turned on</p>
<p>Location service is on</p>
<p>Default location is properly set at Nashville, Indiana 47448</p>
<p>I do not know what else to tell you or what else to do.&nbsp; Again, this is a DESKTOP so it NEVER moves!&nbsp; I am using Windows 10, Office 365.&nbsp; That is all I know to tell you.&nbsp; IF you need anything else specifically, just ask.&nbsp; I would surely like to get this
 corrected as it has become very frustrating.</p>

 11 font is displaying in huge letters when I compose or reply to an E-mail.&nbsp; How can I revert back to the smaller letters I am used to with Calibri 11?&nbsp; Much appreciated!

            Thank you for the information. Since the Stationeries and Fonts are set on the default styles and size, possible that a corrupted file affects the functionality of&nbsp; your Outlook 2016. We recommend that you
