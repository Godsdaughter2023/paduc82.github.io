<h2>            Word2007 Form - problem with Rich text content control</h2>
                    
<p>I'm reasonably savvy on the PC but am new to Word 2007 and perplexed! Thanks in advance for any help!</p>
<p>I'm creating a very simple form using mainly the Rich text content control. I am not bothering to protect the document, as it seems this is no longer necessary. I am making sure that I have turned off Design mode once I have finished building it. It all
 seems to look fine, but when I test the form myself, it sometimes works perfectly and at other times I can't seem to type freely. I can enter some text, but it won't allow an ENTER, for example, to create a new line. This can occur simultaneously in the one
 document (ie one field works, but the next doesn't). Closing the document without saving anything and then reopening, again changing nothing then trying again sometimes (but not always) fixes it. Or that field works but now a different one doesn't. I have
 not made any changes to the default Rich text content control (ie not trying to limit length or anything under properties).</p>
<p>I can't for the life of me work out what I am doing wrong. I don't think I am doing anything differently, but unless my PC is haunted, there must be something I haven't done quite right! Am I making any sense at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Deb</p>
<p>The only time I <em>know</em> I'm going to see the behavior you describe is when the content control is not the only thing in a paragraph. If for example, I have something like this:</p>
<p>Enter some text: [Content Control]</p>
<p>I know I will not be able to press ENTER in the content control. The way content controls (and other kinds of fields) in Word are designed, they can't break from within a paragraph to a new paragraph. If they're in their own paragraph, then they can contain
 muliple paragraphs.</p>
<p>Does this reflect what you're seeing? Is it possible, since the text around the content controls is not "locked", that at some point you've made an edit that puts the content control in a paragraph with other text? Or that you've designed your form like
 this, and in trying to make things work, you end up moving content controls into or out of paragraphs with other text (which is why things seem so inconsistent)?</p>
<p>What you mignt want to do, once you've got the form set up, is to select the entire document (Ctrl+A) or the section(s) with content controls,&nbsp;then insert a "Group" type of content control. You can then set up this to not allow editing. This will protect
 the text, but allow you to work in any content controls. And unlike forms protection you can continue to use formatting, graphics, etc.</p>

<h2>            Changing multiple numbers to subscript at once&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>I do freelance work and it requires me to use Microsoft Word 2007. I find myself spending a lot of time going through and changing numbers, one at a time, to superscript. Is there an easier way to do this, maybe using the find/replace tool?</p>
<p>A little more information, it is for chapters of a book. The reference numbers need to be made from just a regular number to superscript. The numbers in the text are normally sited like [reference number]. I am wondering if there is an easier way to change
 all of these at once, to increase the amount of time I spend on things for work that are actually important.

<h2>            Spellcheck issue in Word 2016</h2>
                    After the last update and the upgrade to Mojave, Word 2016 has the following problem: When running spellcheck, the content in the spellcheck "Not in Dictionary" box disappears after a couple of checks and is replaced by a uniform grey.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sheen is on the right track - installing updates should fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please go to the Word menu and choose About Word to display the version you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your version starts with 16.x then go to the Help menu in Word and chose Check for Updates to launch AutoUpdate app. Let AutoUpdate install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your version starts with 15.x then you have to download a new version of AutoUpdate, then run it to get the updates. Here's the link to get a newer version of AutoUpdate that will install your updates:</p>

<h2>            &#34;The Proxy server isn&#39;t responding&#34; on IE</h2>
                    I haven't been able to connect to Internet Explorer or Chrome for months now, but Firefox is working. When I try to connect to either, I get the error "The proxy server isn't responding". Changing the LAN settings does not work. Resetting or reinstalling
 the programs does not work. Restoring my system does not work. When I go to my computer's network settings and check for errors, it reads "the remote device or resource won't accept the connection". I have tried everything suggested on the forums, but nothing
 has yet worked. Can anyone give me a solution?

    <title>Contacts maximum amount - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> docipaq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts maximum amount</h2>
                    
<p>I have new Ipaq 614C with WM6 Pro. Its a great Pocket PC and I have been waiting on it since it was announced last September. Overall it is what I wanted (combine my phone and PDA (Ipaq 5450) and just have one unit)
 and its works well nippy processor office suite etc and the keyphone keypad which means i can use it as a phone.<br />
<br />
My problem is that on my Ipaq 5450 I have 3,700 contacts with programmes Pocket Informant along with Xcpu scalar, Sprite Backup and Pocket Mechanic. I never really had a problem with this setup apart from the usual hang but overall it worked well. Contacts
 were easy to get never slow unless rebooted.<br />
<br />
Now that I have the Ipaq 614C (faster processor 520Mhz compared with 400Mhz in the 5450) it sync's fine with my PC but when I try to use the phone on the 614 it hangs freezes or just acts really slow. It got to the point on the first day I had to uninstall
 all my programs and soft reset about 3 times starting again each time by reinstalling my software and syncing again. In the end I did a factory restart (software pre installed) which does a clean boot. And even after all of that I sent the unit back and got
 a replacement as I thought it was faulty.<br />
<br />
I now have the new device and I have decided not to sync my contacts (just using the ones in the sim) and have installed my programs and the unit works fine well no problems at all.<br />
<br />
This is not ideal however because I don't have my contacts. My contacts consist of Title, Name (First and last), Adress (3 lines), Tel and Postcode. I really need to have them to make this system work.<br />
<br />
Would anyone have an ideas how I can resolve this problem. I was under the impression that 3,700 contacts wouldn't be a problem with the processor etc. There was a day were the Device worked ok for me with my contacts so i think it will work but if I installed
 any extra software it caused me to reset and uninstall and re install...........I felt like throwing it&nbsp;against the wall.........

<p>The problem seems&nbsp;to be when I use the phone Dialler it stalls or freezes and takes its time to put the list together. When I used the Ipaq 5450 I had no issues whatosever with the amount of contacts. I was careful when choosing a new device
 to as I needed one with a good enough processor (nearly went for Atom Life at 624Mhz) for the amount of contacts I have. I also sync my diary from Outlook which has 300 Appointments (new and old).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I honestly didn't think this would be a problem on an uptodate pocket pc phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am going to take off the non essential programs and leave pocket informant and sprite back up only. And see how I get on.</p>

<p>Hi I've had a bit of time to look at this problem I have a bit further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you reply what I did was sync all contacts to the device then when done I pushed the call button. Initially it opens the phone book&nbsp;but then freezes and continues to stay frozen even if closed down and restarted basically you can do nothing
 with the phone but&nbsp;if closed down the&nbsp;pocket pc works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point after a few minutes I usually do a soft reboot then try again but in this instance I just left the device (I have the setting turned off for&nbsp;switching off the device&nbsp;after a few minutes) for 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that I cancel the phone book then start it again. What seems to be happening is that the phone is taking time to build a directory of the contacts. This seems to take around about 10-15 but after that the phone seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that is the problem it has to build a directory after restarting everytime and because there are so many contacts this can take a while. even as I type this I can go to the phone and scroll through all contacts and call someone with
 no delay at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This however&nbsp;causes a problem from the point of view I can't turn the phone off or have sprite backup do a backup as it will take quite a while to build up this directory again because it has to reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it be possible to speed up this process or put contacts into the ipaq file store so they will always be there to save this lengthy start up process?</p>

            You ask an interesting question Doc.&nbsp; I have looked for a while to see if there is anything out there but I have had no luck.&nbsp; I am going to send this up to a friend at MS to see if they know someone who might be able to assist.&nbsp; Clearly the issue is the
 number of contacts and I am not sure what they expected most folks&nbsp;would have stored on their devices.&nbsp; Lets see if I can get an answer....

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Are there any news on the problem? I have about 2600 contacts and trying to switch from NokiaE51 to Samsung i900 (winmobile 6.1), Nokia's search in Contacts responds almost immediately, but search in Windows Mobile is SO SLOW that it's totally unusable. The
 phone is just from the store, no 3rd soft installed, just synced with Exchange 2007.<br />
<br />
So, is there any solution yet?

            When you say that you "can't get them to come up on my device", is the original file that you set to sync still there?&nbsp; If so, when you edit the file, are you editing it from its original file location or from the folder that is created (probably on your
 desktop)&nbsp;when you set files to sync?

            Whhoooops,<br />
Silly me for assuming people know what I'm on about without giving all the facts!!!<br />
Basically I have a folder called customer records in my folder on my PC. When I see a new customer I create a new folder in ' customer records ' and add things to it like copies of quotes (word) &amp; email (html)&nbsp;etc. It seems that recently these new folders aren't
 being copied across to my XDA and now to make things worse some of the folders I know that had copied across aren't there also, only a few. So the folder on my PC ' documents on jimbos xda atmos ' has more content than the (supposed to be) mirrored image on
 my device.<br />
Any Ideas?<br />

Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
I USE THIS PHONE FOR WORK AND THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE WHOLE FOLDERS (I BELIEVE) IS TO SAVE THE FOLDERS ON THE SHARED FILE WHICH IS&nbsp;CALLED 'DOCUMENTS ON JAMIES XDA-ATMOS' ON MY PC. THESE FOLDERS HAVE VARIOUS FILES IN THEM (WORD DOCS, COPIES OF EMAILS) ON VAROUS
 CUSTOMERS AND THIS HAS SYNCED PERFECTLY UNTIL RECENTLY. NOW LESS THAN HALF ARE SYNCING AND THE REST HAVE DISAPPEARED OF MY XDA BUT ARE STILL SHOWING IN THE FILE ON MY PC!<br />
ANY IDEAS?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I'm not sure what is happening jimbolalala.&nbsp; One would think that if some are disappearing from your device then there has to be some change on the PC yet you indicated that they are on the PC.&nbsp; Speaking of that, I'm assuming when they disappear from your
 device, they cannot be seen in the "'DOCUMENTS ON JAMIES XDA-ATMOS' ON MY PC".&nbsp; So a question:&nbsp; When you edit a document, are you editing from that folder?<br />
<br />
I know for me, files that are important to me to sync I either manually copy them or use Live Mesh.&nbsp; If you have not used Live Mesh, check out&nbsp; this
<a href="http://pocketpccentral.net/help/tutorials/transfer_file_mesh.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">excellent tutorial</a>.&nbsp; To be honest, I no longer sync files via activesync&nbsp;and use Live mesh for virtually everything.<br />

<h2>            One Drive for Business Authentication Protocol Not Supported</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to setup OneDrive for Business to sync on my computer.&nbsp; If I go to the web view of OneDrive and click on the Sync button, the OneDrive for Business app loads, populates the URL and prompts me to login.&nbsp; I put my credentials in and click login,
 but nothing happens.&nbsp; I click cancel, and nothing happens, I have to close the dialog box with the X.&nbsp; I do not get any error messages</p>
<p><br />
If I run the OneDrive for Business app standalone and populate the URL manually and click the Sync Now button, I get the following error message:</p>
<p>"The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version of Office."</p>

<p>I have Windows 10 and Office 2016.&nbsp; The version of Microsoft for Business App is 16.0.4266.1003.</p>
<p>When I authenticate in Windows, I use a Microsoft account that is NOT the one that I am trying to use to connect to OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            That is the way the trial is designed. You cannot re-install the same trial bundle.&nbsp; BUT, you should be able to re-install one of the other 3 trial bundles.
<br />
<br />
If you absolutely have to have the same bundle, like the Pro trial, you would have to re-install Windows to wipe the hidden flag that gets left behind by the uninstall process.<br />

    <title>Linked&#47;embedded Excel chart objects distort in Word on different - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cheekypoppet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linked&#47;embedded Excel chart objects distort in Word on different PCs</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a Word report that has a lot of embedded/linked graphs from Excel in it (inserted using Paste Special/Link/Excel object) and we're having problems with these graphs distorting when different users access the report. The reports are generated
 automatically via an Access database (which I also developed) and up to 15 different reports are produced at a time (they are evaluations of training courses so they are all unique - hence the linked graphs).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All files are held on a Virtual PC on the company's server because the Excel graphs were not updating in the Word file (the report) when they were on the network, and would only update if they were on the c drive. I access this via a remote connection from
 home (I'm not based in the office, I'm just helping them out with this) and the other users also connect to it using a remote connection, but from within the network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had this problem of distorting before, but we thought the Virtual PC had fixed it as both myself and the main office user have been able to access and produce reports without the graphics distorting since we started using it. The problem reared its ugly
 head again when an additional user tried to produce reports from their machine in the office. It was fine when this new user was logged into the main user's machine, but distorted when she logged into the Virtual PC from her own machine to do it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it's obviously something native to the machine being used to access the Virtual PC that's causing the problem....and not the actual user account. The Virtual PC is running Win 7 enterprise, and Office 365. My machine is Win 10, both the office users'
 machines are Win 7. Myself and the main user have Office 365, but I'm not sure about the additional user - I can't see how that would make a difference though, given the reports are generated using the Virtual PC's Office installation (ie O365)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the course of the many hours I've spent searching for a solution to this problem, I did come across a suggestion the problem may be display/graphics card related so we've tested several other machines in the office this afternoon, some with the same graphics
 card as the machine that's working OK and others with at least one monitor on the same display resolution (but none actually identical). All the other machines tested distort the graphs on the report.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen the registry hack suggested for similar problems, but that's not something I'm permitted to do on the Virtual PC - and I read that it doesn't apply to Office 365 (which the Virtual PC has). I've also seen a suggestion that the graph could be
 put into fixed table cells to constrain their proportions, but this won't work for us - many of the graphs are custom graphs, made up of several different graphs put together, so this will only constrain the largest in these groups of graphs and the others
 can still distort. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone? I'm out of ideas as to what I can try next to fix this!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help or ideas you might be able to give me!</p>
<p>C</p>

<h2>            Outlook 7 &#34;Enter Network Password&#34; problem</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>I am using a new computer with Microsoft Office Professional 2007 in Windows 7 (Home Edition). My problem relates to Outlook 7.
 I can send but not receive any emails. I keep getting up the box “Enter Network Password”. I migrated all my files from XP, Office 2000 to Win &amp; Office 7 via easy transfer cable including Outlook pst file. I have rechecked my Outlook setting with my
</span><span>ISP</span><span> provider three times, had a tech guy look at my problem but he could not resolve it and reset my outlook user settings three times, all without success. The various web help sites recommend
 using registry entries for deleting passwords using <span>&nbsp;</span>Protected Storage System Provider. Two questions. Do I have to use this registry route or is their alternative, or can I just do a custom reinstall of a clean new Outlook (My Office
 2007 only allows two installations, so doing a reinstall will I use up the second copy option?)</span></span></p>
<span>I would very much appreciate any simply explained help to resolve this “Enter Network Password” problem which is stopping me from using Outlook now for the last 6 weeks</span>

            Thank you for your reply. Firstly I did do my research and easy cable transfer was recommended by two independant&nbsp;techie guys plus supported by various mags. I now know this advice was wrong, you cannot transfer XP settings to Window 7. Regards creating
 new mail profile; I have (as already said above) tried this tree times, the problem still persists. &nbsp;I know I have corrupt registry entry in Protected Storage System Provider (caused by the easy cable transfer process) but am reluctant to tamper with it. Would
 a custom reinstall of outlook 2007 resolve my registry problem by starting with a clean Outlook&nbsp; which by definition would overwrite the registry corruption or would the registry still retain the error. I need your advice, do I reinstall or work on the regisry
 fix as recommended by Microsoft Article 290684? I am very serious about this problem as it is causing me a lot of worry and some sleepless nights as I use this computer for my business.

<p>Thanks for the above advice. Of these two options in the above troubleshoot password prompt error; &nbsp;I have already tried before creating a new Outlook 2007 profile&nbsp;this did not work. I have now also tried the second option deleting "Protected Storage System
 Provider" in the registry again no luck. I still have the same problem. As a final option if I delete and reinstall Outlook 2007 would I start again with a fresh clean install&nbsp;and would it delete whatever mess my current Outlook&nbsp; 7 is in? I do not want to
 reinstall if Outlook if thier is the slightest chance of carrying over any of my current problems or leaving behind any thing which could jepardise the clean install. I need your advice urgently as I desperately need to get Outlook &nbsp;working as I need it for
 my business.</p>

            Hi Owen, I work as a network engineer for a company that outsources to several larger companies, and despite being 22 .. I've managed to build up some experience. Today, However. I stumbled upon the same sticky position you are in. A positive way of thinking
 .. At least you're not alone lol. Anyways i re-rolled a laptop to windows 7 professional. The way i backup a pc is really quite simple, copy and paste, no apps required for the data part but obviously ensure hidden folders are visible. An easy way to backup
 your outlook is just too remember 4 things .. .1: n2k file 2: .pst 3: any archives 4: and signature. All of this can be found under 'local' and 'roaming' &gt;&gt; appdata in your user profile. on exchange, this process is often more simpler. I use "produkey" to
 backup the keys, "dialupass" to backup vpn and dialup(if any) and internet connections passwords and info, as well as "driver genius" to backup the drivers. ok so that's easy enough, i get to the client where i now quickly have to setup a pop account on the
 newly installed office 2007 enterprise. haha yeah right .. I'm pretty sure all the information i have entered is correct, i did screen shot her details and the client is pretty sure her password is correct. So i went into focus mode and came to some directions
 of little hope, which is more or less how far you got. i got into the registry and attempted to delete the user defined password specific to that outlook data file you've created(it didn't allow me to delete that). i also clicked "edit" while that<span><span>Protected
 Storage System Provider</span></span> folder was highlighted, and set permissions to full on the user profile i was currently on, (it was not set as full control) but that still did not fix our problem. i deleted the outlook data file in control panel under
 mail, that did not work. I do not believe re-installing office will resolve your problem, so DON'T DO THAT. if that answers your question. I have to resolve this, so i will definitely help you if i find a solution, hang tight.

<p>Could you please check the birthday calendar was turned on in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a> (If you are using Office 365 mailbox)? If not, please turn on the birthday calendar, then we should see all Birthdays in Birthday Calendar. Here is an article for your reference:

<p><span>Hi Adham,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We should turn on the birthday calendar under
<strong>Your Calendars</strong> in our own Outlook Web App to see birthday calendar in Outlook Web App and Outlook. Here are the steps how to turn on the birthday calendar:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Login to
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Calendar at the left bottom</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right click
<strong>Your calendars</strong> then click <strong>Turn on the birthday calendar</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/361821ed-ddf1-4ee4-9653-872533232ad5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/361821ed-ddf1-4ee4-9653-872533232ad5" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then the birthday calendar should appear in Outlook Web App and Outlook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the steps above cannot solve the problem, please share the screenshots of what the calendar shows in OWA for our further investigaition.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Baron</span></p>

</p><p>I turned the Birthday Calendar on and I can see the Birthday Calendar on OWA and OA but I can't see my Birthday or the Birthdays of my colleges in the Company although they had already added their Birthday on their own accounts!<br />
I can see just one Birthday date that I added it on my Calendar!</p>
<p>How can I see all Birthdays of the Employees in the company without add all Birthdays manually to the Calendar for every account.</p>

<p>Hi Adham,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we know, just contacts’ birthdays (contacts show below) will appear on the Birthday calendar, we can add the users which birthday we want to see to contacts, then their birthdays will appear on the Birthday calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From my experience, after we add a contact, click Edit contact -&gt; add others, after adding birthday there, the birthday will automatically appear in Birthday calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know how and where do they add their own birthday date and how do they see Birthday in the calendar? Please share some screenshots.</p>

<p>This has been a problem for a long long time.&nbsp; Previously, though, after some serious spelunking in the Control Panel*, it was possible to correct the behavior.&nbsp; But that fix has now evidently been broken.</p>
<p>* you had to navigate to get down to a screen like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3698c4b-ec62-4fd0-a49f-150fe53b738c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3698c4b-ec62-4fd0-a49f-150fe53b738c" /></a></p>
<p>It used to be that one of the Ctrl + Shift radio buttons was clicked, so you changed it to Not Assigned.&nbsp; However, they both now start off as Not Assigned.What has always been odd is that in Excel, Ctrl + Shift + 9 always worked as it should.&nbsp; The problem
 has always been with Ctrl + Shift + 0 (zero).</p>

<h2>            Vertical Scrolling in Powerpoint 2013 does only work in some windows</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>in Powerpoint settings and menu vertical scrolling with my mouse wheel does work correctly (as in any other application)- in editing mode in powerpoint it does not react anymore. Also the zoom function CTRL+mouse wheel has no reaction.</p>
<p>I've tried also another mouse - same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any ideas? Very annoying...</p>

            <p>Hi Mohan,</p>
<p>it happened in all types of presentations, strangely in the main Window of Powerpoint. Strange that the mouse wheel reacted by klicking on it (as a mouse klick), but Scrolling was not possibile, only, for example, in the advanced Settings menue of the PowerPoint
 Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A first strange thing happened when I started the application in the admin mode -&nbsp;Scrolling was working for a few seconds, then stopped. The same thing when I plugged the mouse in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 8.1. machine was using a Standard Driver for the Standard Lenovo USB-mouse, which usually always worked. Installing a Standard Lenovo Driver solved the Problem, with both mice that i can try! So far Scrolling works even in PowerPoint. Obviously,
 the Win 8.1. Standard-Driver is not completely working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>
<p>Matthias</p>

            <p>Hi Mack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, not all Access Points work the same. Sometimes I can use an access point and it will work without any interaction on my part, other times a browser windows will open requiring me to login or accept some terms &amp; conditions, while other times
 I will have to open Internet Explorer myself and once I try to navigate somewhere, it will then take to a portal login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that, you can double-check with Vodaphone and ask for details on how their Access Points are supposed to work, and more specifically, how they work with a Lumia 620.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!<br />

 pocket pcs. i usually get stumped when i have to run a .exe file from my phone and get an error message saying that this is impossible. apparently ppcs can run .exe's by themselves. it would be nice to have a "COMPLETE" guide to installing one of these games
 on windows mobile six for a phone like myself. any help?

            Software written for touchscreen devices do not work on your device which is a non-touchscreen. Many developers write their applications for both versions of Windows Mobile and some do not. There is no emulator available that will let you use a software
 originally developed for touchscreens to work on your non touchscreen device. Check on the developers website for the correct version and if there is none, you might suggest that they create one.

</p><p><strong>Q. Where are the documents stored?<br />

<p>A special form of Exchange mailbox provides the physical embodiment of a group. The mailbox is used to store group content up to a maximum of 50GB, including posts, messages, and calendar entries. The mailbox is linked with a document library that is apparently
 created within OneDrive for Business but really is a document library in a SharePoint site with some special UI to make it seem like it’s OneDrive.</p>
<p><strong>Max storage is 1TB</strong>. The storage for Groups is not based on OneDrive for Business, but rather it is an associated SharePoint Online document library, which has the following characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Up to 1TB storage capacity</div>
</li><li>
<div>Ability to upload files up to 2GB in size</div>
</li><li>
<div>Uses the new usage-based storage model (space allocated as needed)</div>
</li><li>
<div>Groups storage WILL count to the used space in the tenant. Please check also the Recycle Bin of groups</div>
</li></ol>
</ol>
<p>The document library is intended to provide storage for any other type of content shared within the group.<br />
The properties of the group mailbox indicate to Exchange that its membership can be used for routing purposes.<br />
Mail sent to the group will be delivered to all members. As such, you can think of a Group as being like an Exchange distribution group with storage (the mailbox).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q. Are groups public or private?<br />
</strong><strong>A. </strong>Groups are either public or private.You select the group type when the group is first create and cannot (for now at least) change a group from public to private or vice versa afterwards. As the type implies, anyone can join a public

<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>This is not a bug!</strong><br />
There are two scenarios when it is desirable for non-members to be able to post to a private group.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>First</strong>, it might be a good thing for non-members to make a contribution to a group that’s used for problem reporting. In this scenario, the actual members of the group are responsible for processing problems but anyone
 should be able to contribute.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Second</strong>, it might be a good thing for a group member to invite external parties to contribute to a conversation, perhaps to provide feedback to a project plan or a similar discussion. They can do this by asking the
 non-member to send email to the group.</p>

</p><p><strong>Q. Is there a way to archive a group?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>To preserve the content on an Office 365 group SharePoint site or OneDrive for Business site, create a preservation policy in the Security and Compliance Center. To place an Office 365 group mailbox on hold, create an In-Place Hold in the Exchange
 admin center. Source: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Learn-about-Office-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p><strong>Q. Is it possible (and if so, how) to share a document &nbsp;in a group to external users?<br />
A. </strong>Yes, you can use PowerShell to individually allow external sharing of the SPO group created site (Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/site1 -SharingCapability
<strong>ExternalUserSharingOnly</strong>) or simply globally allow groups to have the option enabled&nbsp;by default once the group is created.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">On the&nbsp;</span><strong>Office

</p><p><strong>Q. In my tenant some user are seeing ‘Discover’ option under Groups &amp; some are seeing ‘Browse’. I have checked o different browsers but the same thing is happening. Do you know why that is happening? Is there any way that I can hide an Office 365
 group for certain set of users. As whomsoever clicks on browse or discover sees all the groups in OWA. I want to hide the private group for my students in the OWA.<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>We’re rolling out the discover feature – which replaces “browse”. In either case, users can see all groups (private or public), though they cannot see content in groups they aren’t members of. If you want to hide a group from the GAL, you can use
 powershell, but this won’t hide the group in other workloads (e.g. SharePoint). We’re working on “secret” groups to resolve this issue in the future, but I don’t have a date to share.&nbsp;More information:

</p><p><strong>Q. Is there a method to allow non-members to view the calendar of a public Office 365 group via Outlook 2016? I can see that this definitely works via OWA, but am unable to find a way to do it in Outlook?<br />
</strong><span><strong>A.</strong></span>If a group is public, a user can navigate to the group’s calendar in OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Q. <span>Is there any way to export the calendar in a group?&nbsp;</span><span>I want to delete a group but keep the calendar</span><br />
A.</strong></span>Not directly. You can search your own calendar for the items that were sent to a given group and act on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Q. Is there an iOS app currently that performs the ability to sync Office 365 groups files?<br />
A.</strong>You can use your in your iOS device the sites button in the OneDrive app to browse into a group and take the file offline using the parachute app.</span></p>
