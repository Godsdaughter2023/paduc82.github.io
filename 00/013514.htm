<h2>            Reconnect Outlook 2016&#47;Outlook 2013 to Outlook.com to resume email access  - tried all of the options with online help</h2>
                    <p>I have two hotmail email accounts and a business company account on outlook2013 on my PC. The business account got changed to an office365 account today and my two hotmail accounts disappeared. I re-added the two hotmail accounts to outlook2013 and I get
 an email titled 'Reconnect Outlook 2016/2013 to Outlook.com to resume email access'. I have done both options for doing this reconnect by creating new outlook profiles, deleting and re-adding the two accounts to outlook2013, etc. Everytime I do that, I still
 get the same email and my emails from outlook.com are not synced with the accounts in outlook 2013, but the folder structure is all there. All folders are empty with no emails on them. Trying going through possible avenues with outlook help and office help
 and microsoft help but no joy. What do I need to do to get my email to sync again between outlook.com and outlook2013??? Please help!<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Forwarding Emails from my personal account to outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my personal email account, which happens to be my MS account Id as well.</p>
<p>Two years now I am forwarding all my emails to an outlook alias that i have in order to receive my emails from the outlook.com interface.</p>
<p>Yesterday I received an email from my provider, that microsoft might block their server due to a high number of emails received from my email account, they are not more than ten per day on average.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My provider suggested to use the pop protocol instead, but this is not an acceptable solution for me, because i will receive my emails every thirty minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another alternative that they gave me, is to go for an office 365 for business in order to use this as my mail server attached to my domain name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas to my situation?</p>

<p>It&nbsp;is possible to use the pop protocol where the account to be added is already the primary alias.</p>

            <p>I know that I can use the pop. I have already try it. But as I mentioned, this is not helpful for me. The reason is simple that outlook.com will pol my server every 30 minutes for new emails. So I will not receive the emails the moment they arrive.</p>
<p>I am more interested in an IMAP solution.</p>

<p>The only thing that it does is to import once all your emails from the other account.</p>
<p>As Microsoft says in this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/yahoo-imap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>the second step is to automatically forward your emails to your outlook account.</p>

<h3> kenanderson78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help for editing stored autocomplete name-password associations in IE8</h2>
                    
<p>When I log onto a website that requires&nbsp;a name and password, I type the first few letters of the name and IE quickly provides a drop down menu with the appropriate name and, upon selecting the required name, IE then fills in the password which it has has
 conveniently saved.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it also shows other names, including typos and errors in entry.&nbsp; I'd like to clean up my&nbsp;saved names and their associated passwords.&nbsp; Is there a way to edit these without removing all of them by deleting all my&nbsp;passwords
 (using IE Internet Options)?&nbsp; Also, it would be very convenient to access this information as a means of backing up/writing down all&nbsp;those stored passwords.&nbsp; Please advise. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&lt;Split from this thread&gt;</p>
<p>I'm having this same issue. Fresh install of Office 2016 on Windows 7 here, get the same pop-up. Also another case, a fresh install of Office 2016 on a fresh install of Windows 10 - again the same. I haven't tried the above workaround on the 10 machine yet,
 but on this 7 one it did get me further - when clicking "sync now", instead of getting the pop up, it asked me to provide credentials. I did this, it then asked me again, and then a third time - and then the pop up came back.</p>
<p>If I click the sync button in the browser app, and choose "get the onedrive for business app that's right for me", it offers me an app for Sharepoint 2013</p>
<p>I agree with Thomas's earlier appraisal of the situation that this is a fundamental incompatibility between OneDrive 2016 and Sharepoint 2013</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>Currently we have received several reports regarding the issue when syncing with OneDrive for Business 2016. The issue has been escalated to the related team for further investigation. Please refer to the second suggestions Daizy provided in the thread below
 and let us know the results:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/426299 .</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I would like to collect the OneDrive for Business logs and the tenant information for our further investigation. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the information. You could check and respond to
 it via the steps below: https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations .</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Shirley</p>

<p>I've got this sorted now - I have the same email address for my Microsoft account and for my Office 365 account, but with different passwords. The above workaround did work, but then when being prompted to log in, when being asked what kind of account I
 was using, I was choosing the first option "Microsoft account for OneDrive, Outlook, etc". So of course that login was not working for ODFB, and eventually the pop-up would return. This also means that when I had signed out of Word and signed back in as per
 the workaround, I had done so with my Microsoft account as well. </p>
<p>Going back through the procedure and signing in using the second option "work account" for the account choice, meant that my Office 365 account was being used, so I'm now signed in on that with Word, and then doing the same when setting up OneDrive resulted
 in a successful sync.</p>
<p>Some feedback here: I was choosing the first choice for the account type because it clearly lists Microsoft services, including Outlook which is a part of Office, whereas the second choice simply says "sign in with the account provided by your work, school
 or university". I don't have an account provided by any of those - I run a small IT business, and I created and administer the Office 365 setup myself. To be honest, the first thing I thought of when I saw that was "we're not on a domain so that's nothing
 to do with us". Had this choice actually mentioned "Office 365" in the description, I could have saved myself an entire day of troubleshooting this. It's very unclear.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Express emits SYN, gets no SYN-ACK back but telnet works fine</h2>
                    
<p>I Use Wireshark to monitor the network traffic while Outlook Express tries to send a mail.</p>
<p>OE (or the kernel, if you like) emits TCP "SYN" datagrams to establish a connection to the server. The IP address is correct, see below.</p>
<p>There are three such SYN packets before OE gives up,</p>
<p>Then I run "telnet &nbsp;smtp.online.no 25" in a command window. This produces a fourth SYN packet and immediately (just a few milliseconds) a response "SYN-ACK" packet. In the telnet window the server's greeting appears. I type QUIT and the connection finishes
 normally.</p>
<p>Then I click the "Send and Receive" button in OE again, and this time OE gets the connection and sends the mail and all is as it should. But this pattern has repeated some 6-7 times in the course of the last few days. Yesterday I got the error box in OE,
 went upstairs to my Linux box and issued the telnet command and got the greeting banner message right away. Back downstairs I clicked Send and Receive again, but again it failed. I went back up and tried telnet again, and the response was immediate. Back at
 the XP and OE I clicked Send and Receive for the third time, and it failed. Then I figured out how to run telnet on the XP (I tried in a cygwin window, but that did not work), and as soon as I had had a telnet session (on the smtp port) with the server, then
 OE did work flawlessly.</p>
<p>The two computers are on a home network with a single shared external IP address, so the server outside should not see any difference. Yet it seems like the server refuses to answer only if OE is the originator of the connection, and only if I have not had
 any recent telnet connection from the same computer.</p>
<p>Any ideas what could cause this?</p>

    <title>Word 2011 Freezes, sluggish re-pagination - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tcornell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2011 Freezes, sluggish re-pagination</h2>
                    <p>In the compilation of two large genealogies (currently around 900 pages), I constantly run into Word 2011 hanging. &nbsp;Most generally, it occurs when I copy and paste material within the document. &nbsp;By watching Activity Monitor (AM), I see memory use ramp up
 to 100% and remain there. &nbsp;AM also says the software has become unresponsive. &nbsp;The only alternative is to Force-Quit Word and lose any changes I neglected to save or were not protected by auto-save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you highlight some text and execute Copy, AM will show a rise in memory use. &nbsp;If you sit on your hands and finally see a sufficient downward trend, you can usually Paste the text without a hangup. &nbsp;It may, however, take ten or 20 seconds, and you can
 see how this will slow your work flow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is something I can't recall ever encountering with Word 2008, but to be truthful these documents have grown since I used it. &nbsp;It is clear that size is definitely a factor. &nbsp;Also, my documents are sprinkled liberally with index entries (codes). &nbsp;Anyone
 who has used or written a genealogy knows that every name in it needs to show up in the name index. &nbsp;That doesn't mean every name on every page must have a hidden text code, but I think you get the picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Index entries are also implicated in my second complaint, namely Word's incessant and slow repagination. &nbsp;Compared to Word 5.1a, you would say that Word has OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder). &nbsp;It jumps at every opportunity to renumber its pages. &nbsp;In Word
 5.1a, repagination could be turned off and would only really be needed if you wanted to use layout view or print preview. &nbsp;Now, it's hard to say what triggers it or why it's even needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of its speed, it's also quite aggravating. &nbsp;Index codes definitely are a factor, and it's not readily apparent why. &nbsp;So, I did some comparisons using one of my genealogies. &nbsp;Turning on and off hidden text disrupts pagination (but really shouldn't
 need to), and I started doing that on Page 1. &nbsp;Then, I quickly executed a Go To Page 300 command and timed the software. &nbsp;On my original MacPro 1,1 (dual 2.66 GHz CPUs, 4 cores, 2006), the time was 41 seconds. &nbsp;I also had access to two newer MacPros (dual
 3 GHz dual CPUs). &nbsp;These were 2,1 (2007) and 3,1 (2008), and their repagination time was in the 10-15 second range. &nbsp;Now, I have a 4,1 (dual 2.26 GHz CPU, 8 cores, 2009), and its time is 15 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the precursor of this same document and Word 5.1a, repagination went so fast I could not time it accurately. &nbsp;The same was also true when I ran the test on an old PC laptop (800 MHz, Win 2000) and my son's Win 7 machine and whatever version of Word
 he had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something is radically wrong with this picture, and I have other problems involving failures of the Find function and garbling of the Search and Replace sidebar when I open it. &nbsp;Surely others are encountering these, too.</p>

<h2>            Tasks with no Start and Due dates disappear from My Day</h2>
                    Each day, all my tasks disappear from My Day. All of my tasks have no start date and no due date. When I first create them, they appear in My Day. But then the next day they disappear. I can make them re-appear by editing the task and assigning a start
 and due date and saving them, then editing them again and removing the start and due dates. But then, they disappear again the next day.

            Do I understand you correctly that I should attempt the steps in the linked KB article only if I am NOT on an Exchange server? I am on an Exchange server.
<div><br />
<div>Also, I may be wrong but I don't have a sense that the problem is like the problems described in the KB article.&nbsp;There does not seems to be any missing or corrupted data.&nbsp;The tasks are correct in the Tasks window in Outlook. The only problem is that the
 tasks disappear from the My Day window the next day after they are created. I have tried this with several tasks and the pattern is always the same: the task disappears the next day.</div>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were you able to download earlier on this computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes before this issue started?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you using Internet Explorer browser to download?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While downloading the file, try to change the location to save the file on your desktop and check if the files are downloaded
 to the desktop successfully. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Internet Explorer I would suggest you to Optimize Internet Explorer on your computer and check if it helps you
 fix the download issue. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to temporarily disable security software from the computer and check if you can download successfully.
 If you are able to download, you may contact the security software Manufacturer and check if you need to change any settings. Later re-enable the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Post back and let us know the result.</span></p>

<h2>            Comments&#47;Feedback on build 10536</h2>
                    <p>I just installed the latest build on my Lumia 920 and I am not impressed, the most basic things are just poorly implemented. With speed being the worst.. Also had to do a hard reset after the upgrade, because WIFI would not work..</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Overall, my phone feels&nbsp;sluggish (as in unacceptable). Especially swiping from the top to show settings, almost unresponsive.. takes several seconds</li><li>Email, way way way to slow. With Denim I click a tile and the email is pretty much there. with this one, it starts the app and then it flashes a few times before something is shown. Especially if I was reading a other email account.</li><li>Cortana, not near a quick as Denim..</li><li>Dealing with multiple email&nbsp;accounts is poor(at best). I pinned seperate accounts to the Start screen, then when selecting 1, things go as describe above, then selecting the other account; first the previous mail account shows before it is refreshed with
 the account I actually like to take a look at. ALso, on pinning the different accounts to the start screen, this is not intuitive and needs to be made easier to access..</li><li>To me, email for multiple accounts was much better and faster in Denim..</li><li>We MUST be able to change the font size for the start screen. I can barely see what account I am selecting or reading calender items in the live tiles is just to hard.. Font options please!!!</li><li>Also, I was downloading some maps to the phone and when it pauses (if you go of the WIFI), I get several alerts (4 or 5) about the download begin paused. Then I dismiss it and get more alerts.. and this keep repeating..</li><li>I downloaded my old Denim settings&nbsp;and noticed the HERE apps are gone, but there are still dark tiles on the start screen. Since these apps are no longer available for 10 mobile, It would be better if the are&nbsp;removed automatically.</li><li>On the same subject, the back-up did bring all email accounts over in their own tile,

    <title>Cortana for Android disabling phone&#39;s microphone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cortana for Android disabling phone&#39;s microphone</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I find Cortana to be a helpful application on my Android phone, especially its ability to send notifications on my phone to my computers, but I recently had to delete it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>It appears that Cortana was frequently taking control of my phone's microphone and not letting go of it, causing microphone-related features in other apps to not function properly. Sometimes the microphone would not work at all. Other times it would start
 working but suddenly stop working in the middle of speech. Other times still, the microphone would pick up my voice but convert it to incorrect text.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I was able to temporarily fix this by turning my phone all the way off and turning it back on again--restarting the phone didn't work--but a temporary fix is not good enough when I need to use my phone's
 microphone immediately.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>
</p><p>I do hope that this issue is fixed soon. Cortana's ability to send notifications on my phone to my computers is quite the convenience, but as long as it is apparently disabling my phone's microphone, I will have to do without this convenience, and Cortana
 as a whole on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">This phone is a Sony Xperia XZ Premium (United States dual SIM model) running Android 7.1.1 with the July 1, 2017 security patch (Build Number 45.0.A.7.90).<br />

I have a spreadsheet in which I use inserted page breaks. &nbsp;When I print the spreadsheet in its entirety, it<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>prints</span></span></a>

If I print selected pages (i.e., 5 through 9) it prints fine.<br />
<br />
If I highlight a number of rows and columns that cross over these inserted page breaks, and select Print  selection, it does not print correctly. &nbsp;It will break the text at odd places, and drop large sections entirely.<br />

<h2>            Tell me why I bought a HTC HD7</h2>
                    
<p>My old Nokia N95 died so I went for an iphone but developed a hatred for itunes. Then theWindows 7 arrives and I thought get the HTC.</p>
<p>What do I think of Windows 7 - Give me back my iphone.</p>
<p>Windows 7 -____, ____, ____.</p>
<p>No file Manager</p>
<p>No way of running a Sat Nav such as Co pilot or Tom Tom</p>
<p>Cannot save&nbsp; documents attached to emails</p>
<p>Cannot sync with outlook on my PC have to go through web which my email account&nbsp;does not.</p>
<p>In a nutshell my old N95 gave me more customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Microsoft - You have forgotten the most important thing of all - What the customer wants!!!!!</p>
<p>So what I have got now - A mobile that makes calls, txt and emails. Can go on&nbsp;the internet, oh and listen to music and take photos.&nbsp; Answer = everything that almost every other phone does.</p>
<p>Such Hype such disappointment</p>
<p>Satisfaction level= 2/10</p>
<p>Ripped off value = 9/10</p>
<p>Phone value = £50</p>
<p>Recommendation level= 1/10</p>
<p>Recommendation = Get the iPhone 4 you can do more with it.</p>
<p>Finally - Zune</p>
<p>Double ____-bringback active syn</p>
<p>Zune vs iTunes=no contest&nbsp; - Same advice buy an iPhone.</p>

<p><br />
Because of the design of Windows Phone, File Manager will NOT be included the way it was before in previous Windows Mobile devices.
</p>
<p>Ringtones will be amongst the 500+ features that will be added in the Mango release coming this Fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voice search works well for me so maybe you can outline what you are doing so maybe we can see what is happening to you? This video (which is old) gives a good explanation of how to use the Voice Search.&nbsp; See if it helps.</p>

<h3> oherb40  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can wallpaper be omitted from &#34;Show side-by-side&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>Since the earliest preview release until the present release build 10586. 104, Win 10 has, unlike all previous releases of Windows, shown the wallpaper along with the windows&nbsp;containing meaningful content when the&nbsp;"Show side-by-side?" option is invoked
 after right-clicking the taskbar. That means that if you're viewing 2 windows with meaningful content, you get at most two-thirds of the screen for them. In recent releases, that proportion has dropped to one-third, with the two windows stacked one on top
 of the other, taking up about one-third of the screen <em>in toto</em>. Of course, you can stretch the windows up, down, right &amp; left to give each roughly half the screen, but unless you're hyper-careful, one of the windows expands to full screen, and it's
 back to square one. Isn't using&nbsp;a computer enough of a hassle without this "improvement" introduced for the first time in Win 10?&nbsp;</li></ul>

 back to square one. Isn't using&nbsp;a computer enough of a hassle without this "improvement" introduced for the first time in Win 10?&nbsp;</li></ul>

            <p>In the screengrab shown in the previous message, you can see how two separate instantiations of File Explorer typically come up after "Show side-by-side" is selected. That's about the only use I make of "Show side-by-side" as neither outlook.com nor Word
 seems to work with it. In another case, I was unable to split the screen between an email being composed in outlook.com and an HTM file opened from another email. One or the other just went dormant, leaving the other alone on the screen. (That was after I
 had manually&nbsp;resized the windows&nbsp;from the default shown in the previous message until they divided the screen roughly in half.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you don't mind if I comment on the procedure you recommend for uploading screengrabs. On my 10" (diag.) tablet screen, the icons are almost indistinguishable. I'm surprised MS hasn't retained the "hover" feature which textually identifies icons in
 previous Windows releases or, alternatively,&nbsp;adopted a feature like that on my Android phone which enlarges an icon when your finger gets close to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the bottom line is I'm very glad my wife's employer strongly advises&nbsp;avoiding Win&nbsp;10&nbsp;in favor of&nbsp;8.1 with a 3rd party&nbsp;add-on which preserve the superior UI on Win 7 -- superior for any serious professional use, that is. Even a former MS employee
 like myself is constantly struggling to get anything done with Win 10. What happened to making releases that were really stable,&nbsp;doing monthly security fixes via the web, and doing a stable Service Pack each year or so until a new stable version&nbsp;was fit&nbsp;be
 released to manufacturing. That's the formula that's kept MS flourishing counter to the dire predictions of some of America's foremost business experts, e.g. Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School. I say, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Personally,
 I'm seriously considering reverting to 8.1 (luckily, I own a set of installation media) and upgrading to Win 10 only after Win 11 is released.</p>

            Obviously that means there are many&nbsp;Win 10 features that I like very much and that I would give up reluctantly only&nbsp;due to&nbsp;to&nbsp;insurmountable problems achieving the same productivity with Win 10 as with Win 8.1 plus the Start8 UI.

            <p>It seems to me that's even worse as you'd need to manually move the windows a bit to the&nbsp;left as well as all the way to the right, and even then&nbsp;you'd have the windows stacked 'instead of side by side. The only explanation I can think of why MS missed out
 on this&nbsp;situation where you buy a 17" or 21" monitor to put several documents or images&nbsp;side by side for comparison is that MS gives everyone 3 or 4 monitors on their desks at the office and they're&nbsp;too busy playing&nbsp;Grand Theft Auto V at home (maybe on Win
 7, 8.1 or even on a Mac assuming Rockstar supports that) to notice **** they've not gotten around to fixing in Win 10.</p>

            <p>The easiest away to get two windows&nbsp;side by side is:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the two windows you want side by side.</li><li>Drag one of these to one side by its titlebar using a&nbsp;mouse, touchpad or finger. Once it reaches the snap zone it will show a ghost window of where it will fit.&nbsp;(aim for the middle of that side or it will snap to a quarter screen on each corner&nbsp;instead
 of a half screen on each side)</li><li>Once the ghost window appears lift your&nbsp;finger off the mouse, touchpad or screen&nbsp;and on the other side Win10&nbsp;allows you to pick which one you want on the other half of the window.</li><li>click/touch the one you want and both windows will take up half the screen each fully to each edge and down the centre.</li></ol>
<p>I was not aware of the problem you found because the above is so very much better than the right click on the taskbar and choose either&nbsp;show windows stacked or&nbsp;show windows side by side. However,&nbsp;how these&nbsp;two options work does not&nbsp;make sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An improvement to the snap could be that there is currently no way to use snap to give two windows stacked. Drag the title bar to the top of the screen and it offers full screen. If you drag it to the bottom of the screen you get nothing - perhaps dragging
 to the bottom of the screen&nbsp;could give you a window&nbsp;on the botton half and offer you the choice of which window to be displayed on the top half.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the above method with Word I get :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c7f77a0-35a8-4d92-a1ab-5f2db4bcc462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c7f77a0-35a8-4d92-a1ab-5f2db4bcc462" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>which is next to useless - Stacked will give me full access to my ribbon and allow me to use the navigation pane and see the document. Obviously this is less of a problem on a large screen what about the tablets and laptops?</p>

            <p>Thanks for explaining how to use snap to replace side-by-side. Very cool, and a godsend for editing documents! I still greatly miss the stacking option, especially for programming. After trying a few times to reconcile 2 or 3 versions of code by stacking
 windows on Win 10 (a very frustrating process as you hint above), I've simply reverted to 8.1 on my main programming machine, though so far without reinstalling the "Start-8" front-end with the handy Win 7 Start Menu feature of listing (and making it possible
 to load) the last 10 or so files you&nbsp;entered in your code editor, PDFs you read in Adobe Acrobat, documents you edited in Word, spreadsheets you&nbsp;made in Excel, etc., etc.:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I agree, too, that&nbsp;it would be nice if MS got the side-by-side and stacking options working even if it means returning to the unaesthetic process of right-clicking the taskbar. And tablets are a big problem as I can testify since I'm writing this on one.</p>

 I'll click your reply "Mark as Answer" as soon as I initiate the 2 new threads and write a final entry giving the URLs of the new threads.</p>

 certain programming languages. Unfortunately I'm somewhat over the hill age-wise &amp; grew up in an era when the now-acceptable (on prime-time TV, anyhow) expressions "damn," "****," "sweat,"&nbsp;"****" &amp; even "Shut up!" were not tolerated at the family dinner table.
 So I hope you'll understand my confusion about proper usage in the Microsoft Community.</p>

    <title>Entourage Would Not Open Due to Following Prompt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbiddymon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Entourage Would Not Open Due to Following Prompt</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p><span>On my wife's iMac.&nbsp; "You can't open the application "Microsoft Entourage" because PowerPC applications are no longer supported."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The iMac Processor is 2.4 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, Memory 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running OS X 10.9.2 (Mavericks).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2011 has Outlook, which she uses for a small business.&nbsp; However, she prefers Entourage (Office 2008) for her personal email.&nbsp; Her Entourage personal mail constitutes about 99% of her total email usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Disk Utility to Repair Disk Permissions and was then able to open Entourage.&nbsp; However, Entourage opened as a new email application with all previous data deleted.&nbsp; I then created a new account, which is identical to her former Main Identity through
 Comcast, thinking that it would pick up all of the data from her previous Main Identity.&nbsp; Such thought process was obviously wrong.&nbsp; Her old Entourage account contained a large number of folders that are critical to her use of email and file system.&nbsp; I then
 went to the backup disk, downloaded the prior Main Identity and transferred that to User &gt; Documents &gt; Microsoft User Data.&nbsp; However, that did not transfer the folders, but rather started from just the current email Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She then contacted Microsoft Tech Support.&nbsp; The technician did not speak English very well and did not know of Entourage.&nbsp; She informed the tech that it was a Microsoft product.&nbsp; My wife was on the phone for two hours, paid $98.00 for the advice and now
 has her old Entourage data in Outlook, but it has combined both the business account and the personal account in the same Inbox.&nbsp; The Microsoft tech also added two new accounts into Tools: (1) Bigfoot, LDAP Server Idap.bigfoot.com and (2) four11, Ldap server
 idap.four11.com.&nbsp; Does anyone know what Bigfoot and four11 are?&nbsp; What would happen if we deleted those as accounts in Outlook?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to assist with this situation and would like to import the former Main Identity into Entourage from the backup drive that contains all of the folder data, etc., but am befuddled as Entourage is not cooperating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I run Outlook on a new MacBook Pro and Entourage on an older iMac (which has OS X 10.6.8).&nbsp; So are the problems that her computer is having a Mavericks Issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or ideas, instructions or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Syncing Lumia 950 to Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a lumina 950 and have tried unsuccessfully to sync the phone with my windows 10 PC particularly the calendar events. After repeated attemps I contacted a microsoft online tech support service and was told this feature has been disabled
 by microsoft and that an update will be available at some future date. Has anyone else experienced the same issue and has had success in having the calendar events automatically updated on the 950 and windows 10 PC ?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>How you do this depends on the accounts on both devices and what you want to have on the PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the PC you may have Office 365 with Outlook and it's calendar&nbsp;or the built in calendar in Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please describe which you want to view phone calendar events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make sure, what type of accounts you have on each device. Don't try to give full email addresses here. They will be blocked.&nbsp; Just give the domain name, like an outlook.com, &nbsp;live.com , Hotmail.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>The devices are capable of doing this. The accounts ahd where you want to see the phone calendar on the PC</p>

            Hi Thanks for your response, my PC is running the standard windows 10 without office 365. The lumina 950 has the standard lumina windows 10 operating system supplied with the phone. So calendars on the PC and the phone are the standard versions supplied.

                    <p>I have changed my Gmail password&nbsp;and am not able to change this in Outlook on my laptop (on my iPhone no problem!)</p>
<p>I cannot send or received any mail and keep receiving this notification:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to change password under Repair and Change but it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have checked under Data Files in Settings but there is no field enabling me to change password (may have to do with IMAP?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a second option I thought&nbsp;to remove the account from Outlook on my laptop and thereafter add same account as new account.</p>
<p>But them I am worried that I will loose all my file folders.</p>
<p>Can someone possibly give me advice on this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Dear friend<br />The second option is good, but you have take the backup of data file by copying it to another location, and then add the account again and attach the same file.<br /><br />Regarda

<p>Dear Ahmed Raza_Khan</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I have removed my Account from Outlook and started to add Account with the same address.</p>
<p>Now I receive a notification "The connection to incoming (IMAP) server was dropped.</p>
<p>I have googled and found that this may have happened because of too many login attempts.</p>
<p>Now I have to find out how I can have this incoming (IMAP) server reinstated, do you possibly have a response?</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Annemarie</p>

<p>Dear Ron</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook now works on my laptop, thank you!!</p>
<p>However, I am still puzzled why one day ago, when not enabled, I could use Outlook on my laptop without a problem. My iPhone e-mail always worked.</p>
<p>After changing the settings I am a bit worried about security of my mail now....</p>

<h2>            accessing emails</h2>
                    When I scroll down my emails, the cursor jumps back to the top.&nbsp; The result is that I can only open the first few emails .&nbsp; This started with the recent change in outlook.

            Is this for outlook in the browser? Try clearing your cache and cookies  or a different browser.
