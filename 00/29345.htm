<h2>            Windows 10 freezing spinning dots on reboot</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I know this question has been asked before but I was not able to fix it and being desperate and in need of a proper computer I'm asking for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restart my Windows 10 it freezes (starting it after a shutdown is not a problem) the spinning dots freeze and ... that's it. Only a force shutdown is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I've tried:</strong></p>
<p>clean install on previously formatted, rather new harddrive (about 3 months old SSD from Samsung).</p>
<p>disabling fast startup</p>
<p>stop wuausrv via cmd, rename SoftwareDistribution, restart wuausrv</p>
<p>unplug all unnecessary hardware (everything except mouse and keyboard)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>
<p>Adorak</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in
<strong>Safe mode with networking</strong> and check if similar issue persists on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers
 necessary to run Windows. The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using. Logging into
<strong>Safe mode</strong> will help in diagnosing if the issue is caused due to the corrupted user profile or the services disabled on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select appropriate options to boot the computer into
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Safe Mode</span></span></strong></a><span>.
<strong>Reboot</strong> the computer to exit from <strong>Safe mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about
<strong>Safe mode, </strong>refer to the article on </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Windows Startup

<p>
</p><p>Did what is stated in your post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>booted into Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Entered password into user after it booted into Safe Mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still have endless spinning dots on the login for Safe Mode , and will not login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what does this mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted user profile or due to certain services on the PC? how would I figure out which?</p>
<p>

            <p>Some time ago, one user reported that they solved this problem by opening a Command prompt then deleting the dodgy folder using the Del command.</p>
<p>Command prompt is in your All programs, Accessories folder.&nbsp; Open it then go to the Desktop.</p>
<p>You can see the syntax for the Del command by typing in </p>
<p>Del /?</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Del /? &gt;DelSyntax.txt [which will put the text file of the syntax onto the current folder]</p>
<p>- - - - - -</p>
<p>I don't know why this should work but it did.&nbsp;

<h2>            User Home Drive Not Accessible</h2>
                    I have set up a new user in 2003 AD. I use the same template as I do all other users. All users are able to access their home drive on the server except for one user who is on a Windows 7 PC. The drive (H:) maps appropriately but when the user clicks on
 it it returns error stating H:\refers to a location that is unavailable. It could be on a hard drive on this computer.... If it still cannot be located, the information might have been moved to a different location. I have a few other users on Windows 7 PC's
 that do not have this issue. All settings and scripts are identical. Any help on resolving this is appreciated.

<br />
<br />1
<br />Please check to see if the Windows Key on your keyboard is stuck down
<br />
<br />2
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot 
<br />
<br />Run the Keyboard troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />3
<br />If that does not resolve this for you 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager 
<br />
<br />Expand the Keyboards section 
<br />
<br />Right click your keyboard and choose 'Uninstall' 
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC
<br />
<br />4
<br />Update your video card device driver . . .

<h2>            Where is the Disk Defragmenter log file location in Windows 7</h2>

<div>And at Microsoft development: A simple 'View Log' button could be added to the UI next time around you get to work on that.</div>

            <p>Thanks, RagRao for the log location. For other Windows novices like me, the location is:</p>
<p>Control Panels; Administrative Tools: Event Viewer: Windows Logs: Application.&nbsp; If you have multiple "Defrag" records, choose the one with the date and time of interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also hoping to see before and after graphs but I guess if the Disk Defragmenter window says 0% fragmented with a "last run" date and time, then that means it was successful, though I get no indication of how bad the problem was since the process ran
 to completion while I was away from the computer.</p>

<h2>            Windows Logo Key Stuck &#47; Sticking&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After maybe half an hour or so of use, it appears as if the Windows Logo key is stuck.&nbsp; The start menu flashes on and off intermittantly and when I press certain keys, it performs the action as if it was the shortcut key for the action : LOGO+key.&nbsp; Has been
 happening for a couple of days, although it seems to&nbsp;be ok at present.&nbsp; I think I've got sticky keys turned off.</p>
<p>I'm on Windows 7 Home Premium on a HP Pavillion Netbook.</p>
<p>There seems to be lots about this problem on assorted tech forums&nbsp;for several years but I've not found a fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can you offer any advice.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 happens when you tap the Windows Key on the Netbook again?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to check whether the issue happens when you use the On- Screen keyboard. Follow the steps mentioned below to open onscreen keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on start menu and type Keyboard in the start search box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select
 On- Screen keyboard from the list and check whether the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the Issue does not persist then there is an issue with the Netbook’s keyboard. I would suggest you to contact HP for further assistance.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows Media Player issues after major Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Media Player issues after major Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Dear Windows community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently performed the large Windows 10 upgrade. Now, several songs that I formerly listened to in Windows Media player will not play. After attempting to play the song, Windows Media player places a red "X" next to the song. When I look at the "properties"
 for the song I see the message: "This file is missing media usage rights." I legally purchased these songs and formerly had "media usage rights." What happened? Thank you for any help,</p>

            Have you tried this?
<br />
<br />Open Windows Media Player.
<br />
<br />Click the small arrow beneath the "Now Playing" tab on the application's interface. Choose "More Options" and then hit the "Privacy" tab.
<br />
<br />Put a check mark in the box next to "Download usage rights automatically when I play or sync a file." Close the window and restart your Windows Media Player.
<br />
<br />also:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Open Troubleshooting
<br />Type: media player in the search box
<br />
<br />Click the Windows Media Player Library troubleshooter then follow the on screen instructions. 
<br />
<br />If it does not resolve the problem, try the other troubleshooter: Windows Media Player Settings.

<h2>            Microsoft Update Messed up my Computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own an Alienware Aurora Pc running windows 10. I have a GTX 1070 Graphics card, 16gb ram, and a bunch of other fancy stuff because I need that much power for my career. I saw that there was a windows update, so, just as always trusting nothing would happen
 I updated it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use two displays, one connected via display port, another connected via HDMI, now, only one display gets a signal and the other turns on, but does not show anything. My drivers are updated, so there isn't a problem there. Ican't&nbsp;click on my desktop background
 because I get a never ending loading mouse that locks me out of my background. I can't run anything other than the internet browser because the computer will crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. How do I fix this?</p>

            <pre>Sorry, I can't verify the problem. I haven't updated to 1803 yet.  
Please also give us the BUILD number when reporting Version.
For example Version 1803 started with Build 17134.1.  I have seen at least one person report they had Build 17134.5  I don't know if that number is valid for the general public, I haven't seen it anywhere else (I asked them for confirmation, have not gotten it yet). 
The point is, Windows Version Numbers tend to last 6months, while Build numbers increment every day or two (for insiders) and often several times during the month for the general public when new updates are released.
Try these trouble shooting processes to see if you can fix the problem, otherwise send a Feedback to MS
Win10 Store apps  / Metro / Modern / UWA / UWP
In Windows 8.1, Microsoft introduced Universal Windows Apps (UWA), colloquially known as “Metro apps” or “Modern apps.” In Windows 10, Microsoft took the idea even further and ended up with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
Based on my own experience, and the reports of many others it appears that the store and it’s associated “environment” is rather fragile, causing various problems with the store itself and store applications. 
2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-windows-store-app-issues-windows-10/ 
Restart the computer
Win Store Trouble Shooter
Clear store Cache (WSReset.exe)
Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
Reg hack for Connection errors
Re-Register the Store
Here are some additional instructions for the 5 tips defined in the article above 
Remember to test the problem applet between each of the steps.
#0 RESTART THE COMPUTER
Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen component constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them is to restart the computer. 
#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER
http://aka.ms/diag_apps10 
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-trouble shooter-for-windows-apps 
Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
Use the built in Trouble shooter
Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
Scroll down to the bottom 
Click Windows Store Apps
#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/ 
Run as Admin.
Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
If the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html 
https://www.tekrevue.com/how-to-enable-system-restore-windows-10/ 
Create a System restore point. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point )
Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
Follow the instructions in this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6eHDtylDYo How to Fix Win Update Errors
This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
. – in start menu search for Windows Update
. - click on “Check for Updates”
. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates

8 MICROSOFT STORE ERRORS AND HOW TO FIX THEM 
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-microsoft-store-errors/ 
Joe Keeley February 15, 2018 5 minutes 
&lt;snip&gt;
The Windows Store, recently rebranded as the Microsoft Store, is the official marketplace for downloading games, apps, themes, and more. It’s not uncommon for it throw out errors, many of which are hard to resolve. We’re here to help.
Whether your Store is apparently missing, has a damaged cache, stuck downloading, or something else entirely, we’re here to offer all sorts of solutions that should hopefully get everything sorted.
.  0. WINDOWS STORE APPS TROUBLESHOOTER: START TROUBLE SHOOTING WITH THE STORE TROUBLESHOOTER (FIND IT HERE: HTTPS://SUPPORT.MICROSOFT.COM/EN-US/HELP/2970908/HOW-TO-USE-MICROSOFT-EASY-FIX-SOLUTIONS 
.  1. WINDOWS STORE WON’T OPEN: IF THE STORE WON’T OPEN AT ALL, LET ALONE GIVE YOU AN ERROR MESSAGE
.  2. WINDOWS STORE CACHE MAY BE DAMAGED: TRY CLEARING THE CACHE.
.  3. WINDOWS STORE IS MISSING: F YOU CAN’T FIND THE STORE ANYWHERE ON YOUR SYSTEM THEN YOU’LL NEED TO REINSTALL IT.
.  4. WINDOWS STORE DOWNLOAD IS STUCK: IF YOUR APPLICATIONS WON’T DOWNLOAD OR UPDATE PROPERLY, FIRST CHECK THAT YOU’RE NOT TRYING TO INSTALL THEM TO AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE.
.  5. ERROR CODE 0X80072EFD: THIS ERROR WILL APPEAR WHEN THE STORE IS HAVING NETWORK ISSUES. 
Temporarily turning off the firewall was reported to work for one person.
.  6. ERROR CODE 0X80072EE7: THIS PARTICULAR ERROR CODE CLAIMS THAT THE SERVER HAS STUMBLED. IT’S A NETWORK ISSUE
•  This particular error code implies that the server has stumbled. It’s a network issue and can occur even if your internet browser is working perfectly. For this, try resetting your proxy settings. Press Win + R, input cmd and press Enter. Input this and press Enter:
netsh winhttp reset proxy
Restart your computer and open the Store, which should now be working.
.  7. ERROR CODE 0X8000FFFF: THIS ERROR WILL APPEAR IN THE STORE AND SAY THAT THE PAGE CAN’T BE LOADED.
.  8. ERROR CODE 1: THIS IS A VERY CURIOUS ONE. IT’S THE FIRST ERROR CODE AND WILL APPEAR WHEN YOU TRY TO LAUNCH THE STORE.
&lt;/snip&gt;
RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture) 
RE-INSTALL ALL STORE APPS USING POWERSHELL
…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
…*  right click and select “Run as Administrator” option.
…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}
………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
………  get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmanifest.xml”)}
*******************************
**************************************************************
*******************************
Although MS does not tell you, when you are asking for help, we really do need to know specific the Windows (or Office) Version AND Build numbers you are running. 
Contrary to MS's wishful thinking, we are all NOT running the "most recent" version (actually Version AND BUILD!) .  Individual recurring, (obviously unfixed) Windows update errors cause people to be running older versions and builds. We commonly see people running versions of Windows that have fallen out of support because they are 18 months old due to unfixed update errors during that span of time. 
*******   PLEASE PROVIDE FULL VERSION AND BUILD NUMBERS   *******
Open the Run dialog using the &lt;WIN&gt;&lt;R&gt; shortcut
Type; WINVER
Press &lt;enter&gt;
The WinVer dialog is displayed.
Report the Version and Build numbers.
(Only) If you are having Office problems:
In any Office 365/2016/2013 application go to:
File menu &gt; Account command &gt; About section
ie Version 1803 Build 9126.2116
Office 2010
File menu &gt; Help command &gt; About section
ie 14.0.7197.5000
********************************
If you want to check for yourself:
MS SUMMARY of Windows VERSION AND BUILD NUMBER RELEASE DATES
HTTPS://WWW.MICROSOFT.COM/EN-US/ITPRO/WINDOWS-10/RELEASE-INFORMATION 
Skip past the “Windows 10 current versions by servicing option” section  (it’s just too confusing), go to the “Windows 10 release history” immediately below
WIN10 VERSION AND BUILD NUMBERS
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4093112  
MS documentation for Build releases. Go to Place for official info about specific changes made in the builds
Detailed Build numbers only: https://buildfeed.net/ (updated frequently as MS releases development builds)

<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<h2>            Movie Maker in Windows 10-Black screen video</h2>
                    We just purchased a new desktop with Window 10 and I'm needing the Movie Maker program for making a video using old video clips for our daughter's wedding.&nbsp; I downloaded Movie Maker and I can add video; however, it only plays back the audio and the video
 is a black screen.&nbsp; Very frustrated as there is no other free app's out there that can do what Movie Maker does.&nbsp; My question is, does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp; If not, is there a free app that can do the same things as Movie Maker.&nbsp; Thanks!

            <p style="color: rgba(119, 119, 119, 1)">
There are several troubleshooting options for the black screen problem with Windows Movie Maker that you can give a consideration. It is up to you to choose the best option for your program’s troubleshooting.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(119, 119, 119, 1)">
<strong>Set sound level.</strong>&nbsp;As you noted earlier, muting the sound of your Windows Movie Maker can cause the black screen error. As a solution, you should get rid of the mute settings for the program. To achieve that, select the “Timeline” and then expand
 to both audio and video. Right-click on the option for “Mute” and it will solve the black screen error. Alternatively, set the sound level of all the clips to zero which can be effective in solving the problem.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(119, 119, 119, 1)">
<strong>Shut unnecessary tasks.</strong>&nbsp;Why should you have ten tasks running on your computer yet you are using one? That will cause the black screen error and its only wise that you shut down those you don’t need to remain with necessary ones. The more idle
 tasks you have running on Windows Movie Maker, the higher the chances that the black screen error will occur. Just remain with few tasks and those that you need only to help solve the error.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(119, 119, 119, 1)">
<strong>Restart Windows Movie Maker.</strong>&nbsp;Shutting down your program and restarting it for another time is a good way to tackle the black screen error. That will help you to determine if there are any viruses that are causing the black screen error to show
 up. Once you have noted that, you can scan the program to delete all the spyware and then restart the Windows Movie Maker. That is sure to solve the problem. &nbsp; Reference - iskysoft.com/&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sportsind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SportsInd</a></p>

            Unfortunately, none of your suggestions worked.&nbsp; I spent a great deal of time online with a representative only to find our that ever since the release of Windows 10 Microsoft Movie Maker does not work and they hope to have the issue resolved sometime
 this year.&nbsp; Doesn't do me a lot of good since I need to use it know.&nbsp; I'm going to just have to purchase softeware instead. Thank you for your help.

            It's interesting because I've been using Movie Maker all winter with Windows 10 and had no problems, but then today, I'm getting a black screen.&nbsp; I can still hear the audio, and the video is progressing, just with a black screen.&nbsp; Same thing happens with
 all the videos I created this winter.

 you can install them manually or you can download them online. Here's a step by step instructions to update them - (For this tutorial, I am using Windows 7 screenshots)</span><br />
<ol>
<li><span>First of all, click on start menu button and open Control Panel.</span></li><li><span>Change the view by mode to "<strong>Large Icons</strong>".</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>Now find "<strong>Device Manager</strong>" option and open it.</span></li><li><span>A new window will open. Here find "<strong>Display adapters"</strong>&nbsp;option and click the arrow icon left to it.</span></li><li><span>Now right-click on your driver name and then click "<strong>Update Driver Software</strong>" option.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After this, click "<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>" button. You can also install them manually with second option.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now Windows will search your computer and the Internet for the latest driver software. If any new updates were found, it will download and install them automatically. This process will take few minutes.</span><br />

    <title>Fanatec wheel horror story - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slowracerx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fanatec wheel horror story</h2>
                    
<p>I’m sure most of you, like me, want a wheel that helps make<br />
Forza 4 one of the best racing simulation experience you can possible have. In<br />
order to do that you need a good racing wheel and unfortunately for most of us<br />
there is only one option out there, Fanatec. The MS wheel can no longer be<br />
found anywhere. Let me start off by saying I’m a patient guy and am willing to<br />
give a company a chance. I read wonderful reviews about their wheels on websites<br />
that received free demo products but heard horror stories about Fanatec’s<br />
support from some friends. I still decided to give them a chance.</p>
<p>Here is my experience with Fanatec. I ordered the Porsche GT2<br />
wheel in January of this year (2011). I was excited and ready to improve my<br />
immerse-ment into Forza 3. The wheel arrived shortly after. After my wheel<br />
arrived, I noticed that Fanatec ran out of stock on their website for GT2<br />
wheels. Whew! Got my order in, in the nick of time. I purchased this wheel to<br />
be used exclusively with my Xbox 360 and with my favorite racing game series of<br />
all time, Forza!</p>
<p>I installed the wheel on to my Playseat and connected to my<br />
Logitech G27 pedals using the included adapter. I was excited and ready to play<br />
with my friends. The wheel was missing the adapter to the MS wheel pedals, no<br />
biggie because I sold that to someone.</p>
<p>The wheel seemed to work decently but I noticed the port for<br />
the headphone jack was loose and I would constantly have to wiggle it to get<br />
sound to come out to my head phone. An annoyance but not a deal breaker,<br />
perhaps I could purchase one of those wireless gaming headsets. Then I started<br />
to notice the wheel would lose connection to the Xbox 360 when I would try to<br />
change the calibration settings. Every time I made a change it would disconnect<br />
from the Xbox 360 and I couldn’t reconnect it without hard resetting the wheel.<br />
Major annoyance!</p>
<p>So I decided to email Fanatec about the issues in March,<br />
asking if they had a firmware update or something. I followed all their steps,<br />
made a video and emailed them. I knew the audio-port was a connector problem<br />
(hardware) but the disconnect was a circuity/software/hardware issue. I got the<br />
run around saying that was normal with the Xbox 360 due to the settings<br />
changing from 270 degrees. This was apparently a lie as I later found out! I<br />
have a friend that I race with weekly that uses a Fanatec wheel and he never<br />
has had a disconnect issue from the console when tuning the wheel the way I was<br />
experiencing.</p>
<p>The audio problem was blamed on Microsoft’s audio chip that<br />
they were forced to use. This was blatantly a lie! How can a MS audio chip be<br />
blamed for a loose/crappy connecter that was most likely not soldered properly?</p>
<p>Anyways I sparingly played with the wheel till the end of<br />
March, then summer came and I packed up all my gaming hardware, ignored the<br />
Fanatec problem. And did what some of us racers do, race in the real world with<br />
real cars.</p>
<p>Come fall, I pre-order Forza 4 LCE, ordered a Fanatec shifter<br />
kit to prepare myself for what I was hoping to be a great simulation<br />
experience. The shifter kit arrived; I unpacked it and attached it to my wheel.<br />
I got the demo for Forza 4 and started playing the demo, however I quickly<br />
realized the H pattern shifter wasn’t functioning properly within the game. I<br />
went to the forums for help checking to see if anyone else was having this<br />
problem. Apparently no one else was having this issue. Upon suggestions from<br />
the forum and the user’s manual, I tried calibrating the shifter with the wheel<br />
when connected to the Xbox 360, to no avail. The darn thing will either only detect<br />
gates R, 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> and ignored the rest<br />
or after multiple calibration attempts detected only gates 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup><br />
and 6<sup>th</sup> and ignored the rest. Sometimes from a cold boot it would’t<br />
even detect the damn shifter. I have tried multiple things to get the shifter<br />
and the wheel to play nice. I looked for firmware updates, there were none. The<br />
same issue is happening with Forza 4. The wheel will sometime lock up/hang due<br />
to what seems to be a faulty ON/OFF switch. Yea this just keeps getting better<br />
and better.</p>
<p>I recently, as in Oct 2011, tried to contact Fanatec about<br />
the recent problem. I sent Fanatec all the information about all the past issues,<br />
along with videos detailing the problem. I keep either getting the run around<br />
or no response! My patience has run out with this company and the poor excuse<br />
of a tech support operations they have. They basically ask me to test this with<br />
a PC which is not what the wheel was purchased for! It was purchased for an<br />
Xbox 360 and Forza! I don’t care if it runs with a PC when it isn’t functioning<br />
properly with my Xbox 360 for which it was purchased and some of the issues are<br />
blatantly hardware related!</p>
<p>There are plenty of other people that have Fanatecs that are<br />
working perfectly with their Xboxs. However Fanatec won’t do the right thing and<br />
admit there is a problem with either the wheel or the shifter they sold me and<br />
have decided to ignore me. I find this really interesting/annoying after I went<br />
ahead and purchased their shifter kit despite the issues I was having with their<br />
wheel.</p>
<p>Honestly, the Fanatec wheels seem to be made with a bunch of<br />
cheap left over parts from computers. Old PS2 connectors litter the side of the<br />
wheel. The wheel seems to overheat quite a bit which can cause it to crash! The<br />
connectors are in the worst positions possible (the side of the wheel) and they<br />
stick out, making it easy for someone to hit/break/bend them while jumping in<br />
and out of their racing seat. If you want to see a well-made wheel, check out<br />
the Logitech G27, that wheel feels solid and the ergonomics and connectors are<br />
top notch and beautifully placed in a location out of harms range.</p>
<p>I only wish MS had contracted Logitech to make the Xbox<br />
wheel, then I wouldn’t have to deal with this nightmare that is Fanatec. If you<br />
do decide to get a Fanatec product pray that you don’t get a lemon and have to<br />
deal with the non-existent tech support! I’m not going to say don’t buy their<br />
product but buyer beware. I just wanted to share my experience. I will make<br />
sure BBB and Microsoft hear about this. $300 sunk and many hours wasted.</p>

<p>Wow...that really sucks man. &nbsp;It does indeed sound like you got a lemon. &nbsp;I've got a GT2, which I ordered in early Dec of 2010 (took delivery about a month later, just before their big shortage). &nbsp;I've had no problems to speak of with the wheel itself. &nbsp;The
 pedals, on the other hand, are a different story. &nbsp;I originally had a pair of the standard pedals, and after a few months the brake pedal started malfunctioning, showing that there was input being applied even when my foot was nowhere near it. &nbsp;I was offered
 the chance to upgrade to the Clubsport pedals, and now after a few months, they're exhibiting the exact same behavior. &nbsp;Which is odd, because supposedly the construction of the brake pedals and the way they detect braking input is totally different between
 the two.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>We'll see how they respond to that, but I do have to give their tech support a bit of credit though. &nbsp;At least in my case they've always responded quickly to my emails and they've even sent me a free bottle of oil to lubricate the pedals when I complained
 to them that they were squeaking all the time after only about a week of use.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Regarding the overheating issue you were having with the wheel...I've heard that turning down the FFB setting on the wheel itself will help this. &nbsp;Leaving it at 100 causes the motors to have to work pretty much all the time. &nbsp;I've found that a setting of
 100 is generally way too high for my liking anyway, so that's probably why I've never had this problem.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hope you get your issues sorted out and are at least able to reach some sort of reasonable resolution. &nbsp;I'd be interested to know how this all turns out.</p>

<p>Those identitites are not associated with any working computers in my house, though I think I remember that an old computer I used to have had that name.</p>
<p>Windows doesnt give me the option to create a new homegroup; it only has the option to Join, and when I try to of course I dont know the password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The view homegroup password option is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not sure how these relatively new computers could be seeing my old homegroup that I hadnt used in years.&nbsp; How can I kill off that old homegroup and create a new one?&nbsp; This is in windows 8.1.<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>A homegroup is a group of PCs on a home network that can share files and printers. Using a homegroup makes sharing easier. You can share pictures, music, videos, documents, and printers with other
 people in your homegroup. You can help protect your homegroup with a password, which you can change at any time. Other people can't change the files that you share unless you give them permission to do so.</span></p>

<h2>            username on texts</h2>
                    <p>When I text someone from my Skype account in Windows, my Skype name shows up at the top of the text on their mobile device. Is there any means of preventing the username from showing?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a107ac1a-b989-4719-8de5-ece29fb8adf5" title="JimThomson1968">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you send an SMS text message from Skype, the recipient will see the first 11 characters of your Skype Name. For example, if your Skype Name is
<strong>thisismyskypename</strong>, the recipient will see <strong>thisismysky</strong>. They won’t be able to reply to your SMS text message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can change your sender ID so it displays your mobile number instead. This means the recipient can reply to your SMS text message and the reply will go to your mobile phone (not your Skype).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the <span>classic </span><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA11099/how-do-i-find-my-way-around-skype-for-windows-desktop?q=way+around" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Skype for Windows desktop</span></a><span>&nbsp;version,
 you can verify your mobile number by:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Open Skype<strong>.</strong></li><li>Go to <strong>Tools.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>IM &amp; SMS </strong>&gt; <strong>SMS Settings</strong>,<strong>
</strong>click the link&nbsp;<strong>Verify your mobile phone number </strong>and follow the instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the <span>classic </span><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34664/finding-your-way-around-skype-for-windows-10?platform=uwp?q=way+around" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Skype for Windows 10</span></a><span>&nbsp;version,
</span><span>you can verify your mobile number by following the steps below: </span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span><a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in to your account online</a>.</span></li><li><span>Under Manage features, select <strong>Caller ID</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type your number and verify it.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It may take up to 24 hours to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you’ve validated your mobile number, all SMS text messages you send from Skype will display your mobile number as the sender ID. However, if Sender ID&nbsp;doesn’t work, it might be because it’s not available in your country or it’s not currently supported
 by the local telecommunication provider for the country you’re sending the SMS to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
