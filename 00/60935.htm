<h2>            How to schedule repeating task in Microsoft To-Do app&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I recently downloaded Microsfot To-Do app on my laptop and iPhone and I have two concerns</p>
<p>1- scheduling a task on a certain day and setting this task to be repeated everyday not showing this task on my day list in the next day</p>
<p>2- the app synchronized the tasks with the iPhone reminder and which (the iPhone reminder app) showing me all tasks are overdue because they all scheduled to be due 4:00 am !!! I couldn't find the way to set the due time on Microsoft To-Do app</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>

            Hi iGeo2019 
<br />
<br />Are you using Skype on Windows 10 and are you using the Windows 10 App version from the Microsoft Store?
<br />
<br />If so,  your best option is to uninstall that version and install the full Skype for Windows Application instead. It has more features and is a lot more stable:
<br />
<br />On this page, click the drop down and choose the bottom item:

            Hi  iGeo2019
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>Well, that's a real head-scratcher, all right. In fact, I can only find two (2) references to that error anywhere and the link I cited in my previous reply was the only suggested fix. So let's do some more-generic troubleshooting:<br />
<br />
What anti-virus application or security suite is installed, is your subscription current, and is it supported in Win7?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?<br />
<br />
What anti-virus application or security suite&nbsp;was installed <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
before you upgraded to Win7</span> and was your subscription still current?</p>
<p>Has a(another) Norton or McAfee application ever been installed on this machine (e.g., a free-trial version that came preinstalled when you bought the WinXP computer)?<br />
<br />
Why did you include "I have [plenty] of space on my hard drive" in your first post above?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Anti virus software is bullguard 8.7 security suite and the subscription is up to date. It is supported by win 7
<br />
Anti-spyware is bullguard as well<br />
Firewall is bullguard as well <br />
Mc Afee was installed before I upgraded to win 7 and the subscription is current but only for a month or so<br />
The only security suite that was ever installed on this machine was Mc Afee<br />
<br />
One of the&nbsp;possible reasons given for not installing&nbsp;was that I might not have&nbsp;enough hard drive space ????<br />
<br />
When first installing win 7&nbsp;I did a &nbsp;custom install there was a part of the drive that had my OEM which I could not delete. Could this be the probem????&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a file transfer but everthing else seems fine just a little slow at times. I reinstalled&nbsp;win 7 with
 another custom install to see if that could solve the problem but no.<br />
&nbsp;Any sugggestions ????&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    <p><span>I have an hp laptop<span>&nbsp; </span>pavilion dv5</span></p>
<span>with windows 7 home premium.</span>
<span>with windows 7 home premium.</span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I let my brother in law use my laptop to transfer his pictures and videos from his phones to his external hard drive one day
</p>
<p>and all of a sudden.....</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My laptop has been working perfectly fine until I started it up and I started getting a notification sound every second. I looked up the sounds so I know it’s the connect sound that is playing constantly and occasionally the DISconnect sound plays
 as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I got a message saying usb hardware has malfunctioned and to repair it but if I can't to reinstall it. Thing is nothing is connected but an unknown usb drive shows up and it doesn't even let me click on it or anything. I assumed it was his external drive
 still somehow connected so I connected it and tried to reinstall its program in there to see if it fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p>
</p><p><span>It got to the point where I just muted my laptop and did my work but then all of a sudden I got the blue screen of death!
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I looked up this problem and I’ve tried solutions like:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>updating all my drivers</span></p>
<p><span>checking usb settings (which say all usb ports are acting properly) </span>
</p>
<p><span>reinstalling silverlight </span></p>
<p><span>checking if it’s the wi-fi connection (it’s not)</span></p>
<p>windows update</p>
<p>checking for virus with microsoft</p>
<p>using microsoft fixit without any solutions (sometimes it caught the problem and "fixed it" but my
</p>
<p>problem is still here) </p>
<p>system restore </p>
<p>and i've checked my registry and all seems fine so far </p>
<p>
</p><p>but nothing has fixed this for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>I also noticed that when I tried to check the device manager the list refreshes every other second as well like something is connecting.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thing is there’s NOTHING being connected or disconnected. I don’t have blue tooth on so I know it’s not that!

<p>
</p><p><span>Once I turn on the laptop either the sounds play constantly or it doesn't sound at all, my laptop seems fine, then I get this blue screen, sometimes I even get the sound and the screen.</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p>I remember looking up the problems for each thing under technical info to see what they mean (0x00008, 0x00006 etc etc)</p>
<p>but I had no clue how to start fixing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would send more useful information but I'm clueless on how to do so, so if anybody can help and give me instructions to give more useful information I would be more than willing to!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think all this shutting down and restarting is taking a toll on my laptop</p>

<p>How long do you using this DVD Drive? If it's more than two years then the symptoms is quite similar like faulty/expired laser. As today we use multi format(like CD,DVD,DVD+DL,DVD+RW etc) disc reader,the laser is capable of emitting different frequency of
 ray from it, depending on the inserted media type. Now your drive laser can emit correct frequency to read CDs but not DVDs.</p>
<p>Its time to buy a new DVD drive. Laser changing would be equal costly like changing whole DVD Writer. It's also hard to find spare compatible Multi CD/DVD writer lens in majority country.</p>

            Hi Donna.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />
<br />For USB drive not detected issue, first try steps here:  <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-recognized-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-r...</a>
<br />
<br />Go into Device Manager to look for the drive  It may be listed by it's model or Serial which you can google to determine which is it.  Click on the Device, then Driver tab, choose Roll Back if available.  If not then choose Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver.  
<br /> 
<br />If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br /> Test the drive using diagnostics to know for sure it's condition:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>
<br />Follow this up with a DIsk Check from the Command Prompt if necessary:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the drive is detected in another PC.  If so back up the data to it's desktop.  
<br />Then plug it back into the PC which cannot detect it, reformat in Disk Management:

<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<h2>            Typing causing page scroll down automatically.</h2>
                    I have a Dell PC, windows 10. There is some problem in all the apps where there is a scroll down available. The moment i press "a" the page automatically scrolls down to the bottom of the page. It happens in MS office, Chrome, IE, any app. When there is
 no scoll available like renaming a folder or cortana search then there is no problem in typing. I have tried every possible solution found in net. i ran MRT windows update anti viruses. . What do i do? Thanks.

<br />
<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Selling on Visual Studio 2008 Professional Academic Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richie616  say:</h3>
<h2>            Selling on Visual Studio 2008 Professional Academic Edition</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Apologies if this is in the wrong forum but none seemed applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently finished a VB.Net course and wondered what the implications of selling on the study material, specifically the copy of the VS 2008 Pro Edition (academic) that came with it. Can I sell it if I uninstall from my computer? Will the serial key
 work on another computer considering i have used it in the past on mine? Is it even worth selling, value-wise??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems a bit of a waste with all of the books, software and coursework it includes.&nbsp; The course cost me about £1400 a couple of years ago and must be worth something to someone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

    <title>How To Recieve Security Updates Only&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How To Recieve Security Updates Only&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so after reading all the hype about the next Windows 10 "Creators" Upgrade, and after wasting weeks, even months of my time hunting down "fixes" for all the many things the "November" Upgrade and the "Anniversary" Upgrade broke/hosed/bricked, etc., on
 my desktop, laptop, and 2-in-1 computers, I want NO part of all this futuristic focus on 3D, mixed reality, new sharing capabilities, and improving gaming -- making all users “creators” bloat **. that Microsoft is about to forcibly shove down our gullets,
 once again breaking/hosing/bricking, etc., millions and millions of computers ... and, as usual, I fully expect at least one, maybe two, will be mine. I simply don't need the bloat, and I surely don't want the aggravation and weeks of my life&nbsp;lost cleaning
 up after the "upgrade".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here's my question: Is there ANY way possible to, what you might call, "put a freeze" on any future "upgrades" and just receive security&nbsp;updates on my current "Anniversary" Edition of Windows 10? Although there's still a few "bugs" left on my laptop
 computer, for the most part I'm perfectly happy with the version of Windows 10 that I have now, and it is perfectly capable of doing ALL -- and then some -- that I presently need out of my computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, and millions of others who are just sick of the new "Windows As A Service" and forced monthly Cumulative Updates and the yearly Monster Updates that ALWAYS break things, would be eternally grateful for ANY kind of relief from this "prison" Microsoft has
 built around us that has simply made working and playing on Windows computers no fun anymore ... And I'm an "Insider" ... What must it be like for the less computer savvy users? And the probable family and friends who help them keep their computers in some
 semblance of decent working order?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Don Smith</p>

            <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>For receiving only security updates you can go to:</p>
<p><strong>Settings-&gt;Update &amp; Security -&gt;Windows Update -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; And check the "Defer feature updates" box.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68f44224-2174-4906-b381-56edfc0dccd9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68f44224-2174-4906-b381-56edfc0dccd9" /></a></p>
<p><span>"Some Windows 10 editions let you defer upgrades to your PC. When you defer upgrades, new Windows features won’t be downloaded or installed for several months. Deferring upgrades doesn’t affect security updates. Note
 that deferring upgrades will prevent you from getting the latest Windows features as soon as they’re available."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope that helps!</span></p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your time and effort&nbsp;in replying to my question. Yes, I'm aware of this setting for Pro, Enterprise and Education. I have two computers with Pro installed, and the little 2-in-1 has Home, which doesn't have this option. I will, however,
 definitely use this option on my two Pro computers, and turn off the Update Service completely on the 2-in-1 for awhile. However, this option on Pro and up&nbsp;is only good for&nbsp;"several months", whatever that means -- I've heard anywhere from four to seven months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, when the time is up, you'll still get slammed with the "Creators" Upgrade. Whether you want it or not. I've filled MS's Feedback Hub with requests for MS to provide a way to NOT get these "Major" Upgrades, such as the "November" Upgrade, the
 "Anniversary" Upgrade, and the coming "Creators" Upgrade, unless the user gives specific approval, but I don't hold out any hope for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm hoping for, and, hence my question here, is for someone (dare I say hacker?) to figure out a way to give the user the choice whether or not to have their computers upgraded to new editions, which ALWAYS causes problems and breaks things, causing
 days, weeks, even months of anxiety, wasted time and anger researching and finding ways to fix or work around what Microsoft breaks/hoses/bricks with their "Borg"-like "Windows As A Service" ** -- you know: "We are Borg. We will assimilate you. Resistance
 is futile."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate Mac and Linux has&nbsp;never been ready for prime time. Actually, I like Windows ... or did, until "Windows As A Service" ruined the (as they say in the trade) "experience" completely for me. Heck, even these all-to-often Cumulative Updates break/hose/brick
 things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there ANY hope for Microsoft if the company keeps treating their customers as nothing but property, to use and mold as they see fit? I think not. It may take a few more years, but eventually MS is going to get bitten in the butt -- big time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, any other suggestions or ideas on how to work around these forced upgrades will be much appreciated. Where are you, Microsoft "Engineers"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Don Smith</p>

            <p>Consider yourself fortunate, d0gknees. I have four computers that I maintain; three of which I own, and one for another family member. I'm a member of TechNet, an Insider, and I have experience installing and&nbsp;maintaining computers and networks, both large
 and small,&nbsp;since Windows 3.1 and Mac SE, mostly for newspapers, newspaper groups and print shops, So, I've been around the block a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To keep this as short as possible, I'll just say this: Since Microsoft went "Windows As A Service" and started forcing Cumulative Updates and Upgrades upon me -- without asking for my consent nor approval, EVERY major upgrade, first from Windows 8.1 to Windows
 10, then the "November" Upgrade, then the "Anniversary" Upgrade, has broken/hosed/bricked AT LEAST one, sometimes two, sometimes three of my computers. EVERY one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, not being a dummy, I know I can only speak for myself when I say "EVERY" one, but, hey, just spend some time searching and reading in this Community about the myriad of problems users have had or are having with the new "Windows As A Service"&nbsp;model,
 and even with the&nbsp;Cumulative Updates. You'll be reading for a long, long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, speaking strictly for myself, and the many other users who are in the same boat, do you have any suggestions about a way to give the user the choice whether or not to have their computers upgraded to new editions, which ALWAYS causes problems and breaks
 things, causing days, weeks, even months of anxiety, wasted time and anger researching and finding ways to fix or work around what Microsoft breaks/hoses/bricks with their "Borg"-like "Windows As A Service" BS -- you know: "We are Borg. We will assimilate
 you. Resistance is futile?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really appreciate any suggestions you have that might help.</p>

            <p>Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can really suggest is clean installs and leaving it alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with a clean install abut 15 months ago when it first became available. I've allowed Windows 10 to do it's updates and upgrades when they turn up and have had very few problems. I have an external DAC rather than a sound card so I had to chase
 that down and I am not a fan of reboots and upgrades firing up at random times, but the worst I've suffered is waiting about an hour when the AU loaded on a Saturday morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for leaving it alone, I recommend you don't try and remove things you don't want to use, just don't use them and set your preferences to use the applications you prefer. Removing things seems to be a trigger for all sorts of issues. Again I don't really
 agree with how tightly some things are linked into Windows, but I find just ignoring them works pretty well. Internet Explorer has been that way for a decade or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I don't use Edge or many of the new apps. I don't use Groove, or media player for that matter. I use MS Office and also let it do it's thing with updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like more customization options, but found some interesting information last week that give me hope that MS are coming to the party on this one, so I'll wait and see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the complaints and problems here. I spend a fair bit of time here (don't tell the boss) and while there are a lot of people complaining, there are an awful lot more who are not. You've obviously had problems with Windows 10, and I'm not saying
 you don't or that they are your fault, but having worked on help desks for over 30 years, I believe it when I see it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi d0gknees,</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- Long post, happy reading :-) --</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to reply. I appreciate your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also been one to go after the "latest and greatest" since the days of Novell DOS. Personally, as opposed to professionally, the only versions of Windows I haven't installed as soon as possible after release was Windows 1, 2 and 3.0. That's because
 my first computer was a Windows 3.1 rig, which I upgraded to 3.11 and Windows 95. The old rig, even with all the hardware updates, couldn't quite cut it with Windows 95, so I donated it to my daughter who was in college at the time. After she graduated, she
 donated it to her church, who used it for I don't know how many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second computer came with Windows 95, which I updated to Windows 98 and Windows ME (What a horrid OS -- but it was the last Windows version that ran on DOS, so it was OK for sentimental reasons, I guess.) In fact, I still have that rig with ME on it stashed
 in a closet, and with the hardware updates, it still runs just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My third computer came with XP, which I upgraded to Vista and Windows 7. With the hardware upgrades, it ran fine, but by that time I had another daughter in college, so ... She used it all the way through graduate school, and donated it to somebody -- I
 don't remember who.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't recall exactly when MS started releasing Service Packs ... but I kept up with all of them. I also became a TechNet member along about this time so I always upgraded everything to Pro editions on all my computers that came with Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My fourth computer came with Windows 7 and it was a "barn-burner". I loved it. I still have that one, too, stashed in the closet, and it runs just fine. I also bought my first laptop during that time. It came with Windows 7, which I upgraded to Windows 8,
 8.1, Windows 10, November Upgrade, and Anniversary Upgrade. I'm writing this on it right now, in fact. I used this computer to dual-boot with Windows 8 during it's way to "RTM", but hated it. I must have installed and uninstalled it half a dozen times. I thought
 running a smart phone OS on a computer was just stupid. Still do, but I finally discovered the joys of Window Blinds and Start 8 and have never looked back. I now use Start 10 on all my computers, except the 2-in-1. I can handle the smart phone interface on
 a 10-inch touchscreen, and use it almost exclusively in Tablet Mode. I used the laptop during Windows 10's testing, too, and joined the "Insiders" program as soon as it was formed. After Windows 10's first "RTM" though, I'd had enough and dropped down to the
 "slooooow" ring. Just too many problems and too little time for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sixth computer came with Windows 8, which I upgraded to 8.1, Windows 10, November Upgrade, and Anniversary Upgrade. It's my current desktop computer.
</p>
<p>My seventh and final computer, so far, is the 2-in-1 that came with Windows 10, which I upgraded to Anniversary Upgrade, (I guess it was in Best Buy's warehouse somewhere when November Upgrade came out) then to Anniversary Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, all that was a very long -- and boring -- intro to serve as a backdrop for my next comments; which are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that a clean, bare-metal install is the way to get off to a good start. I've done many through the years with each new Windows release, but that was only about every three years or so. With the new "Windows As A Service" that doesn't work too well,
 as you have a Major Upgrade at least once a year. Since it takes about two weeks to get two OS's clean installed and enough of my applications installed to where I can get stuff done and just start reinstalling the others when I need them, it'll take even
 longer with three computers. In addition to Office and Acrobat, I have a ton of media programs I use, having to do with music, photography, videos and games. For me, that's just too much time installing and reinstalling, chasing down solutions to problems
 that crop up ... just not worth it any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also agree with your "leave-it-alone" philosophy, to a certain extent. That's also the philosophy of Microsoft, but I've brought too many computers "back from the dead" both in business enviornments and for friends and family with the prudent use of
 utility programs to fully buy that line. It's just a fact that, over about a two or three year period, for the average user, their PCs slow to a crawl and start having all kinds of problems from installing and uninstalling programs, collecting junk files all
 over the place from God only knows where, surfing the Internet, and just using the computer to do work and play. So, what does the average user do? Some call on family or friends for help, who usually don't help but just make things worse. Some take it to
 a computer shop, that usually sells them an updated OS, and maybe some new hardware, and sends them home with an updated, like new computer -- with none of their programs installed. But some do just what Microsoft WANTS them to do: Go out and buy a brand new
 computer, because the old one is just outdated and worn out, don't you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used utility programs to help keep my computers alive and well since day one, and never, I said NEVER, have I EVER done any harm to any of them by doing so. Just the opposite, in fact ... but for the "average" user ... I have to agree that unless they
 know what they're doing they could damage their computers. But what the hey? The worst that could happen is they'd have to get someone to do a bare-metal reinstall, the exact same thing as if they's just left their computers alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But we're talking about "Windows As A Service" these days, so let me tell you about just a FEW of MY experiences with that. Such as: The new Microsoft Mahjong update won't sign in to X-Box on my laptop computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Anniversary Upgrade, on two of my computers, after a few minutes of use, all the menus and dialog boxes would go blank, that is, the content was invisible. It required a restart of the computers several times per session. I finally, after days,
 or weeks, of work, narrowed the cause down to two programs I had running in the background. One I had to completely remove, the other one required a reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On all of my computers, Internet Explorer (which I much prefer to the Edge smartphone app so I don't really know or care if it's the same with Edge) is sluggish and eventually freezes up or does a restart. And speaking of Edge, on my laptop, it refused to
 start. Not that I use it that much, but the Upgrade changed it back to the default browser so I discovered the problem right away. Getting that fixed took days of research and a rather complicated process to uninstall and reinstall Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop would only boot to a blank screen after the Anniversary Upgrade. The only fix that would work? A bare-metal reinstall of Windows 10. Also, because of Microsoft's only God knows why decision to just rename my user folder from my first name to the
 first five letters of my Microsoft Account's e-mail address, after the Anniversary Ugrade I was locked out of my desktop computer. Upon trying to log in, I got the message that my password was changed by "another device", and to please log in with my new password
 at least once and I could reset my Pin Code. What? A new password? On only one computer when I log into ALL my computers with the same Microsoft Account? Impossible! The only fix that would work? A bare-metal reinstall of Windows 10, which, after a week or
 so I discovered was the Home Edition instead of the Pro Edition it should have been. So, I just upgraded it to Pro with an old serial number I had lying around from my TechNet days. Also, with the stupid User folder name change, all of my many playlists in
 MusicBee were hosed on all of my computers, as well as all of my GoodSync Jobs for all of my computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, on another family member's laptop after the Anniversary Upgrade, I could only log in to the computer using an old password from an account that didn't even exist anymore (it's a long story). The only fix? Create a new Local Account, delete the Microsoft
 Account, and then make the Local Account the New Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just a few of the problems I've had with "Windows As A Service" and the Anniversary Upgrade. I don't even remember the specifics of what the November Upgrade did, but I do remember that it, too, was an Upgrade from Hades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, do you see why I want nothing to do with the coming Creators Upgrade? Besides, how many users really NEED all that futuristic focus on 3D, mixed reality, new sharing capabilities, and improving gaming -- making all users “creators” bloat? Maybe a few.
 Like a lot of tech things these days, it's just another case of "creating" a need where none exists just to sell new computers and gadgets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still maintain that MS's new focus on "Windows As A Service" and forced Cumulative Updates and forced Major OS Upgrades that ALWAYS break things are going to come back to bite the company in the butt in the not to distant future. Windows 10's growth has
 already slowed down since they stopped giving it away, gaining only 0.06% of market share in September. Windows 7 even beat Windows 10 in October, gaining 0.11% of market share. Heck, even Windows 8.1 gained 0.57%, beating them both. Windows 7 is still king
 with 48% of the total market, Windows 10 has 23%, and every other OS on the planet is mired way down in the single digets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been over four years since the Windows 8 fiasco bit MS in the butt. I figure MS will continue down this "Windows As A Service" and forced Cumulative Updates and Major Upgrades path no more than two more years without having to make major adjustments,
 just as with Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm still looking for a way to skip the forced Creators Upgrade. Any ideas from anyone -- even Microsoft "Engineers" or "VIPs" (who've been awfully silent in this thread for some reason) will be most appreciated.</p>
<p>

</p><p>But being the skeptic I am when it comes to "help" from the "Microsoft Engineers", "Microsoft VIPs", "Microsoft Forum Moderators", etc in this community, I kept reading the thread and, lo and behold, I ran across another post from johnptd dated August 4,

<p>
</p><p>"Unfortunately with the Anniversary Update, Microsoft has changed the ballgame. Windows Pro Group Policy Editor changes to Windows Updates is now ignored. It has instead given everyone (Home and Pro) an "Active Hours" option so you can define what hours
 you do not want your system rebooted. You are limited to defining no more than 12 hours as being "active". As far as I am concerned, this is not the best option.</p>

<p>Hi, Don Smith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I grieve and moan with you about your wanting to freeze Windows Updates but still get the Security Updates. I am a senior-senior (not nearly as geeky and pc skilled as you, who does volunteer pc repair for seniors in a very small town. I went from house
 to house helping seniors here update to Win 10, then the other versions and now I am almost through getting them updated to Creators Version. Why they need it? They all don't want it and don't use 1/3 of all of bells and whistles on Windows 10. Some of them
 are so non pc savvy that they don't know where the notification box is. It is sad getting old, and wanting to do the basic pc stuff like email, surfing, getting the news and weather, and your grandchildren pics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I read from the Windows 10 Update that Windows is going to do two updates a year? I am sick about this I tell you. No way I can keep my seniors up to date on all of this new gibberish that none of them will ever use. Seniors can not keep up with
 all of the new changes that are being thrown into the new updates.</p>
<p>And some of them tell me that they will just dump their pc's in the trash if their pc gets more complicated for them to understand. Well if enough Baby Boomers and earlier seniors start shutting down their MS pc's I think MS will see there is a need for
 a one version OS just for seniors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I contacted a MS Tech on chat and asked him if there was a way to freeze the updates for my seniors to one version, but still get the security updates. Well he gave me a procedure for turning off the updates and I was just elated at first. After
 closing the chat I went through the turning off updates and realized I didn't go far enough quizzing the tech. Right now I see that to get the MS Security Updates even if I go to every house and turn off the updates that isn't all of it. It appears to me now
 that I will still have to go to the seniors homes, turn the Updates back on, and some how select just the security updates to download on their pcs. I am just sick and so frustrated by all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am with you on most everything you have said. I saw many pc's falter during updates and some of them I had to work hours and hours to finally get the updates installed. And then some of the features were not installed on these seniors pcs. I think I am
 going to tell the seniors that I am firing myself as their volunteer pc It guy because I am too tired and old to help them keep their pc's running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there was some way to install only the security updates without all of the trouble of turning updates back on, now that might be a fix. Maybe I mis-interpreted MS Tech...and there is a way to only download security updates. But Google my Friend hasn't
 shown that answer to me as yet. If you learn how please let me know. I can give you the link that the MS Tech gave me to turn off the MS Updates, but I am sure you know already how to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards and please keep in touch with me on your progress in freezing the twice-a-year Win Updates but still easliy acquiring the security updates.</p>

            Hi Mohammad.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unfortunately File history is buggy and may be phased out soon.  What I recommend is changing to a more reliable and flexible free app like Macrium which is the choice of most experts.  For both file and image backup, it just works.
<br />
<br />File backup:  <a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />Image backup so you can restore C in 20 minutes if it become irreparable:  
<br />
<br />I would also have a secondary method using the cloud which is fire and theft proof:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you also can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

<p>What the heck! &nbsp;Is this happening with any other profiles? &nbsp;What kinds of gamer pics were you switching to? &nbsp;If they were all from packs, let's try changing to something featuring your avatar and see if that behaves.</p>

<p>i have tried everything. I was on the phone with microsoft for hours and we still could not figure what the problem was and how to fix it. When you press the guide button on my controller the gamer picture on the top of the guide blinks only on my profile
 on multiple xboxs. If you can offer any suggestion of a solution that would be much appreciated. Thanks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>That is pretty odd.. Are you connecting to your profile on those different consoles on the same network by chance? From what I have seen this is a connection issue. I would suggest restarting your network equipment, and if you are using a wireless connection,
 perhaps try a direct wired connection. Let us know how that goes. Cheers!</p>

<h2>            RPS PerfectDiskStub blocking instalation of Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm attempting to upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10.&nbsp; Eventually the Windows 10 installer says that I have to remove &nbsp;RPS PerfectDiskStub because it is incompatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; So I removed it.&nbsp; Now I do not see &nbsp;RPS PerfectDiskStub
 in the installed list of programs.&nbsp; I click "REFRESH" in the windows update.&nbsp; Nothing happens.

            <p>Via the windows 10 upgrade dialogue-- after roughly 15 minutes-- I received the " RPS PerfectDiskStub needs to be uninstalled because it is incompatible with Windows 10" notice.&nbsp; Then II clicked the uninstall within that dialogue.&nbsp; After seeing a successfully
 uninstalled message&nbsp; the continue button for the Windows 10 upgrade remained disabled.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way&nbsp; " RPS PerfectDiskStub"&nbsp; did not appear in the list of programs under Control Panel&gt;&gt;Uninstall Programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my original post I learned that this entry (RPS PerfectDiskStub) may have been part of Telus Security Services.&nbsp; Telus is an large telecommunications and ISP company in Canada.&nbsp; Telus provides&nbsp; their internet customers security software.&nbsp; I just now
 replaced Telus Security Software with Norton. This might do the fix for me. Tonight I might try to re-run the Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; After that I will learn if &nbsp; RPS PerfectDiskStub appears as an incompatible software module within the Windows 10 upgrade installation
 dialogue. </p>

<h2>            Others can hear what I hear when I use a headset.</h2>
                    When I use a headset with skype or any other voice program (Even the windows microphone test) people can hear what I hear (Music, System Sounds, Game sounds, etc.) I thought it was my headset and bought a new one but the problem persists. I also tried
 reinstalling the sound drivers but that also did not fix the problem. Both the headsets I've tried are USB.<br />

So, <a href="http://digitalmediaphile.com/index.php/2012/11/02/how-to-use-windows-8-rt-apps-libraries-and-removable-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://digitalmediaphile.com/index.php/2012/11/02/how-to-use-windows-8-rt-apps-libraries-and-removable-media/</a>&nbsp;will get you what you want with a couple of caveats"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You will have to manually re-index when you add/remove/change anything. </p>
<p>2. Windows 8.1 (which will be available as a free upgrade 10/17) changes everything. You won't need the kludge above, SD cards, etc. can be treated like any other local drive. And, equally important, you would want to un-do the kludge I documented in my
 blog before installing the upgrade and then re-establish your library (don't mount in empty NTFS folder, remove it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can hold out for 10/17, that would be the easiest. If not, use my work around and be aware of what you may need to do when 8.1 RTM is available in the Store as a free upgrade.

<h2>            Intel Wireless Bluetooth not showing in Device Manager in HP ZBook Studio G3 Mobile Workstation</h2>
                    <p>Hi, new PC, never had bluetooth working due to nothing showing in device manager.</p>
<p>Have spent days trying to resolve this. Ended buying a usb bluetooth adapter for a quick fix. Now it doesn't recognize my new Microsoft arc mouse so I'm now trying to fix the core issue. which has been detected after following some trouble shooting in windows
 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message says 'There is a problem with this windows installer package.&nbsp; A DLL required for this Install to complete could not run. Contact your support.</p>
<p>I guess a clean install would work but it's a big job....to fix this another way would be great.</p>
<p>Thank you..!</p>

<h2>            Xbox one Elite controller&#58; Thanks Xbox users&#33; Thanks for nothing Microsoft Support</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have been a loyal Microsoft customer since the DOS days. I&nbsp;have been a retail consumer for every home operating system put out. I have also bought every generation of Xbox consoles and currently have a Xbox one S and a Xbox one X.</p><p>I&nbsp;can't remember ever asking for warranty assistance from Microsoft before this left stick drift issue with my Elite controller I&nbsp;purchased from BestBuy. </p><p>After&nbsp;6 months, my FPS&nbsp;characters started moving forward on their own. I would just jiggle the stick and everything was good.</p><p>Then it rapidly started getting worse. at 9 months, it was to the point that I&nbsp;had to go back to my stock controller.</p><p>I felt as though this was pretty darn weak that the Microsoft "Elite" flagship controller is only good for 9 months but I&nbsp;knew the warranty was 90 days so I&nbsp;didn't even think about asking for help from Microsoft.</p><p>Then I read that Microsoft was doing the right thing and replacing the controller

They only care about how much money they can get from you.<br /><br />The problem here is that Microsoft are in the right legally. The controller is out of warranty and as such they do not have to replace it for you.

It is very likely that the reason you received a empty box was so the broken controller could be returned in the correct packaging.

 </blockquote> <p>Problem is though that lets for argument sake say that Microsoft sent out an elite controller to the original poster (that means Microsoft has lost some money) then someone else calls saying the same thing, so Microsoft now sends out another controller, and another and another.&nbsp; How long before Microsoft stops sending out free Elite controllers? when its costing them thousands of dollars a month?</p><p><br /></p><p>Microsoft stuck to what they have to do legally, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

            <p>Why do people think you have to be a Loyal Customer to try and win things? No company cares about your "loyalty". Sure some may offer good customer service and have staff or management that like you.

<h2>            Help - Script trying to delete all files from System32</h2>
                    <p>Today morning i wake up with a script running on my computer trying to delete all files and folders from System32.</p>
<p>The other day i added a script to delete all files from a temporary folder on Downloads:</p>
set folder="C:\Users\toshib\Downloads\Pasta Temporária"<br />
cd /d %folder%<br />
for /F "delims=" %%i in ('dir /b') do (rmdir "%%i" /s/q || del "%%i" /s/q)
<p>I tried to check on tasks that i had on my computer, but i wasnt able to do that, i got this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d4f115a-32a7-4dcc-83f8-2ee4e5a5caff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d4f115a-32a7-4dcc-83f8-2ee4e5a5caff" /></a></p>
<p>(Windows cant localize the folder)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now i have some problems playing games that use OpenGL, but games with DirectX is working fine.</p>
<p>My question is could that script "turn back" and try delete the files or just a virus?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description, a script ran on your system trying to delete the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would appreciate, if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better?</span></span></p>

</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you made any recent changes on your system prior to this issue?</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You may face this issue if some third party software installed on your system is conflicting or your system is infected with virus.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the steps given below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Perform Clean Boot.

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>

 Normal startup mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue still persists try method 2.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 2. Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>I would suggest you to perform a full system scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner to eliminate any issues related to virus/malware.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong></span></span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">

<p><span>Problem is, the tips tell you basically this: play the game so many times that you practically memorize (for the entire game) where the threats are and what the best course of action is.&nbsp; Most tips also recommend that you NOT
 waste any saves while playing disc 1 of the game. These tips were of little use to me as I get killed again and again in disc 1, usually by something silly or random. Good luck.

<p>Have you tried any of the dlc? &nbsp;I recommend the Martial Law pack strictly for the Force Gun. &nbsp;Level that, the Plasma Cutter, and your favorite dlc suit. &nbsp;Level your suit first (health). &nbsp;Carry the Contact Beam so you can sell all the ammo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more you play it the more you will remember where those tricky parts are. &nbsp; Always be on your guard. &nbsp;Personally, I saved in Chapter 4, disk checkpoint, right before the Ishimura, and before the eye needle. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Both Software’s have their own merits and demerits.
</span></p>
<p><span><em><span>Picasa
</span></em><span>is easier to use, but it is limited in flexibility. &nbsp;<em>Windows Movie Make</em>r has more flexibility.&nbsp; Both are free. &nbsp;Both have to use&nbsp;<em>Windows&nbsp;DVD Maker</em> to burn a video disk to view on TV.
