<h2>            Lumia 550 storage</h2>
                    My phone keeps saying I have almost used all the storage. It says to go to settings and just uninstall any apps I want to. This does not work as all the apps I don't want I cannot press the uninstall button. Any help?

<p>So my advice, particularly if you need or want to update is to save any documents and pictures to OneDrive then hard reset and set up your device again,
<strong>DO NOT reinstall from a backup</strong> but rather use a fresh install. Use the same Live ID you currently are using so that you will have access to all your contacts and calendar info. Then perform an update if it is available then add back programs
 that you really need or want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All too often we install so much that memory gets eaten up and sometimes temporary files are not cleaned up. The temp files can eat up a lot of memory if they were not automatically deleted.</p>

<p>It really is pretty easy to do. </p>
<p>Look at this link: &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10768/windows-10-mobile-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10768/windows-10-mobile-reset-my-phone</a></strong></p>

</p><p>Resetting your Windows phone will return it to the same state it was in the first time you turned it on. All of your personal content will be erased, and the phone will be restored to its factory settings.</p>
<p>If you decide to reset your phone, you can back up apps, text messages, and more in the cloud beforehand. To learn more about how this works, see
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Back up your stuff</a>. <br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>Reset your phone </strong></p>

<li>On Start , swipe over to the All apps list, then select <strong>Settings</strong>.
<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>About </strong>&gt; <strong>Reset your phone</strong>.
<br />
</li><li>You'll receive two warnings. If you're absolutely sure you want to restore your phone to its factory settings, select
<strong>Yes</strong>, and then select <strong>Yes </strong>again. It might take a little while for the process to complete.
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If your phone is unresponsive and you can't reach <strong>Settings </strong>, you may be able to reset your phone using the hardware buttons. On Lumia phones (and some others), use the following procedure to reset your phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Reset an unresponsive phone </strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>Volume down</strong> and <strong>Power </strong>buttons at the same time until you feel a vibration (about 10 to 15 seconds).
<br />
</li><li>When you feel the vibration, release the buttons, and then immediately press and hold the
<strong>Volume down</strong> button until you see a large exclamation mark. <br />
</li><li>Once the exclamation mark appears, press the following four buttons in this order:
<strong>Volume up</strong>, <strong>Volume down</strong>, <strong>Power</strong>,
<strong>Volume down</strong>. Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take a while for the reset to finish.)</li></ol>

<p>Hi Eric Julien,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the errors on Outlook Web App, please exit all Office 365 service from all browsers, then clear these browsers cookies and caches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If clearing the cookies &amp; cache doesn't help, please update IE to 11.0 and use IE inPrivate mode to see if issue persists. Please also change another network to see if issue is related with network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’d like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Whether the shared mailbox you mentioned refers to:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-shared-mailbox-871a246d-3acd-4bba-948e-5de8be0544c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-shared-mailbox-871a246d-3acd-4bba-948e-5de8be0544c9</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If so, if you open the shared mailbox directly on Outlook Web App via My account-&gt;Open another mailbox…-&gt; enter the shared mailbox address, whether you get the same error when checking the items in it?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If the version of Opera that you want to restore to your phone was originally installed on the phone when you got it, then you could perform a hard reset of the phone to get it back to all of its original factory settings.&nbsp; A hard reset will restore the
 original set of software on the phone.<br />
<br />
If you downloaded and installed Opera 9 on the phone, then you'd have to look around the internet to see if you can find a version of it somewhere since Opera does not provide a copy of its old versions of browsers for download.<br />

 but no customers. If I get one customer right now I paid $130 for him. That is not good. I'm thinking I am the victim of click fraud by my competitors. No other explanation.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 keep hanging at searching for server for 20&#43;mins, when trying to connect to an Exchange Server</h2>
                    <p>Dear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company recently had upgraded from a POP3 email service to exchange mail service. But somehow my outlook 2016, on the newest bought Thinkpad X1 Yoya at Windows 10, cannot be connected to the exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I put all the username and login, it will start trying to connect, then wait like ages without showing anything. All my other colleagues using Win 10 / Outlook 2016 doesn't have this issue, so I have to think it's must be some problem within either
 Outlook or Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 other laptop, 1 can setup without problem, the other one have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now any kind of suggestions / inspiration would be really welcome. Since I am now really uncomfortably using a Online Email system to reply email. Once this solve it will really be a huge help to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Chamssa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could be a combination of problems, some type of conflict (including with prior installations of MSE), a bad MSE installation for any number of reasons, problems with Action Center (I thought it only showed in the notification area if there was a problem
 and otherwise remained hidden - but I guess you could have changed that), an infection, corrupted system or other files, or something else.&nbsp; But to avoid biting off more than reasonable here (which considering how long this is, you may already think is the
 case)&nbsp;in the first post, we're only going to address those things mentioned above and come back to "something else" if they don't work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind you don't need to do this all at once - it just keeps us from having to post back and forth over several days one step at a time when this way you can go at your own speed.&nbsp; Chances are not all of it will be required but there's no way to know
 where the problem lies so I can't guarantee it'll be an early step or if it'll end up being "something else."&nbsp; None of it is particularly difficult and is either explained in detailed or in links provided for reference and furtner assistance along the way.&nbsp;
 Most won't take too long, but some steps will take some time if they are needed.&nbsp; At any point you can post back for further assistance or help with any part no matter how silly the question may seem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any point in the first section if you want to try a shortcut rather than doing it yourself, you can always&nbsp;go to the end and submit the email support case as described: however, bear in mind that since you have problems that suggest MSE is not the only
 issue involved here, they may not be able to help you with everything or get into areas where it is no longer free (such as malware-removal if you're in the United States or issues with Action Center and/or Windows&nbsp;7 or problems with&nbsp;corruption and then you
 either need to thank them for what they did to that point and return here or agree to pay for support in one or more different areas depending on which they suggest trying first).&nbsp; If you reach the "it's going to cost" point, I recommend coming back here and
 trying yourself with our help before doing that&nbsp;(unless cost is not a factor for you).&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure where you are so lets start from the beginning, check a few things, and make sure everything is done correctly. And we're going to forget Windows Update and upgrading and install MSE fresh to remove WU and upgrade problems from the equation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering
 with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install McAfee Security Scanner, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally installed
 McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once
 done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a> I suspect some problem with uninstalling the prior version is behind this, so you may need to focus more on the manual
 procedures in the first thread and on the second link with the Mr Fixit in aggressive mode AND manual procedures to be sure it is completely removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs - you MUST also use the removal tool - even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn't use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you're logged in as an administrator) as I've
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows (and even if it does help and works, you should do this section anyway because of the higher than normal chance that you were infected even if MSE
 gave you clean bill of health and we really need to be sure):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>

<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn't know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have an issue with Action Center and others have also had it. Some have resolved it using the following and some have done so by getting assistance from Microsoft (instructions follow). Some have been unable to resolve it for whatever reason (but
 I haven't seen many such cases after all options have been tried). Some are willing to live with the problem (since MSE has its own notification icon and if it is showing green and active, then you are protected despite what Action Center may be reporting
 (it's not that Action Center is right and you aren't protected - it's that Action Center does not recognize MSE is there and enabled and working)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if it is about the Action Center, please check out the answers and suggestions in the following thread:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/xp-security-center-reports-virus-protection-not/1484c369-a138-4544-aa40-a3bb91dee5b9">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/xp-security-center-reports-virus-protection-not/1484c369-a138-4544-aa40-a3bb91dee5b9</a>.
 Specifically try the fix that's recommended. If that doesn't work, then try the options below. Although written for XP, with a little tweaking because they are a bit different, it can apply to Vista and W7 as well and the needed changes shouldn't be too hard
 to figure out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If none of the above works or you get stuck trying many or most of the steps, then the issue may be file corruption, so let's try to check and either fix that or rule it out:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run. It will scan and try to fix some of your system files. Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run. It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart. Answer yes and then reboot to run the program. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>i'm sure you're glad to hear that's it for now.&nbsp; I sure hope something above resolved the problem.&nbsp; If not, post back explaining everything you did and what happened at each step.&nbsp; Keep notes so you can provide a detailed report.&nbsp; Then based on that,
 we'll decide where next to proceed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Currently, this option is not available.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

    <title>Disable-RemoteMailbox results are unexpected &#40;Hybrid&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> me_5555  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable-RemoteMailbox results are unexpected &#40;Hybrid&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Good day all.&nbsp; I'm experiencing an unexpected behavior when attempting to disable a remote mailbox for an on-premises user with a hybrid Exchange deployment.&nbsp; Note that I want to retain the on-premises user account, but have the O365 mailbox deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
 I run the disable-remotemailbox command it appears to make the appropriate changes to the on-premises user account... the Exchange attributes of the user are set to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>msExchDisabledArchiveGUID: &lt;ldp: Binary blob 16 bytes&gt;; <br />
msExchRecipientSoftDeletedStatus: 0; <br />
msExchRemoteRecipientType: 24; </p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the RemoteRecipientType of 24 is a DeprovisionMailbox (8) plus a DeprovisionArchive (16).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the on-premises changes are processed successfully I force an AD Connect synchronization</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial</p>
<p>The synchronization appears to succeed.&nbsp; I've waited 24 hours.</p>
<p>When I check the mailbox object in Exchange Online it retains&nbsp;the original&nbsp;remoteRecipientType as shown below:</p>
<p>get-mailbox | select name,remoterecipienttype</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RemoteRecipientType&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
----&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------------------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
user1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ProvisionMailbox, ProvisionArchive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I've attempted to delete the mailbox in the O365 Portal or with remote Powershell, but receive the error...</p>
<p>'Unable to perform the save operation. 'user1' is not within a valid server write scope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, when I attempt to disable just the archive (by running Disable-RemoteMailbox&nbsp;-archive)&nbsp;it appears to work as expected in that the Exchange Online mailbox shows that the archive is disabled for the user.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, if I run a DirSync,&nbsp;wait for
 the O365 mailbox to display a "DeprovisionArchive" status, and then&nbsp;Disable-RemoteMailbox again on the same user where I remove the archive, the O365 mailbox appears to be disassociated with the on-premises user as evident by the new RemoteRecipientType set
 to None, but the RecipientType set to UserMailbox.&nbsp; With the mailbox in this state I tried running Disable-Mailbox, but received the following error:</p>
<p>"This operation only works with Archive or PermanentlyDisable parameters."</p>
<p>So, I attempted to run "Disable-Mailbox user1 -permanentlyDisable" to remove the mailbox permanently... it worked, but I'm looking for a way to softDelete the mailbox, not permanently delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: are my expectations correct in that the&nbsp;Disable-RemoteMailbox command should softDelete the O365 mailbox?</p>
<p>Question: How do I get this to work?&nbsp; Assuming I need to retain the on-premises user account.&nbsp; P.S. I've found a work around that prescribes having DirSync disassociate the Azure AD user from on-premises and then delete it or another one that prescribes
 moving the on-premises user into an OU that isn't synchronized.&nbsp;These&nbsp;techniques seem like kluge workarounds for a PowerShell cmdLet not working as it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hoping that I'm misusing these PowerShell cmdLets and that you can give me a suggestion on how
 to get them to work as expected.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Me_5555,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This command <strong>
Disable-RemoteMailbox</strong> is not a “soft-deleted” behavior. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the scenario you mentioned, there is no way to achieve “soft-deleted”.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As mentioned in this article:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn186233(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn186233(v=exchg.150).aspx</a>, to achieve “soft-deleted”, the Office 365 Azure account needs to be deleted. So, in DirSync environment, the local AD account needs to be deleted, too. However, you need to “<em>retain
 the on-premises user account</em>”, as said above.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            Note that you can only have up to 3 dictionaries installed at any given time. If you try and install more, the dictionary application will prompt you to uninstall dictionaries until there are no more than 3 left installed.<br />
<br />
I have no idea why this (undocumented) restriction is in place and find it rather stupid, to be honest. But that's how it is, I'm afraid.

<h2>            Outlook for Android - Federation Services login page keeps appearing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are experiencing an issue with the Outlook app for Android (NOT OUTLOOK.COM). We use an Office 365 E2 Plan. This issue is only experienced on old android phones where the latest version available of Android is 4.1.2 - the outlook application versions
 this is experienced on are the latest 2 versions (2.0.38 and 2.0.39).</p>
<p><br />
The issue is as follows:<br />
<br />
When adding one of our domain accounts to outlook, using the office 365 option, we are taken to an office 365 login page, after entering the user's email address and tapping to the password field, we are redirected to our own federation services login, this
 is expected behaviour. After entering the password into the login screen, the account adds to outlook as normal.</p>
<p>Once some emails and information have downloaded into the app, and you try to use it in any way (this can include opening an email, changing tabs within the app, going to settings etc.) the app will take you back to the login screen again, and redirect to
 our federation services page.<br />
<br />
Again, this only happens on the older smartphones. On a newer phone running android 5.1.1, this issue does not occur. This only started happening recently, as of Monday 22nd February when updating to the newest application version. There are no issues loggin
 into the normal OWA, or accessing office 365 accounts in nay other way, this issue is only experienced in the Outlook application for Android devices.<br />
<br />
I have attempted to use the support tool within the application, but all this does is open an SMS chat window, where I have not received a response in 48 hours, despite sending in 14 or more messages.<br />
<br />
Please assist me with this issue.</p>

<p>hi atechadmin2716,<br />
<br />
based on your description, you failed to add an account into the outlook for android app. since this is an outlook for android app related issue, and this forum is focused on office 365 for business online service, we may provide limited information about it
 in this forum. your understanding is appreciated.</p>
<p>given the situation, we recommend you contact the app built-in support for dedicated help. you may also request bug fixes and submit feature requests via in-app support.<br />
<br />
note when using the in app support:<br />
1. it can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. it is recommended that the user turn on notifications for outlook in order to know when the technician is available.<br />
2. if you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you will see a response from the technician.<br />
3. it is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=24f3cb00-a0b1-49a2-a930-3a255721734b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d24f3cb00-a0b1-49a2-a930-3a255721734b" /></a>&nbsp;<br />

<p>Your assessment is incorrect, and actually it looks like you have not actually read through my post. Allow me to clarify:</p>
<p>The account adds to outlook fine, and downloads the mailbox contents without an issue. The issue is that when navigating through the app after the account has been added, our domains federation services login page keeps re-appearing at random.</p>
<p>Also, as I stated in this post, the app's inbuilt support has been frankly useless, they have not responded to a large number of messages I have sent to them in what is now 36 hours since I raised the issue.</p>
<p>I appreciate this may not be the correct forum for support, but I am running out of options. Is there a specific forum that may be able to provide better support?</p>

<p>Hi AtechAdmin2716,<br />
<br />
I understand that you encountered a poor support experience. Let me help to clarify here. It appear that you have reported an issue like below.<br />
1. After adding your Office 365 account into the Outlook for Android app, once there are emails and other information synced to the app, it could take you back to the login screen again and redirect to our federation services page when you try to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have identified that the above symptom is not an expected behavior. In order to move forward, you need to report this to the in-app support. This is the only channel where customer can share the usability experience to the application team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you do encounter issues when communicating with in-app support, you can let us know by providing the following information.</p>
<p>1. The email alias that they used to create the in-app support ticket</p>
<p>2. The exact question posted to the in-app support</p>
<p>3. Time/date creation of the in-app support ticket (correct time zone information)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the few points you need to refer to:</p>
<p>1. Make sure that an in-app support ticket was created within the last 24 hours when reporting back here.</p>
<p>2. Make sure notifications for Outlook is turned on within the device operating system so that the in-app support team able to respond to the case.</p>
<p>3. Refer to this FAQ if the issue falls into any of these categories. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/learn/outlook-for-ios-and-android-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Microsoft Warning Popped Up</h2>
                    The other night a red screen popped up warning me not to close the computer or log off that there was a terrible virus in the computer. &nbsp;It directed me to call "Microsoft" and gave me a number. &nbsp;I called the number and a foreign tech (sounded Indian) told
 me the problem required "hacking protection software". &nbsp;The company charged $499 and is called "Absolute Softech Ltd." &nbsp;I'm not sure whether this was a legitimate thing or whether I was hacked and sold a bill of goods. &nbsp;I don't see any special program installed,
 except I think they used a free cleanup program, "CCCleaner" and I believe Windows Defender is now on my computer. &nbsp;Was I scammed???? &nbsp;Before I call AMEX to dispute the charge I wanted someone to give me an opinion.

<h2>            Lost MS project data</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have asked this question before but being able to respond to the person who answered it was not possible - I got an error message?</p>
<p>I still have the same problem as before</p>
<p>I create a project and populate the project with data, saving info every few minutes</p>
<p>I specifically saved before the update that came up</p>
<p>When I open the file (the file name exists in my file directory) it is blank?</p>
<p>It says it is 380MB in size but there is no entered data?</p>
<p>The last time i lost this type of information, I at least had a PDF version from which to recreate the data. This time I have to redo all the info if the data is lost - a huge waste of time.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>Thank you<br />

<p>Ian,</p>
<p>Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Save group. What is the file format? What is the location? Do you have auto-save activated or not? If it is, turn it off and then put yourself on a conscious plan do periodically Save As back to the same file name (that's how I have
 always saved my files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need a template file to create annual holidays. All you need is a custom calendar, based on the Standard if appropriate, with all holidays or other non-working periods (e.g. summer shut-down). Once that is created it will be part of your Global
 and you can select it as the Project calendar for any new project you create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes strange behavior like you describe is due to corruption in a view. Try saving your file as XML. Then re-open the XML file in Project. Note, you will lose any custom formatting with this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, the issue could be related to a problem with your Global. In order to re-set the Global, first save your custom calendar to a new blank file using the Organizer. If you have other custom attributes, you could also save those but if one of those items
 is the underlying cause of the save problem, you might just end up transferring that problem back to the new Global, so chose carefully. Once you've saved the custom calendar, move your working Global to the trash. Then re-start Project. A new default Global
 will be created. Use the Organizer to move your saved attributes to the new Global.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi, Sainathchaturvedula .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you! <br />
<br />
I understand that you are unable to connect to the internet. Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.
<br />
<br />
You can perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then, press and hold the
<strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.
 Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing soft reset try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this helps. Thanks! </p>

<p>TyArcher,</p>
<p>Sounds like those forms might have become corrupt.&nbsp; Have you tried to restore from a back-up file to see if you get the same results?&nbsp; If you don't have a back-up I would recreate the forms, make sure all is well and they work okay and then&nbsp;*MAKE A BACK-UP*.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &lt;---Not yelling just making a point!</p>

<p>TyArcher,</p>
<p>Not sure if you're still seeing this problem, but if you are, maybe some of the following suggestions might help:</p>
<p>1. Do the underlying record sources of these forms open ok (ie table/query)?</p>
<p>2. Does the issue reproduce when you hold down the shift key when opening your database?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Does the problem occur if you boot your machine in safe mode (F8) (We have seen some hang/not responding issues caused by third party apps, although usually it's with tables rather than forms).</p>
<p>4. If you create a new blank database and import all objects, do your 2 forms still display the same issue?</p>
<p>Hope this helps!<br />

            When you add a google calendar to Outlook.com/Office 365, it will sync to all devices but is not (currently) writable in Outlook desktop. This may or may not change in future versions of Outlook. 
<br />
<br />If you subscribe to it in Outlook desktop it's also not writable and won't sync to the other devices. Devices can link directly to the account though, where it will definitely be writable.

            <p>You're correct in what you've determined... Mac Excel does not provide the <strong>
Find &amp; Select</strong> button, nor does it allow for <strong>Find All</strong> or anything comparable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the items you see listed in Win Excel's Find &amp; Select dropdown essentially are just a few of the options provided by the Go To - Special feature. If you simply want quicker access you might consider using a macro &amp; assigning a keystroke to it.<br />

<p>Do you have VBA code in the Workbook Open event that is attempting to rearrange something on the worksheet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error could possibly be due to inserting columns or rows and there is an object that would be moved off the worksheet to allow the inserts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so,&nbsp;ensure that you Open Excel first (not double click file in windows Explorer)&nbsp;and hold the Shift key while opening and then edit the offending code and/or move (or remove) the object that it is attempting to shift.</p>

            Could also be a worksheet with more rows or columns of data than can be accommodated in earlier versions of Excel and if so then attempt to open with Excel 2007 and reduce the number of rows and columns with data.

            Why would a file save without an error message?&nbsp; I didn't run into the error until I opened the file the next day?

            With these type of errors one can only speculate on what it might be. Sorry that I can't help any more. Maybe someone else might come up with other things to try.
