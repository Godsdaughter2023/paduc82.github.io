<h2>            Can&#39;t install antivirus on Win 10 Technical Preview</h2>
                    <p>Tried to install Avast Free antivirus but keep on getting errors. Unless the Window Defender is working well, I won't dare to stay online for long.</p>
<p>Don't know whether this is related - I did a clean install of the technical preview on a spare SSD. After that I connect back my 3 other hdds &amp; boot up again. I was able to access my other files &amp; folders &amp; played movies from all the partitions. After I
 shut down, I swopped the SSD with another containing my current Win 7 OS. Before the Win7 could start CHKDSK did a check for all my 3 other hdds - total 9 partitions. At the end of every check the message read</p>
<p>"CHKDSK verifying USN Journal" This has never happened before. When I did a reboot the whole sequence start again.</p>
<p>Hope there's a solution for this</p>

            <p>On my clean-install(s) of the Tech Preview, Defender is on and doing it's thing (regardless of whether it's as good as AVG/Kaspersky/Norton/Avast/etc is up for debate [which I don't care to get involved in]).

</p><p>I can also say that AVG business edition won't install either. I've tried it both on a Virtual Machine and the PC I've dual-booted. I'm guessing the conflict is with Windows Defender, but I'm not sure.

            I have&nbsp;heard that Avira runs well on Windows 10 TP but don't take my word for it, it's always better to stay with WIndows Defender till the AV vendors release versions compatible with Windows 10. Yes, you are right that the other third-party vendors antivirus
 programs are better than Windows Defender, but please use Windows Defender until there has been released a compatible version of your favourite AV program. Windows 10 has enough problems for now on it's own, no need to add an AV which might crash the PC.

            Windows Defender is built in, so you have some protection. Install COMODO free and you will be fine.

<h2>            Using mail merge to create labels - unable to print select pages</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used mail merge to create labels. Using an Avery template. Everything looks fine, however, when I try to print a select number of pages, for example, I just want to print the first 5 pages of the document, selecting them in the print dialogue box,
 the whole document (about 15 pages) starts to print. Tried the "print range" function and "print selected pages" function to no avail. Thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using latest version of Word and Excel for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you try to do that in the Print dialog that appears when you merge the document to the printer, it does not work.
</p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that relates to the axiom "Word doesn't know what a page is.". If printing directly from the main document the merge is being done one record at a time. Pagination is imposed on the fly, so Word has no idea how many 'pages' will be generated. Along
 with that, Labels actually are a Table which is being built on the fly as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When merging to the printer the range of records has to be controlled prior to printing, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the record source,</li><li>by using Word's Sort/Filter feature, or</li><li>by using the Merge Range control [But it appears that the job can't be constrained to partial sheets. IOW, if there are 30 labels/sheet &amp; you specify a Range that comprises only 1 record, all 30 records on the sheet containing that 1 will be printed.]</li></ul>

have you checked in the nokia store if there is a newer version? as this is a user to user forum only for nokia products and services, you will need to contact the application developer of Viber directly.

    <title>Refer to form control from Navigation Form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> accessorizer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refer to form control from Navigation Form</h2>
                    If someone sends me this link <a href="http://access.mvps.org/access/forms/frm0031.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://access.mvps.org/access/forms/frm0031.htm</a>&nbsp;I am going to have a fit.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yes, this link is sometimes helpful, but most of the time trying what it suggests does not work with Navigation Forms, not to mention that no one seems to be able to explain how to define the control of a subform and how to find that since it's not the
 Form Name. Luckily I'm not trying to do reports referencing from Nav Form today (I've given up) so what I want should actually be possible--I've done it before somehow.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you haven't noticed I hate MS' handling of Navigation Forms. It looked like a good idea, until I realized everything I get working no longer works when run from the Navigational Form because referencing things through it doesn't work well and MS (per
 lovely horrible usual) has no explanation on how to do this. It's like you're NOT supposed to use anything other than the "Wizards" that make craptastic Windows 95'-type reports, you know?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>The Issue:</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>Some background: I'm calling reports to open and print to a predefined directory file at the push of a button via VBA. The parameter that usually is called for in the recordsource query of these reports is instead replaced by the value of a control on
 the form with the buttons. It works perfect when not nested in a Navigation Form.</div>
<div>
<div>[Sidenote]: The names are crappy because I just created duplicates of 2 queries and 2 reports and edited them to be able to run them for a different purpose without parameters, but with form control defined values...yeah I tried docmd.openreport and recordsource
 dancing around in VBA...just ignore it.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Navigation Form: "NavigationFormEquipment"</div>
<div>Subform: "GageRetirementForm"</div>
<div>SubformControl to reference: "Combo4"</div>
<div>Report Recordsource: a query "LifetimeUsageQuerynoparameters"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"LifetimeUsageQuerynoparameters" query</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>SELECT *</div>
<div>FROM Tracking LEFT JOIN Equipment ON Tracking.ID = Equipment.TSFGageID</div>
<div>WHERE (((Tracking.ID)=Equipment.[TSFGageID]))</div>
<div>AND Equipment.[TSFGageID] = Forms!GageRetirementForm.Combo4</div>
<div>ORDER BY Tracking.Date_Used DESC;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So ^that^ works fine....how can I make it work fine when the form with the buttons (GageRetirementForm) is accessed through the Navigation Form?</div>
                </div>

            <p>You can use this style reference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms!NavigationFormEquipment.[name of the subform control].Form.Combo4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the name of the subform <strong><em>control</em></strong> is almost certainly NOT the name of any form object.&nbsp; I suspect it was named NavigationSubform by default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I think all the confusion and difficulties of dealing with multiple forms alternately displayed in a single subform control is not worth the effort.&nbsp; Using a tab control with each subform on its own page just makes more sense and eliminates all
 the nav form hassles.</p>

</p><p>If you will make a call from the states to UK, you no longer need to have a UK number since you're making

<p>They have special tools (software and hardware) to bring back a bricked phone to life. Sometimes it might even require replacing hardware components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won't say it's not possible to buy these equipment, but their costs are astronomical and they are practically of no use to an end user like you or me, without the expertise to operate them. Moreover, the software that is used to recover the phones won't
 be made available to the general public even for a price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, you cannot do it yourself. Send your N73 to Nokia and they'll fix it for you.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not economic to start replacing hardware components at home. However, if this is unnecessary, it should be possible to use software to rectify problems without sending the device away for weeks and paying for the privilege. The idea that
 the software is too difficult to use sounds a bit patronising if you're an IT professional! In reality, it's just a good excuse for Nokia to charge customers for something which is not necessarily their fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the software being of practically no use to the general public, on the contrary, looking at the number of bricked phones advertised cheaply, by repairing them you could make a small fortune on the resale value!</p>

<p>Because I'm working in an industry where we sometimes have to deal with "bricked" electronic devices (definitely not the ones that you see around), I can very well tell you that it's not that easy for an end user to get a bricked phone working. Sometimes
 temporary modifications to the circuitry are required to use the specialized software tools. In certain cases, the interfaces to be used are different from what we use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know Nokia charges heavily for service and spares, but we have to bite the bullet. You can raise your concerns in the Contact Us link on the Nokia website. I won't say taht you will get a very warm, immediate response. But sometimes, bugging them helps
 in the long run.</p>

<h2>            What can we hope for in Win 10 re&#58; VSS&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Volume Snapshot Services</strong> for managing shadow copies are clearly still a part of Windows (as well they should be; they solve several problems marvelously well).</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">However, the level of support that will be available&nbsp;in Windows 10 is unclear.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>We see, for example, that the <strong>Previous Versions </strong>tab has reappeared in File Explorer.&nbsp; Thank you for this, Microsoft!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>But there is <strong>no GUI</strong> for configuring/scheduling&nbsp;a recurring VSS-integrated System Image backup (as there was up to Windows 8).&nbsp; This can still be accomplished in a bit more geeky way by scheduling an appropriate
<strong>wbadmin </strong>command in the Task Scheduler, but that's not really going to be accessible to a lot of users.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Also, the <strong>vssadmin </strong>command is hobbled as compared to the one available to users of Windows Server operating systems.&nbsp; You can't, for example, manually create a shadow copy with the vssadmin.exe that is provided with Windows 10.<br />
</li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I guess my question is this:&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Can we hope for the delivery of more complete VSS functionality in Windows 10, including some of the missing features I mentioned above?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">And, I'd like to make a suggestion:&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">As long as Previous Versions is being resurrected, it would be really nice if a fully featured browser could be provided (e.g., maybe a kind of "view" in File Explorer showing folder trees and files for a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">particular snapshot</span>, similar to 3rd party software Z-VSScopy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of stuff may not interest portable device users much, but folks running desktop computers care how well their backups are integrated&nbsp;with Windows.</p>

            In my opinion this should have been the number one fix before windows 10 was released in a preview. The further they get in builds the more functionality is taken away<br />

    <title>Retrieving Data from Access Database Using Barcodes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Retrieving Data from Access Database Using Barcodes</h2>
                    I have a&nbsp; MS Access database of equipment inventory. I know how to assign a barcode to each record, but what I would like to do is to scan a barcode to retrieve the record of that specific piece of equipment using a tablet or android phone. Please ask
 me to clarify if this doesn't make sense, or point me in the right direction if this isn't the best place to ask this question.

            <p>Just bear in mind that when you scan a barcode, Access (or any other program) just sees it as somebody typing very fast and very accurately. A scanned code is just text and can be handled like any other text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest using an unbound Textbox on your form, and using the AfterUpdate event of the textbox to set a form's filter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem will be that this assumes that you have Access open... and Access doesn't run on phones or tablets, unless the phone is running Windows. Once you scan it, what do you want to do with it? Retrieve a record from an Access table?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As John pointed out scanning a barcode is just another form of user input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to use the built in camera on your phone or tablet to do the scanning? This probably won't work as the phone or table has no way to transmit the scanned code to the Access program running on a PC. Also Access does not do well with wireless
 connections. So even if you were running Access on the device used for scanning its not going to work well.</p>

<p>Ok, forget it. Access is not the tool here. Power Apps may be. Unless you were specifically supplying the tablets and they were Windows tablets and you used SQL Server as the data store this is unlikely to work.

            <p>I appreciate the help. The reason I was leaning towards Access is because I already have the database built, and it includes records for the past two years. It looks like PowerApps will work without having to rebuild the database and users can use their
 own phones and tablets. Also instead of barcodes, I can simply have the user input the ID number to find the equipment.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

            You can set up your gamil account on this phone just like you do on your Android phone. You are then best not to also sync to Microsoft My Phone as this will create duplicates.

<p>Hi Patti,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, there's no option to share a PowerPoint presentation to multiple devices simultaneously using the PowerPoint app.
<span>However, you can recommend this feature added in the future by sending a feedback.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>You can post this<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong><a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288952-powerpoint-for-ipad-iphone-ios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here

<p>
</p><p>There might be third-party apps that you can use to share your presentation simultaneously, but it is best to consult your device manufacturer about this so they can suggest a safe and compatible app for your device.

    <title>Build 10240 and system restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windybritchs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10240 and system restore</h2>
                    Has anyone been willing to try the system restore issue with build 10240 to see if it messes up modern apps and store as previous builds have done?&nbsp; I will not right now,&nbsp;due to the fact it would take me over 4 hours to killdisk / re-format, put build
 10166 back on my system just to spend even more time waiting on 10240 to install again. Just a thought since I really have not found any issues with this build as of yet.

            This I do understand this,&nbsp;which is why I am unwilling to try, until an .iso or working activation key becomes available for 10240.&nbsp; As for previously activated "build" mine was and I converted the .esd to a bootable usb image, so I sort of assume I could
 put a clean install back on, But I could be completely wrong about that.

            <p>They changed the Licensing servers and turned off the ability to give out new activations.</p>
<p>If you have a current activated windows 10 build&nbsp;and you run windows update only it will stay activated.</p>
<p>If you format or try to reinstall windows 10 fresh you will not be able to get it to activate again.</p>
<p>They might turn the activation for new installs back on soon and as well provide a new ISO (but not confirmed yet)</p>

<p>Hi EV91,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Advertising support! I understand after going through the steps provided in our help article, you did not have the option to associate an ad group with In-Market Audiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, the In-Market Audiences feature is only available in the United States. If your account location is set to another country, you will only see the two options of remarketing lists and custom audience lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feature is also available as a pilot if your account location is set to Australia, Canada, France, Germany, or the United Kingdom. If your account is set to one of these locations, we can look into having you added to the pilot, so you can utilize the
 In-Market Audience feature.</p>
<p>

<br />
1. Which browser are you using on the computer?<br />
2. Are you able to use Internet explorer without any issue?<br />
3. Which blog are you referring to?<br />
<br />
You may try using Internet Explorer and check if the issue occur.<br />
</p>
<div>If the issue occur in Internet Explorer and continue to occur in Google Chrome, then the problem seems to be with Java upgrade. You may try to re-install Java&nbsp;and&nbsp;see if that works.</div>

<h2>            Pivot table Group Field ignores start date if before start of data</h2>
                    <p>I have a Pivot table and am using "group field" to group&nbsp;dates in the table rows into weeks. The data set begins at the beginning of a month but part way through a week.
</p>
<p>Setting the&nbsp;Group Field&nbsp;to the Monday before and counting 7 days from there doesn't work as Excel ignores start date if it is before the start of data and starts the 7 days from the first of the month.
</p>
<p>How can I get it to work Monday to Monday without inserting a fake bit of data? Cheers</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>The settings you should have in the Group dialog are as follows:</p>
<p>under Auto</p>
<p>Starting at <strong>unchecked</strong> and 27/02/2012</p>
<p>Ending at <strong>checked</strong> and date will be the largest one in your data.&nbsp; (as this is for one month only then 30/03/2012 is the last working day)</p>
<p>What this does is force the start day to be a Monday and lets Excel determine where to stop.&nbsp; If the data sheet is repopulated with the following months data then the PivotTable will still know to start on a Monday and be able to adjust the end date according
 to the new data.</p>
<p>By checking the&nbsp;Start at under Auto refreshing the pivot will allow Excel to recalculate where to start grouping by seven days, based on the data in the source list.</p>
<p>If you need/want to change the label for the first group 27/02/2012 - 01/03/2012 you can amend it but you may have to re-edit it each time the pivot table is refreshed.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>Issue between accounts, onedrive and apps - failing to load - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steeps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue between accounts, onedrive and apps - failing to load</h2>
                    <p>Had this issue for weeks now, trying to follow similar issues on the community and source help from Microsoft/B2X. Unfortunately due to how complex this issue seems to be no single department is able to help and instead blames it on each other. Running a
 lumia 930 with windows phone 10 (10.0.14393.1198).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start off how the issue developed I had to clear out my onedrive online account as it was limited to 5gb (I do have a 365 account but that library is too big for the phone to sync).&nbsp; Even when the account was cleared photos would no longer upload unless
 they were added to albums wheras before they would sync fine in root.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Early January I noticed whatsapp would no longer load all the time, often had to re-login. Assumed it was their issue and it would fix itself. Then other apps started to fail, mostly banking and a few others I have had since 8.1. So far the consensus is
 to wipe the phone and start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where the fun begins. Onedrive has not been syncing, I am able to add contacts to my phone but they do not appear on the web. I can add contacts to the web but they will not appear on my phone. I don't know how far back this issue started but according
 to outlook my last sync was in August, which means wiping my phone I will lose 6 months worth of data. Trying to manually open the onedrive app gives a black screen (no loading) then crashes back to the start screen. Content will sync to the phone but the
 phone cannot upload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B2X suggested there was an issue with my account as when I go through to account settings and select "synchronise" it flags up "attention required", selecting that then "fixes the account" and confirms it has been fixed, but straight away it goes back to
 "attention required" and repeats. This process is not fixing whatever the issue is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft support for accounts says that as I am able to log in to my account there is no issue and B2X needs to further investigate but after 2 hours of troubleshooting they had no answers apart from to wipe the phone and possibly lose 6 months worth of
 data. They did suggest trying the "contacts &amp; messaging backup" app, but apps won't load on the phone, they get stuck at "loading".</p>
<p>
</p><p>B2X says it's Microsoft accounts that need to fix the issue, Microsoft accounts says B2X needs to troubleshoot it further, Onedrive team don't have a clue and says it could be either as they don't deal with Windows Phone, I'm left with a phone that cannot
 open apps, update or sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What makes this even more strange is every so often an app does load briefly, but try again 2 minutes later and it gets stuck on the loading screen. This leads me to believe it is an accounts issue or something server side as the apps function fully when
 they can load, but it only allows it roughly once a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manual phone "backup" feature works, but only saves one copy at a time, contacts have not synced to my live account, will SMS have synced within the manual backup or does that require onedrive to work? No one was able to clarify what was saved and what
 wasn't. I'd happily wipe the phone if I knew I could restore it from the backup and not lose 6 months of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious answer would be to move on to a different handset and scrap trying to use Windows Phone, but as a phone and connected device it still works great and is straight foward to use, I'm reluctant to spend money on a new phone that isn't really an
 upgrade when the one I have work(ed) fine. Not that it counts for much but I've always had a Windows Phone as my primary handset since 2005.</p>

<p>I have 2 accounts, one is my personal phone account running on a free live account that gets 5gb of free storage, my other account is my work account with office 365 which gets 1tb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone account is my free one, always has been. This is used to store my contacts, sms, local documents and upload photos to my 5gb onedrive space, when my account gets full, I archive old photos that I don't need to reduce the space, it's currently sitting
 at 1gb free. This is done through onedrive.live.com and stored on the pc manually, no sync. Before win10 I used to do all my own backups manually with SD cards but with this nokia phone it insisted on doing it all itself with the cloud to make things "easier".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My work account is purely an office365 account that I use for email with exchange, no onedrive syncing at all because the phone cannot store that amount of data, so didn't even try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the phone is locked to the same account without doing a hard reset, it's not possible to "log out and log in" to try and fix the issue.</p>

<p>Hi Steeps, <br />
<br />
<br />
We understand that you are hesitant to reset your phone as you will lose 6 months worth of data. However, this is the only way to resolve multiple issues with your Lumia 930. You can download and install the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a></strong> on your PC, then connect your phone and reinstall the Windows. It's possible
 that the device's software is corrupted, that's why some apps don't work properly including the OneDrive. We suggest that you back up your photos, videos, and documents through your PC to avoid data loss. Contacts on your phone are synced to Microsoft account.
 If some of your contacts are missing in <strong><a href="https://office.live.com/start/People.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">People - Outlook.com</a></strong>, just add it manually to have them back on your phone when you set up your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so that we can provide further assistance.</p>

</p><p>Well I lost everything, not because of the phone not syncing but because when I upgraded from 8.1 to 10 on the restore using the device recovery tool.... it wiped out my backup with the 8.1 backup and deleted all of my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In onedrive this morning the backup was there for my phone, had no ability to download it... windows update wrote over it with the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not lost 6 months of data, I've lost 3 years.</p>

<p>Thank you for updating us. The main purpose of the recovery tool is to reinstall Windows on your device. If you read all the information in the link we provided (Windows Device Recovery Tool: FAQ), it says "To avoid Phone Backup Overwrite after switching
 to Windows 10, you must rename the device. You can do this by going to <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; About</strong> and tapping
<strong>Edit</strong> name." We believe that your data wasn't deleted as you still see your backup in OneDrive. If you will perform a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10768/windows-10-mobile-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>hard reset</strong></a>, you have a chance to restore your files from backup. Just to verify, is everything on your Lumia 930 now working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>The device was reinstalled with the default phone name which is why I noticed the backup was different. My backup isn't in onedrive, only "NOKIA" is available and not the original "PHONENAME" which was there the day before. If I perform a hard reset the
 only recovery option will be "NOKIA" which was taken during the reinstall process as "PHONENAME" is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got call logs, managed to salvage some SMS using a PC app that I loaded to check contents before wiping the phone, but anything app related the data is gone, all of whatsapp is lost and anything with synced app settings is lost. Contacts didn't sync
 so I've re-added key contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone managed to update all the way to 2007 instead of being stuck at 1198, onedrive does open and apps do load so it is working better than before, but relying on cloud for backups when usb drag and drop (how I eventually managed to extract the SMS) used
 to be fine is frustrating.</p>

            We're glad to know that your phone is working better than before. It's really possible that your backup in OneDrive has been overwritten after upgrading to Windows 10. But if you have a chance to set up your Microsoft account in another Windows 10 Mobile,
 please do. This will give us a conclusion. <br />
<br />
Feel free to get back to us for further assistance.

    <title>Nokia 1520&#58; music just skips to next song - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> circus_alchemist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 1520&#58;  music just skips to next song</h2>
                    <p>All apps experience this issue: &nbsp;Groove, Pandora, Spotify. &nbsp;(not an app issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: &nbsp;music player will not play but will instead just skip to the next song (repeatedly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround: &nbsp;only solution so far is a device restart. &nbsp;This is, of course, not optimal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else have this? &nbsp;Anyone know the cause? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feels like a driver not coming out of sleep correctly, or similar, but I'm not really a firmware guy.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may encounter issues like this when the apps are not up-to-date, there is a pending software update, and other factors. Let's try to isolate the issue. When did the issue start? What is the OS build currently installed in your phone? To check go to
<strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; More info &gt; OS build</strong>. Also, make sure that the apps are up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>What is an SSL?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>SSL is the name of the technology that encrypts the conversation between your PC and a web server.&nbsp; &nbsp;It's what keeps your web traffic private.&nbsp; &nbsp;Each web site has the option to provide a normal "http://www.xxxxx" web address plus a "http<strong>s</strong>:/www.xxxx"
 web address.&nbsp; &nbsp;The extra "s" shows that the connection is considered secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of technical details that I'm not sure you're interested in.... so I'll just refer to this article:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security</a></p>

            <p>You can restore all of the built-in Building Blocks (TOC formats, headers, footers, page number formats, etc.) as follows: Exit Word and then delete the Built-In Building Blocks.dotx file in your user profile (to find the file you have to display hidden
 files and folders in Windows Explorer). Restart Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that you mustn't delete the&nbsp;version of the Built-In Building Blocks.dotx file in the Program Files folder.&nbsp;</p>
