<h2>            upgrading vista to windows 7 fails because of hp quick launch buttons, which I had already uninstalled</h2>
                    Trying to upgrade from Vista to Windows 7 (4 times). &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>(a) &nbsp;In Upgrade Advisor, it says it doesn't &nbsp;have info on Adobe Shockwave Player&nbsp;version 10.2.0.023,&nbsp;Get an update to a compatible version . &nbsp;I uninstalled that, installed version 11.6.3.633, then uninstalled that, and searched for any "shockwave" files,
 found none. &nbsp;Run Advisor again, it still sees Shockwave 10.20.023</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(b) &nbsp;I go on to W7 "Install Now" - it stops to say HP Quick Launch Buttons from Human Interface won't work with W7, get rid of it. &nbsp;I already had uninstalled it, and had searched for files with any of those words without finding any. &nbsp;I continue install
 W7, but it says the install failed and it reinstalled Vista (just fine, thanks.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get past this and use the upgrade I paid for?</div>
</div>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span><br />
1.&nbsp;When exactly the upgrade fails?<br />
2.&nbsp;What is the exact error message received when the upgrade fails?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Which version of Windows Vista is installed on the computer? What is the version of Windows 7 that you are trying to upgrade to?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Have you clicked on Upgrade or Custom install?</span></p>
<p><span>5. Was the roll back fine? If no, any error messages received?</span></p>
<p><span>6. Are you still&nbsp;getting Adobe Shockwave and HP Quick Launch issues while upgrading?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This can also be due to some third party software conflict. </span><span>You may put the system in clean boot state and then try to upgrade. Refer to the following link to do the same:</span></p>

            1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
If the upgrade fails again, I would backup and do a custom install.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/</a><br />
<br />
How to do a custom install while preserving your personal data:<br />
<br />
<br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)<br />
<br />
select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.<br />
<br />
You will receive the following warning:<br />
<br />
The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.<br />
<br />
(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK<br />
<br />
Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.<br />
<br />
When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and drivers.<br />
<br />
You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.<br />

1. When exactly the upgrade fails?<br />
&nbsp;In the last of 4 steps - "Installing features and updates"<br />
&nbsp;It said it was 62% through, approximately 400000 out of 477291.<br />
&nbsp;At that point it restarted itself, and eventually restored Vista.</p>
<p>2. What is the exact error message received when the upgrade fails?</p>
<p>&nbsp;"The upgrade was not successful.<br />
&nbsp;Your previous version of Windows is being restored.<br />
&nbsp;Do not restart your computer during this time."<br />
&nbsp;(Note - there was no other message - it went through smoothly<br />
&nbsp;to this point.&nbsp; On previous tries, it had interrupted the Upgrade<br />
&nbsp;to tell me that the HP Quick Launch was incompatible.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. Which version of Windows Vista is installed on the computer? <br />
&nbsp;Windows Vista Home Premium, Service Pack 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the version of Windows 7 that you are trying to upgrade to?<br />
&nbsp;Windows 7 Home Premium includes Service Pack 1,<br />
&nbsp;includes Windows anytime upgrade <br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Have you clicked on Upgrade or Custom install?<br />
&nbsp;Upgrade<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Was the roll back fine? If no, any error messages received?<br />
&nbsp;Just fine. No messages except that in Question 2.<br />
&nbsp;Vista is working as before.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6. Are you still getting Adobe Shockwave and HP Quick Launch issues while <br />
upgrading?<br />
&nbsp;Shockwave -Yes- I tried:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) uninstalling the old version<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)installing a new version and uninstalling, and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)installing the new version 11.6.3.633 and leaving it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all tries, the Upgrade Advisor says <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;"(exclamation point in a triangle)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adobe Shockwave Player&nbsp;version 10.2.0.023<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adobe Systems, Inc. &nbsp;Update available <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't have compatibility information about <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;this version of the program.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get an update to a compatible version"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there some way to get rid of traces of the old version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;HP QL buttons -No- I installed a new driver, and now the Upgrade <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Advisor just gives it a check mark and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Check Windows Update after installing Windows 7 to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;make sure you have the latest driver for this device, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise it may not work."<br />
&nbsp;(Note there were 9 total similar notations, plus this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;NVIDIA nForce System Management Controller - check mark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Free update available <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturer provides software to use this device<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;on Windows 7.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the software for free from the manufacturer's website. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--- I tried, but "your driver is up to date" or some such.</p>
<p><br />
Note - These answers apply to my 6th and 7th attempts to upgrade.&nbsp; Between </p>
<p>attempts 6 and 7 I did:<br />
-- a complete checkdisk (it seemed to find no issues, but after the fifth step<br />
it spit out a page of print and then closed before I could read it), and<br />
-- a clean boot.<br />
For attempt 7 I was not there for the finish, so I'm not sure about the details of
</p>
<p>my answer to question 1. above, but the timing and other results were the same as
</p>
<p>attempt 6.</p>
<p>Also - Before using Upgrade Advisor and Upgrade, I turned off and then uninstalled the McAfee Security Suite from AOL, and made sure the Windows firewall was turned off.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />

            That is interesting. I wonder why the pointer doesn't work then. When I shorten it (to the intro and the first level, for example), it works, but it does not work with all of the frames. In case you are curious what software I used to make it, I used
<a href="http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RealWorld Cursor Editor</a> to create the pointer. That application is quite nice. I have created quite a few pointers with it (including a birthday cake, which I had intended to animate, but didn't due to complexity,

 due to a bug). If that is the case, I will contact the developers about that (if I can).

            I looked through all the file format specifications I could find and I sure don't see any type of limit in the specs for ANI cursors if there is one. &nbsp;I'll try the cursors here too.

<h2>            Battery Remaining time on Win 10 Anniversary update and HP x360 Envoy</h2>
                    <p>I have a new HP x360 Envoy 15" PC that I received last December -- everything works fine except Windows doesn't show remaining time on the battery - only a percentage.&nbsp; Calls to HP said that this feature was taken out of Windows and to contact Microsoft
 &nbsp;That is strange because it works on my other PCS's that have the anniversary update.&nbsp;&nbsp; Third party utilities like Save Battery have remaining time grayed out. I find this frustrating because I really would like an estimate of how long my battery will last.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell me what is gong on? Is there an installed update that I can remove to enable this feature -- If MS took it out, put it back in - that is a valuable feature knowing about how much time is left in a battery and how fast we are using
 it. </p>

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 uses "<strong><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/commercialize/design/device-experiences/modern-standby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Modern Standby</a></strong>" (used to be "Connected Standby" power state with the
 Always-On/Always-Connected feature). </p>
<p>With Modern Standby, your system can't really calculate how much time is left. You will have to look up on how to disable it to be able to see how much time is left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other devices running with Windows 10 probably doesn't support Modern Standby, that's why the battery meter on them works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>I have a new HP laptop and when I hover over battery icon it says how much time is remaining, but it will only do this if the battery is not charging. Try it with charger turned off.

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I own a "Lenovo - Thinkpad - W510"</div>
<div>I installed windows 8.1, and after the installation I could use the camera.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But, I started updating drivers for all the hardware, downloaded from Lenovo driver center.</div>
<div>In the process I updated, camera driver also.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, camera is not working, I tried all the ways, installing - uninstalling driver, but nothing is working.</div>
<div>How can I repair this issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is what I found on Lenovo site</div>

<div>Based on your suggestions, I tried all the options, like installing the driver in windows 7 compatibility mode, installing windows 8 driver etc.</div>
<div>But, nothing helped. Camera is still not working and it is very annoying.</div>
<div>Should I run windows 8.1 installer in repair mode ? will that help ?</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since Lenovo says the Windows default driver should work there should be no need<br />
to try other drivers (of course that is assuming the article does apply to your specifc<br />
model. Have you updated the BIOS, chipset, and other major drivers at Lenovo? <br />
<br />
As that article states if there are issues with the driver you should contact Lenovo Support<br />
which as OEM&nbsp;is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows.<br />
Also check with the Lenovo Forums to see if others have the same issue.<br />

<p><span><span>You have two options to be able to create Stills from the Videos. You may either use print screen option or use the snipping tool. Play the Video
 you want to create still with and pause to the position where you want the still to be created.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Snipping tool:
</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open Snipping Tool by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, and then clicking Snipping Tool.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click the arrow next to the New button, select a snip type from the menu, and then use your mouse or tablet pen to capture a snip.</span></span></p>

            Replace the hard drive?<br />
First, boot from the Windows CD and press R at the repair Windows screen. When you are prompted for the Administrator password just hit enter. It has no password. Type chkdsk /r at the command prompt and press enter. It will scan your hard drive for errors.
 Pay attention to the errors that it tries or fixes. Type exit when it's done to reboot. Boot from the hard disk and when it comes back up, click Start &gt; Run &gt; eventvwr.msc &gt; Press enter or OK &gt; Go to Application, Type: Information, Source: Winlogon. Paste
 and copy to your next post.<br />

DST Short Test Failed
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<div>
<p>If a DST Short Test fails on your computer, and you receive an error message or log entry that reflects the failure, this is likely caused by a failing hard drive. However, certain software will also cause the DST Short Test to fail. McAfee and other anti-virus
 programs may cause the DST Short Test Failure error to generate. Other corrupted applications may also throw the error. Re-install the anti-virus program, or return your computer to an earlier point in time with System Restore.</p>

Hi FawnFerrin</p>
<p>What issues were you experiencing that led you to decide to reinstall the operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failing a DST short test could mean that your hard drive is failing. It could also mean that the device drivers were not installed in the correct order after you reinstalled the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First and most important step at this point is to try to backup your important personal files to an external drive just to be safe.
</p>
<p>When all you files are safely backed up, You can try reinstalling the OS again, then follow the driver installation order&nbsp;linked below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Dell requires that, after a reinstall of the OS,&nbsp;device drivers be installed in a particular order for the system to work correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dell driver installation order</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/downloads/en/driver_install_order?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;~lt=print&amp;DoNotRedirect=y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/downloads/en/driver_install_order?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;~lt=print&amp;DoNotRedirect=y</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/help</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can scan for and obtain the correct drivers for your system, using your service tag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/index.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When finished, rerun the Dell DST Short test to see if it passes. If the rerun results in another failure, then I suggest&nbsp;&nbsp;replacing the hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            hi there,

 tells me that not enough space for bad clusters. So what to do then. Anyone? Sorry for posting on ur stuff didn't really know how else to post.</p>

            <p>This answer might not be much help <em>now</em>&nbsp;to Fawn, however anyone else in trouble might find relief in testing the hard disk in another CPU. This not only prevents you from replacing the drive for no reason, but it will conclusively identify your hardware
 or software issue. If your hard disk is there, but the DST short test results in a failure, you might be experiencing driver issues and this can happen almost inevitably by downgrading your systems OS, or after a fresh install, not installing drivers in their
 correct order (or in Fawns case, a few just weren't installed at all). As a result of a bad reinstall, you might have created one too many partitions in which case the PC doesn't know what to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I reccomend you try is using the hard drive you have in another Computer. Test your disk with any Live CD with the capability. Delete all partitions that have data in it if you're able to see your Disk. Reinstall whatever OS you desire (this can be
 done with official Windows, recovery disk, .IMG/.ISO and I suggest you try the latter and mount it on a USB using bootable USB software), but remember that your drivers are apart of your installation process and generally all of them need to be enabled for
 optimal system stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DST short tests do not determine whether you need to replace your Hard Drive, their error codes do. Please do not just throw out your hard drive because of a test.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Question what oh it does not respond to a cd? Or even respond to fixing anything? My computer just shut down and I have to its the esc button in order to do anything. But I'm still not able to perform any task but a chkdsk /f then a chkdsk /r which then
 tells me that not enough space for bad clusters. So what to do then. Anyone? Sorry for posting on ur stuff didn't really know how else to post.</p>

You need to use a USB instead then. Less buggy than CD's which will scratch and what not. Get an 8 GB or so. If you have a product key, you should be able to download and mount the image on the USB. And if your BIOS isn't recognizing your CD ROM anymore I would
 reset back to defaults. Press f2-10, maybe enable Legacy Boot if at all possible.&nbsp;

            Hey there, Pradeep
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. 
<br />
<br />This is something I am not sure with, however if you know what your doing you can give it a try. After you have done this, please log into a machine and click the OneDrive icon and select the three dots at the top right. 
<br />
<br />You will then see a list of options, please select settings and a new window will appear. Then select general where Files on Demand will be shown and you can see if this is enabled or disabled. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Regards,       
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Network upload speed limited to 0.60 Mbps after upgrade from Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded from home laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad W520) from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; After running for ~1 month and getting use to the new UI, I decided it was safe to upgrade from Home computer as well (ASUS P8Z77-V LK, 32GB men, etc.).&nbsp; Prior to
 upgrading, both my laptop and my home computer were getting 80+ Mbps network throughput as measured by speedtest.net.&nbsp; After the upgrade to Windows 10, my laptop still get 80+ Mbps in both directions, but my home PC is getting 80+ Mbps download, and just 0.60
 Mbps upload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's y configuration and what I've tried so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verizon FIOS modem -&gt; Netgear nighthawk R7000 -&gt; laptop &amp; Home PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All LAN cabling is CAT 6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was getting 80+Mbps with the PC when running Windows 7 (prior to the upgrade).</p>
<p>I tested the laptop with both wired and wireless connections and I get 80+ Mbps with both wired and wireless connections. (cable modem and router appears to be working fine).</p>
<p>I tried swapping the LAN cables used between the laptop and the PC - the PC remains limited to 0.60 Mbps upload. (cabled appear to be fine).</p>
<p>I tried swapping the ports the laptop and PC are plugged into on the Nighthawk - the PC remains limited to 0.60 Mbps upload. (network port appears to be fine)</p>
<p>I tried powering the PC off for 10+ minutes (lots of people recommended this solution for similar problems) - no difference. (long shot, but other people claimed success, so tried it).</p>
<p>I tried changing/upgrading the Realtek driver for the PC.&nbsp; I tried the older on the ASUS site, and the latest driver (10.6.1001.2105) - the PC remains limited to 0.60 Mbps upload.&nbsp; (Using the latest driver and older driver show exact same performance).</p>
<p>I bought a new network card, a Tenda LAN Adapter TEL9901G.&nbsp; I wasn't expecting this, but it uses the same Realtek driver.&nbsp; The new network card performs exactly the same (80+ Mbps download, 0.60 Mbps upload).&nbsp; (2 network cards have the poor performance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At a loss for what else to try... (please don't recommend rolling back to Windows 7 and trying again).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that even after changing the hardware devices like network cards and cables then also the download and upload limit are same.</p>
<p>It clearly shows that it is&nbsp;fully depending&nbsp;on the Service provider who provides the plan and as per the service provider the network upload and download limits are set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you to contact the service provider and check if the issue resolves. Upgrading or Downgrading will not reduce the limits of the Download and upload speeds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Keep us posted if you are facing if any issues further in Windows.</p>

</p><p>Sachin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks for the quick reply.&nbsp; I thought I was clear that I have a laptop running Windows 10 that was recently upgraded, and it performs at 80+ Mbps upload and download using the same FIOS connection and Netgear router.&nbsp; So, my provider (FIOS in this case)
 is not limiting the upload speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Prior to upgrading the PC to Windows 10, I was getting 80+ Mbps in both directions.&nbsp; I doubt anything has changed with my provider (I pay for additional bandwidth.&nbsp; I actually pay for 75/75 and get 80+ all the time).</p>

</p><p>Sachin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I forgot, one other thing I have already tried is adjusting the LAN advanced settings to force 1 GB full duplex versus auto-negoiate.&nbsp; I get the same results (80+ Mbps upload, 0.60 Mbps download) regardless of the setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are screenshots of the speedtest.net test results for both the Laptop (fast&nbsp; - 80+ both ways), and the PC (slow upload).&nbsp; Both the laptop and the PC are running Windows 10.&nbsp; The PC was getting 80+ both ways under Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;This is the laptop:</p>

</p><p><strong>Method 4</strong></p>
<p>In some instances, the IP settings or network configuration that you receive from your Internet service provider (ISP) might be incorrect or need updating. Sometimes, the connection between the modem and the ISP might experience problems. To update the settings
 on the modem or the router, reset (restart) the modem. This creates a fresh connection to the ISP. follow the below steps to reset the modem settings.<br />
</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Disconnect the cable that connects your computer or router to the modem. This can be either a USB cable or an Ethernet cable.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Turn off the modem using the power switch on the front or back of the modem. If the modem doesn't have a power switch, disconnect the power cord from the back of the modem, or unplug it from the wall.</p>
</li><li>Wait several minutes, and then turn on the modem and reconnect the cable from the computer or the router to the modem.</li><li>Restart the computer</li><li>Test your connection to see whether you can access the Internet.</li></ol>

            <p>You have probably already resolved this. &nbsp;But in case you haven't or in case someone else is having a similar issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case this was caused by Asus Turbo Network software that came with my motherboard. &nbsp;I uninstalled it (Disabling it did not resolve the problem) and the issue went away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that it retained settings from &nbsp;my previous account level and did not upgrade when I upgraded my Internet service. &nbsp;But in any case I am not sure what benefits it provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check for this or other third party Network Diagnostic / boosting etc. software on your system.</p>

            <p>I had a simmilar problem which only affected the upload speed (3 Mbit down to 0,5 Mbit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I screened every app like onedrive, dropbox, kaspersky ... but there was no abormal datatransfer visible. Then I read about drivers for hardware and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally this fixed my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply deactivated the IP6 protocoll (which was activated by default together with the IP4) on my network adapter. -&gt; The upload speed returned to normal.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had to reconfigure my router to use 40MHz band instead of 20MHz.</p>

<span>The reason why I am not reaching 500Mb/s is the lack of UASP. This is supported by the Asmedia 1042 USB controller used in the Series 7 (2011) but Windows 7 does not support it. I don't really want to change to Win10 because

 Unless, you modify the system information so that it sees a ASUS system.</span><br />

<span>It seems to be that this problem must have been experienced by many Win 7 notebook users due to the rise of SSDs. I couldn't find a solution for it yet, but It must be relatively simple to implement this.</span><br />

Mostly, this issue is caused when a driver uses an incorrect memory address. Other possible causes of this error include an incompatible device driver, a general hardware problem, or incompatible software.

The Memory diagnostic tool will check and fix any issues with the computer’s memory. You can refer these steps to run this tool.<br />
a. Press the ‘Windows + X’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b. Select control panel.<br />
c. Select the Option Administrative Tool from System and Security.<br />

<p>"I cannot open Populous on Windows 7"</p>
<p>I have been reading of graphic problems other people have suffered when trying to open the 1999 'god game' on&nbsp;Windows 7, my problem is different however as it does not even open. I used to play the game when I was younger and istalled it onto my new laptop
 for a bit of nostalgic fun (this was not a problem),&nbsp;but I can only get so far as the first menu [a brown square in the middle of the screen with Play, Install, Uninstall etc...]. I click Play, the disk drive whurs, but then nothing happens apart from the
 same menu opening again and the drive going quiet.</p>
<p>I have tried Re-installing but this didnt work.</p>
<p>Also, before the menu screen appears I am asked to 'Select the version' I would like to run:&nbsp;"Software rendered -&nbsp;No 3D Acceleration" or "Direct 3D Rendered - 3D Accelerated"</p>
<p>Please help, thanks</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi KieranSutton,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may check if the game is listed as compatible with windows 7.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
Refer to the below link and check for the same -<br />
<span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=god%20game%201999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/window<span>s/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=god%20game%201999</span></span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><span>If the game is not listed please do check the below link -<br />
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/faq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/faq.aspx</span></a></span><span>,
 the FAQ’s addresses steps the customer can do if the product they are looking for is not listed.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Also I would suggest you to try running the game in compatibility mode with Windows Vista or Windows XP in Windows 7 and then check.<br />
If a program written for an earlier version of </span><span><span>Windows</span></span></span><span><span> doesn't run correctly; you
 can use the Program Compatibility Wizard to change the compatibility settings for the program. To change settings for a program manually, use the individual program's Compatibility tab.<br />
<br />
You may refer to the below mentioned link for assistance on compatibility mode-<br />

<p><span><span>If the issue persists I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer of the game and check with them for resolution of the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>

 already backed up my files... I just need to fix this virus or whatever it may be.

<p>Hi Elenso,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ark: Survival Evoled is an Xbox Play Anywhere which means you can play the game on both Xbox One and Windows 10 device. However, Xbox One is designed to be a gaming device. That is why it has a lesser downloadable file size during game updates compared to
 Windows 10. While Windows 10 needs a larger downloadable file size during the game updates to make the game more compatible and playable on a Windows 10 device during game updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, we highly recommend that you post your concern to the Ark: Survival Evolved Forum. To do this, you may refer to the link below:</p>

<p>Original title:&nbsp; <span>remote connection</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remote connection will not connect, between Dell Inspiron 530 with Windows 7 Home Premium (base computer) and Dell laptop with Vista Home Premium 64 bit. Both computers have Norton Security Suite and Remote Monitoring seems to be setup on both. Remote connection
 is enabled on both computers. I get the following error message: "Remote Desktop can'r connect to the remote computer for one of the&nbsp;these&nbsp;reasons: 1) Remote access to the server is not enabled 2) The remote computer is turned off 3) The remote computer is
 not available on the network.&nbsp; Make sure the remote computer is turned on and connected to the network, and that remote access is enabled."&nbsp; The third item on my network is a HP printer.&nbsp; Some tips please on what I am missing.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Geralde</strong>,<br />
<br />
1. Are you under any active domain?<br />
2. What is the Client computer (From which&nbsp;you are trying to&nbsp;Connect) and Host Computer (To which you are trying to connect)?</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to disable any security program on your computer and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>After checking for the issue you need to re-enable the security program on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ensure Remote Desktop is enabled:</strong></p>
<p>On Windows Vista computer try to change the settings to allow connections from computers running any version of remote desktop:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Click Start<br />
b. Right click ‘Computer’<br />
c. Select ‘Properties’<br />
d. Click ‘Remote Settings’ in the upper right hand corner<br />
e. Ensure the option “Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop (less secure)” is selected.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Note: Host computers should have only Professional or above editions to support Remote desktop.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<p>Hi Suresh I,</p>
<p>No, I am not under any active domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My Client computer is a Dell laptop with Vista Home Premium, 64 bit.</p>
<p>My host computer is&nbsp;&nbsp;a Dell Inspiron 530 with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Windows 7 Home Prem</strong></span>ium.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;I <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">don't</span></strong> have the Professional version of Windows 7&nbsp;there apparently is no need to try any of&nbsp;your other suggestions. I just thought maybe there was a go-around, so I could avoid spending
 $89 to upgrade to Professional.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Geralde</p>

<p>Look at <strong>TeamViewer</strong> as an alternative. Its free for personal use. You can setup a predefined password if you wish and easily address by LAN IP of your only using it over a private LAN. Its highly configurable.</p>

<p>Thanks Al for your reply. I probably will go with upgrading from Windows 7 Home Premium to the Professional version on my host computer. That is only if&nbsp;I can be sure that&nbsp;I will be able to fully access it by Remote Desktop Connection from my Client computer,
 a Dell laptop with Vista Home Premium, 64 bit.</p>

<h3> wernd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Diagnosing Start up, no windows</h2>
                    <p>Recently there was an update. Not sure which one but i have a Toshiba Laptop running Windows 10. Soon after i have a screen that starts out black then after a long time goes into diagnosing start up then it ends with troubleshooting, reset, etc. Nothing
 on the forums work. I cannot reset with or without files. I get the message there was a problem. Same situation for System Restore. I tried chkdsk, etc. but did notice instead of C it said X? Not sure what that means. No matter what i do, i can't get to windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking of downloading Windows 10 and installing it on the Laptop but am worried i may be asked to pay for it even though i already have it on the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated on this as i am need of this laptop quickly and can't afford to buy another. I can't think of anything i downloaded, clicked on or installed that led to this situation.</p>

<p>I downloaded the media tool to a USB Thumb drive. I changed the boot to first go to the thumb drive. It was perfect. Found it, found windows 10 Home. It got to installing files and last i saw it was about 82% then an hour later when i returned it said that
 due to a corrupted system file the installation failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should i have formatted the drive? Did i miss anything?</p>

            Do you have any important files on the drive? Thats why I recommended the custom install. If you don't have any important files or your files are already backed up, you can perform a direct clean install instead. 
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />a
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            This sounds like your installation media might be corrupt.
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults then try again:

<p>I have only had bad experiences the last 2 days. 2 USB drives no longer will complete the Windows 10 from the Media tool. Always ends with an error. The laptop in question now has a black and white screen saying a boot item is missing. i then tried to burn
 a DVD which i was able to do. I followed all the instrucctions. It got as far as setup beginning but stopped spinning and right now nothing is happening after 20 minutes but i'll continue to wait just in case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm out of ideas.. Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Factory Reset Stuck at 59&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 7bluejays  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Factory Reset Stuck at 59&#37;</h2>
                    I have an HP computer that has run into a lot of trouble in how smoothly it runs, etc., so I decided to do a factory reset and clean the hard drive out of personal files completely. It's now been at it for about 24 hours, stuck from about 3 hours to 24
 at 59%. Is it safe to turn off the computer or cut the wi-fi to the computer to try and redo its resetting process? Any other suggestions?

            Hi 7B.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes, I'd first cut the wifi to make sure it's not causing it to hang.  
<br />
<br />Then if it doesn't proceed press and hold the power button until it powers off.
<br />
<br />Wait 5 minutes and power on again.  What happens.  
<br />
<br />If it already choked on a Reset you may need to create bootable media to  do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose   Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi 7bluejays,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Rebooting during a Reset would make the PC restore the previous version of Windows at next reboot. As Greg said, doing a clean install is more robust than Reset so suggest you to do that.

<p>
</p><p>So I went through with the wi-fi shutoff which didn't change anything. From there, I shut off the laptop, however, now its screen is black and if I press any key it emits a loud beeping noise. Not sure what any of that means.</p>

            Hello,

<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you.
<br />
<br />I do not recommend reset factory as it reinstalls useless manufacturer stuff and older W10 version.
<br />
<br />Clean install is much better.

            Did you hold the power key in long enough for it to power off completely?  You said it emits a loud beeping  noise, but is this after you powered it back on?
<br />
<br />You're likely going to need to reinstall so continue with the steps I gave  which will result in a better install than before.

            Changing UEFI firmware settings isn't indicated yet.  Use the HP ESC or F9 keys to trigger bootable media as a UEFI device.  If you reinstall then follow the steps above to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space, Click Next to let it auto-create and format which makes it foolproof.

            I am not sure that I understand. When I press the power key to turn it on while pressing esc or f9, it doesn't do anything. When I press the power with esc it makes a distinct, low-toned click but otherwise the screen remains dark.

            You can try ESC F10 or F10 to enter UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot which can cause it to skip the Boot Menu interrupt key, or to Reset the UEFI firmware to defaults.
<br />
<br />If nothing works to get into UEFI firmware then try other methods given here to reset UEFI firmware to default:  <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-to-reset-cmos-and-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-to-reset-cmo...</a>
<br />
<br />A workaround if all else fails is to remove the hard drive and install it on another PC to reinstall Windows 10 to UEFI, move it back to the target PC.  Windows 10 is remarkably adaptive to new hardware without needing adaptive restore.  If it will start it will swap out all drivers requiring several restarts.
