<h2>            Delete incomplete Windows 10 update download</h2>
                    <p>MS is already taking up 22GB of my 27GB drive. No wonder the new computer runs like crap! The last 3GB of Windows 10 update that evaporated, likes taking away my use of the keyboard. Thank you MS for your bouncy bubbly politeness policy and forced robbery
 of my personal information just to ask a question. Yes, I took my soma like a good boy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Undo whatever you broke</p>
<p>2. Delete the update files taking up about 3GB of my drive so I can't update</p>
<p>3. Be able to move on with my life</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really miss starting a compute with a single bootable DOS floppy disk and even having space on the disk to have another program. Please stop upgrading me and provide human support instead of the so-called AI that doesn't solve jack.</p>

            I hear ya, the updates can take up alot of space. Try clearing the update download folder to clear up some space:
<br />
<br />The first step is to temporarily turn off the Windows Update service (to stop background downloads). Open the Command Prompt, type the net stop wuauserv command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer and go to View &gt; Folder Options. Select the Show hidden files, folder, and drives radio button and click on Apply to enable the display of hidden files on your computer. 
<br />
<br />Once done, navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download and then delete the content of the Download folder. 
<br />
<br />Open a new Command prompt window and run the net start wuauserv command to restart the Windows Update service. 
<br />
<br />Personally I would go to the Update and Security settings and postpone the updates. 
<br />
<br />Also try navigating to the temp folder while hidden folders and files is still on and delete everything in temp
<br />
<br />C:\Users &gt; username &gt; AppData &gt; Local &gt; Temp
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.

<h2>            Can A Virus Infect My Computer From The System Restores&#63;</h2>
                    My computer was recently infected by (I think) some kind of malware that would redirect my&nbsp;Google&nbsp;search results (with a warning from&nbsp;Google&nbsp;chrome that the website had a weak signature) and deleted Windows Defender. I tried many of the possible solutions
 on the internet, but none of them worked. In the end, I decided to do a system restore to about two days before it started, and my computer seems to be working fine.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After the system restore, I installed AVG Antivirus (the paid/pro version) and did a full scan on the computer. I believe it removed whatever it harmful things it found on my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, three days after the system restore, I read some articles and questions on the internet that said a system restore does not remove a virus and that it could be hiding in the system restore files. I don't know if this is related, but some sites aren't
 loading for me (like "wiiublog", and "malwarebytes" websites), and when I check on another website (like "downforeveryoneorjustme"), it says the websites are up. Also, some of the websites load with just the words and links, but no images.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can the virus infect my computer from the system restore files? Is it still doing damage to my computer ?</div>
<div>If so, is there anything I have to do to check my system restore files (I read that you have to turn it off and do another scan, but I don't want to do anything without some help first) ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am on Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 2.</div>
<div>I also have Iobit Advanced Systemcare running.</div>

    <title>Xbox Silver Gamertags - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a lil guppy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Silver Gamertags</h2>
                    
<p>There are quite a few great Gamertags out there, which are taken by Xbox Silver users who, to my knowledge, have been silver for quite a while. A lot of these silver members don't play any more or are accounts owned by someone who hordes Gamertags. There
 are members of the Gold community, who actually pay for their accounts, and are willing to spend the 800 points to Microsoft to change their Gamertag.<br />
<br />
Do Silver memberships ever expire? Does anyone think there should be a period of time when a Silver member loses their name? And if they decided to come back then they could choose a new name. I understand that some people go overseas or have financial issues
 and have to prioritize real life over paying for Xbox Live. But, if someone doesn't pay for 6 months, or a year even, would it be fair to let someone who is Gold, who pays yearly and is willing to pay money for a new Gamertag to have that GT that isn't being
 used?<br />
<br />
If you have an argument please be fair and calm. No one likes being flamed. Thanks.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">MS was resetting "old" and "unused" Profiles GT's that were inactive (it's longer than 6 months though) but the "problem" became very apparent very quickly. People were just taking the recently reset GT's and then selling them
 to others as "OG Tags".<br />

No word on if MS was going to reset any others after this. It just shows, give something great to a Community and a bunch of

<p>I stay silver because I really don't care for online play. Still, I need an account to use my DL content, receive updates, etc, etc. Why should I give up my Gamertag because there are aspects of Live I don't use? It's not my problem those are the aspects
 that need to be paid for. Whenever there is a game that I want to play online, I switch to gold. I'm not giving up my identity because I like or don't like specific types of play. Full-time gold members need to stop whining because they have to pay for a "privilege"
 no other console manufacturer charges for. You're not better than anyone else, just more gullible.</p>

<p>Someone claimed my original xbox gamertag. The gamertag has 2 games played. Gears 1 and Prey. Gamerscore is 0. So this person has never played anything long enough to even get a 10g achievement. I'd defnitely pay to change my account name to that if it were
 unlocked or whatever.</p>
<p>What sucks is I can't even offer to give the guy points to change his gamertag so that I can claim the tag I used on the original Xbox.

<p>I'm not saying that someone should have to give up their Gamertag if they choose to be a silver member. But I think inactive accounts like the one Jack Specter mentioned shouldn't be allowed to be around for so long.</p>
<p>And, OG Pooh, I understand that you don't want to pay for something you don't use, and as an active gamer, obviously your name shouldn't be reset. But, I do disagree with your opinion on paying for Gold membership. I would gladly pay three times the amount
 I pay for Xbox Live right now because I enjoy the service that Microsoft provides. Everything, down to the interface, I enjoy on Xbox more than any other console.

<p>I don't know about paying anymore than we all ready do for live. My account was compromised on the 25th of last month and I still haven't gotten access to my account back and was told that I wouldn't get my account back until the 27th or 28th of this month.
</p>
<p>That's not the kind of customer service you pay extra for. Not to mention every time I've called about my account, not only do I talk to a different person every time who gives me a different story, but no one can give me a solid reason as to why I can't
 get access to my account back or what the status is on what's going on.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the fact that Xbox Live enables me to play games online with other people on a regular basis, but Microsoft rakes in more than enough money to both have more efficient and rapid customer service and be more proactive in not only banning modders,
 hackers, and cheaters, but also beef up their security measures so that it doesn't happen as often.

            You seem to have undertaken all possible solutions for this issue. There is a specialized forum at Technet for Skype for Business. I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to Technet forum also as this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. Experts on both forums will assist you giving you wider reach.

            <p>Hi Flight,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Safe" is one of those terms that means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are degrees of "safe" to just about everything - including storing passwords on your computer.&nbsp; Here's an article on the subject:
<a href="http://ask-leo.com/is_it_safe_to_let_my_browser_remember_passwords.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://ask-leo.com/is_it_safe_to_let_my_browser_remember_passwords.html</a>.&nbsp; Here's another:
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/68231/how-secure-are-your-saved-internet-explorer-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/68231/how-secure-are-your-saved-internet-explorer-passwords/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a general rule, I'd recommend against it (with some obvious exceptions where the computer requires that passwords be saved in order to verify what you enter to gain access to something that's password-protected - like your user login or a BIOS password
 if used - but only in the BIOS) or products like Family Safety where the computer needs to know the password to allow access to controls to make changes but that's just how the computer works and not what I think you're talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I think you're talking about online passwords like those used to access various websites and maybe some programs so you can get to them faster by bypassing the need to enter them manually every time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're lucky enough to never be infected by anything that steals your computer information or invaded by a hacker who uses the saved passwords to access all your private sites like forums and banking sites and credit card sites and network access to your
 company server where they can then access that information (perhaps even top secret info that could cause much harm and possibly get you into a lot of trouble), or fall victim to a scam where they get access to that information, or have your computer stolen
 and then hacked to gain general access and then have your other passwords all right there in front of them to use as they please while you're trying to change them all (and remember all of them and deal with the crime at the same time), then maybe you'll be
 OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're not lucky, then you've left the keys to everything right there easy to be found.&nbsp; And if you decided to show both secure and insecure information because you dislike seeing that notice pop up all&nbsp;the time, you're even at greater risk.&nbsp; And I'm
 not even considering the level of risk you're at right now depending on how well you attend to the security of your system and its connections.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not only a matter of turn on the Firewall, install a Firewall, and off to the races.&nbsp; Good security involves
 much more and I don't have any idea how you've covered yourself aside from storing passwords on the computer.&nbsp; There are many factors involved.&nbsp; Start here for some basic information:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/mse.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/mse.aspx</a>.&nbsp; For a variety of articles on how to secure your computer, see the following search:
<a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=How%20to%20secure%20your%20computer&amp;sc=6-27&amp;form=BSRTLB&amp;pc=BBSR&amp;QS=n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bing.com/search?q=How%20to%20secure%20your%20computer&amp;sc=6-27&amp;form=BSRTLB&amp;pc=BBSR&amp;QS=n</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; I don't know enough about your setup to know how well you are otherwise secured (e.g., are all your files encrypted, are all programs on your computer completely up-to-date in terms of updates, what operating system do you have - if XP you're
 already at risk because there are known holes that cannot be patched and never will be) to begin to&nbsp;guess at the level of risk associated with storing passwords (which no matter what is going to be an additional risk - perhaps small and perhaps not so small).&nbsp;
 But no matter what else you do, almost no matter how perfect you do everything else, it is more risky and less safe than not doing it.&nbsp; The above articles should help you decide if you feel comfortable doing so.&nbsp; Many do and many don't.&nbsp; I can only offer my
 personal opinion.&nbsp; The computer, the risk, the potential harm caused if they fall into the wrong hands are all yours to consider and the decision is yours&nbsp;to make.&nbsp; I can offer no guarantees if you do so no matter how you do it.&nbsp; I can guarantee if you don't
 that you will be safer though there is a small risk based on methods of doing it anyway where you have elected not to do it (e.g., someone installs a keylogger or keylogger software/malware to get every single keystroke you make including what you push when
 entering passwords) - but that's a different issue than you deciding whether&nbsp;or not to consciously and intentionally do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally, while MSE will help in terms of blocking and/or removing malware that may allow this to happen on your computer - it is not really very effective if someone gets to you through and in the browser or by other non-malware means as mentioned above.&nbsp;
 There are password-managing programs out there that claim to help do this and&nbsp;some work better than others&nbsp;- but in the end they too can be overcome and then someone has the entire list at their fingertips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; No I didn't give you a direct yes or no answer because I can't with the little I know about your situation and even if I knew everything, I still couldn't provide a guarantee.&nbsp; I simply will end by saying that I do not and never will
 do this myself and do not setup my clients to do that (though some change my setup once I walk out the door) and I've been at this for well over 20 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <span>
<p>Ok so here is the problem,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I come to boot up the computer</p>
<p><em><strong>Windows XP - Home</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when booting in normal mode or safe mode I get the message</p>
<p><strong><em>system32/drivers/ntfs.sys is missing or corrupt</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>please insert original windows disk and press 'r' on the first screen.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so i put in the disk and it says boot CD but then after a while it just comes up with the same message telling me to insert original disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried this now with 2 different windows disks, a different disk drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP :)</p>

<p>When booting from the disc you should receive a message to "Press any key to boot from cd". Are you receiving that message and pressing any key?</p>

<p>When you power on you computer you should see a screen that either list the the maker of your processor ie.. Intel or the maker of your computer... ie.. Dell. On that screen should be listed for example "Press F1 to enter BIOS set-up". The particular command
 may or may not be different on your computer. Press the command to enter BIOS set-up. Navigate to the boot menu order or sequence. Change the boot order to boot from the cd rom first and the hard drive second. Once complete make sure you press the right key(s)
 to save the settings to CMOS or you will have to do it again. Try to boot from the disc again. Finally, I am not a big fan on reinstalling windows if there is any means possible of fixing the issue otherwise.</p>

<p>Hello Matt. I completely understand your frustration. I have experienced this issue before but honestly cannot remember exactly what I did to resolve it. I do know that the message you are receiving "boot from cd" is not the same message as "Press any key
 to boot from cd". I don't mean to sound like you are not following instructions when I ask this but, are you absolutely sure the settings were saved when you changed the boot sequence?. I would check the bios again just to see. If so, try again to boot from
 the disc. When you get to the "boot from cd" prompt do not do anything. Give it a minute or so to see if the next prompt to "press any key to boot from a cd" appears.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

                    <p>Does Windows 10 include Movie Maker and Photo Gallery? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently have files on OneDrive. &nbsp;My understanding is that when the upgrade is taking place, any files that I have on my computer will be placed on OneDrive. Will the files need to be placed back onto my computer from OneDrive manually or does the Windows
 10 upgrade do it during the upgrade?</p>

            <p>If the code is region locked there is no way around it. It would have to be redeemed in the region it is meant for. If the code is for a game and the game itself is region locked, then your account region and your physical location would also have to match that region.</p>

<h2>            Win 7&#47;10&#58; ALT&#43;TAB and last cursor position</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi there!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am currently working at a small company where I met a weird little problem with our ERP and the ALT+TAB-function of windows. The ERP we’re using is rather old (20 years) and we use it mostly by keyboard-only as it is a lot faster than
 using the mouse additionally.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Imagine a program-window with a mask with several input boxes between whom you can move by TAB and UP/DOWN. You've just selected a box and want to check something within a second window und switch forth and back. But now the selected box
 is deselected and you can't move via TAB/UP/DOWN. First you've got to click somewhere and then you can proceed working as usual again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The problem occurs only on two computers: one with windows 10 and one with windows 7. All other machines are able to remember the last selected input box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 formatted the whole laptop and reinstalled a fresh copy of windows 10 on it and installed my game again, quad core was still visible and enabled BUT WHEN I UPDATED WINDOWS WITH WINDOWS UPDATE IT WENT BACK TO DUAL CORE SO WHAT HAPPENED MICROSOFT? &nbsp;Warcraft
 does not efficiently play anymore because of this, how do I get or make use of my octa core intel i7 processor? &nbsp;It did a huge update then set everything back to defaults or whatever but it doesn't run as fast as it did before this major update...how do I
 fix this and make the best use of my laptop for gaming? &nbsp;How do I unlock/unpark processors or whatever, this is infuriating, this is suppose to be a gaming laptop but you junk it up with all your settings and apps. &nbsp;someone please help...</p>

<h2>            Individual pictures from Theme</h2>
                    <p>Great pictures in the theme packages.&nbsp; However, I would like to pick one for more than a day.&nbsp; How do we open theme packages?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>And, how do get to choose a single picture from a package as a background?</p>
<p>When you go to background, there are only five pictures.&nbsp; When you select Browse, you go to your picture folders.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>How can I choose one of the theme pictures as a background?&nbsp; </p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the version of Windows 10 installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The most common cause of this issue is the programs which implement and add their own context menu items to Windows context menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest to remove the additional items from Windows context menu and see if it works. You can remove the context menu items from registry.</span></p>

 information about system hardware, installed programs and settings, and profiles of each of the user accounts on the computer. Windows often reads and updates the information in the registry.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Normally, software programs make registry changes automatically. You should not make unnecessary changes to the registry. Changing registry files incorrectly can cause Windows

    <title>Wireles Association to access point failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cordash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireles Association to access point failed</h2>
                    This is the error message I receive from Troubleshooting diagnostices when trying to wirelessly connect to an access point on our network (with a router acting as dchp controller) . The Packard Bell Windows 7 notebook correctly accesses the router's wireless
 connections.. It sees the Access point and attempts to connect, I type in the security key (correctly accepts) and it continues to connect. It then comes up with a troubleshooting note - listed below., failing to connect to the access point.<br />
<br />
I have followed several online suggestions including the Regedit of the adapter register key&nbsp; vis:&nbsp; DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle set&nbsp; =1 , as per windows suggestion without it having any effect.<br />
<br />
I have changed the channel on the access point from Automatic (13) to 1 ( as per the router which works)<br />
<br />
I am at a loss as to what else to try, especially since 2 phones and another wireless laptop all correctly connect to this access point. It is only the Packard Bell (Dot S2) notebook, and only to this particular Netgear Prosafe Dual Band Access Point (WAG102).
 Needless to say there is very good signal strength since the access point is only a few meters away.<br />
<br />
Help please. Thank you<br />
<br />
I have highlighed lower down the diagnostics:<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>This may happen due to the Anti-virus or firewall, I would suggest you to disable firewall and antivirus and then check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Disable antivirus software</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:
</strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it
 as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn Windows Firewall on or off</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to turn on Firewall after your troubleshooting as turning off Windows Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you
 have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>You may also follow the steps from the link and check if it helps.</p>

    <title>New Skype for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tia_91  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype for Windows 10</h2>
                    Usually I have been using the classic Skype but now I Skype has forced me to use the new version. What I don't understand is how am I able to see who's online? Because it there's nothing showing that, it looks like everyone is offline. How am I suppose
 to know who's online when I am unless they contact me first? What if I want to contact them first? Or what if they log off but it doesn't show it and I keep IMing them and I start to think they're ignoring me on purpose? (I have and had friends who were bumped
 off of Skype plenty of times.) Is there any kind of notification showing who has logged on and off? Please give me an answer. And Skype if you're reading this, PLEASE makes changes to these problems!!!!!

            I have a similar issue. I resisted the push for the new Skype but Avasty summarily updated all my apps, including it. The new Skype had no sound and froze upon testing. I uninstalled it and tried downloading from the website but it says "if you have Windows
 10, you already have it". Please advise...

            I had no Skype version when I asked my question, as I'd uninstalled the most recent one available (whichever the skype website says you have if you have windows 10). Luckily I'd kept a setup.exe from 2015, which is why I'm happily using as of this morning
 ;o)

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">These are the possible statuses in the Skype for Windows 10 version 12.18:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Active</strong>: Let your contacts know you're available and ready to chat.&nbsp;</li><li>
<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong>: Let your contacts know you don't want to be disturbed.
 They can still send you an instant message or call but you won't be alerted.&nbsp;</li><li>
<strong>Invisible</strong>: Hides your presence indicator from others but they will
 see the last time you were set to Active or Do Not Disturb.</li></ul>
<p>
If your contacts does not have any status, it's possible that they're offline or in Invisible mode. But to further check this, try to sign out in Skype and then uninstall and reinstall it and check if there's any changes on their statuses.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please check if the issue persists in the classic Skype. You can install it here:

            Am I able to sort my contacts by the ones that have their statuses set to Active and by doing are letting me know that they are available and ready to chat? I have the latest version of Skype for Windows 10.&nbsp; If I can't sort to see who is available to
 chat, then why bother having that status option at all?<br />
