<h2>            Dell XPS-15&#58; Build 15007 hangs after laptop lid closed</h2>
                    <p>Dell XPS-15: Build 15007 hangs after laptop lid closed</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lid close setting is "do nothing".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I come back after being away for a few minutes, the laptop is quite warm to the touch and the fan is running. When the lid is opened, the power button light is on and the screen is not on. Nothing happens; it just sits there with the fan continuing
 to run. If a key is struck, the keyboard lights up, but nothing else happens. Tapping the power button does nothing.&nbsp; Hold it for four seconds, and the power light turns off and the fan stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tap the power button and the machine boots and runs normally until the next time the lid is closed. Then its deja vu all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any workaround?</p>
<p>

    <title>Iphone Battery Drain Using Outlook App - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Iphone Battery Drain Using Outlook App</h2>
                    I've read the various posts from Microsoft on the problem of the Outlook app for iPhones draining the battery quickly; however, none of the responses were helpful, and in fact, they all basically didn't acknowledge this was a problem.&nbsp; The IOS email app
 has a simple solution, which allows you to tell the app how to sync with the server.&nbsp; In my case, I only sync when I view the app.&nbsp; It would be nice if the Outlook app, which has some features that I really like, would do the same.&nbsp; Are there any settings
 that can be changed, either in the iPhone general settings or App specific settings that will solve this problem.&nbsp; As of now, I've deleted the app so my phone battery will not deplete so quickly.

                    <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Can someone please help me with Mail merge?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have attempted to merge a word document with an excel docs containing names and email addresses numerous times.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Each time ending with either only 25 saved pdf’s of correctly merged docs, but not the remaining 325 that were in the excel doc, or an error message of “Acrobat PDFMaker was not able to mail merge the document”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This last attempt had all the makings of promise, only to be let down.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It said “Acrobat PDFMaker is converting messages to PDF” for a very long time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It switched to the failure notice, then switched back to the converting message and kept going all night.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The green bar slowly going across and flickering like it was working.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At one point, before I went home for the day, a window came up saying that it was saving records 1-50 and 51 to 100.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This morning there was nothing saved and only the failure window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’ve done merges in the past with no instances.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have an employee who is masterfully skilled in excel who has attempted this with me a few times, with no success.<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            Access - Compact and repair fails with message file already in use. Does that matter&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I open the database. I select but do not open the table. I click on Compact and Repair Database. I get the error message: 'Could not use 'C:\....accdb'; file already in use.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened intermittently (I think not always) for the last few months. It would get cleared if I logged out of the Windows user account and back in. Today that didn't work so I tried restarting the PC. That has not worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a standalone PC on Windows 10 Home 1709 running MS Office Professional 2016. There are several user accounts and an administrator account used only for maintenance. Access is used only in one of the user accounts. It has never been used in any other
 user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Googling the problem has not brought up anything helpful which I can understand. I guess I may no longer be able to compact and repair the database. Does that matter? What could go wrong if I don't compact and repair the database?</p>

            I would view the folder containing the Access file prior to anyone having the file open. If you see a ".laccdb" file, try delete it. Then attempt your compact and repair. If that fails, I would create a new, blank access file and import all of the objects from the one you can't repair. Then rename both files so the new one has the name of the original.

                    I want to know how to turn the entire app off and keep it from starting up when I turn on my computer. It also seems to be restarting itself like a virus no matter how many times I turn it off. The older version had a way to do this. For some reason the
 version I have does not include this option. HOW do I turn this THING OFF?

            Hi JunoAtkings
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. If this is Skype for Desktop, Open Skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Setting &gt; General &gt; Toggle Off Automatically Start Skype
<br />
<br />2. If this is Windows 10 Store Skype (v8 and v14 both will be written), then you can disable this (You can use Skype for Desktop instead)
<br />
<br />Uninstall - Windows Key+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below and paste into Powershell and Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />In place of Store Skype, use Desktop Skype - <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />3. Invoke Task Manager from CTRL+SHIFT+ESC &gt; Under Start up see if Skype is listed. If yes, right click on it and Disable
<br />
<br />4. Windows Key+R &gt; Copy and paste following into Run and Enter
<br />shell:startup
<br />This will openup Startup folder
<br />See if you have Skype in it
<br />If yes, Delete shortcut from here 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p><span>Hi JunoAtkings,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Greetings from Skype!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on the screen shot you’ve provided, it seems that you are using Skype for Windows 10 (UWP). In this case, I would suggest to use/download
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for desktop</a>, since the control to disable auto startup of Skype exist in the application. Whilst, the settings for auto-startup of Skype for Windows 10 (UWP) exist outside
 the app and can be found on your computer settings &gt; <span>Privacy settings</span> &gt;
</span><span>Background apps</span> and disable Skype. This will stop the Skype app and its components from launching at startup.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On this thread, one of the Skype volunteer moderator “TechFreak_” was able to explain how Skype for Windows 10 (UWP) works “https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/changing-skype-to-not-start-on-windows-startup/2fba1d77-a108-46a8-b881-e8e4a0478d17</span></p>

<h2>            Using Office 365 without internet access</h2>
                    On a recent flight, I opened a Word document on my Mac laptop. A message appeared at the top of the window saying that I needed to sign in to activate Office. But I couldn't sign in because I had no internet access. If I clicked on "sign in," it said,
 "Network error." Consequently, I was unable to work while I traveled. Is there anything I can do in the future should this happen again?

            <p>In theory you should be able work unconnected to the internet for up to 30 days.&nbsp; 365 needs to connect to MS every 30 days to confirm that you still have an active license. But during that time you are supposed to have full use of your license on your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first message you are getting is (well should not be) unrelated to not being connected to the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the problem go away when you connected to the internet?</p>

    <title>Failed Restarts After Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sdeviney1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed Restarts After Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>After many months and almost 30 attempts to successfully apply the Windows 10 Upgrade, I finally got it to work. However, my PC now won't successfully Restart. Even a hard Shutdown and reboot doesn't work. The symptom is that my PC begins to startup, then
 the spinning icon simply stops. No progress, no error messages, no nothing. My disk drive is still running, and I've waited as long as 46 hours to see if it will successfully complete the startup to Windows, but nothing. Even a restore of a restore point I
 had created didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent 10 1/2 hours today attempting to get my PC back working. The only thing that worked was a restore point created by the Windows 10 upgrade; but the end result was the same. I restart my computer, and it won't successfully boot back up to Windows.
 Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>I've investigated my video drivers by asking my system to look for any updates and install them.&nbsp; Both my Nvidia GeForce drivers and my generic Microsoft video drivers did have updates. I applied them, but rebooting my PC as requested just leaves me back
 in the same black hole. When I Restart or Shutdown and then start back up, the boot sequence just stops and any spinning icon stops after about 90 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried disabling the Nvidia app in Device Manager, but that doesn't seem to result in any difference. Have also checked to see if Windows-B command somehow is directing the video output to a device that isn't there, but that also doesn't seem to be the
 case. Whenever the icon stops spinning, my ability to also type anything on the keyboard is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way for me to get my PC back is to either apply the Restore Point originally created 3 days ago when Windows 10 was finally installed (none of the subsequent Restore Points I've created allow me to successfully reboot to Windows), OR I can get into
 Safe Mode with Networking.&nbsp; I tried booting up with "Enable Low-Resolution Video" but ended up with the same symptom - the icon displayed while booting up Windows just stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My disk drive is still running but the restart just doesn't advance --- or at least it appears not to since the display freezes and no typed command is accepted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have done all of this with all peripherals unplugged from my PC, including Ethernet cable, and with all anti-virus and malware apps disabled -- but no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do the restore of the Windows 10 upgrade, it will bring my PC back up; but any type of restart or shutdown, turn back on just puts me back to the same place. So effectively, any update that requires a reboot/restart trashes my PC and I'm back to square
 one --- apply the restore point from the Windows 10 update from 3 days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if booting in Safe Mode which does work, would allow me to do any sleuthing to uncover anything else.</p>

            <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 15 with i7 processor, 16GB memory; and 800GB+ of free space. I have both wireless and direct internet cabled access available to my cable modem.&nbsp; No pre-existing issues with Windows 8.1 from which I upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied the upgrade by the Windows Update window; not from a media. My first 25+ attempts to download Windows 10 would always halt after the download was 100%, the install was 100%, and the PC would try to configure the update. I finally got it to complete
 by disabling all anti-virus and maleware apps, disconnecting all external devices, turning off wireless, and unplugging my Ethernet cable once the update was downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A restore point was automatically created. I was able to bring up Windows 10 then and go through the various options to select what was desired.&nbsp; Everything seemed good and worked.&nbsp; However, any updates that then needed to be downloaded and which required
 a reboot is where everything goes afoul. As long as I never download anything requiring an update, and as long as I never shutdown my PC, everything is fine. But any restart or shutdown puts me right back in the mode of ---- PC starts to boot up, icon that
 displays progress spins for maybe 90 seconds, then freezes and my keyboard on my laptop freezes. I can hear the disk drive spinning and have left my laptop run up to 46 hours to see if anything beneficial happens, but it doesn't. I eventually just have to
 do a hard power down. Then restart.&nbsp; Even when pressing CTRL-F12 after restart, only every third hard restart like that will bring up the menu of various ways to restart my PC. The only 2 that work are: Safe Mode, or Restore the restore point created automatically
 when Windows 10 update was installed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just saw something like this last night&nbsp;on my mother's TouchSmart on which I upgraded a W8.2&nbsp;partition last week.&nbsp; In contrast to the smooth upgrade experience this has to be seen to be believed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was trying to Restart in order to switch to her W7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbeknowst
 to me there was an update to be done first.&nbsp; The screen stayed stuck on the worm chasing its tail and the message Don't turn off your computer.&nbsp; And that was it for about an hour!&nbsp; It tried to go to&nbsp;screen save mode&nbsp;periodically and had to be brought back
 to life with a mouse movement.&nbsp; Then it finally got into the W7 boot menu.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart from W7 into W10 was even more obnoxious and unbelievable.&nbsp; I have no idea what it was doing.&nbsp; It looked like had quiesced and simply not finished the job of getting the boot menu up.&nbsp; At this point the screens were blank.&nbsp; So I tapped the power
 switch to request Sleep/Power Off (not enough to request a hard reset).&nbsp; That set in motion a flurry of disk movement and fan noise that lasted for over an hour on&nbsp;
 of Sleep and pressed the Win- key.&nbsp; Instantly this brought up the W10 Lock screen.&nbsp; What happened to my boot menu?&nbsp; I suppose the blank screen period before I pressed the Power switch would have been enough time for it to have been there and out but that is
 not likely because the default boot item is W7 in both boot menus (W10 and W7).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank goodness my TouchSmart has indicators such as a disk light and fan noise.&nbsp; Users of modern machines without such clues might end up interrupting whatever it is that was going on and causing themselves more grief by putting their machine into an automated
 recovery sequence.&nbsp; Also, I&nbsp;think that having a boot menu is more essential than ever to have any kind of control over such overdone clueless (pun intended) automation that we now seem to be subject to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10.&nbsp; Still an <em>Adventure</em> ("Twisty passages, all different.")</p>

<h2>            Openoffice 365 proplus setup manager opens and closes immediately.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my study I need word and other programs Openoffice 365 proplus offers, but I'm not able to install nor activate the programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the first problem:</p>
<p>I downloaded the&nbsp;Setup.X86.en-us_O365ProPlusRetail file and ran it like the site told me to, by clicking yes and then waiting, but when I clicked yes the setup manager opened and it stated: "We're getting things ready" and then it immediately closed without
 a crash report or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the other problem:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have word, excel and the other programs on my laptop, but after using the right activation codes it still tells me that I need to activate it before the 6th of september otherwise it denies me access I guess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Tristan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that some settings on your computer are preventing you from properly installing Office. We'd like to learn more about your concern so that we could provide the proper resolution. We just have a few questions for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which build version of Windows 10 is on your computer? To check, click <strong>

<p>We appreciate the information you provided. We suggest uninstalling the old version of Office on your computer by using the Easy Fix tool
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Then, to find out if the Office installer was closing unexpectedly due to a third-party software conflict, perform a clean boot by following the steps listed in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. Once you're in a clean boot environment, the chances of software conflicts are minimized because Windows will only use the essential drivers and programs to run. Run the Office installer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: To return your computer back to normal, check the section
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you're able to successfully install and activate Office after following these steps.</p>

            But dear see the quality of Application in it... And also the OS are much efficient than the previous version .... As Symbian also hangs too much but on the other hand Windows is one of the Least Lagging OS.

            <p>And usb otg is supported in Windows 8.1 ......and the point of xenon flash it is hardware issue.... Not the software.... And if u talk about it...remember most of the Symbian had not Xenon Flash,... Xenon flash in the Mobiles didn't catch the market too
 much so now the company are not launching the phones with xenon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And the point TV connectivity it has already been launched in some phones in the Black update and also wirelessly u can connect through the TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well class Equilizer are there in Lumia' series... See and it is working very nyc.</p>

            <p>But yes i agree ur some of the point .... I also like previous Symbian but it is also the point that Microsoft is doing such thing to make the OS much simplier and LAG Free....</p>
<p>
</p><p>there is no doubt in it that Windows is much smooth...Simplier even than the IOS and BLACKBERRY....</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also it is very easy to use as Symbian also do this.....</p>

            <p>I TOTALLY agree with you, and it's SHAMEFUL that we are still here with 8.1. You forgot that, with Nokia Suite we were able to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Send text (SMS) messages from our PCs through our phones</p>
<p>- Perform full phone backups on our PCs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Symbian was able to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Use Skype to send files</p>
<p>- Use Skype to send text messages</p>
<p>- Use phonebook to call Skype numbers</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only things Windows Phone is better than Symbian are aesthetics and stability.</p>
<p>

            <p>Yeah i am also agree with this but remember Symbian also takes much time to gain that position.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is also catching up fast... When you change the Platform and UI both then you have to do all the fresh work instead of modifying the Primitives....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such as Symbian is based on Java Platform and Windows is based on C# platform.... Also you can see the change in UI , Metro UI of Windows , so instead of modifying the Symbian programmer , software engineer have to do all the new task have to develop all
 the new ones , so it would be take some time to establish.</p>

            <p>The things you mention should have been done BEFORE the launch of the OS, and not so that 18 months later we are still waiting. Also, Microsoft had already a privileged relationship with Nokia, so they had all the knowledge they needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what business users are concerned, I don't think many business users will want an OS incapable of call recording, VOIP calls or a decent experience on Skype. Also more security obtained through a worst user experience is stupid, not an evolution. There
 are plenty of antivirus solutions... which don't work on WP8 because the OS can't handle them. This is sooooooooo dumb!</p>

<h2>            Error&#58;&#39;document name or path is not valid&#39;, 2 files since Service Pack 3 upgrade</h2>
                    
<p>I'm still using Word 2002, and recently download Microsoft Office Word Viewer 2003 and&nbsp;added the XP Service Pack 3 download.&nbsp; Since then&nbsp;I've had 2 Word files get corrupted, receiving the<em>'document name or path is not valid'</em> message.&nbsp; The first time
 I was able to open from Notepad, then save back to Word.&nbsp;The latest I can't open from any other program or&nbsp;the File Open dialog box, and I tried renaming the file.&nbsp; I've got a backup file on a thumb drive I can update, so I'm not as worried about this particular
 file, as I am about what's going on in my system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other things both these files have in common:</p>
<ol>
<li>I've copied&nbsp;research text from websites into the Word files, <em>some</em> in the first file I was able to retrieve, and<em>extensive</em> text in the second one which I can not retrieve.
</li><li>I often get a message upon closing the documents that says something like "Do you want to save the change made to 'Normal' template" It's hard to get this off my screen so I sometimes save it sometimes don't.&nbsp; It often keep popping up no matter what I do.
</li></ol>
<p>So my biggest concern is that other Word documents that I go back to use, or new ones I create will take on this same problem.&nbsp; Any suggestions please?&nbsp; Thanks much....Al</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you saving these files for the first time? If yes, are you using the default name that is based on the first line of the doc? Look for "special" non alpha-numeric characters in file name.</p>
<p>Try changing the name of the affected file to something really simple, ie A.doc, just to see if you can get it to work.</p>
<p>The content of the file will not have any effect on the name or path error.&nbsp; I copy text from web into files dozens of times every day without that problem.</p>
<p>Try doing File / Open / select file type: "Recover Text from Any File type" to extract text from the broken files.</p>
<p>The Save changes to normal is an informational warning that you have the option of turning off. Personally I prefer to explicitly turn it ON. Unless I have explicitly made changes to Word configuration that I want saved, I will always say no the prompt.
 This prompt can be triggered if you have installed and use an application that wants to add a button or toolbar to Word. You may not realize that the change is there unless you look very carefully.</p>

<h2>            How to Re-Activate One&#39;s Skype Credit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know that supposedly one can prevent one's Skype credit from being deactivated by making a call to someone's non-Skype number. So I did that after I got an email saying my credit was going to be deactivated in 7 days.&nbsp; But for some reason that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I got a follow up email telling me that my credit has been deactivated, and that to activated again I have to go to my account, log in, and go to "Reactivate your credit." (In Dutch "Reactiveer uw tegoed."</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/65255cbf-1fb2-4fa4-92e1-2e361db70063" title="L. Langeweg">
<p>
</p><p>I apologize to know about your experience. If you are not seeing the reactivate option on your Skype page, there is a possibility that you have signed in to a different Skype account. I suggest you to make sure that you have signed in the correct
<strong>Skype name</strong> (username) or email address. If you are not sure of your Skype name, you can check the email notification from Skype, your Skype name is indicated in it.

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I am logged in with my Skype name and I have only one account. I see it is coupled to my Microsoft account. And that is showing my correct e-mail address in case I would want to change my password.</p>
<p>All I see are the options on my account page to buy more credit and to give credit to someone else as a gift.</p>
<p>I wish I could send you an e-mail with screen shot.</p>

</p><p>On that page I have €4,21 left from the €5 I had added on October 3. But when I got the email the day before on October 2 telling me that my credit was going to be deactivated in 7 days I still had over €7 credit which I haven't used.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I received a second email on October 9 saying the credit had been deactivated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember having logged into Skype with my Microsoft account data, something I don't remember I did before. I was always logged in automatically. So maybe it somehow is a different account, although I got the Skype e-mails to my usual e-mail address. And
 I'm always using the same Skype name. I don't remember if the password I'm using with this Skype account is the same I used before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see this in the latest e-mail I got from Skype:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uw accountgegevens:<br />
Microsoft-account: live:lode123_4</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember that. And on my Microsoft account page I see nothing about my Skype account or accounts.</p>

<p>Thanks again&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d6737d2a-449b-41c6-9297-d7682026ce7d" title="Ruwim.B">Ruwim.B</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just uninstalled Skype from my laptop and installed it again. Just to see what would happen when filling in my Skype login data again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I fill in my email address -lode123@xxx, the same address on which I got the deactivation emails- a Microsoft panel in Skype appears in which I have to fill in some personal data for Microsoft. (Which I didn't do. Instead I went back to the previous
 still nothing filled in panel. I already have a Microsoft account. I can see it online.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in this second try I filled in my Skype name in the panel -instead of that email address-and&nbsp; right away I get the option to log in with my password, and filling that in I can log in and it gives me my functioning Skype with all my contacts etc..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I see no "Reactivate credit" option on my Skype nor Microsoft online accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not that I really care much about the €7+ that Microsoft would keep (The €7+ is not much money) but I care about the principle. It could have been much more money. And I wonder how many other people have this issue. So I would like a solution to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PS:</p>
<p>In the emails from Skype about deactivation and reactivation only my first name appears:</p>
<p>"Hallo Lodewijk," I don't see my Skype name there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Auto-charge On, and besides that purchased Skype credit a few times manually. The last time €5 on October 3, and the time before that also €5 on June 24.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2017 my credit also was deactivated, but I was able to reactivated again:</p>
<p>
<table>

Balance inactive</td>

</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>So I wonder what has changed since that now I can't find the option to reactivate my credit again.</p>

    <title>E63 not connecting to PC.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelby---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E63 not connecting to PC..</h2>
                    
<p>I just got this E63 a few days ago, and have been very happy with it. I wanted to put some music on it and maybe import the few photos I've taken to my PC, so I bought a new USB to do this with. It's third party but right out of the box, so I doubt it's
 faulty. I got the error popup of not recognizing the device, and I searched around here before posting to figure out the problem. I downloaded PC Suite, and it doesn't find it either. I also downloaded the software updater for my phone, and it can't locate
 the device any better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone itself doesn't say it's connected to anything, and there's no popup. I've gone to connections and selected PC Suite, as well as Mass Storage, and nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea how to fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It indeed loos like a cable bug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure PC Suite is installed with connectivity cable drivers, PC's USB port is working or try changin port.You should get an option to connect on ur phone, you may need to restart both the PC and the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If nothing works than the alternative is to test the cable at some friends PC (obviously he should have compatible noka phone ), or pick a cable from some friend ant test on your PC.</p>

<p>The USB port works fine, it's normally the one I use for my digital camera.</p>
<p>The USB itself seems to be working fine with other devices, just not the phone.</p>
<p>The computer IS picking it up, just not recognizing it..the phone itself still isn't, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of my family members have the same phone, or even a Nokia...And all of them have refused to let me download anything on their computers to test it. |:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have Vista, if it makes any difference.</p>

            I'm betting it is the cable. Why Nokia doesn't provide one with it is beyond me. I would suggest you obtain one from Nokia.

            You can use Word's Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge facility for this (the terminology depends on the Word version). To see how to do so with any mailmerge data source supported by Word, check out my
<strong>Microsoft Word Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge Tutorial </strong>at:<br />
<a href="http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/154370-Microsoft-Word-Catalogue-Directory-Mailmerge-Tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/154370-Microsoft-Word-Catalogue-Directory-Mailmerge-Tutorial</a><br />
or:<br />
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Zips/Catalogue%20Mailmerge.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/Zips/Catalogue%20Mailmerge.zip</a><br />
The tutorial covers everything from list creation to the insertion &amp; calculation of values in multi-record tables in letters. Do read the tutorial before trying to use the mailmerge document included with it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Depending on what you're trying to achieve, the field coding for this&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;complex. However, since the tutorial document includes working field codes for all of its examples, most of the hard work has already been done for you - you should be able to do little
 more than copy/paste the relevant field codes into your own mailmerge main document, substitute/insert&nbsp; your own field names and adjust the formatting to get the results you desire. For some worked examples, see the attachments to the posts at:<br />
<a href="http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/9180-mail-merge-duplicate-names-but-different-dollar.html#post23345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/9180-mail-merge-duplicate-names-but-different-dollar.html#post23345</a><br />

&nbsp;<br />
Another option would be to use a DATABASE field in a normal ‘letter’ mailmerge main document and a macro to drive the process. An example of this approach can be found at:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/many-to-one-email-merge-using-tables/8bce1798-fbe8-41f9-a121-1996c14dca5d">

The DATABASE field can even be used without recourse to a mailmerge. An example of such usage can be found at:

<h2>            Import pst Outlook into Outlook for Mac creates a second entry which can&#39;t be merge in the default one</h2>
                    When importing emails, calendar and contacts via a .pst file, everything goes well. However, there are issues. The mail, events and contacts import, but they create a second entry in the navigation pane that cannot be merged with the default mail, calender,
 contacts entry. Do you know how to solve this?&nbsp;

            You can drag items from the folders under On My Computer into your default account (Exchange?) and these will copy to your server. You will need to put calendar items into a list view before you can select and drag multiple events. Unfortunately, you may
 not be able to drag appointments sent to you by others between accounts.

            If this is attached to a Microsoft account, then Microsoft account will also get closed which has its own ramifications. Hence, before closure, rethink
<br />
<br />You always have the option of not using and leave it as is.
<br />
<br />To close, you need to follow this process - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i...</a>

            If you close your Microsoft account, in addition to not being able to sign in to or access Skype, you'll no longer be able to sign in to other Microsoft consumer products or services such as Outlook.com, Office Online, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Windows.
<br />
<br />Before you close your Microsoft account, let's make sure you aren't leaving anything important relating to Skype behind:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to Skype.  
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>
<br />    Follow the steps in this article to verify that: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412</a>
<br />
<br />        Important information such as files and contacts are saved.
<br />        Your Skype Credit balance has been used. Once your account is closed, you can't get it back. 
<br />        Active subscriptions have been cancelled so you don’t continue to get charged. If you have Auto-recharge enabled and cancel your account without first cancelling your subscription, you will continue to be charged until your account has been permanently closed in 60 days. Learn how to disable Auto-recharge.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633</a>
<br />
<br />You can close your Microsoft account by following these steps:
<br />
<br />    Go to our Microsoft account closure page. You may be prompted to sign in or verify your password.
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a>
<br />
<br />    Make sure you are signed in to the Microsoft account you want to close and select Next. 
<br />    In the Select a reason drop-down list, choose the reason you're closing the account. 
<br />    Select Mark account for closure.
<br />    Your Microsoft account will be closed in 60 days. We wait 60 days before permanently deleting accounts in case you change your mind or need to access something before it's gone. You can change your mind any time during the 60 days, just sign in to cancel the closure.

<p>The solution is that Microsoft releases a bugfix for this because it is a problem in the rom. Or maybe it is just isolated to Nokia's Cyan version.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm having the same problem with my Lumia 620 since upgrading to WP8.1</p>
<p>I can't connect to my car's phone set with bluetooth anymore.</p>
<p>Tried everything including factory reset.</p>
<p>Asked Microsoft for support, no solution available.</p>
<p>Asked Nokia for support. They finally asked me to send the phone in for repair at my own expense! They must be crazy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only a patch from Microsoft will help, because it's a software issue in WP8.1.</p>
<p>I wished I never upgraded.....</p>

    <title>Issue with Paste Special dialog box&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with Paste Special dialog box&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One of the last upgrades appears to have broken the Paste Special dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Office 365 Excel 2016 Version 1710 Build 8625.2139. One of our users does a lot of copy and paste values from various spreadsheets. However, recently they have noticed that the paste special dialog box has changed when they open multiple excel
 spreadsheets at the exact same time. It appears to be more like a paste object box which doesn't list the option to Paste Values. Is this a bug or is this happening by design? If so, please give us paste values as an option in this "New" dialog box.</p>

<p>Hi Chistopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the issue you are experiencing is a known issue that occurs when you open multiple files all at once or in rapid succession.&nbsp; The workaround for this is to open the files more slowly or open them from within the Excel application instead of
 opening them from Windows explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reporting this issue.</p>
<p>Jim</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Occasionally you'll get an error message telling you there's a problem with a website's security certificate.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For us to provide the best resolution possible, we would like to know which of these error messages were you getting:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Error message</th>
<th>What it means</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This website's security certificate has been revoked</td>
<td>You shouldn't trust this website. This often means that the security certificate was obtained or used fraudulently by the website.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This website's address doesn't match the address in the security certificate</td>
<td>A website is using a certificate that was issued to a different web address. This can occur if a company owns several websites and uses the same certificate for multiple websites.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This website's security certificate is out of date</td>
<td>The current date is either before or after the time period during which the certificate is valid. Websites must renew their certificates with a certification authority to stay current. Outdated certificates can be a security risk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This website's security certificate isn't from a trusted source</td>
<td>The certificate has been issued by a certification authority that isn't recognized by Internet&nbsp;Explorer. Phishing sites often use fake certificates that trigger this error.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Internet&nbsp;Explorer has found a problem with this website's security certificate
</td>
<td>Internet&nbsp;Explorer found a problem with a certificate that doesn't match any other errors. It could be because a certificate has been damaged, tampered with, written in an unknown format, or is unreadable. You shouldn't trust the identity of the site if
 a certificate has this error. </td>
</tr>

<p>It's impossible to copy and paste from the message, but I'll put it the best I can:</p>
<p>The heading on the box says Security Alert.</p>
<p>"The identity of this website or the integrity of the connection cannot be verified.</p>
<p>Then 4 problems are listed, 3 of which have green check marks and 1 of which is marked with an exclamation point.&nbsp;The problem marked changes from occurrence to occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two most often marked are: &nbsp;'The security certificate has expired or is not yet
 valid.' 'The name on the security certificate is invalid or does not match the name of the site.'&nbsp; Then it says, 'Do you wish to proceeed?' and I must click on Yes, No, or View Certificate.</p>
<p>This is currently happening while I'm reading email in my yahoo.com mail account.&nbsp; It's currently happening repeatedly over the email Microsoft sent to me. When I click View Certificate, the identity is different each time, currently showing&nbsp;Issued to: &nbsp;*.yashi.com,
 sometimes showing *provenpixel.com.</p>
