<h2>            My Intel Q6600 quad core processor is only showing 2 processors in Vista.</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
<br />
I have a problem.&nbsp; My Intel Q6600 quad core processor is only showing 2 processors in Vista.&nbsp; This is in the Device Manager, System Information, Task Manager, Msconfig etc.<br />
<br />
This is very strange because the last time I checked about six months ago it was showing 4 processors.&nbsp; I haven't changed any related settings so the only thing I can think of which would have changed it is the Windows Update.<br />
<br />
I have searched the forums for solutions.&nbsp; I have tried the command prompt 'show hidden devices' which didn't work.&nbsp; I have tried the 'One graph per cpu' in task manager.&nbsp; I have tried the msconfig 'number of processors'&nbsp;but it&nbsp;only showed 2.&nbsp; I have tried
 uninstalling the cpu in device manager.&nbsp; Nothing works.<br />
<br />
I have Vista 64-bit home basic.&nbsp; The processor works fine otherwise in the bios etc.&nbsp; But I am obviously missing performance if it is only using 2 processors/cores.<br />
<br />
How do I solve this ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

<p><span>Have you installed any recent applications or updates on the system? Do you have an Anti Virus on the system?
</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend checking Device Manager by: Click on Start/ right click on Computer, select Manage, and then select Device Manager
 on the left panel. Then check for any issues&nbsp;with the drivers. (If there is an issue, the device name will have a yellow exclamation mark or a white mark).<br />
If you have issues with drivers, download and update the chipset drivers (from the manufacturer’s website), and any other driver that might have a yellow exclamation mark.</span></p>

            Hi.<br />
<br />
There are no issues with any devices/drivers in Device Manager.&nbsp; I have Norton Internet Security 2010. I haven't installed anything which could possibly cause the problem.&nbsp; I recently installed cpu-z to check the processors/cores&nbsp;and it showed only 2 also.&nbsp;
 As far as the system itself goes, there isn't any indication of any problems.&nbsp; It's really weird and frustrating but for some reason Vista is only recognizing 2 processors/cores out of 4.&nbsp; It's really strange because previously it showed all four processors/cores
 so I am thinking the only thing which could have changed the way Vista is recognising the processor is Windows Update.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know what I can do to solve this problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I've finally figured it out after many months of trying.&nbsp; All I did was restore my bios to 'optimum defaults' and hey presto, all four processors are now showing in Vista.</p>
<p>I wonder why none of the 'experts' told me that.........</p>
<p>Anyway, if anyone else encounters this problem, restoring your bios to 'optimum defaults' could solve the problem.</p>

Generally speaking. when you turn on your computer, it will tell you what button to use to access the BIOS.&nbsp; Usually, it's the DEL or Delete key to access it.<br />
<br />
I know with AMD Bios, once you are at the BIOS setup home screen, there is an option to "load optimized defaults".&nbsp; Using the arrow keys, highlight that and hit the enter key.&nbsp; Then, hit F10 and have the system reboot.<br />
<br />
Other BIOS will have a similar setup, unless you get an ultra modern machine with a more graphical based/mouse interface.&nbsp; However , most BIOS setups will have optimized settings on the "home screen".<br />

            This worked for me also in Windows 10. This is the only place on the net I could find an answer, even though it's a Vista thread. My 4 core q66oo was showing up only as 2 cores even after doing ALL of the other tricks, including adding registry entries
 for core 2 and 3. The instant I loaded optimized defaults in the Bios and booted the 4 cores showed up in task manager/performance. Motherboard: ASRock P43Twins1600. All old, but plenty fast hardware for what I do.

<h2>            Trouble with updates in a group chat</h2>
                    For some reason today I cannot see posts in a group chat that has been ongoing for months. If I post something others can see it, but I cannot see their replies. I can do a one on one chat with certain contacts, yet not all of them. I uninstalled and reinstalled
 twice today. I also rebooted computer and cleared cache on Skype and on desktop.

<strong>%appdata%\Skype</strong> and hit enter. Look for a file named <strong>shared or shared.xml</strong> and delete it.</span></li><li><span>Open the folder that has your Skype name.
</span></li><li><span>Locate and delete the
<strong>config or config.xml</strong> </span></li><li><span>Exit and rename your entire Skype folder to Skype_Old.</span></li><li><span>Re-launch the Skype application.</span></li></ol>

            The three processes you circled use a combined total of 1.1 Mbps of network bandwidth. Since most modern network adapters provide at least 100 Mbps of bandwidth, those processes are using just a tiny percentage of the total.

<h2>            Cannot download Apps from Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>I have yet to successfully download an app from the Windows Store. My PC is a Dell Latitude, running Windows 10 pro, version 1607, 64 bit. I have had it for almost a year and the Windows Store has never worked. It's always the same result: I click "get",
 it says "working", and then an error message pops up: "Try that again. Something happened on our end. Waiting a bit might help".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried: the language location fix, updating Windows Store app, resetting my computer, resetting the app, and several other things that I've now forgotten. Meanwhile I can't get any work done (after the reset, all my apps went away, and I can't download
 them from the Windows Store. </p>

            <p>Hi Davy, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you the administrator of the account?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Since you have tried the Default user logon picture, creating a new user account can help you in identifying if the issue is related to User account corruption.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If not, login with the account that has administrative rights and try changing the picture.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><font color="#000000">Create a new user account and check if the issue persists, if the Issue does not persist in new user account then you can fix the corrupted user account.

            I am sorry but nothing will fix this unless you reinstall windows or hook up the scanner to the usb port.&nbsp; I have this issue that only fixes when I reinstall windows but when I don't want to do that I am forced to connect the multi-function printer to
 the usb port.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can still print fine though.<br />

            <p>OK then, actually I see that your system files are corrupt.You will need an installation disc i.e. an ISO to perform the repair as the DISM tool cannot find source files.</p>
<p>See this:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>Additionally you should specify the source in the DISM command to initiate the upgrade.</p>

            Hey Mawson.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />You can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <pre>The "Settings" dialogs are a "MS Store App".  Try resetting the store environment
Win10 Store apps  / Metro / Modern / UWA / UWP
In Windows 8.1, Microsoft introduced Universal Windows Apps (UWA), colloquially known as “Metro apps” or “Modern apps.” In Windows 10, Microsoft took the idea even further and ended up with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
Based on my own experience, and the reports of many others it appears that the store and it’s associated “environment” is rather fragile, causing various problems with the store itself and store applications.

8 MICROSOFT STORE ERRORS AND HOW TO FIX THEM 
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-microsoft-store-errors/ 
Joe Keeley February 15, 2018 
&lt;snip&gt;
The Windows Store, recently rebranded as the Microsoft Store, is the official marketplace for downloading games, apps, themes, and more. It’s not uncommon for it throw out errors, many of which are hard to resolve. We’re here to help.
Whether your Store is apparently missing, has a damaged cache, stuck downloading, or something else entirely, we’re here to offer all sorts of solutions that should hopefully get everything sorted.
.  00. RESTART THE COMPUTER
Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs or Windows simply get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen component constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them completely is to restart the computer. 
.  0. MS STORE TROUBLE SHOOTING PROCESS
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps - Fix problems with apps from Microsoft Store
http://aka.ms/diag_apps10 - Direct link to dowload the MS Store trouble shooter
Also Use the built in Trouble shooter
Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
Scroll down to the bottom 
Click Windows Store Apps
****  Optional Bonus ****
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions - collected Links to various Win10 downloadable trouble shooters, including one for the Store
.  1. WINDOWS STORE WON’T OPEN: WON’T GIVE YOU AN ERROR MESSAGE
.  2. TRY CLEARING THE STORE CACHE. WSRESET.EXE
Additional instructions 
http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/ 
WSReset.exe must be “Run as Admin”
Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
.  2B (OPTIONAL) MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
If the problems remain, you can try the manual process to reset Windows Update. The store uses Windows Update, so if there is a problem with Windows Update it could affect the store
Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html 
https://www.tekrevue.com/how-to-enable-system-restore-windows-10/ 
Create a System restore point. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point )
Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
Follow the instructions in this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6eHDtylDYo - How to Fix Win Update Errors
This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
. – in start menu search for Windows Update
. - click on “Check for Updates”
. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates
Windows Update Reset batch tool made by MS for XP up to Win10 Creator. 
https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Reset-Windows-Update-Agent-d824badc 
Download the tool from this page. 
Run it (use “Run as Admin”)
Run option 2
.  3. WINDOWS STORE IS MISSING: YOU’LL NEED TO REINSTALL IT.
Re-Install All Store Apps Using PowerShell
…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
…*  right click and select “Run as Administrator” option.
…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}
………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
………  get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmanifest.xml”)}
.  4. WINDOWS STORE DOWNLOAD IS STUCK: 
first check that you’re not trying to install them to an external hard drive.
.  5. ERROR CODE 0X80072EFD: THE STORE IS HAVING NETWORK ISSUES. 
Temporarily turning off the firewall was reported to work for one person.
.  6. ERROR CODE 0X80072EE7: IS A NETWORK ISSUE
This particular error code implies that the server has stumbled. It’s a network issue and can occur even if your internet browser is working perfectly. For this, try resetting your proxy settings. Press Win + R, input cmd and press Enter. Input this and press Enter:
netsh winhttp reset proxy
Restart your computer and open the Store, which should now be working.
.  7. ERROR CODE 0X8000FFFF:  STORE ERROR THAT SAYS THE PAGE CAN’T BE LOADED.
.  8. ERROR CODE 1: THIS IS A VERY CURIOUS ONE. IT WILL APPEAR WHEN YOU TRY TO LAUNCH THE STORE.
&lt;/snip&gt;
RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)</pre>

This is the first time I receive a message like this. What is the limit of contacts you can e-mail to avoid having this problem?

<p>hi</p>
<p>my DVD-RAM GSA-H55N DVD DRIVE cannot read blank DVD-R discs at all and it used to lag the whole computer when a dvd-r disc is in the drive, until i remove the drive on windows xp</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and on windows 7 it still lags but not completely frozen like xp.</p>
<p>i have updated firmware</p>
<p>i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it.</p>
<p>i recently upgraded to windows 7 but the problem started on windows XP SP3, and even after formatting and installing windows 7 its still not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ive tried 2 different brands of discs but i still cant read blank discs.</p>
<p>Ive used the "Playing and burning CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs" program and it hasn't helped/fixed the problem.</p>

<h2>            Drag and Drop Mouse Bug - Not sure If related to windows 7 or hardware issue.</h2>
                    Hey,<br />
<br />
While I was playing SimCity this past week, I encountered a mouse bug where whenever I Drag and drop. The hold on my input for the left click would suddenly break and reclicked at that same point.<br />
<br />
For example. So imagine me draging my highways and it would suddenly build before i finished dragging and when my mouse reaches it's destination, it reclicks. I think I have Isolated the problem to windows 7 itself as after drag and dropping files on my desktop,
 it would still break. These happen at random intervals. They can occur in a matter of milliseconds or seconds.<br />
<br />
Im also considering my mouse could be broken but im not sure if this is relevant to any windows 7 bugs. I have restarted hoping this would go away but it remains. I am not sure when this started happening.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Ultimate Evaluation copy Build 7100<br />
AMD Athlon II x2 240 @ 2.80GHz<br />
4GB RAM<br />
64 BIT<br />
<br />
btw, Sorry about not fileing this in the right section, there isnt seem to be a tec forum.

<p><span><span>Hello David92ng,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.<br />
<br />
Dou you have a wired or wireless mouse?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>One the quickest ways to troubleshoot this issue will be to try another mouse if you have one.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If it is a wireless mouse, you can change the battery and see if that will resolve the issue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In the meantime, try uninstalling the drivers and let windows reinstall the driver after reboot. You can also download
 the latest driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></span></p>

            It is a PS/2 mouse so basically its wired.<br />
<br />
I reinstalled the drivers with no luck. its the one written by Microsoft on 2006/2007ish.<br />
<br />
Like double-click works, but no drag. Right click works tho.<br />
<br />
Im trying to find another mouse throughout the next few days to try this<br />

            I am experiencing the exact same issue.&nbsp; In my case the mouse is a Logitech Marble Mouse.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I disabled all nonessential services and uninstalled tablet support.&nbsp; This made the issue better, but is not entirely gone.&nbsp; It is very frustrating.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This occurs on two machines:<br />
Desktop (infrequently, but noticable)<br />
Laptop (very frequent and annoying issue)<br />
<br />
Logitech Marble Mouse with latest drivers on both computers.<br />
<br />
<strong>UPDATE:&nbsp; I forgot to mention that in both cases the problem occured a week or so after upgrading to Windows 7.&nbsp; Worked perfectly in XP / upgrade to win7 / left click issue as described by David above begins.</strong>

            I also have the same/simlar problem. Windows 7 64 bit RC. For some reason I can no longer drag windows, or files, or anything the involves left clicking because its as if the system thinks i have clicked twice.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I will go to select a menu especially online and it will open and then immediately close as if I pressed it twice. It is very annoying as I usually drag windows around depending on what I am doing and I will start to drag it only to have it dropped
 a second later.. or will be using a scroll bar and it will stop scrolling halfway down the page cause it thinks ive clicked.
<br />
<br />
I have recently installed xp on a second drive, and also installed a logitech webcam. I have a wireless logitech mouse keyboard combo, and was previously using the drivers windows installed automatically, but after problems installed the latest setpoint and
 drivers which hasnt helped

            <p>This is very BAD and hight priority bug in Microsoft hardware mouse driver. Bug appear only in Windows 7.</p>
<p>The bug name is "mouse breaks with snap to button(on focus ;) I guest ;) )" .&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Test to make this bug.</p>
<p>1. Set this settings - "snap to button" - Check(Yes).</p>
<p>2. Restart win 7</p>
<p>3. Put first usb HID &nbsp; wireless &nbsp;mouse and work. Then restart windows.</p>
<p>4. Unplug mouse.</p>
<p>5. Put second(another mark) usb HID wireless mouse and work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Bug characteristics</p>
<p>If you &nbsp;select one row of text fast (hold mouse left button in notepad text and fast select row with dragging to another side of text ), windows hold OFF left mouse , but user still in hold OFF position. Naturally selection make garbage.</p>
<p>This is work on dragging windows dialogs. Hold on dialog menu and drag to some side, user hold on button, but windows hold off button.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Very bad bug. I have it on my working windows 7 32-bit PC. I can not work normally.</p>
<p>The bug is not appear if you change&nbsp; wireless mouse with simple cable mouse ;) &nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My coworker have the same problem with original Microsoft mouse.</p>
<p>Microsoft gift to him on one presentation ;) The mouse is with big price on the market. Yesterday i set to my friend.</p>
<p>My mouse is for 5.00$, yours is for 100$ but this can not protected from this BUG.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What is the lesson. Use simple cable mouse for 2 $ and life will be happy ;)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I want fix that uninstall all mouse drivers and then install latest HID setup drivers?</p>
<p>Battery is new. Signal is good. I test on windows xp and work great with not any problems.</p>
<p>David_O, do you want to send you video of bug?</p>

            I had the same issue. Just Uninstall the drivers and then do a "Scan for Hardware Changes" in device manager. DON'T restart the system for driver installation. I had restarted earlier after uninstallation, that time it did not work.&nbsp;

            I am also using Windows 7, and the same problem also appeared several weeks after I began using the system. I had always used the same mouse and never switched to a different one (though I may have unplugged it and plugged it back in).<br />
<br />
I put up with this problem for weeks. I might click once and the program would respond as if I'd double-clicked; or it might miss the mouse click altogether and do nothing; I would try to drag a window and the cursor would "drop" it unexpectedly; I would highlight
 some text and suddenly "lose" the highlight and start highlighting text at a different point - or worse, drag the partially highlighted text to a new location; I would try to use a vertical scroll bar and would find myself highlighting text, instead, etc.
<br />
<br />
I noticed the mouse response time seemed to be slightly slow in general (milliseconds) so I started looking for any software that might be sitting in-between the driver and the user interface. I discovered ipoint.exe in the Task Manager, which belongs to IntelliPoint/IntelliMouse.
 A quick search revealed that some people have had "problems" with IntelliPoint on Windows 7, and that updating the software fixed these problems. I followed the link to http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/intellimouse, installed the latest version (8.15
 for USB mice), rebooted the system, and my problems were less frequent, but still noticable. I then tried terminating the ipoint.exe process, which was a slight improvement but not a fix.<br />
<br />
The problem went away for me only when I replaced the mouse with a new Windows Certified, "Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical" mouse. I noticed this one uses a different driver than the previous mouse (by Sun Microsystems) which had been using a generic Microsoft
 driver.<br />
<br />
The pattern of failure seems to indicate a bug somewhere between the mouse and the UI which results in the (apparent) occasional loss or double-acknowledgement of interrupts from these devices. The problem is also related to performance, which may explain why
 it only appears some time after a fresh installation of Windows 7 - it takes time to install enough services and programs to load the CPU/memory to the point where the problem becomes noticable. My best guess is that there is a bug in the generic USB mouse
 driver which results in missed or double-acknowledged interrupts. If you were dragging a window and a mouse interrupt was missed, it would look like you'd dropped the window and clicked again; if you clicked once and the interrupt was double-counted, it would
 look like you had double-clicked. Missing interrupts would explain 100% of my symptoms.<br />
<br />
A mismanaged buffer, of sorts, would fit the profile of the problems I was having. Suppose there's a buffer (FIFO) for mouse interrupts that only gets used when the machine is loaded and the interrupts cannot be handled immediately. Suppose there's a bug in
 the algorithm that manages the buffer; for example (and I'm purely speculating), maybe there are two processes that access the FIFO - one that reads, and one that writes. If both try to read/write at the same time, and there's no mutual exclusion being enforced
 (or it's buggy), you might get race-conditions when the FIFO is nearly empty, and some interrupts could missed or counted twice.<br />
<br />
If in doubt, the quickest solution is probably to get a Windows 7 certified mouse.<br />

            I am still not seeing a response on this issue that addresses this, and recently started having the problem as well.
<div>This happens no matter what I remove from my system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To reiterate the actual bug, since there seem to be a few replies that were saying something else:</div>
<div><br />
<div>When holding down the mouse button, the system will automatically(and seemingly randomly) reclick the button being held down. &nbsp;It happens with both mouse buttons(at least for me).</div>
<div><br />
<div>An example:</div>
<div>Select a group of files to move.</div>
<div>Begin a right click drag to the new destination.</div>
<div>Midway through dragging a right click context menu pops up at the cursor's current location.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another example:</div>
<div>In a game with a camera controlled by holding down the right mouse button.</div>
<div>Hold down right mouse button and start turning the camera.</div>
<div>Camera snaps around almost at random.</div>
<div>Further investigation reveals that the mouse is reclicking and doing a position update because of how the game holds the cursor in location, causing the camera to snap around based on how far you have moved your mouse since holding right click.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This happens with either mouse button.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I have tried with several different mice and drivers with no effect.</div>
<div>Currently I am using the g700 which has the benefit of being a Wireless mouse that can be used as a Wired mouse when the charging USB cable is connected. &nbsp;It happens regardless of which mode I am using it in. &nbsp;There are no other occurrences of "wireless
 lag".</div>
<div>It happens with 2 other older Logitech Mice I have that are dual optical instead of laser.</div>
<div>It happens with all of the various Microsoft brand mice I have.</div>
<div>It happens with the few generic dell USB mice I have lying around.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tried uninstalling and deleting the mice drivers and letting Windows 7 handle the driver installs, no effect.</div>
<div>Uninstalled and deleted drivers and had the respective driver install programs for the mice do the installs, no effect.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have systematically gone through and uninstalled/disabled almost every piece of software on my computer to see if it is being caused by a program I have running/service. &nbsp;Nothing had any effect at all. &nbsp;This seems to be an issue with the actual driver
 system/Windows 7. &nbsp;BMGilbert seems to be saying roughly the same thing after his testing as well.</div>
<div>This should not be happening on practically every new mouse though, especially one as new as a G700.</div>

 Wireless Keyboard 6000 v.3 controlled by&nbsp; "Microsoft USB Dual Receiver Wireless Keyboard (IntelliType Pro)" driver v.&nbsp;8.20.409.0 date May 11, 2011 (same version and date as the mouse driver).

            <p>Im having the excact same problems, Its a year on from your post did you solve the issue.<br />
Ive a brand new windows 7 PC and Ive tryed 3 mice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples...</p>
<p>Left click move/drag a MP3 file it opens it and plays<br />
Trying to drag a folder will open folder</p>
<p>Moving files lets go and drops them in other folders, you havnt a clue where theyve gone. Its just a constant "Undo".</p>
<p>Doing stuff in graphics programs try selecting multiple images the mouse unclicks and moves just the one image that your mouse is on.</p>
<p>Highlighting text to copy, constantly retrying as its clicking of and on, highlighting from various points<br />
<br />
Using snipping tool will click off before you have covered all you want to snip.</p>
<p>The list goes on....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Did you solve this issue? </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the controller works properly on other games (all buttons and triggers) then you know that it is communicating with your PC properly.&nbsp; You will need to look into the controller configuration on the game to make sure it can use a controller and is properly
 set up for it.<br />

<p>That could be a bug with the DLC itself. I looked up the contents of the DLC on several sites, and they all do say that some of the single player characters will be made available for multiplayer. There could also be an issue with the disc as well, because
 the disc is what contains the coding to load basic game elements, like NPCs and such.
</p>
<p>I'd recommend doing the following:</p>
<p>1. Check the back of your game disc for scratches, smears, food/drink, fingerprints, etc.</p>
<p>2. Turn your console off and let it cool down if it seems to be overheated (check by touching the console (especially near the fan) and seeing if it appears to be hot)</p>
<p>3. If it still doesn't work, and you've cleaned your disc and let your Xbox rest, try re-downloading the DLC again, and make sure you have enough space on your Xbox.</p>
<p>4. If it still doesn't work, I don't really have an answer. I'd recommend waiting a bit to see if it is a glitch and the DLC is patched.
</p>
<p>I'm sorry that it isn't working out for you, I hope it does begin to soon.</p>

            <p>Hi there HorseyLover,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you try these steps, I copied them from a Rockstar support thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This issue may occur if you have deleted one or more of the DLC packs from your hard drive after playing and saving your game online with them installed. &nbsp;Please re-download all of the DLC packs you own and then test the outfitter again.</em></p>
<p><em>If that does not work, try deleting and re-installing the Title Update. &nbsp;Note that this Title Update appears in the RDR save file folder, rather than the 360 Cache.</em></p>
<p><em>Go to My Xbox-&gt;System Settings-&gt;Memory-&gt;Hard Drive-&gt;Games-&gt;Red Dead Redemption.</em></p>
<p><em>Delete the Title Update and reboot the console. &nbsp;Start the game while connected to the Internet and you will be prompted to download the patch. &nbsp;We also recommend clearing the cache (even though Title Update 1.07 is found elsewhere).</em></p>
<p><em>Go to My Xbox-&gt;System Settings-&gt;Memory-&gt;Highlight hard drive and press Y-&gt;Choose to clear cache.</em></p>
<p><em>If you are still freezing when going into the Outfitter, please try the disc in another console to determine if the console is unable to read from the disc. &nbsp;If the disc is bad, please click "Submit a Request" at the top of this page and use Disc/Warranty as the Issue type.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the result.</p>

            HI Chingwan, what is the brand and the model of your USB3 hub?
<br />When you plugged this device to USB3 hub prior to the issue, did it work?
<br />Meanwhile I recommend that you update the chipset drivers. Please visit the manufacturer’s website for this.       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>What is the brand and model# of your PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if it is a USB 2.0 CAP Device, you might not get it to work in a 3.0 and higher port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, Did you install the drivers and software that came with it ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the software/drivers state it is for Windows 10 or an earlier Windows version.</p>
<p>Have you used it before on this PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to install the drivers/software in compatibility mode they are designed for. See DETAILED STEPS 1/2 down the page in link below.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Look in my comments in this link below. I actually have 3 programs to capture the videos. You need a software program to be able to capture them or watch them live, and the drivers to connect it to PC. Looks like you are getting some sort of connection.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This will be the best thing you ever did for All audio and video playback in WMP</p>
<p>Don't waste your time with useless media players. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For all audio and video playback<br />
Install shark007 advanced codecs<br />
Close the 64bit settings app<br />
Select shark007 suggested settings in the 32bit settings app<br />
Close it out<br />
<br />
Go to:</p>
<p>Settings&gt;&gt;Apps&gt;&gt;Default Apps<br />
Select Windows Media Player for default player for audio and video.<br />
<br />
Start Menu&gt;&gt;All Apps <br />
Locate Windows Media Player, Right Click&gt;&gt;More&gt;&gt;Pin to Taskbar<br />
Restart PC<br />
<br />
Now you can play every audio and video file in WMP. Shark007 is the best in the world. Never a problem again playing files. Even DVD, BlueRay and 4K videos. It is free and no malware. Been using it on mine and customers PC's for almost 20 years since XP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It even provides nice Thumbnail previews in Explorer, as Shark007 installs Icaros. You can access Icaros by opening up the Shark007 64bit settings app and opening up Icaros.
</p>
<p>But the default settings for it is fine as it is. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You must always open Shark007 Settings &gt;&gt; RUN AS ADMIN to make any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shark007 is located in Start Menu&gt;&gt;All Apps&gt;&gt;Shark007 Codec’s. </p>
<p>Right Click&gt;&gt;More and Run as Admin or Open File Location and send shortcut to desktop. Then right click on them and Run as Admin.</p>

</p><p><strong>The creator of Shark007</strong> does not pay to register it because nobody donates enough money to him. It is expensive to register and he has never registered it. All programs that are made, if they do not pay Microsoft to register it, then you
 could get the message that it could be harmful when you download the file. This is how Microsoft makes more $$$.,

<p>Hey Wonjin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us today. I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, you are welcome to post in your native language if that is easier for you to explain the issue at hand and any steps you have tried to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The moderators have no problem with translating posts, so do whatever makes you comfortable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately that error code cannot be found in our database, so we need to try some things from the ground up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest to completely reboot your PC and log back into the operating system. Once everything is back try to sign into the Xbox App again. If it's still giving you errors try logging in to the same account on Xbox.com and let us know if it allows
 you to log in.</p>
        </p>
