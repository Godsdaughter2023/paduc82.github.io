<p>Hello Gregory,</p>
<p>
</p><p>ReadyBoost uses external USB flash drives as a hard disk cache to improve disk read performance. Supported external storage types include USB thumb drives, SD cards, and CF cards. Since ReadyBoost will not provide a performance gain when the primary disk
 is an <strong>SSD</strong>, the system disables ReadyBoost when reading from an SSD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ReadyBoost provides the most significant performance improvement under the following circumstances:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The computer has a slow hard disk drive. Computers with a primary hard disk Windows Experience Index (WEI) subscore lower than 4.0 will see the most significant improvements.</li><li>The flash storage provides fast, random, non-sequential reads. Sequential read speed is less important.</li><li>The flash storage is connected by a fast bus. Typically, USB memory card readers are not sufficiently fast. However, connecting flash memory to an internal memory card reader might provide sufficient performance.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, ReadbyBoost may still be able to improve your device's performance that has a small amount of RAM and using a fast USB drive. It is also somehow subjective as it will depend on what kind of applications you're going to run/use on your computer.
 Adding additional RAM will surely improved performance much more than using ReadyBoost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2442620/usb-and-sd-storage-media-readyboost-with-a-sd-card-or-a-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to learn more on how to use ReadyBoots with an
 SD card or a USB flash drive. The steps also applies to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Windowsupdate error 80070584 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronjackman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windowsupdate error 80070584</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> 80070584.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Everyone. I have an old Acer Aspire 9300 Laptop with 3 gb Ram and a 1.8 GHz Amd dual core cpu. I have been running Windows 7 64 bit on it successfully for a good while now but in the last few days I have been having problems updating the NVidia Ge force
 Go 6100 graphics chip. I have tried everything Microsoft suggests to no avail. I have got a display but it is the standard VGA. The error code I get each time it fails to install is 80070584 which I think is a general code meaning the driver didn't install
 and would apply to any hardware update installation. So what I would like to know is this, does anyone know where I can acquire a complete Ge force Go 6100 software package that will run on my laptop which was only built for Vista 32 bit or so the updates
 at Acer would lead me to believe. Alternatively, does anyone have a solution to the update problem.
</p>
<div>Thanks in advance, Ron</div>

            Hi Gerry. Sorry to take so long getting back to you but I cant believe how easily I resolved this problem. With the graphics chip showing standard VGA adapter in system, I restarted in safe mode then updated the chip with Windows update and then restarted
 the system. Hey presto, back to NVidia and its been running ok since.&nbsp;
<div>Thanks for your answer anyway and I hope my experience will be of assistance to anyone else with this problem&nbsp;</div>

                    <p>Realtek RTL8188EE 802.11 wifi adapter underperforming after upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware is HP Pavilion 500-424 PC with factory OS Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original Wi-Fi speed was between 20 and 30mbps as is with all the other devices in my home that use Wi-Fi. Current speed is now between 1 and 5mbps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating the driver as well as all compatible previous versions with no luck in restoring the original Wi-Fi speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restoring the PC to Windows 8.1 and the problem persisted&nbsp; and upgraded back to Windows 10 while it was still free.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen several Wi-Fi connection issues with regards to the Windows 10 Upgrades though none of the documented issues I've come across seem to provide a solution to my problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can offer any help, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I resolved my issue by reinstalling Windows 8. I pulled the product key from bios via command prompt and downloaded Windows 8 from Microsoft. My speeds are actually better now than previous Windows 10 issue.&nbsp;

    <title>AMD Graphics Driver &#47; CCC Error &#40;Windows 8.1&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xflawless11x  say:</h3>
<h2>            AMD Graphics Driver &#47; CCC Error &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
Laptop: Dell Studio 1558</p>
<p>
OS: Windows 8.1 Pro (64 Bit)</p>
<p>
Processor: Intel i7</p>
<p>
Graphics Card:&nbsp;AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5000 Series</p>
<p>
Harddrive: Crucial M4 128GB SSD</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Issue:</p>
<p>
Updated to Windows 8.1 through the Windows Store Update and it broke all my graphics settings. &nbsp;Everything is blurry and I'm unable to get the same setup as previously. &nbsp;Additionally CCC would not start and when attempting to re-install I'm getting an "Application
 Install: install package failure!"</p>
<p>
I've attached two screenshots one with the error message from CCC and another of the device page and device driver history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
It appears as though when the Windows 8.1 update went through it deleted then re-installed with some new driver. &nbsp;I have no idea how to fix this or what the steps would be to remedy this issues. &nbsp;Nor am I actually sure if that's the true issue.</p>
<p>
Please feel free to ask any questions that might help clarify the issue.</p>
<p>
I appreciate any and all advice in advance.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
I've posted in the AMD support forums and received no response so I'm trying here now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,</p>
<p>
Flawless</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Note: You can even see the 'fuzziness' of the screen from the screenshot</p>

<br />
<br />
When you downloaded the Twain Driver, did you get the 1st Driver for Vista 32bit?<br />
<br />
And did you also expand that + sign in front of it at the above website, and follow the installation instructions?<br />
<br />
I don't think that you followed the install info, that is why it is still asking for it.<br />

<h2>            My computer won&#39;t start due to registry keys that were accidentally deleted. What do I do&#63; </h2>
                    Some registry keys were deleted in the process of cleaning my computer of a virus. My program was a little too vicious in the cleaning process, and deleted some vital keys for windows to function. Now, every time I start my computer, it says it can't,
 looks for the error, says it found it and cured it, then shuts off. Then I turn it back on, and it goes through the whole thing again. How do I put the registry key back where it is supposed to be without my computer turning off while I am at it?

<p>You can if you boot to the installation or Recovery Disk and initiate System Restore from the Recovery Environment on those disks.&nbsp; If you have no disks,
<span>
you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (though you may need to make the disk on a differentt computer).&nbsp; Then boot to the CD on the problem computer.&nbsp;
<span>
To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and
 exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The disk does not usse the computer OS so it doesn't matter
 if the system won't start normally or in safe mode.&nbsp; It should still run the disk and those options should still be available from the disk.&nbsp; From the options on the disk you can try System Restore and if that doesn't work then you can try Startup Repair.&nbsp;
 There are some other options we can try from the disk but let's just try these to start.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!<br />

<p>Hopefully it could be a simple case of your settings being altered. Right click into an empty area of your desktop, then from the menu click on
<strong>View&nbsp;</strong>and opt for the medium or small option. It may not be something so simple but it doesn't hurt to check.</p>

<h2>            Server timed out problems, amongst others</h2>
                    
<p>Here is my saga. &nbsp;I have brought my console from one house to another. &nbsp;No probs running it wireless at the first house. &nbsp;I only play MW3 online so far.</p>
<p>The problem at this house is the games get laggy and eventually after one or two games kick me off with a 'server timed out' message. &nbsp;If I do get to complete a game it is likely that I get kicked off xbox live while waiting to start a new one.</p>
<p>I found out my modem was running slow after a few minutes so swapped it out with a Technicolor Gateway from Telstra as I'm with bigpond. &nbsp;It was a bit glitchy so I have run a temp lead from the iso box at my first entry point into my lounge room and am now
 running ethernet straight from modem.</p>
<p>Today I spent an hour or so on the phone to an Ambassador who was in the phillipines and even though he wasn't an expert with the Technicolor Thompson we muddled through opening up some ports. &nbsp;The first game after the reboot was fine so I let him go. &nbsp;After
 an hour or so connecting to xbox live is harder and it even fails the connectivity test which it never did before.</p>
<p>Here is the current result of a speedtest: &nbsp;http://www.speedtest.net/result/2736085775.png</p>
<p>I asked the guy in the phillipines if it could be my slow upload speed and he said no.</p>
<p>All of the below may not be accurate now because since then we changed the IP to manual on &nbsp;to 10.0.0.25 on the console.</p>
<p>We have also manually added&nbsp;<span>Modern Warfare 3_Open NAT to the game and application section of the toolbox in the Gateway. &nbsp;Opened ports 80,88,3074 and 53</span></p>

<p>I will go ahead and let you know that your speeds are super slow. Your upload isn't conducive with what you should have for online gaming. You want at least .5 upload, and you barely have half of that. Is that what you're paying for?</p>

<p>The unfortunate side is that there isn't much that can be done with this. The best I can say is see if you can get better speeds for what you're paying for (specifically upload speeds, your downloads are fine). :\</p>

<p>How far out are you from the nearest town? Does the town have a exchange? Going from personal experience, upload speed is always lower if you are too far away from the local telephone exchange. No matter ISP you go with you will still unfortunately still
 have a low upload speed. If you are a.fair distance away I am surprised they even gave you ADSL 2.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Installation Guidelines - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Installation Guidelines</h2>
                    <p>First off, this is not in any way official and thus many things can go wrong.<br />
I will not be responsible if any damage (software or hardware) arise. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.<br />
Before we begin, it is recommended to read the entire article before doing anything.<br />
Or at least, read and consolidate the entire step number and by those recommended sub sections completely before any actions.<br />
<br />
===============================================<br />
WINDOWS CLEAN INSTALL CHECK LIST AND GUIDELINES<br />
===============================================<br />
After installing the OS:<br />
<br />
1. LAST CHECK AND SETUP OF OS INSTALL AND PERSONAL DATA STRUCTURES<br />
Install any OS updates. Since Windows 10 updates are rather finicky, you can continue the steps and let it update when it requests. Microsoft™ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br />
Move user folders and other data to its original state. (if changed, see RECOMMENDATIONS - USER DATA)<br />
This means that before installing or launching any apps it is recommended to move the user folders -<br />
especially those that are frequently used by apps like "Documents" and "Roaming" to their respective place.<br />
Install preferred browser for latest drivers and other apps that either use -<br />
online installers or need to be downloaded from the internet.<br />
<br />
2. Install Drivers<br />
Graphics Driver - It is recommended to install those drivers first for easier work.<br />
Audio Driver - It is recommended to install those right after so you have audiable signals as well as visual ones of what you are doing.<br />
Install any other drivers.<br />
NOTE: I havent found any issues so far with installing all the drivers without restarting the PC.<br />
I restart my system after all the drivers are installed that might request a restart.<br />
<br />
3. Install OS Customization Tools And Apply<br />
RocketDock, Rainmeter etc.<br />
<br />
4. Install Applications and Programs<br />
Discord, Photoshop, Blender, UE4, Games etc.<br />
<br />
5. Install And/Or Setup Core Addons<br />
Codecs, Plugins, Format Extensions etc.<br />
<br />
6. DEFRAGMENT DRIVE<br />
NOTE:<br />
Most often than not, after a complete reinstall of the OS and all Apps that one might use, a drive defrag is not needed.<br />
<br />
OPTIONAL:<br />
Defragment any drives that are used in the setup process.<br />
Meaning, if only one drive like "C" was being used for all the setups -<br />
(OS, Apps and Programs) than only that drive needs defragmentation.<br />
If "C" drive is used for OS and maybe some other core programs and -<br />
"D" drive was used for other applications and programs, both need defragmentation.<br />
Its not always absolutely necessary but its a good practice and a guarantee -<br />
that fragmentation is not going to be an issue from that point on.<br />
Regular defragmentations are very much still recommended. Based on the amount of data being added and removed,<br />
one to two months defrag schedule is a good practice.<br />
<br />
WARNING! THIS APPLIES ON HARD DISK DRIVES EXCLUSIVELY! DO NOT DEFRAG SOLID STATE DRIVES WITHOUT CONSOLIDATION!<br />
<br />
OPTIONALLY INSTALL SECURITY APPS BEFORE OR AFTER STEP 6 - Disk Defrag<br />
Install Security (Anti-Virus) Applications and Programs (RECOMMENDED at this point)<br />
It is assumed that all programs are legit and thus leaving security programs last to install.<br />
Security programs can slow down a massive re-installation of apps and programs by quite some cumulative time.<br />
So i usually install them last.<br />
<br />
7. YOU ARE DONE!<br />
CONGRATULATIONS! Your system is ready to go. :)<br />
<br />
===============<br />
RECOMMENDATIONS<br />
===============<br />
SELF CONTAINED PROGRAMS - PORTABLE APPS<br />
It is recommended to use any light on system apps and programs as self contained "PORTABLE" versions if possible-<br />
that are as part of your core user environment.<br />
For instance, if you use RocketDock, Notepad++, Rainmeter, it is recommended to use it as a portable version to ensure a continuous personal environment.<br />
Get to know your apps and do research to see where it is best applicable.<br />
<br />
USER DATA<br />
With the new addition to Windows 10 and possibility to move user data around,<br />
i would recommend intermediate users to move that data to a drive outside the OS drive.<br />
That way, usually tedious backing up of user data can be skipped and app settings will be saved as well.<br />
For instance, i have my user data Desktop, Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos and Roaming all moved to a different drive.<br />
Any damage, refresh or clean install of the OS will not erase my user data.<br />
<br />
I suggest using the file structure same as the default for easier tracking as well.<br />
That would look something like this:<br />
Default OS - "C:\Users\UserName\Desktop" or "C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming"<br />
Custom Location - "D:\Users\UserName\Desktop" or "D:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming"<br />
Notice that only the drive letter is changed.<br />
<br />
Also note that AppData folder is hidden.<br />
You can see hidden files and folders simply by going into view options and ticking checkbox -<br />
"Show hidden files,folders and drives" in the advanced tab or -<br />
"Hidden items" in Windows 10 view tab.<br />
After moving the folders, you can hide them again if you dont do anything within them.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
CONCLUSION<br />
==========<br />
I've been using this general guideline for years ever since the XP era.<br />
I'm from the 98 era but i learned to install and maintain my own PC on Windows XP.<br />
(Arguably still the best Windows OS) :P<br />
(BRING BACK INDEPENDENT TOOLBARS!)<br />
Of course steps have been updated for new technology and apps.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
PERMA APPS &amp; PROGRAMS<br />
=====================<br />
Programs that dont require to be reinstalled after a OS wipe. (Clean Install)<br />
<br />
STEAM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Repairs itself)<br />
<br />
========================<br />
PORTABLE APPS &amp; PROGRAMS<br />
========================<br />
Program that are portable/self contained, or offered/are possible to use as portable version.<br />
<br />
Notepad++&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Officially supported from withing installation)<br />
RocketDock&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Unofficially, requires manual conversion)<br />
Rainmeter&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Officially supported from within installation)<br />
<br />
=============<br />
TIPS &amp; TRICKS<br />
=============</p>
<p>PORTABLE APPS<br />
I recommend to store any portable apps in a separate folder from "Program Files".<br />
For instance, i store all my portable apps in a folder "Programs" that are besides "Program Files" and "Program Files (x86)".<br />
That way i know which ones are which at any given moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have or want to setup Notepad++ as a portable variant,</p>
<p>keep in mind that things like Edit with Notepad++ right-click context menu will be missing.<br />
This requires Registry editing either manually or via a .reg file.<br />
For manual registry editing there is enough tutorials out there to help you out.<br />
I recommend .reg files for easy access.<br />
Create both the reg file that adds and the one that removes the entries as well or you can create all three.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add notepad++ to context menu, create a new text document with any text editor and copy/paste and edit the following:<br />
(Edit with Notepad++ entry with icon. Default behavior if it were to be installed.)</p>
<p><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong><br />
<strong>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\Edit with Notepad++]</strong><br />
<strong>"Icon"="<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">D:\\Programs\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe</span>"</strong><br />
<strong>BlankLine</strong><br />
<strong>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\Edit with Notepad++\command]</strong><br />
<strong>@="<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">D:\\Programs\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe</span> %1"<br />
</strong>(Edit with Notepad++ entry without icon. In case you dont want the icon.)</p>
<p><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong><br />
<strong>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\Edit with Notepad++\command]</strong><br />
<strong>@="<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">D:\\Programs\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe</span> %1"</strong></p>
<p>Note the underlined address, edit that address to point to the execute file. (where your notepad++.exe is currently located)</p>
<p>Yours might be D:\\Portable\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe<br />
Change accordingly.<br />
TIP: Hold left shift and right click any files or folders, like <strong>notepad++.exe</strong> and in the context menu select
<strong>Copy as path<br />
</strong>and simply replace the current address. Note it might copy with punctuation's, remove any duplicates.</p>
<p>Save the file by selecting <em>Save as type: </em>to <em>All Files</em></p>
<p>Name the file what ever you wish, i suggest something descriptive and add .reg in the name.<br />
Example: <strong>Edit with Notepad++ Context Menu ADD with icon</strong>.reg for the entry with icon.<br />
And/or:<strong> Edit with Notepad++ Context Menu ADD</strong>.reg for the entry without icon.</p>
<p>This will associate the file as a .reg file which we want. Now all you need to do to apply it is to double-click the file or right-click
<strong>merge</strong> in the context menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove notepad++ from context menu, create a new text document with any text editor and copy/paste the following:</p>
<p><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong><br />
<strong>[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\Edit with Notepad++]</strong></p>
<p>No editing needed for this just save the file by selecting <em>Save as type: </em>
to <em>All Files</em></p>
<p>Name the file what ever you wish, i suggest something descriptive but add DEFAULT in the name as well</p>
<p>so you know which one to use to revert to original settings and add .reg in the name.<br />
Example: <strong>Edit with Notepad++ Context Menu REMOVE (Default)</strong>.reg<br />
This will associate the file as a .reg file which we want. Now all you need to do to apply it is to double-click the file or right-click
<strong>merge</strong> in the context menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DOCKS<br />
Using a portable version of RocketDock or any dock where the most important and frequently used apps and programs shortcuts are placed<br />
is a good way to have a reference of which apps are installed and which are still missing.<br />
An example of my usual PC environment is that i have all my apps pinned on RocketDock and when ever i do a OS clean install -<br />
i simply run RocketDock and i see which apps are still missing (usualy indicated with a "?" mark).<br />
Even if i dont plan on installing an app right away, i still keep the shortcut on the dock for future reference.<br />
The only guidline here is to install apps on the same location when the shortcuts are being placed on the dock.<br />
I usually always install all apps the same way they would be by their defaults but on a different drive.<br />
For instance, if an apps default installation location is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Some App\App" -<br />
i would simply set it to the drive letter i normally use for my apps which would be "D:\Program Files (x86)\Some App\App".<br />
Notice that everything is the same except the drive letter.<br />
Now if i ever wanted to install an app on the system drive or a different drive altogether,<br />
all i had to do is set any shortcuts on the dock to the right drive letter and thats it.<br />
</p>
<p>Some apps like Rainmeter wont have the option for <em>start when windows starts</em> and the way to do this is by simply adding a shortcut to the startup folder.</p>
<p>Easiest way is to either locate the folder, by using Windows Key &amp; R (run command) and entering
<strong>Shell:startup</strong></p>
<p>or making a batch file to keep in the Rainmeters folder (which i use and recommend)<strong>.</strong>To make a batch file that opens the user startup folder, simply make a new text document with any text editor.<br />
Copy/paste the following inside:<br />
<strong>start Shell:startup</strong></p>
<p>Save the document as <em>All Files </em>in the <em>Save as type:</em> and name it something descriptive like
<strong>Open </strong><strong>User Startup Folder</strong>.bat<br />
Note to add .bat at the end of the name so the file gets associated as a batch file and your done.<br />
Double click and it should open the right startup folder.</p>
<p>You can keep that file anywhere you want or keep it with Rainmeter for easy access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres a guideline to checking out configs and settings of practically any app. Make it a habit after exploring to close it by
<em>cancel</em>.<br />
Many menus dont re-confirm of any changes being done (and it supposed to be so) but many times it happens that while exploring some entries, you might set something without intent. I have seen people do that and done so myself countless times.</p>
<p>Now its rather easier than it was to revert those changes by googling them but you can image how fun that was when we didnt have google. And some entries can be so little and plain that finding out what it is on google even can take hours. Stay safe. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>================<br />
PERSONAL REMARKS<br />
================<br />
I wish there was a better way of storing the installed apps and programs information we could back up.<br />
In an era of portability and apps that are larger and larger, like games and alike. Games can be large as 30 to 60 GB on average.<br />
I wish i wouldnt need to reinstall apps as well that are on a separate drive already just because i reinstalled the OS.<br />
Im not talking of the apps stored personal information like the ones in Documents or AppData. Those are easy to back up and straight forward.<br />
Registry backup per program that you could select and other connected data. Like photoshops host file and other files in ProgramData etc.<br />
The installers know the locations of each of those files.<br />
If only we had a built in backup option in the OS to export and store those files that are -<br />
outside of our selected install directory wherever we choose and import them back.<br />
And i know there are different kinds of running the OS and procedures of reinstalling, refreshing etc the OS.<br />
But i am talking about old school clean install and is aimed at that.<br />
So please take this as a grain of salt. :)<br />
<br />
We can all agree that not needing to reinstall Steam is the best thing of them all. xD<br />
Most of us have at least a few games, being even if its for children, the amount of games or even just a few games can be large in size.<br />
Not needing to reinstall them will greatly decrease setup time.<br />
Do take notice of individual games data that are being stored outside of steams installation folder, like "Documents" and "Roaming".<br />
Those are still your responsibility. If you use my example of user data, that should not be an issue ever again.<br />
<br />
Lastly, after you get the hang of it, you can experiment with different workflows and do things completely differently.<br />
What suits me the best might not suit you at all. But it is always good to start from somewhere and get the idea and mechanic behind it.<br />
So if you never done anything like this but would like to but needed an overview of the procedures, this should hopefully help.</p>
<p>That is why i havent linked to any additional files like .reg or .bat files so you can learn to create your own and get started with it.<br />
You can do so much more to automate a process by Windows in-built scripting language. Use its advantage. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more things like these feel free to contact me so i can expand, change, enhance -<br />
this article to suit most users that never worked like this or are simply new and need a starting point.<br />
Thanks for reading. :)<br />
Screenshots soon to follow.<br />
Wish i could make a video but im poor/poor country economics and my PC is not capable of such endeavours. xD</p>

            <p>If your PC account is connected to a Microsoft Account online, you cannot remove the password requirement.&nbsp; This protects your Microsoft Account, which has confidential and private information (such as your payment details).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You still have options though:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Disconnect.<br />
</strong>You could disconnect your Microsoft Account from your PC Account (which means your PC login is a "local account").&nbsp; However this will lose many benefits like settings backup and sync, plus block your ability to use apps, games, skydrive, and even the
 Mail app.<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Change the type of password.<br />
</strong>You can change the type of password used so that it's a simple 4-digit PIN number (like cell phones) or even a picture password (draw on a picture to unlock your computer).<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Use the sleep option.</strong><br />
Sleep mode is very efficient, and you can tell Windows not to ask for a password when resuming from sleep.&nbsp; Then the only time you need to type a password is during full system reboots, such as after updates are installed.&nbsp; This happens monthly, so now instead
 of typing your password every day, you only have to type it once a month.</li></ol>

<div>How do I unhide a hidden shortcut that is pinned to the Start Menu? This problem occurs very simply but does not resolve quite so simply. I pinned a shortcut to the Start Menu before unchecking the hidden attribute (didn't realize I had to) causing the
 shortcut to be registered without being visible. When I attempted to pin it again I was alerted to it's presence by the fact that the second pinning rendered a title extension of (2). When I attempted to change the title I received the message stating that
 a link by that title was already present. I don't want this to remain as an enduring situation which is why I need instruction on how to change it. I could just change the title of the second pinning to something close but different but then I'd have two shortcuts
 to the same program pinned to my Start Menu, one without the ability to be removed. I'm just a little to **** for that if I have to say so. I could uninstall the program and then run another program that searches for broken shortcuts to "fix" then (I'm assuming
 that means deletion when they can't be "fixed") but would like to avoid the extra pedestrian steps for the advantage of learning a new Windows skill if such skill exists. Could use this help ASAP. Thanks.</div>

<h2>            Windows installer starts automatically on reboot</h2>
                    Windows installer comes on automatically on reboot and then&nbsp; goes manic.&nbsp; I have to shut it down through task manager (several tries). I have tried to reregister to no avail.&nbsp; My computer works fine in between these above episodes.&nbsp; I would like to uninstall
 (or rename) msi and then reinstall 4.5.&nbsp; I'm running Vista 64 bit on a DELL Inspiron desktop, quad core, 6 gb of RAM.&nbsp; Running Vista home premium with SP2. &nbsp; This happened after I installed Windows uninstaller to remove vestiges of a software program that
 failed to install properly.&nbsp; Then I got the msg that the program might not have installed properly. (windows uninstaller.)&nbsp; I went to control panel to repair the uninstaller program (don't know if that worked or not).&nbsp; Dell won't help because it is a Microsoft
 problem.&nbsp; Microsoft won't help unless you pay them.&nbsp; Same old story.......&nbsp; thanks for any help you can give me.&nbsp;

Check these keys in RegEdit -&nbsp; Start - type in Search box - Regedit<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce<br />

<br />
In the RIGHT PANE of those keys there should be nothing except the "Default"<br />
<br />
If any have something then Highlight the Key - click File on menu and then EXPORT - save with a name you<br />
can remember. Then Right Click on RIGHT PANE entries and DELETE (except leave Default alone if there)<br />
<br />
Reboot&nbsp;- is it gone now?<br />

            <p>Are the black borders part of the desktop i.e. can you put the mouse cursor or icons into the black area, or is the black area 'wasted space'.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the black area is 'wasted space' around your desktop then it may be that you have to adjust your monitor settings, picture size etc, to fill the screen again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you can move things into the black areas i.e. the desktop is full screen but the picture isn't, then it may be the type of wall paper in personalization, its 'picture position'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>right-click on your desktop.</p>
<p>click personalize</p>
<p>towards the bottom, click 'desktop background'</p>
<p>towards the bottom is a pull down selection list called 'picture position'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It has options such as - Fill, Fit, Stretch, Tile, and Center</p>
<p>Try each in turn and see if it helps.</p>
<p>If it does then &lt;save changes&gt;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If not, have you loaded any new updates like new graphics drivers lately?<br />

<p>Hey guys! Is the profile you want to sign in to still on your console? If so log in to it, open Account Management, and look under WLID. Is that the same email address you are using to sign in on Xbox.com? Try that one and let me know how it goes. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Cannot Connect to an external monitor via mini DVI or wirelessly</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Microsoft Surface Book 5 with Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I am unable to project my display to another screen in any way. Usually I do this using an HDMI cable which I connect throught an adapter to the mini DVI input. However this will not work. Nor can I connect to a screen wirelessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used device manager to uninstall and re-install the driver in the display adapters section. I have unplugged and replugged in the adapter. Checked the settings on the dsiplay I would like to project to. I've cyled between extend, duplicate, 2nd screen
 only, and none of it works. I've changed HDMI cables, and HDMI ports, but again there is no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to connect wirelessly it simply loads for a while and then says it failed to connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Surface repair tool, and went through the diagnostics it recommended, but again there is no progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The display I am connecting to shows there is an input to it from my computer to the HDMI port, however when I choose it as the source is sats there is "no signal."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I am on a ship in Korea, so taking it in to be looked at is a bit of a non-option at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I've sort of exhausted all the recommendations I can find on the internet. Does anyone have any ideas that might work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you are able to provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>V/R,</p>
<p>Adam</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am using a Mini Display Port to HDMI Adapter (I believe that is USB-C to HDMI). I have a few adapters, each has either worked, or is a newly purchased model of one that has worked previously. Changing the adapter does not solve the issue as I have tried
 each with no success. I have not used the Surface Dock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My device is a Surface Book (I do not believe it is the Surface Book 2 as I bought it in the fall of 2016). The display is a Samsung 32" LED TV. Also, I am not able to do "screen mirroring" with the computer either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried numerous troubleshooting tips including disabling, enabling, updating, uninstalling and re-installing the driver for display adapter (the only one I was unable to do was "roll-back" the driver. In addition I have used the command prompt to scan
 for issues, and found none.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HDMI cables work, as they have been tested with other equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating Windows allowed it to work briefly, but then the issue returned and I have not been able to get it to work again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. What recommendations do you have?</p>
<p>
