<h2>            Saving&#47;creating personalized desktop theme</h2>
                    <p>I'm having ongoing problems saving personalized Themes.&nbsp; As an example, I have pics I'd like to use and save as part of a personalized Theme, but the pics disappear after having saved them in a renamed Theme.&nbsp; My guess is they aren't saved for some reason
 (even after I rename and then save the Theme).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong??</p>

<p>If you only want a single photo as a background (as I usually do), the easiest way is to open the photo in 'Photos' app, right click on it and select 'Set as' then 'Set as background. You can also set the lockscreen in the same way.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you import themes from the store, a folder containing the photos folder and a theme file goes to&nbsp; C:/ Users/ [you]/ Appdata/ Local/ Microsoft/ Windows/ Themes. If you want a single photo then apply as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried creating my own theme. First I collected some photos into a dedicated folder for use in a slideshow. In Settings/ Personalisation/ Background, I browsed for this folder to create the slideshow. (note - the go to themes link on this page does not
 work). I go to themes and save this as 'flowers' and includes the current settings for colour, sounds and mouse cursor. Personally I don't use themes and prefer to set these individually.</p>
<p>The theme was saved in&nbsp; C:/ ……… / Windows/ Themes but the slideshow photos were in C:/&nbsp;…….. /Windows/ BackgroundSlideshow and a copy of the original location. There is no need to go to these locations as the theme can be applied in the theme settings.</p>

            That error message may be normal. You are only supposed to use the support tool when receiving the errors listed at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2530409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2530409</a>

            Docking with your PC is the only way to update. Updates are rolling out slowly. MS said it could be 4 weeks before everyone has it assuming your carrier is sending it out now. Be patient.

            <p>Hi deepsea123,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your contribution to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it shows connect to pc sign should i connect to pc ? no, just leave your Phone reboot by itself. when the phone has rebooted, connect your phone to the pc. and update it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if then i have already tried and then restored the file but no updates...<strong>isnt there any other way to update to mango</strong>???&nbsp;&nbsp; there isnot any other way to update your Phone . So, you cannot force the Mango&nbsp;update . you have to wait that your
 Mobile operator sends &nbsp; the notification for&nbsp; the Mango update on your phone. then connect your Phone to your computer with the Zune Software&nbsp; already installed on it. And update Your phone by clicking&nbsp;
<strong>Updates Now</strong> in the Zune Software</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, Have a look at this link :</p>

            Deepsea, just an FYI. Today MS turned up the pipe on Mango rollouts. It was supposed to be at 10% but they have cranked it up to 50%. See if you have it now. I still don't, but at least half the people are getting the "you have an update" alert.&nbsp;

<h3> dan-it  say:</h3>
<h2>            Results of a formula show incorrect result unless I directly update that cell or dependent cell</h2>
                    
<p>I have a pretty simple spreadsheet that shows a&nbsp;yearly trending analysis.&nbsp; Some of the formulas in the analysis are showing an incorrect result.&nbsp; For example, the contents of cell E22&nbsp;=-E21*E20.&nbsp; E21 is 10,000,000 and E22 is 7.0%.&nbsp; I would expect the result
 to be -700,000 but it instead shows -600,000.</p>
<p>When I hit &lt;F9&gt; to recalculate the worksheet, it does not change.&nbsp; I tried &lt;Shift&gt; &lt;F9&gt; as well with no improvement.&nbsp; I checked my
<em>Excel Options--&gt;Formulas--&gt;Calculation</em> options and I am set to <em>Automatic</em>.&nbsp; I am also set to
<em>Recalculate workbook before saving</em>.</p>
<p>When I enter in numbers in any cell other than E22 or E21 or E20, the displayed value for E22 does not change.&nbsp; If I edit any of those cells, the number displays correctly.&nbsp; If I add and then delete a row/column, the display changes to the correct value.&nbsp;
 I do not want to have to do this every time I change the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this?</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like recalculation is the problem unless the values in E20:E22 are formulas which refer to other formulas...</p>
<p>Anyway, there are four recalculation keys in Excel:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>F9</span></td>
<td><span>Recalculate all open workbooks</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Shift+F9</span></td>
<td><span>Calculate active worksheet</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Ctrl+Alt+F9</span></td>
<td><span>Recalculates all open workbooks regardless of changes - Full recalc</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F9</span></td>
<td><span>Rechecks dependent formulas and then calculates all cells in all open workbooks, including cells not marked as needing to be calculated.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

    <title>How do I make the columns in my column chart have rounded tops&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aimee zagorski  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I make the columns in my column chart have rounded tops&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am hoping to make the tops of my columns rounded like in the top left corner of the image below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding a border, selecting "Format Data Series" and changing the border style cap type to round only rounds the corners and rounds the bottom, which I don't want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried creating a shape and copy/pasting to the series, but all it does is stretch/shrink oddly (see image below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated!</p>

    <title>nokia 5800 user abandoned by my warranty...... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stabbedinback  say:</h3>
<h2>            nokia 5800 user abandoned by my warranty......</h2>
                    
<p>I've been a nokia customer for about 12 yrs. I genuinely wouldn't have looked at any other mobile phone company and when their first touch screen became available I knew I had to have it....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software issues were at least in the beginning manageable. Call data and messages would be routinely deleted without any prompting, but backing up data protected against most issues and a periodic hard reset would solve most freezing problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About six weeks ago things began to get serious. I would be barred from making all but emergency calls, sending emails would cause the phone to freeze, the phone wouldn't connect to the internet even in full signal reception and my battery would dangerously
 overheat and the phone would shut itself down completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My insurers directed me to nokia and they pointed me in the direction of my local care point. Over 3 weeks my phone has been in repair 5 times. The longest it was it was held by me was overnight during that period. The substitute phone offered? a nokia 1110i.
 Great. I couldn’t use my data plan, receive email, coordinate my calendar, store music or use my gps, frankly even less than phones were offering 10 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After waiting patiently for a reply from my care point I was told they were prepared to issue me a refurbished replacement. Either the next nokia model down (thats right a downgrade) or..... wait for it..... a Samsung.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe it. Take less than I paid for or switch to another manufacturer. What a choice. Perhaps if nokia had been so up front I’d have been able to avoid this mess. Sadly for nokia this doesn’t end there. 5 days ago I contacted nokia directly
 to register a complaint and i was told this matter would be dealt with within 48 hrs, that nokia sincerely apologised for any difficulties and that i would be receiving a phone call from someone capable to dealing with my problems immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve waited again patiently every day by my house phone for this call. They can’t contact me on my mobile so i’ve made sure i’m sitting by the house phone every day from half 5 to 7. My reward.....? You’ve guessed it, not even a whisper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really am gutted. I had placed quite a high degree of trust in this company and frankly can’t believe I’ve been treated this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a disappointment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I honestly don't know what recourse is open to me beyond simply giving up. My phone is just over six months into a 2 yr warranty. the only upgrades installed were network/nokia sanctioned and i've only ever used ovi apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked through threads for advice but I haven't found anything of help. Any suggestions really are welcome......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            xbox music pass</h2>
                    <p>Somehow I managed to switch on Xbox music pass without realising I had. This was far to easy. What isn't so easy is cancelling it! Why can't I just cancel my subscription rather than the cryptic 'switch off auto renewal' which I am hoping in the same thing?
 I know this is more a moan than a question but needed to vent my frustration.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft community forums</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel your Xbox Music Pass straight away, you will need to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/contact-us#2:4:1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Contact Xbox Live Chat Support</strong></a>. They will be able to cancel your pass as they have the tools to preform that action. The Microsoft Staff on these forums and on the Xbox Forums may not have the tools to preform this action.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you turn off Auto renewal, this will tell the system that you no longer wish to purchase the subscription, and will not charge you when the subscription ends. I would also like to point out that you will still be able to use the App, even when you do
 not have an Xbox Music Pass. You can also listen to songs for a set time,&nbsp;which&nbsp;&nbsp;is 10 hours a month, and then you will be asked to purchase the Music Pass if you want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope all of this information helps you, and hope your issue is resolved soon.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello Stephen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum.&nbsp; You can certainly contact support to help get this canceled.&nbsp; There is however a process to cancel a Music Pass online.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is to go to <a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a> and sign into the account that has your Music Pass.&nbsp; Once signed in, click on MY ACCOUNT &gt; subscriptions.&nbsp; Select the "Get more music".&nbsp; That will take you to a page with your subscription details
 and the option to change the Pass you are on.&nbsp; In the left section there will be "Automatic Renewal".&nbsp; It will show the current status and provide you a change option to change this.&nbsp; Turning the renewal off will make sure that the service completes the current
 cycle and then stops.&nbsp; If you wan this canceled immediately, contact support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

    <title>How do I go about burning a dvd that can be read on French region 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardberrong  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I go about burning a dvd that can be read on French region 2 dvd players&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to burn dvds for several friends in France who have dvd players but no computer. (They are all quite elderly. I cannot ask them to start using a computer, much less to buy one.) How do I go about doing this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that when I convert the videos from mp4 to a movie mode, I need to use PAL and not the American mode (NT something or other). But that alone does not do the trick. I tried producing a dvd on my American computer in PAL format, but my French friends
 could not play it on their dvd players.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it has something to do with regions as well - the U.S. is region 1, France region 2 - but that doesn't tell me how to go about burning a dvd for them - if in fact I can on an American computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

 (if I'm using the wrong terminology, I apologize; I don't do this for a living) rather than NTSC. But I've done that in the past (using Freemake Video Converter), and it is not enough. Evidently I have to turn off the dvd burner's Region 1 status. How do I

<p>You mean I could burn the discs, send them to France, and wait to hear whether my elderly friends, the youngest of whom is 85 and all of whom are already uncomfortable with technology and do not do e-mail, discover whether or not the discs work and then
 send me letters through the post office to let me know? I don't think so. I'd like to be able to send something that I know will work, not something that will frustrate them.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Richard - The above link may shed some light.... It does not seem to be about region - more the Pal/NTSC business. I sympathise with your frustration and ultimately it probably comes down to whether your friends' machines will play the finished product.
 There are users in this forum who seem to have problem enough getting a pc burned disc to work on their own DVD players! If the disc plays on your DVD player - that's a reasonably good guide to the probability it will play in France.&nbsp; Cheers, Ric.</p>

<p>I thank you for the link, but it doesn't offer much help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, it is definitely not true that a dvd recorded on an American (in this case, HP) disc drive is region-free. I have already tried burning dvds set to the PAL format and sending them to France. They played just fine on my American dvd player - which
 surprised me, as I would assume it is NTSC; it certainly won't play dvds I buy in France - but none of my French friends' dvd players could play them. So</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It is not just a matter of burning the dvd in PAL rather than NTSC</p>
<p>2. "Home"-burned dvds are evidently not region-free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may also be some other element at play here. This is completely out of my field, so I can't say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I appreciate well-meant suggestions, I really would like to hear from someone who has already done this and knows from experience what will and will not work. I cannot submit my elderly French friends to repeated frustrations with technology that already
 bothers them.</p>

<p>no, thats not what i meant at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>let me put this in very simple statements:</p>
<p>- if you change your dvd drive's region to region 2, you have a region 2 dvd drive to test with.</p>
<p>- if you then burn the dvd and it plays in the region 2 drive, but not on a region 1 drive, you have a high level of certainty that it is a region 2 dvd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've already given you all the information that you need to try this. read it with attention instead of being dismissive. be practical instead of waiting for a holy grail answer.</p>

    <title>Opening &#42;offline&#42; Dropbox files on iPhone using Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amoss17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening &#42;offline&#42; Dropbox files on iPhone using Excel &#40;Office365 apps&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Context: I have an iPhone 6s, with latest updates. I have installed Office365 for business apps, and those apps work fine in most ways. Our company shares files using Dropbox, and I open some of those files on my iPhone. When I need to edit, I use the Office365
 apps. There are a small # of files that I keep on my iPhone so that I can access and edit while offline. Dropbox makes this easy, I can mark those files for offline access = local (on iPhone) storage. So far so good, I can view those offline files in Dropbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: when I try to open one of those offline files, which is already saved on my iPhone, using Excel (or any of the Office365 iPhone apps), Excel *downloads* the file fr Dropbox, rather than *opening the saved offline copy on my iPhone*. Therefore, when
 I'm actually offline (the only reason I need this feature in Dropbox), Excel tells me I can't access my offline Dropbox files. I know the file is saved for offline viewing, b/c I can see it (while offline) in Dropbox's native file viewer. But of course I can't
 edit it, I can only do that using Excel, and Excel keeps trying to download the file rather than using the saved offline copy. I have the same experience when using Word or Powerpoint on my iPhone to open offline Dropbox files, I'm just using Excel as the
 lead example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The outcome I want is for the Office 365 iOS app to see that Dropbox has saved a copy of the file for offline and to open that file. Thanks for any suggestions.
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi AMoss17,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my test, if we open downloaded Office files in Dropbox with Office applications when offline, we get a message: Can't Open Excel Please check your network connection and try again. If we
 are online, Office applications will download the Office files and open them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While using OneDrive on iOS, there is no such issue. We still can open Office files and edit them when offline. To do that, please perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Tap the files, and download them by tapping the cloud icon in the below screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4e413a5-e485-4e20-9524-37b061ee5f5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4e413a5-e485-4e20-9524-37b061ee5f5e" /></a></p>
<p>2. When open an Office file, tap Office application icon (e.g. Excel) to open it in Office application to edit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87d58df7-ea91-43bd-ad9f-45cd2781e765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87d58df7-ea91-43bd-ad9f-45cd2781e765" /></a></p>

<h2>            OneNote 2016 Deleted From Computer After Update To Office 365</h2>
                    After updating our companies office accounts to the new update that was released this week for Office 365 Business, OneNote 2016 was completely removed from a few of the computers. I attempted to repair this by going to Apps and Features then selecting
 modify Office 365 Business. I used the quick repair option and then the Online Repair option. After this did not work I uninstalled office 365 and then reinstalled. This did not work either. Is there a reason why this would be happening?

<h2>            Disable grid lines when generating a pdf from an Excel page</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a VBA project where I draw shapes on the sheet and create a pdf file from it using next command :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF, Filename:= _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Users\bwlf\Desktop\ToolCellConfig.pdf", Quality:=xlQualityStandard, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IncludeDocProperties:=True, IgnorePrintAreas:=False, OpenAfterPublish:= _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True<br />
</p>
<p>Apparently the pdf shows the excel grid lines which are anoying. Can these be ommitted ?</p>
<p>Disabling the grid lines in Excel doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    Can someone please tell me how to get back to the old format of Hotmail? This new format is harsh on my vision and I do not like that I have to click on each e-mail to read it. If there is no help is there another services to go to with a format that does
 not look like this?

            You may be seeing Outlook.com because your account was automatically upgraded from Hotmail. Hotmail customers who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were notified in advance via email.<br />
<br />
Why was my account chosen to be upgraded automatically?<br />
<br />
When we launched Outlook.com preview, we shared plans to eventually upgrade all Hotmail customers to Outlook.com. To help ensure a smooth transition, the upgrade will be gradual. Your upgrade is part of the process.<br />
<b><br />
Can I switch back to Hotmail?<br />
<br />
If you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, the option to switch back to Hotmail isn't available.<br />
<br />
To see if you have the option to switch back, check for the Switch back to Hotmail link in Outlook.com. Go here for steps on how to check for the link.<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/switch-back-hotmail</b><br />

<p>If you don't see the link <strong>Switch back to Hotmail </strong>in Outlook.com, then you can no longer revert to Hotmail's layout.</p>

            <p>I also have this problem, but I found a solution on how to stop showing notifications.</p>
<p>Just go to Settings and turn OFF "Show Message in Notification". This should help. And when you quit the app (by pressing the 'Back' button until you reach Start screen), you are offline. But still, people can message you which appear as notification.</p>

                    <p>I linked my Microsoft account to my Google account so that my Google contacts would stay in sync. However, as at least dozens of other community members have reported here over the past several months, I have been receiving emails from Microsoft asking me
 to "Reconnect to Google" at least once every 2-3 days since late spring/early summer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STEPS I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN:</p>
<p>- I have verified these are legit emails coming from Microsoft and that my Google contacts do not stay in sync unless I keep reconnecting</p>
<p>- I have made sure my Google account password and security settings are not changing</p>
<p>- I have removed the connection completely between my Microsoft account and Google, and then re-linked them from scratch</p>
<p>- I have contacted Google to make sure nothing is wrong with the settings on my Google account</p>
<p>- I have even tried linking my Microsoft account to a different Google account, and the same thing happens eventually</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not suggest to me to do any of the above steps. I have already done them. This is not something I have done incorrectly; this is an issue with the Microsoft account / Outlook.com / People service that needs to be addressed by the team who created
 the feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:</p>
<p>- Upon connecting or reconnecting to Google, my contacts should stay in sync and I should stop receiving notifications to reconnect</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference, this is what the email from Microsoft looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/728bc184-50a5-4975-8feb-9eed6ff281d5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is what the Google authentication webpage looks like every time I reconnect:</p>

            <p>Hi the falconer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you fix your concern about being asked to reconnect your account to Google several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the connection between the two accounts had been broken which can be related to the change that was made by Google to their security defaults. As a basic&nbsp;troubleshooting step,&nbsp;I suggest activating the Two-Step Verification on your Gmail
 account (if it is not enabled yet). You can refer to the steps on this <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> on how to do so. Then, generate a (new) App password by following the instructions on this
<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en&amp;topic=2784804&amp;ctx=topic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Once done, please update the new App password in your Microsoft account via "Your email accounts" page. You can refer to the article below for more information:</p>

    <title>Problems after software update on Samsung Galaxy S5 mobile phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanrobe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems after software update on Samsung Galaxy S5 mobile phone</h2>
                    <p>When I attempt to open my Outlook email account, I am asked to "Re-enter your password". &nbsp;I sign in with this and am then asked to confirm permissions, so I hit YES.</p>
<p>At this point, I get the message "Authenticating with Outlook ..." and it goes round and round and nothing happens. &nbsp;I have tried Microsoft Support on my phone and just now hung up from a phone call trying to resolve the issue. &nbsp;I was told Microsoft do not
 provide support for mobiles and was directed to this site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be most appreciated as I have been battling this problem for days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Dear Tommy, 
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users using my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />Thanks for your question!
<br />
<br />Looks like an app issue. Can you try to update the app and if this doesn't help my suggestion is to recreate the profile. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if it worked.  
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Kristina

            Hey Tom,
<br />
<br />I would recreate the Outlook profile. (Delete and add again the account). It is additional work for you but this should solve the issue. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if this helped.

<br />Kristina
