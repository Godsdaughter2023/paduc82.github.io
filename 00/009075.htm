<h2>            MSCONFIG &#38; Safe Boot</h2>
                    Windows 10 Tech Preview Build 9926 - when I go into RUN and enter MSCONFIG, and attempt to do a Safe Boot the PC locks up and I must use my DVD of Win10's Install to repair and get the Operating System back up and running.&nbsp; Is the command of MSCONFIG something
 that should not be used here-after, or are there problems when doing this?

<p>
</p><p>I've been using msconfig without issues, but haven't tried to select Safe Boot...</p>
<p>I've been using a shortcut instead of&nbsp;RUN though... I don't know if that would make a difference or not.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; In the past, and within other Operating Systems I used to go to Safe Mode (by tapping F8) and upon getting there I would, when&nbsp;within, go to RUN and type in TEMP as well as</p>
<p>%TEMP% and clean up all the temporary files within the PC.&nbsp; Then I would come out of SAFE and to me the PC would run faster and smoother.&nbsp; I was able to do this activity with the past Builds of Win10, but not now with the latest Build installed.&nbsp; Like a
 normal Hard Head that I am, I did attempt to do it about 4 times now and each time I get into the Safe Boot the darn PC locks up.&nbsp; Thus - I guess this user will no longer be going into SAFE...</p>

            <p>Shortly after I first updated from 9879 to 9926, I tried going to Safe Mode. &nbsp;The computer locked at a black screen just after Windows started loading. &nbsp;Nothing I could do would let me proceed. &nbsp;I ended up restoring an image of 9879 and was back up and running.
 &nbsp;I then did a clean install of 9926 from an ISO and had no trouble with Safe Mode the one time I tried it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had thought my upgrade from 9879 to 9926 went well. &nbsp;But, it looks like something didn't work quite as well as I thought.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried this, and I was able to select Safe Mode in MSConfig and restart without a problem.</p>
<p>However, when the machine started there was some kind of unknown Explorer error displayed and most of the icons were missing. None of the icons in the taskbar worked either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some messing around with Screen Resolution I got most of the Desktop back, but the Taskbar buttons were still useless. I was able to right click on it and get to the Taskmanager\Toolbar options though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my machine I have disabled the Boot Menu that appears for "Rollback" or Win 10TP... I don't know if that makes a difference or not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>No crashes though. I was able to get to MSConfig from the shortcut on my Desktop, turn off Safe Boot, and restart to a normal Desktop.</p>

            <p>Yep. &nbsp;Something's very wrong with 9926 and Safe Mode. &nbsp;I just tried booting into Safe Mode again and got the same thing you did. &nbsp;After entering my password, it came up with a big error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"explorer.exe - System Warning</p>
<p>Unknown Hard Error"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the Desktop was missing and/or inoperable. &nbsp;I wish I had added an MSCONFIG shortcut to the Desktop as you did. &nbsp;The only way I was able to get back to normal mode was to right-click on the taskbar, start Task Manager, select File and tell it to Run
 a New Task. &nbsp;I then told it to run msconfig.exe (I had to browse a bit to find it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, this isn't even an upgrade install. &nbsp;It's a clean install from the ISO.</p>

<h2>            No Track Changes in Word Online</h2>
                    I just signed up last night for a 30-day trial for the cloud-based Office 365 suite. I uploaded a document to edit and can find no Track Changes feature under Review. The "Tell me what you want to do" feature informed me that Track Changes is invisible
 and to know it's engaged, it will show "Track Changes" in the status bar. I do not get "Track Changes" in my status bar no matter what I try. But even if I did, I must be able to see my own changes in another color. Any solution to this would be appreciated.
 I'd prefer to use a traditional software downloaded to my computer (it's faster, for one thing), and am considering Home &amp; Student 2016, but not sure if this version has Track Changes, either. Can someone help? I have a brand new client who just sent a project
 with a due date of less than a week from today, so I'm starting to get desperate. Oh, how I wish MS Office 2010 were still available. (My computer that had it on it when I purchased it from an individual crashed and that per

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Track Changes is not currently available in Word Online. Word online has a subset of the features available in the desktop version.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Compare-Word-features-on-different-platforms-5e00dfba-3d7c-4222-b850-a0527ff7b066?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Compar...</a>
<br />
<br />
It certainly is present in Office 2016 on a PC. Are you sure your trial does not include the desktop version as well? All versions of Office 365 that I know about have the full Word for PC/mac as a part of the subscription.

I am a fellow Word user and not a Microsoft employee. I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.

<h2>            Problems with Insider Build 10565. Page Fault Errors.</h2>
                    <p>I was unable to find anyone who could help me stop the Page Fault Errors and the system would restart every 5 seconds.&nbsp; I had a Windows 7 System that I was going to use as my working system and this system with the Insider Build was to be used as a test
 system.&nbsp; Unfortunately I had a Get Windows 10 downloaded on that system last week and there wasn't an option to opt out.&nbsp; So I had to find a way to use this one.&nbsp; I was able to start it in safe mode with out the network and ran the restore point back to the
 11/3/15 when the Build 10565 had installed as well as stop the automatic updates for anymore builds.&nbsp; Since it had Windows 10 Pro installed without a Preview build I need to know if I find a way to burn the Media Creator to DVD's,&nbsp;well be able to format the
 drive and reinstall&nbsp;a fresh Windows 10.&nbsp; I can see that the first Windows 10 Pro Version is still on my Microsoft Account.&nbsp; As I understood it before I would have been able to do a fresh install without having to upgrade from the retail 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; This was
 how&nbsp;it was installed with Windows 10 Pro to begin with.&nbsp; I would like to know if this option is still available.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have work that must be done on other systems so I don't have much time to fix the Windows 7 System so that Windows 10 does not install on it
 until Tuesday of next week.&nbsp; This means that I must get this system to work in order to access the Web sites for the OEMs systems I need to repair.&nbsp; Is there a phone number I can call (NOT THE ANSWER DESK PLEASE!!!), or if you would please let me know what

            <p>Hi Frances,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand your query, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Are you asking if there is an option to create an installation media for Windows 10?<br />
2. Are you referring to clean installing Windows 10?</p>
<p>3. When you upgraded to Windows 10, was it activated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your previous operating system&nbsp;was genuine, once you upgrade to Windows 10, it will be activated automatically. Once Windows 10 is activated, you can always re-install Windows 10 end number of times and still retain the authenticity unless you make any
 hardware changes or change the motherboard. However, if you are trying to install Windows 10 directly before activating Windows 10, I would recommend you to first go to your previous genuine operating system and upgrade to Windows 10, get it activated and
 then perform the clean install should you wish to. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that clean install will remove everything in your system therefore I would suggest you to create a backup before you initiate a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the steps given by Andre Da Costa on how to Create Windows 10 installation media.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your prompt response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In answer to question #1: It would be No, I know where and how to download load Windows 10.</p>
<p>I just have to find a system to create DVD'S. I tried downloading Windows 10 to and running it from both a USB 2.0 with 4GB, as well as a USB 3.0 16 GB. The Windows 10 System keep telling me it could not find any USB'S connected to the system which is why
 I need to format using DVD'S..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer to your question #2: Yes this would be a clean install. &nbsp;Formatting a 1 TB Drive &amp; reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer to your question #3: I had activated a Retail Windows 8.1 Pro. Then ran Windows 10 Pro 2 times in August. &nbsp;The first install of Windows 10 was activated but do to the many graphics issues that went on between Nvidia and Windows 10 I ended up with
 corrupted OS. I tried fixing that install with the DISM tool as well as resetting the OS. I finally had to run a second install because my app data profiles became corrupted. That is why I have the same system listed 2 times under my Microsoft Account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So from the rest of your answer I will concluded that running a fresh install will work and activate without any problems. As well as taking me back to the Build 10240.</p>
<p>I believe I will wait to run the insiders build until I have removed Windows 10 GWX from the Windows 7 system and rebuild the system I received last week. I need at least one working reliable OS. I know that I love most of everything that Windows 10 Pro
 offers when installed correctly.</p>
<p>Thank you for confirming the process for me.</p>

    <title>Duplicate folders in new onedrive install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deborahmcgregor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate folders in new onedrive install</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am migrating to a new computer.</p>
<p>My old computer has Onedrive, then there are three folders inside</p>
<p>- documents (which then has a further 80 sub folders and various sub-sub folders and docs)</p>
<p>- pictures (which has my photos inside)</p>
<p>- music (which has various folders of my music inside)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the new install on the new computer&nbsp; I created a folder called OneDrive in my D drive.&nbsp; When asking to install, I selected change location and entered D:\OneDrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>This new install has put the 80 subfolders of my old Documents folder straight in the OneDrive along with the Music and Pictures, then it has a folder called Documents which has all the 80 subfolders in it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that the original 'documents' folder is in there but the 80 subfolders seem to have duplicated and raised up a level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried unlinking it, deleting the file, then re-doing, but the same thing happens.&nbsp; Help!</p>

            Hi DeborahMcGregor,<br /><br /> I'm a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help. <br /><br />I think it might be due to you manually creating a folder and calling it OneDrive. OneDrive will create its own OneDrive folder. Try just choosing choosing the root D drive instead of the folder you created, if that makes sense.

            Yes, I did try that, but the same thing is happening.&nbsp; Also it seems that some of the folders are empty, some are populated ..&nbsp; it is just completely bizarre.

            Try resetting the OneDrive sync app:<br />	<br />	1. Press these two keys on your keyboard at the same time: Windows key and the R key. This will open the Run dialog box on your screen<br />	2. Copy and paste this text into the Run window and press Enter:<br />	<br />	%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset<br />	<br />That will reset OneDrive<br />After a couple of minutes, the OneDrive cloud icon should show in the system tray.<br />	<br />If it doesn’t start, Click on Windows Start, then find OneDrive and start it

<p>This did not work.&nbsp; I still have a bunch of duplicate folders which ARE NOT COMPLETE or are EMPTY, along with the documents folder and stuff in that I HOPE is complete ..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eg&nbsp; Onedrive / folder 1 - says no items</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Onedrive/ documents / folder 1 - shows all items</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onedrive / folder 2 - lists correct folders, but shows no items in those folders</p>

            I solved it with the help of Microsoft Support&nbsp; I had to go into settings and then go into 'Choose Folders'&nbsp; I then unticked all those folders except the three (documents, music, pictures) and everything was back to normal.

<p>Hello Dilshan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Common download or update errors are due to insufficient storage space, incorrect settings, outdated software and unstable / slow internet connection. We'd like to know the OS build currently installed on your phone. To check this information, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>
More</strong> <strong>info</strong>. Also, when did this issue start? Have you tried any troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue? We're are the apps are currently installed?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if you're unable to download or update apps from Store on your Lumia, you can try the steps provided on this

<strong>article</strong></a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not receiving audio when playing music, games or video, restart your phone by pressing and holding the
<strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume</strong> <strong>Down</strong> keys simultaneously until the phone vibrates and restarts. After this operation, you may need to re-adjust the volume. Use the

            Hello Paul,
<br />
<br />Lets try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode: Right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar and select Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. Type in taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe to terminate any OneDrive processes and hit Enter. 
<br />Then type in either %SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10 or %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10 and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />After that Go to RegEdit on this path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include One Drive version 
<br />Account folders also can be removed 
<br />After that restart the pc and install One Drive again

    <title>PowerPoint Online iframe issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandrasarmiento  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint Online iframe issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to embed a PowerPoint presentation but there are some slight issues I haven't been able to figure out how to solve.</p>
<p>I have two images on one of my slides and when I click them on powerpoint for mac they appear and when I click again, they disappear. However, on powerpoint online, when I click them, they appear and immediately disappear again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second slide, seems to have layering issues with the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what it looks like on PowerPoint for mac</p>
<p>(what it's supposed to look like)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f83bbf69-cce7-40a2-9013-194b5fdb1a34?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f83bbf69-cce7-40a2-9013-194b5fdb1a34?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what it looks like with PowerPoint Online&nbsp;</p>
<p>(the video is on top of everything else)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b86d9a84-d683-4048-8535-3f4ac07557a0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b86d9a84-d683-4048-8535-3f4ac07557a0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is what it looks like on the iframe</p>
<p>(the video is not loading, the shape layer with the gradient is in front of the fish and the "screen" side of the laptop)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried changing where both the iframe and powerpoint are hosted to see if that made any difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really like to be able to put on a website my presentation the way it looks on my mac!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />
Sandra</p>

            It's not a macro. It's an animation that is triggered by clicking on different objects on the slide.

<br />
To verify if the issue is software related. We suggest that you perform a soft reset. P<span>ress and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>button</span>
 until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Let us know the results.<br />
</p>
<br />

</p><p>I've tried soft restart as per your instruction, however it didn't help. Still m not able to toggle between multiple apps. Long back key press does not show the open app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last time (an year back), I've to reset the phone to windows 8.1 due to the same issue, however it does not have much update. Windows 10 has very nice experience to use.</p>

            <p>Let's start working on this by checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check, just go to
<strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update &amp; security</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Phone update</strong><span> &gt; Select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Check for updates</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to
 see if any updates are available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is still not resolved after updating the phone software, the next workaround is to back up the phone and perform a hard reset. To hard reset the phone, just go to
<strong>Settings &gt;</strong> under <strong>System</strong>, tap <strong>About &gt; Reset your phone.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Please create a backup before performing the hard reset as the phone memory will be wiped out. For creating a backup, here's how:

    <title>Disable a shortcut &#40;J&#41; on OWA with Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dahley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable a shortcut &#40;J&#41; on OWA with Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We sometimes get asked if we can disable the 'J' shortcut in OWA because users find it to be annoying because it is pressed so easily by accident. The J button automatically moves the selected mail to a spam folder and also blocks incoming mails
 from the selected adress.<br />
After a lot of searching in the management console and the web I was not able to find anything regarding this and I'm surprised that no one is bothered by this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to disable this button so users won't press it by accident anymore? Adding an extra button such as Alt so it becomes Alt+J is also okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous post was made in the wrong category section. Because I couldn't find anything about OWA I've put it in Office 365 as other/unknown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some info: we are working in a domain with Office 365, that means we won't be able to change this setting on every single computer in the network.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Forwarded meetings do not get updates</h2>
                    <p>Hey -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to make a suggestion. I often create meetings that get forwarded to a large number of people. The issue with this is that if I cancel and event or update it, those that received the event as a forward do not get any update notifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if meetings that were forwarded could receive all notifications from the creator of the meeting just as regular invitees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Kristi</p>

<p>Hi Kristi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, as you said, the update notification email will be sent to attendees of the meetings, and it won't inform the forwarded people. You need to inform them additionally. Regarding the feature, there are several users who have same concern with you. You

<h2>            Drag and drop not working for OneDrive for Business team site</h2>
                    
<p>I have a OneDrive for Business team site that is working well.</p>

<p>However, I am unable to drag-and-drop files into it via a broswer. &nbsp;Any ideas why please?</p>

<p>I logon and navigate to the team site. &nbsp;I select a number of files in File Explorer. &nbsp;When I try to drag them to the "drag files here" area in the browser I get a red no-entry sign and I am unable to drop them.</p>

<p>However, if I drag-and-drop them to the Sharepoint folder in File Explorer rather than in the browser, it works well - the files are copied and then synced automatically.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>

</p><p>Specifically: I want to copy an entire row of log data, depending on the truck used in column C, to an existing sheet for each truck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? I've hunted for IF/THEN scenarios and SUMIF, etc... no luck yet.</p>

            <p>Interjecting a few additional thoughts;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I'm underestimating your requirement based on limited information, but for no more than what you described a very simple approach would be to just filter the list in place, then copy the found record(s) &amp; paste to the other sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need something more dynamic, you might investigate the use of;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pivot Tables</strong>, &amp;</li><li><strong>Advanced Filter</strong></li></ul>
<p>in addition to the suggestions being offered by others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach would be to store the data for each '<em>truck</em>' on a separate sheet of its own. It could be aggregated at any time for all, or any combination of, trucks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to adding an existing Class Notebooks to Microsoft Teams. You need to create a new Notebook in Microsoft Teams. If you are interested in this feature, please vote for this feature via this link:</p>

<h2>            Slow when moving&#47;copying sections across notebooks</h2>
                    I'm working on a Surface Pro 4 with the latest Creators Update and Office 365 - OneNote 2016 Desktop Version. My sections to be moved is approximately 500MB large. When I'm executing the move section operation, it almost took forever to move the sections,
 and the fan is spinning really loud. I wonder is it natural to be that slow, and if it's not, what can I do to make it faster? Many thanks.

    <title>Laptop bricked after installing Windows 10 Insider Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nurio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop bricked after installing Windows 10 Insider Preview</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I thought it good idea to participate in the Windows Insider Preview. I know that comes with risks, but what happened seems a bit too ridiculous, and if this is the standard expected outcome of Windows Insider builds, then that's just terrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed up for the Insider program and set up my laptop to receive the builds from the Slow Ring. However, even the day after, nothing showed up on Windows Update. I did some googling and saw that other people had this problem too, and that installing an
 Insider Preview build through an ISO would kick-start the system into accepting future Insider builds as well.</p>
<p>Great! So I did that. Downloaded the... 15042 build (I think) and went to install that... And now my laptop refuses to boot. If I turn it on, I see the laptop logo, but it won't go beyond that. It doesn't do anything. No error messages, no beeping, no nothing.
 Just that screen endlessly.</p>
<p>Well, no real issue there. I can just restore my laptop, right? (Wrong.) So, I used my father's computer to download and burn the non-Insider Windows 10 (using the Media Creation Tool) so that I can restore my laptop through that. But when I try to boot
 from that, I run into several other problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am immediately met with a pop up window telling me that Windows is in the middle of an upgrade and I should let it do that. Well, I definitely would let Windows do that if I could! I even tried one more time, hopeful the upgrade would happen this time
 around, but nope. Still nothing. So this time around, I picked the option to continue with the installation regardless.</p>
<p>Naturally, I don't want to lose all my programs and such, so I first picked the option to repair the computer. Well, "Startup Repair" doesn't seem to do anything. It runs for a total of 4 seconds and then immediately tells me it can't find a problem.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, "System Restore" apparently says that there are no old restore points. Say what? Did the upgrade delete all my restore points or something? I'm sure it shouldn't be doing that!</p>
<p>Well, then I tried to use the "Go back to the previous build" option, but even that fails after 3 or 4 seconds, giving yet another vague error message of "It failed". Well, that's not very helpful!</p>
<p>Then I tried to just install Windows anew -- using the option to keep all programs, etc. -- but then it gives me an error message about how it was doing an upgrade and therefore I can't use this option. I don't understand why I wouldn't be able to install
 Windows right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, all in all, my one-day experience with the Windows Insider program has been absolutely dreadful, and at this point, I wonder what I can do to recover my laptop. Are there any people more savvy than me with any ideas?</p>

            Here are some tips remove any 3rd party Virus/Malware programs, remove anything plugged into USB's/Media slots except wired keyboards, make sure you have at least 20 Gig's of free space on your C drive, bottom line is now you might have a corrupted system
 where you need to reinstall the original OS or do a "clean" install of Windows 10, a couple of questions, what is your system? what OS was on your system before you tried to upgrade?

            <p>If you Made a System Image backup to an external USB or USB Drive you would have the best chance to go back to what you Originally had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the Insider Builds take a lot of time to show up and can take up to even a week to show up as a downloadable update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restore Points are just Registry Backups and not at all like a System Image. so when Restore points are used the Original OS needs to be active to use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The media Creation Tool should Work but you might have to run it and not be able to save any of your Old OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Third party Recovery apps are available that install on USB you might try some of those.</p>
<p>One that I use is available as a Free version downloadable at the bottom of the Page at the link below.</p>
<p>If you try this you will have to verify that you are not using it as a business and register through your email.</p>
<p>You should read all the info on the site on how to use it and decide for yourself if it might work for you.</p>
<p>There are many Free apps like this that can help.</p>

            <p>Something else you could try with the media creation tool you downloaded is use the Troubleshooting or Advanced to get a Command Prompt and when it opens type chkdsk then hit the Enter key on the keyboard to see if any errors are found.</p>
<p>If errors are found type it again but like this chkdsk /f </p>
<p>make sure you include the space between k and / so Check Disk will try to repair the errors.</p>
<p>

            <p>I definitely had enough space on my system drive. I actually don't have an active anti-virus program. (I mean, I have one, but it's definitely not running unless I tell it to, and I didn't run at the time of installation.) I didn't have anything plugged
 into the USB ports, not even a mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is a Medion Erazer. I'm not at my laptop now (since it's a brick), so I don't know the exact model by heart. But it was something close to X6601. ...I think. The OS was Windows 10 with the latest (non-Insider) updates installed</p>

            <p>In hindsight, I really should've made a full system image backup, but I just never expected my laptop to brick this badly from just installing Windows. It's not like I did anything particularly out of the ordinary, and I've installed Windows on so many computers
 over the years. (I check up other people's computers oftentimes.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll see about trying that recovery tool, but at this point, I might opt for a clean install instead. All my actual data is on a separate hard drive (D -- and yes, that's physically a different drive, not just a partition) while Windows and all programs
 were on the C drive. So at least I shouldn't have lost all that.</p>
<p>...Right? At this point, this Windows installation has exceeded all my expectations in the negative sense, so I can't be sure about anything anymore</p>

            Interesting. I did see the option for Command Prompt, but I never thought to use chkdsk with it! Thanks for the tip! I'll try that out first, and if that comes up empty, I'll just go for a full clean install, hoping that my D drive has survived it<br />

            <p>Okay, I ran chkdsk and it returned no errors. In fact -- not that I know the exact count -- it seems to have found all files on the drive intact, so I'm not sure why it won't boot at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I also still don't get is why it won't do a normal install of Windows (keeping my programs etc. intact). When I try to do that, it tells me it can't "because an upgrade of Windows is ongoing". But why should that matter?</p>

            <p>I think the Updates get embedded in the boot manager some how. So you might have to do something to recover your boot manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only command prompt repairs I have used are the ones below you could try. Remember to hit the Enter key after each one and wait till you are back to a blinking command prompt cursor before typing the next command.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Security Essentials and Window Updates of 9&#47;13 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pdxcomposer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials and Window Updates of 9&#47;13</h2>
                    <p>I own five Win7 machines. Four desktops have all gone through the most recent barrage of updates (something like 18 in 2 days) and two are now acting strangely. The problem reported here is with a former Vista machine which was upgraded to Win7 and has successfully
 run MSE for at least 4-5 years - until after 9/13/2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now suddenly this machine cannot initiate MSE at start-up and I get error code 0x80070002.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check SERVICES and WinUpdate is always started and therefore assumed to be running.&nbsp; I can restart it and still MSE will not initiate - same error message. Looking at the Update history, I note that two old (March 2014 and November 2013 MSE updates were
 never downloaded and installed - so I have twice started this and first install initiates a complete (new) installation of MSE - which naturally fails (since it was previously installed and running.)&nbsp; I get error code 80070643.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find no instructions on-line to correct the current problem so thought best to uninstall and reinstall (if possible.)&nbsp; Following the MS on-line instructions, I cannot uninstall MSE as WindowsLiveEssentials does not find it as a loaded software on the PC.&nbsp;
 I can access this via Control Panel or Start/Search and the .exe file does not list MSE among the three programs under it's purview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that MSE was corrupted on this machine during the recent updates, but I am at a loss to remove and reinstall a clean copy.&nbsp; Dunno why, but I suspect that the two-year upgrade from Vista to Win7 is the culprit.&nbsp; I did not see any install/reboot
 problems when the last upgrades occurred.&nbsp; It has worked perfectly prior to 9/13 and not since.&nbsp; Any help in repair or reinstall would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, it seems the machine has updated at least once since 9/13 and though it checks for new updates as recently as this AM, no new updates appear pending or needed and nothing indicates that WinUpdate is working improperly (So the 80070002 code seems
 erroneous.) </p>

            <p>I went back to the Error link for x80070643.&nbsp; The original recommended solution did not work on my PC, but it never occurred to me to read the 3 1/2 pages of comments. There I found this:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>solution:</em><br />
<em>if you have the means, find another machine that will allow a successful installation of MSE</em><br />
<em>copy the Microsoft Security Essentials folder from Program Files and paste it onto the problematic machine</em>
<em>obtain the MSE setup exe file (mssefullinstall-x86fre-en-us-xp.exe) and uncompress this to another folder, if you have winrar or something similar you can right click this file and Extract to...(given folder name)</em>
<em>take all folder contents and copy &amp; paste them into the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Essentials folder overwriting anything that it prompts about</em>
<em>run the Setup file within that folder and installation should be a success.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have four other Win7 machines, all with working MSE, so did exactly what was recommended and I got a new error code - the install from the replacement setup.exe file was in conflict with WinUpdate.&nbsp; (And to be safe, I copied the 64 and 86 sub-folders,
 but ran the 64 version setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back and ran WU and the lone uninstalled update that has been failing - KB2902907.&nbsp; (Which appears to be an updated new version of MSE.) That installed without a problem and suddenly MSE was back!&nbsp; I write this as MSE is running a QuickScan on the
 machine.&nbsp; I may try running the more recent KB2949786 if I can retrieve it from my "cancelled" update history. But the 9/30 virus definition update was successful - so for all appears it looks like MSE is back and working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your help and particularly to a 2009 user post from synack1011 - who experimented and got it right!&nbsp; Wahoo!</p>

            <p>What you want is a SEQ field. Here's the easiest approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Ctrl+F9</strong> to insert a field, which will have field delimiters (which look like ordinary braces but can't be typed from the keyboard) with two spaces between. The insertion point will be between the two spaces: { | }</li><li>In the field, type "SEQ slide" (without the quotation marks): { SEQ slide }</li><li>Type parentheses around the field.</li><li>Select the expression you've just created (both parentheses and field) and press
<strong>Alt+F3</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Create New Building Block</strong> dialog, type a name for the AutoText entry. Make the name something that is at least four letters long and something you won't be typing except when you want to insert a slide number. Leave the rest of the
 default settings and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>When you want to insert a slide number, type the AutoText entry name and, when you get the AutoComplete tip, press

<p>The advantage to this approach as opposed to just inserting the SEQ field and copy/pasting it is that the number will update with each insertion (if you paste it, it will keep displaying the same number until you manually update it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>SEQ fields update "automatically" but not "dynamically." This means that if you insert a new slide number between two existing ones, the following ones won't update immediately; you will have to
<strong>Ctrl+A, F9</strong> to update all the fields.</p>
