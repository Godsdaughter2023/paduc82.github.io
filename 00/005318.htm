                    My voice commands, like text a contact, or call a contact...etc, or using voice for search on Bing...etc, are not working when car's Bluetooth is connected. If I disable the Bluetooth, features work perfect.

            <p>It could be that these voice command connections are not supported by the BT profile.&nbsp; In the past, the BT has been pretty limited to playing music and receiving phone calls, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If has never worked with the car, I suspect it may be because the specs required of BT to support this are not included in the phone's BT profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, not all BT's are created equal -- some only have a few features turned on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately this feature is not possible. A kind of a basic trick to sort the situation could be to add the Company name/title in the name as you save the contact. For example Lastname:Microsoft First Name:JennymariaS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<h2>            Photo disaster,  on Lumia 530 Please can anyone help&#63;</h2>
                    Sorry to keep asking questions, but I've just had a bit of a disaster. As I'm very short of space on my phone, I copied all my photos from my phone onto the SD card. I checked several times that they had copied successfully, and that I could access them,
 before deleting the originals off my phone. I was VERY careful to select "phone" and not "SD card" for the deleting process, but for some reason it deleted the lot from both my phone and SD card.&nbsp; Many of the photos are very special, and although some are
 backed up onto One Drive, not all of them had been, so please can anyone advise how I can get those photos that are not on One Drive back?

            Hi Giulia
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />With Skype calls it matters the destination number and not where you are when you made the call, since you call using the Skype app.
<br />
<br />Currently, you can call toll free numbers on Skype on the following countries and number ranges (which are supported now and are free of charge to all users):
<br />France: +33 ****0
<br />

<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<h2>            That Microsoft account doesn&#39;t exist</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Office 365 account, in which I am already logged in.</p>
<p>I therefore assume that this account exists.</p>
<p>My friend sent me a one-drive link: </p>

<div><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir.aspx?&lt;redact/&gt;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/redir.aspx?&lt;redact/&gt;</a></div>

<p>I'm able to see the files when I go to this link.</p>

<p>However, when I click on "Add to my OneDrive", and it asks me for my OneDrive account, it tells me, rather unhelpfully, that the account, into which I'm already logged in, and also logged in, in this same browser, "doesn't exist".&nbsp; How can that be, and how
 do I fix that?</p>

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to explain OneDrive and OneDrive for Business are two different services. The service in Office 365 for Business is OneDrive for Business, which is different from

this article</a> for more information about the difference between OneDrive for Business and OneDrive.</p>
<p>The file shared in OneDrive is not supported to be saved to OneDrive for Business. To save the shared file to OneDrive, we need to use an OneDrive account. In your scenario, you can consider using your Office 365 account as the user name to register a

<h2>            Camera and Here drive apps crash after Windows Phone 8.1 preview for developers update</h2>
                    I have a Lumia 620 phone and&nbsp;have just downloaded the latest Windows Phone 8.1 update available to developers. Following the update I cannot run any camera app nor the Here Drive app - they both fail to load and just return back to the start screen. Has
 anyone else had this problem?

            <p>Hello StevenBJones:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having with the camera app and the Here Drive + application.&nbsp; I have seen reports of a crashing camera with the original 8.1 developer preview.&nbsp; This is the first I have seen this reported with
 the recent update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said I have a couple things for you to try and a few questions regarding your situation.&nbsp; The first thing I would suggest is that you soft reset the phone.&nbsp; When I have seen this in the past this step tended to get the phone back to a state where
 the camera and effected app could be used.&nbsp; If this is something that continues to happen this may be your go to step to get back to a working state.&nbsp; The process to soft reset is to go to settings &gt; storage sense &gt; phone &gt; temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet
 Explorer settings &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once this is done, press and hold the down volume + the power button until the phone vibrates and reboots.&nbsp; Upon reboot, try taking photos and using the Here drive app.&nbsp; Let us know what your experience is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I would suggest you try uninstalling the Here Drive app from the phone.&nbsp; With the app uninstalled, please try using the camera a bit to see if you can reproduce the crashing issue.&nbsp; If you do not, reinstall the app and see if you can reproduce the issue.&nbsp;
 If the camera app continues to crash the next thing I would suggest you consider is uninstalling any lens or photo editing/enhancement apps you have installed to the phone.&nbsp; Once these are uninstalled, take some photos to see if the issue can be reproduced.&nbsp;
 If the camera crashes at any point during this process please do the soft reset and continue with the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the questions I have.&nbsp; Please provide as much detail as possible.&nbsp; Any others that are experiencing this, please provide the following details as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make and model of your phone.</li><li>Current OS version on the phone.</li><li>Current firmware revision on the phone.</li><li>Your current location.</li><li>The regional settings on your phone.</li><li>The language settings on your phone.</li><li>Does this crash happen as soon as you launch the applications or after taking a specific action within the application?</li><li>Are you using the native camera app or Nokia's camera app or some other third party application?</li><li>Does the soft reset at least temporarily get the phone back to a working state?</li><li>When you first notice the camera app crash, were you using some custom lens?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for you help Mark, I have tried everything you suggested, but the problem is not resolved. I carried out both soft and hard resets and tried removing and re-installing the applications. I then decided to return the phone back to Windows 8 using the
 Nokia recovery tool. Everything worked correctly at this point, so at least I know there isn't a problem with my phone hardware. I then re-installed each update from that point and tried the camera. The camera stopped working on the first installation of 8,1
 this time. Note that is different from before: my camera didn't stop working until the 8.1 update previously. I also realise that it is not just the Nokia Camera that is failing, it is actually the stock camera app which I assume comes with the Windows O/S
 because you can't remove it. I tried a number of different camera apps, they all fail because I assume they are calling the stock camera. I also noticed that the flashlight fails as well, again I assume because it makes use of the stock camera. If I try and
 use the camera it displays a black screen, "resuming..." and then immediately returns to the start screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated the phone to the 8.1 update to see if this would fix the problem this time but it didn't. I &nbsp;restored my backup so that my phone was returned to the same start as I started. Note there was an over the air update last night to add additional language
 support. But I still have the same problem with the camera. Here Maps still doesn't work but I am not worried about that as the Microsoft Apps app works ok. It is the camera that is the problem. It seems to me that the 8.1 update does not support the camera
 on my Lumia 620.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Make and model of your phone. - Mokia Lumia 620</li><li>Current OS version on the phone. - 8.10.14147.180</li><li>Current firmware revision on the phone. - 3056.40000.1404.0004</li><li>Your current location. - UK</li><li>The regional settings on your phone. - United Kingdom, English (United Kingdom). Note the camera fails if I try setting it to United States</li><li>The language settings on your phone. English (United Kingdom)</li><li>Does this crash happen as soon as you launch the applications or after taking a specific action within the application? - As soon as the Camera app is launched</li><li>Are you using the native camera app or Nokia's camera app or some other third party application? - I have tried many apps - they all fail, because I think the native one fails</li><li>Does the soft reset at least temporarily get the phone back to a working state? - No</li><li>When you first notice the camera app crash, were you using some custom lens? - I have never had any lenses installed</li></ul>
<p>It seems that an 8.1 update needs to be produced to fully support the camera</p>
<p />

            <p>Hello Steven:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; I personally have not had the opportunity to use a 620 with the developer preview and the recent 8.1 update.&nbsp; I have reviewed this forum and others and have not found any extensive reports from 620 users.&nbsp; I am going to continue
 to monitor this though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I might suggest you restore your phone to the 8.0 OS, if you need access to the camera.&nbsp; Check for updates over the next few days to a week.&nbsp; See if you can install the official 8.1 update that would included the Cyan firmware update.&nbsp; My gut
 is telling me the issue is between the firmware on the phone and the 8.1 developer preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continue to encourage others with this issue to post here.&nbsp; Be sure you provide all the requested details and vote for this thread.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here another more with similar problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated my Lumia 620 Windows Phone today and the device is a little bit more slow as before.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>When the phone is blocked and I press the unlock action, the "Resuming..." message appears, when it was very fast before this last update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am receiving all notifications without problems, however,... and here I put two samples: The Twitter app closes when I execute it, and the WhatsApp app shows the initial window and stays there without show nothing more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what happened with this last update, but something is wrong with it. I'm sure about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the Twitter and WhatsApp apps were installed into my SD card.</p>
<p>I think that something of these apps have not been moved properly in the update process.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve my problems, I have uninstalled both apps and I have installed them again on my device.</p>
<p>This has resolved the problems I have had.<br />

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing a similar problem with my Lumia 920. Your advice of trying to soft reset my phone did not work. I'm listing down the information required for my phone:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make and model of your phone - Nokia Lumia 920</li><li>Current OS version on the phone - 8.10.14147.180</li><li>Current firmware revision on the phone - 3051.40000.1349.0009</li><li>Your current location - India</li><li>The regional settings on your phone - India, English (India)</li><li>The language settings on your phone - English</li><li>Does this crash happen as soon as you launch the applications or after taking a specific action within the application - As soon as I launch the application</li><li>Are you using the native camera app or Nokia's camera app or some other third party application - The native camera app and Nokia's camera app</li><li>Does the soft reset at least temporarily get the phone back to a working state - No</li><li>When you first notice the camera app crash, were you using some custom lens - No</li></ul>
<p>There are quite a few apps which crash as well. Runtastic is another. It crashes the moment I begin tracking my location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you require anything else of me.</p>

 No deep technical insight, just gut, and issues from the past doing similar things with Pocket PC and Windows Mobile. You can hardly go wrong with a clean install and re-build, as painful as that may be. My daily phone is a 1020, with 8.1 Update, no CYAN yet.
 I know it has been released, but I am setting time aside to rebuild that phone, without doing a restore form the dev preview backup.

<p>I have Nokia Lumia 920 running Black firmware.</p>
<p>I have been posting my issue on other threads, but I cannot get a valid response from MS team. I have been running the 8.1 preview update since April and at the start, it was great and loved it.</p>
<p>a couple of updates later my external microphone stopped working and cannot communicate with Cortana or record voice notes. I can however, record video with sound which proves as a hardware the microphone functions.</p>
<p>The camera flash stopped responding when I started a flash software. The camera works fine</p>
<p>I rolled back to 8.0 using Nokia recovery tool. </p>
<p>The flash worked, the worked and was able to send voice command to Bing search.</p>
<p>I installed the windows 8.1 preview again. </p>
<p>after couple of hours on installation. Cortana works and responds to Voice for a couple of commands. then it stopped working
</p>
<p>Flash works using the camera and flash. Video works with flash and voice.</p>
<p>Cortana still not responding to my commands. </p>
<p>I was excited to get the update notification on August 20th. with 8..10.14157.200. After the update, the camera stopped working and none of the applications that uses the camera works now.</p>
<p>I used Microsoft camera and Nokia camera apps and none works.</p>
<p>I drained my phone battery and recharged it. Microphone works fine. Camera still broke, flash still broke.</p>
<p>Softrest the phone, now microphone stopped working, camera not working, flash not working.</p>
<p>Tried the trick of draining the battery and recharge. No use. still broke</p>
<p>I have posted these issues, but no one seems to help. </p>
<p>I also notice other Nokia users have microphone or camera issues after 8.1 preview updates.</p>
<p>I hope you can report this and get a fix in next release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p />

<p>I have a Windows Command Script (.CMD) file to toggle between the various professional Editions of Windows 10. I just tried it on my clean install of build 17074 Pro and it still works the same as on build 16299, except that you cannot toggle to Windows
 10 S any longer. Also, there is a Windows 10 Remote Server Edition added, that I have noticed since build 17063, which can be toggled using its Product Key from the product.ini file on the install media. My script just uses slmgr.vbs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made my Pro install media from the Windows 10 Core install.wim file, that I created using version 14 of uup-converter-wimlib script found at MyDigitalLife Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have no problem using slmgr.vbs /ipk XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX to toggle between the below Editions on build 17074:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional</li><li>Education</li><li>Enterprise</li><li>Pro for Workstations</li><li>Professional Education</li><li>Windows 10 Remote Server</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Only the CompositionEditionID Registry key from the location that you referenced shows Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using slmgr.vbs to toggle the various Editions?</p>
<p>

<p>Yes,&nbsp;It can also cause activation issues where it does not find digital license for Professional on your device.</p>
<p>Because it is an Enterprise hybrid windows updates might get confused and give you wrong Enterprise only updates or</p>
<p>software that does not work on Enterprise will not install or work properly.</p>

<h2>            User responds to a meeting request and get&#39;s an undeliverable error message</h2>
                    
<p>There are around 10 users experiencing this problem at random times.&nbsp; The user&nbsp;responds to a meeting request and then&nbsp;receives&nbsp;the error message listed below.&nbsp; They are all on the same domain, using Outlook 2013 downloaded from the Office 365 portal.&nbsp; We
 have around 500 users so this is a small percentage of our users but they are all power&nbsp;users whose primary job function relies on calendaring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do the numbers in the error code [0x8004010f-0x8004010f-0x000501] mean?</p>
<p>What causes this error and what can be done to avoid it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the error message:</p>

<p>Thanks, I've seen the suggestion to download the address book in other forums also and this is a good response to give to users.</p>
<p>However, I'm looking to find out how I can avoid this in the first place. &nbsp;Because this is such a random and relatively rare problem, I'm not sure downloading the address book works because the problem goes away for users who don't download the address book
 as often as it does for users who do the download..</p>
<p>Is there a reference somewhere to lookup the error codes?</p>

<p>Hi 365Questions,</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the [0x8004010f-0x8004010f-0x000501] is generated from Outlook client, not from the server. Corrupted or wrong caches could lead to the issue. So you can force to update the address and repaire Outlook profile to fix the issue as Frank suggested.</p>
<p>More ofen, the issue can be caused by network connections. There are many factors that can affect the connections. So update the address book may not work for this issue. Since our forum mainly focuses on Office 365 services, we suggest you also contact
 the dedicated <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Client Support Forum</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Alex</p>

<p>Hi, seems we're also seeing this Problem. Did you in the meantime manage to solve this ?<br />
We see this NDR mostly in response to meeting invites and did so far not manage to catch it at all (it occurs very sporadic).

<p>We did find a switch that was fluttering on certain ports and concluded that was likely causing the problems, after the switch was fixed the problems stopped.</p>

    <title>Windows Update Database Corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew zelenka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Database Corruption</h2>
                    <p>My computer when trying to update to a newer version of Windows&nbsp;10 fails. Midway through the update it gives me a black screen then only updates to 75%. After a restart it goes to 82% and freezes&nbsp;and when the computer reboots it restores the previous version
 of windows. I tried&nbsp;to use the windows update troubleshooter and&nbsp;it says I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;Windows Update Database Corruption. Then when it said it has applied&nbsp;the fix the problem I&nbsp;run the troubleshooter&nbsp;again to check to see if the database is still corrupted and
 it gives me the same error. I don't&nbsp;know if this could be the issue&nbsp;that stops my computer from updating but it probably&nbsp;is. I have an Intel Core i7-3770, a CM6870 motherboard, 16gb of DDR3 ram. Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since you've already tried running the Windows Update Troubleshooter, </span>
<span>try to run the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span>and the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>System File Checker</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tool that will scan for any corruptions
 in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this:</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span><span><span>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, right click the Windows button, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation,

<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Type the following command, and then press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span><span>Note:<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span>It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Note<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span><span>It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>4.Close the command prompt, and then run&nbsp;<strong>Windows Update<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>again.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>If the issue persists, we suggest<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span>performing an In-Place Upgrade to<span>&nbsp;</span><span>clean up your system.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>To do this, here's an&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">article</a><span>&nbsp;</span>created

<h2>            Nonprofit eligibility check complete - Declined</h2>
                    <p>We are a non-profit&nbsp;501(c)(3) registered organisation based in the US and were recently declined with our application for Office 365 Non-Profit. I received an email directing me to check my account for an explanation. When checking my account I found no
 reference to my application or any explanation given. I used the link as provided in below to contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/contact-us<br />
</p>
<p>The Call us link is broken but I was able to extract a phone number tel:<em>&lt;--phone number is removed for privacy--&gt;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the number and after a minute I'm informed that nobody can take my call and to leave a message. I left a message and nobody contacted me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called sales and was directed to call the Non Profit Management department at&nbsp;<span><em>&lt;--phone number is removed for privacy--&gt;</em></span> and waited for 25 minutes on the phone listening to music but nobody answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is someone able to direct me to a person to contact at Microsoft that I can speak to and assist me in understanding why our application was declined and how to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Knuckleheadfr,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your situation, your application for Office 365 Non-Profit eligibility verification was declined, however, when checking your account, you didn’t find any reference to the
 explanation. To better help you, I’d like to collect some related information in Private Messages:

    <title>What happens after 30 day &#39;Security Info Replacment&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwm1970  say:</h3>
<h2>            What happens after 30 day &#39;Security Info Replacment&#39; expires&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having recently been locked out of my Hotmail account (for reasons unclear and unable to gain access via the advanced security route), access was suddenly allowed but I received an e-mail from Microsoft stating that I had asked to change the security info',
 which I had indeed requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Microsoft e-mail states that there is a 30 day waiting period after which '<em>your security info will be replaced with xxxxxx when the 30 day waiting period is up</em>' - the xxxx's represent my land line telephone number, which I've obviously hidden
 here. The e-mail isn't clear as to what will happen and I can't find any up to date info' on line (it is a legit e-mail though).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Will I still have access to my Hotmail account after the 30 days expire? (on 15/09/18).</p>
<p>2. Will they send new security info' to my telephone number? If so, what usually happens?</p>
<p>3. OR, is the telephone number now part of the password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am asking as I don't suddenly want to find myself locked out again on the 15/09/18. During the 30 day period, I can't get into the security or other info' only access to e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise what will happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi DWM1970,<br />
<br />
I want to verify the email that you have received that supposedly came from us. Does it have a green shield beside your name?
<br />
<br />
It is best if you could provide a screenshot of the email through a private message for us to review and authenticate the email.<br />
<br />
If you have access to your account as of this time, then, yes you have control over your email account. Kindly check your recent activity in your Microsoft account to check for any changes made on the account.
<br />
<br />
If a phone number is set-up to your Microsoft account, you can use your phone to unlock your account. You will receive a text message which is a verification code that is required to unlock your account. However, you need to remember that your phone number
 is not part of the password but a tool to unlock your account in case your account is locked.&nbsp; If you want to make changes on your Microsoft account security information, you can check this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10634/microsoft-account-replace-all-security-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a> for more details. </p>
If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.<br />
<br />
Bob

<p>Thanks Bob</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>No green shield by my name on notification e-mail.&nbsp;</li><li>Pretty sure its legit though as it arrived immediately after I requested a change to security details.</li><li>I'm wary about sending any screen shots as Microsoft have already warned me via private message that the previous forum response to the above question was fraudulent. However, I have copied and pasted a redacted version below.</li><li>I have access to my e-mails, but not security settings (presumably until 30 days is up).</li><li>Access code via telephone number - noted. Hopefully this will work.</li></ul>

<p>You're welcome. Upon the checking the screenshot, it did come from us. The email is stating that during this thirty-day period you won't have access to your security settings, which you're currently experiencing. After thirty days that's the only time you
 can have access to your security settings and be allowed to make changes. </p>

            <p>We need to know what version of Windows you are running to be able to give you specific instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you run the other applications in Office?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, try opening the RUN dialog, ie using &lt;WIN&gt;&lt;R&gt; will work in most versions of Windows. then type winword.exe and press &lt;Enter&gt;.&nbsp; That should start Word.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about recreating the shortcut. Actually, the simplest way to recreate a shortcut is:</p>
<ol>
<li>right click on any other one, ie Excel, </li><li>select "create shortcut". That will copy the shortcut, adding "(2)" to the end of the name.&nbsp;
</li><li>Find that shortcut and right click on it. </li><li>Select Properties</li><li>On the Shortuct tab, look in the Target field.&nbsp; If there is a path and program name in it, change "excel.exe" to "winword.exe".&nbsp; If there isn't we'll have to suggest another method.</li><li>OK</li></ol>
<p>The new shortcut should now start Word. It will have the excel icon, but you can change that and the shortcut name to reflect the new application.

<h2>            Word 2016 not responding while typing document</h2>
                    <p>I've been having a problem today which I haven't been able to find any reference to or fix online, while writing a document in word 2016 (running windows 10) I can type for around 5 minutes before word freezes and display's not responding, If I leave it
 and browse the web for a few minutes it starts working again, only to do the same thing 5 minutes later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier today I was able to draft a 4'000 word document in one sitting without a problem, the computer has been used continuously since and hadn't been turned off, any programs downloaded (or files of any kind for that matter, I've been surfing a forum and
 watching youtube), after the problem started I tried closing word and restarting it, restarting my PC and doing a few basic trouble shooting steps like starting word in safe mode to see if any third party apps were linking to it (there are none) and that is
 about my extent of diagnoses ability for word, I tried searching online and found plenty about word not responding when you first open it, and when trying to save a while, but not what I've been experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd greatly appreciate any help as I've got an important document I have to draft tonight, and have already spent a few hours trying to find an answer online.</p>

<br />
By the way i would like to see something like Partition Wizard with advanced features of formatting, partitioning, etc</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick replay. I have already post my question in the TechNet although I believe that I could have a feedback soon because there are similar related issues that consider SSL and "_blank" links and I hope for a solution.</p>
<p>

<p>hi renae,</p>

<p>therefore, to look into the situation,&nbsp;we would like to confirm more details.</p>
<p>1. it would appear the screenshot is unavailable. please could you try re-inserting it? to insert a screenshot, click use rich formatting &gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://community.office365.com/tiny_mce/plugins/insertmedia/img/insert_image.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.office365.com%2ftiny_mce%2fplugins%2finsertmedia%2fimg%2finsert_image.gif" /></a>
 insert/edit media &gt; browse... &gt; insert.</p>
<p>2. let us know the version of the office client. open word &gt; file &gt; account &gt; check the product information.</p>
<p>3. i have sent you a test account through a pm at <a href="https://community.office365.com/user/conversations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>hi renae,</p>
<p>thanks for your update in the private message.</p>
<p>from the account information, i can see that you are using an office 365 business essentials subscription in which office 2013 is not included. given the situation, we can't activate office 2013 with office 365 business essentials license. more information
 can ben found in the article: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-sg/library/office-365-plan-options.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-sg/library/office-365-plan-options.aspx</a>. <br />

&nbsp; <br />
if we just want to sign in office applications with this account after office 2013 has been activated, we can do that. therefore, could you try the test account rene provided in pm and let us know the result? in addition, to clarify the scenario and find the
 root cause, the screenshots about the error message and the product information as below are appreciated.<br />

<p>to upload images, i create a workspace and the user id and password have been assigned to you in the private message. you could check and respond to it via the link below:

<p>if anything is misunderstood, please let us know and we will continue to discuss the situation based on the update.</p>

            <p>Hi Heller,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the pre-requisite updates are not installed before installing Internet Explorer 11. Corrupt Windows Update components could also lead to such issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a third party security software installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, make sure that there are no pending updates offered from Windows Update. Refer to the link to check for updates:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-windows-updates</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, refer to the link provided below to make sure that the pre-requisite updates are installed and show under Installed updates in Windows Update:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2847882/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2847882/en-us</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the issue, refer to the article and follow the steps mentioned in it:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2872074/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2872074/en-us</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, proceed to the troubleshooting methods listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the Windows Update troubleshooter from the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-windows-update-troubleshooter</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if you receive the same error code while installing Internet Explorer 11. If yes, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to link to download and run the System Update Readiness tool and check if it fixes the issue:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008”</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the following link:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try installing the update again and check if it fixes the issue. </p>

    <title>How do I distribute columns in a table&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawrence seltzer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I distribute columns in a table&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I distribute columns in a table in MS Publisher 2013?</p>
<p>This is simple in MS Word. Is there a similar command in MS Publisher?</p>
<p>If not, are there ways to keep the left and right side of a table fixed, and adjust the column widths? When I drag an internal column edge, the entire table gets wider.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I am not able to reproduce your scenario. When I drag the edge of the column, it behaves the same as in Word.</p>

            <p>One person on another forum said that there was no function to distribute columns evenly in MS Publisher 2013. I then experimented with various keystroke combination, and found that holding<strong> control</strong> and<strong> shift
</strong>together while moving the middle cell partition left the outer lines in place. So while I cannot get the columns to be 100% exactly the same using this method, they can be close enough for my purposes.</p>
