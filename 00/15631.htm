<h2>            Could not restore sms messages after N80 fmware upgrade</h2>
                    I've tried all I could to try to restore my previous txt msgs from previous backups after updating my N80, but I have been unsuccessful each time, including suggested workarounds.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to restore a previous (original) firmware version to be able to restore my messages?

            as other told me, NOKIA do not get to read this forum @ all, it's only people who have experinced some issues might help, otherwise, u need to get the support from the siue IF they helped, or taking it into a Nokia Center..<br />
and i think NOKIA is bad, even it bring us good devices but they have some problems on firwares and softwares.. nokia should be the best but i think they ned some good people to write their programs well, coz they TRY to fix sth but they mess up a lot after
 that, and if they kept doing this, i think most of the users will go to other devices!!

            No you can't restore a previous firmware.<br />
<br />
Any idea what SW version you had before the update &amp; what have you got now?<br />
<br />
Have you made your backup with PC Suite or the memory card? Was your message store on the phone or memory card?

            Mine worked properly. I made backup with PC Suite on all contacts, including SMS, MMS and memory files, and after firmware update I have put them back easily..

            I backed up everything with the latest Nokia PC Suite and then updated my N80 to the latest firmware. I then selected to restore everything, but my SMS and MMS backup didn't restore. For a huge company like Nokia not to fix it is quite ridiculous, or they
 could at least give you another tool that will force it to import backed up data.<br />
When I go to the N80 Support, they tell you to do the following: "You can install the needed support file by opening File Manager and by selecting your phone folder -&gt; Messages -&gt; Inbox. Follow the instructions on your phone. After succesfull installation,
 restart the restore process"<br />
I tried it - but there is no "Messages" folder!!!!!<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Draft folder</h2>
                    <p>Newly composed messages auto-saved to the Draft folder are not being remove from the Draft folder after sending. Here's what happening... A newly composed message auto-saves to the Draft folder as set in preferences. Great! After the message is auto-saved
 and appears in the Outlook Draft folder (the compose message window remains open/active, not closed or sent) and Outlook 2016 auto fetches/syncs mail to an IMAP mail server, the Draft message is sent to the Draft folder on the server. Okay. When the message
 is sent, the message in the Outlook Draft folder moves to Outlook Outbox. On the next fetch/sync to the IMAP server, the message moves from Outlook Outbox to Sent folder. Okay. However, the message on the server Draft folder moves back to the Outlook Draft
 folders. These Draft messages remain in both the Outlook and server Draft folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I having this issue with only one IMAP account; the other 9 IMAP accounts are syncing up fine. This issue started after installing Outlook 2016 on Windows 7 that's running Office 2010/Outlook 2010.</p>

<h2>            Cannot convert data to text to be used in a vlookup, recognizes it as a formula</h2>
                    <p>I am downloading CSV data from a web site and trying to use it in Excel for a vlookup in Excel 2010.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My lookup does not recognize the value exists because it thinks it is a formula.</p>
<p>Some of the data is appearing as text some as formulas. I have tried various methods to convert the formula to text such as paste special, saving the file type as .txt and re-opening etc.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<br />
<div>If some data from the CSV is being interpreted as a formula, I would imagine that it is starting with an
<i>equals</i>&nbsp;sign. You might be able to <i>Find and Replace</i>&nbsp;the <i>equals</i>&nbsp;with
<i>tick·equals</i>&nbsp;to force a text value, but that assumes that there are no other
<i>equals</i>&nbsp;signs in the CSV data. Possibly it may be better to do that to the CSV prior to import as you can search for
<i>comma·equals</i>&nbsp;and replace with&nbsp;<i>comma</i><i>·tick</i><i>·</i><i>equals</i>.<br />
<br />
<div>A macro or UDF (e.g. <i>User Defined Function</i>) would certainly do what you are asking. If you can post some sample data (e.g. old data perhaps...?) something can likely be designed for your specific purposes.</div>

<br />
You probably see about 2.08E+12 for 2083421907530.&nbsp; That is not a formula.&nbsp; It is simply how Excel represents certain large numbers in a cell whose format is General.<br />
<br />
As long as such numbers are 15 digits or less, Excel will input them correctly (exactly).&nbsp; However, they will be numeric, not text.<br />
<br />
Since the third column (after two commas) contains a mix of text (206T025193091) and numeric (2083421907530), it would be prudent to format that column (or at least that range of cells) as Text.<br />
<br />
However, when you open or download the CSV file directly in Excel, you have no control over those formats.&nbsp; Although you can fix it post facto, it might be easier to control it when you input the data.<br />
<br />
There are two ways.&nbsp; If you can download the file to disk first, change the extension from ".csv" to ".txt".&nbsp; Alternatively, use the Import External Data wizard to input the data from the file.&nbsp; Either way, the wizard will provide a way to set the type of that
 column of data to Text instead of General.<br />
<br />
However, that will require that you treat corresponding data in the first parameter of your VLOOKUP similarly.&nbsp; In other words, you should enter identifiers of the form 2083421907530 as text, not numeric.<br />
<br />
You can do that one of three ways, depending on circumstances.&nbsp; If those identifiers are in cells, either prefix the data entry with an apostrophe (aka single-quote) -- for example, '2083421907530 -- or format the cell as Text

If all that sounds overwhelming (I had to cover multiple contingencies), it might helpful if you uploaded your files to a file-sharing website, and post the URLs (aka link; http://...) of the uploaded files in a response here.&nbsp; The following is a list of some
 free file-sharing websites.<br />
<br />

<br />
It would also be helpful if you elaborated on your situation.&nbsp; You said you are "downloading CSV data from a web site and trying to use it in Excel for a vlookup".&nbsp; Exactly how are you incorporating the download CSV data into an Excel file with formulas?<br />
<br />
For example, are you opening the CSV data (which opens an instance of Excel), then adding formulas?&nbsp; Or are you incorporating the CSV data some other way?&nbsp; If the latter, exactly what is your current procedure; and how flexible are you on "complicating" that
 procedure somewhat to solve your problem?<br />
<br />
If the CSV data and Excel file are two different things, it might be helpful if you uploaded

<br />
Another thought....&nbsp; If you are using VLOOKUP with only 3 parameters or with TRUE (or non-zero) in the 4th parameter, and you lookup table is composed of mixed text and numeric data as you posted (not in any particular order) [1], you are violating the requirement
 that the lookup column is in ascending order in the special collating manner described in the VLOOKUP help page.<br />
<br />
Essentially, all text data must appear in ascending order following all numeric data, which also must be in ascending order.&nbsp; Excel Sort will order data according to those collating rules.<br />
<br />
Change or add the 4th VLOOKUP parameter as FALSE (or zero).<br />
<br />
Caveat:&nbsp; Although that might allow the VLOOKUP to work as-is, it might slow things down considerably, depending on the amount of data in the lookup table and the number of VLOOKUP expressions that you have.&nbsp; Ultimately, it would be better to sort the lookup
 table according to the first column, and either omit the 4th VLOOKUP parameter or set it to TRUE (or non-zero).<br />
<br />
-----<br />
[1] [ERRATA] After reviewing your posted data, it appears that it is not "not in any particular order".&nbsp; It appears that all text data is together in ascending order, and all numeric data is together in ascending order.<br />
<br />
But the point is:&nbsp; text data is followed by numeric data, the reverse of what VLOOKUP expects if the 4th parameter is not FALSE (zero).&nbsp; Moreover, since we have only an excerpt of the data, perhaps it is indeed "not in any particular order" after all.&nbsp; I cannot
 really say either way.

            <p>It is overwhelming and I see that trying to simplify my issue was not helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I inherited a macro that was working fine until the data I was using changed.&nbsp; (I&nbsp;think the macro&nbsp;can be simplified)&nbsp;I am sure it is the data format and was hoping I could resolve the data and thus my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The macro does do the text formatting of the data.&nbsp; We have tried saving as a .txt and importing into Excel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a link to my .txt file, my .xls file that has the macro in it, and a word document explaining the macro purpose</p>

I do hope those files do not contain real account numbers.&nbsp; If they do, I advise you to delete the skydrive files immediately.<br />

<blockquote>I have downloaded them already.&nbsp; It will take me some time to digest everything.

<br />
I cannot proceed without additional instructions.<br />
<br />
When we open TESTMACRO.xls, we are positioned in the "Original Data" worksheet, which is empty except for a blue button with the instructions "click ... after pasting information from Qwest.com".<br />
<br />
I presume we should copy the text from testCenturyLinkAcctSum_09302011a.txt.<br />
<br />
It is unclear where to paste it.&nbsp; I pasted into A1.&nbsp; That results in comma-separated data in A5:A176 plus some boilerplate data in A1:A4.<br />
<br />
It is unclear what to do next.<br />
<br />
If we simply click on the blue button, that executes the following macros in sequence:&nbsp; QwestFirstStep, QwestDisconnectedAccts and QwestNewAccounts.<br />
<br />
Eventually we are left in the "Miscellaneous" worksheet.&nbsp; I also notice that the "New Accounts" worksheet is essentially empty except for a title in A1000.&nbsp; A VLOOKUP formula that was originally in B2 is gone.<br />
<br />
I don't know what is wrong, if anything.&nbsp; There are no VLOOKUP formulas (which you mention in your original posting), other than the one deleted in 'New Accounts'!B2.<br />
<br />
However, there are VLOOKUP formulas in the NewQwestAccounts macro included in Qwest New Accounts.doc.&nbsp; (Not to be confused with the very different QwestNewAccounts already in TESTMACRO.xls.)<br />
<br />
If we subsequently import and manually execute that NewQwestAccounts macro, the original "New Acccounts" worksheet is deleted, and a "New Accounts 3" worksheet is created.&nbsp; The latter is essentially empty except for titles in A1 and B1.<br />
<br />
I don't know what is wrong, if anything.<br />
<br />
(Note:&nbsp; We cannot execute the NewQwestAccounts macro unless we first comment out the statement Sheets.Add.Name = "New Accounts".&nbsp; Alternatively, we might delete the pre-existing "News Accounts" worksheet.&nbsp; I added code to do the latter, if necessary.)<br />
<br />
The following are some wild-a.s.s guesses about corrections to the above procedures.<br />
<br />
I note that QwestFirstStep copies some columns (B:B, G:G, etc) from "Original Data" presumably after we paste the text copied from testCenturyLinkAcctSum_09302011a.txt.&nbsp; But those columns are empty.<br />
<br />
I suspect we should use "Text to Columns" to split the comma-separated data in A4:A176.<br />
<br />
I also suspect that the NewQwestAccounts macro included in Qwest New Accounts.doc should replace QwestNewAccounts, changing the statement Application.Run "QwestNewAccounts" to Application.Run "NewQwestAccounts" in the QwestFirstStep macro.<br />
<br />
When I make those changes and start from scratch (i.e. using the original TESTMACRO.xls file), the end result seems essentially the same.<br />
<br />
I don't know if the VLOOKUPs in the NewQwestAccounts macro worked or not.&nbsp; I am not willing to debug something when I do not have sufficient instructions and an explanation of intended behavior and observed failures in some detail.<br />
<br />
Some observations of my own....<br />
<br />
The data in the third column of testCenturyLinkAcctSum_09302011a.txt is indeed a mix of numeric and text data, not in any particular order.<br />
<br />
Also, the data in column A of the "Miscellaneous" worksheet is a mix of numeric and text data, not in any particular order.&nbsp; I don't know if that is relevant since it appears that the (new) NewQwestAccounts macro does not access the "Miscellaneous" worksheet.<br />
<br />
In any case, the VLOOKUPs in the NewQwestAccounts macro all do exact matches (FALSE in the 4th parameter).&nbsp; So the mix of numeric and text data should have no adverse effect.<br />
<br />
As you can see, I did not more than a cursory attempt to learn about and use the files that you provided.&nbsp; Perhaps someone else will have more success without further information.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it would behoove you to "fill in the blanks" alluded to above.&nbsp; That is, explain in some detail how you want us to use the files you provided step-by-step and what goes wrong, including worksheet and cell references and examples of what you expect
 v. what actually happens.<br />

            Deleting gmail messages doesn't really delete them. Gmail keeps a copy of every message with the "All mail" label. You are viewing the "All mail" label as a folder and so you'll still see it, just like you would if you were using gmail via a web browser.

<h2>            After installing and uninstalling Firefox I can&#39;t access Internet at all</h2>
                    I had to install Mozilla Firefox, Java and Adobe today to complete an online course. Course now done, when I tried to get on FB it said it couldn't connect. I uninstalled Firefox, (and something called "constasurf" which I never installed)&nbsp;but then started
 getting PROXY SERVER ISN'T RESPONDING message.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now&nbsp;I can not access the internet at all. And of course, that means no email.&nbsp;Help needed!

    <title>Add .net compact framework 3.5 CAB file to the Marketplace&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathleen anderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add .net compact framework 3.5 CAB file to the Marketplace&#63;</h2>
                    I recently went through the process of <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/spiderwebwoman/archive/2010/02/05/1755480.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
installing the&nbsp;Microsoft .net compact framework 3.5 on my&nbsp;Windows Mobile 6.1 phone</a>. For those who are not developers, the process is a bit intimidating, and the file you need to download is quite large (33MB).<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to make the CAB file available for download from the Mobile Marketplace?<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

            It's actually there, but it's not available as an item that you can download directly.&nbsp; If you purchase and item that requires the .Net 3.5 framework then it is automatially installed. Ofcourse that does you no good if you are trying to install an application
 from a source other than the Marketplace.&nbsp;For distribution outside of the Marketplace developers can actually package the framework installation with their application (some do, most don't).<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I think the 33 meg file you downloaded is the full desktop framework. The .Net <em>
Compact </em>3.5 framework is only 2.58 megs.

            You are right - the application I&nbsp;downloaded was from a&nbsp;source other than the Marketplace. The application installed successfully, but wouldn't run.
<br />
<br />
As far as I know, unless it's installed by another app, the only way to get the .net compact framework 3.5 CAB file is to download the full desktop framework to your PC and run it on your PC with your phone connected via ActiveSync. I'm suggesting that the
 .Net <em>Compact </em>3.5 framework CAB file be added to the MarketPlace so people don't have to download the 33MB file. This would be extremely helpful for people who don't use ActiveSync or don't have access to a PC.

            Wow, I hadn't realized that it wasn't quickly and easily available. Being a developer it either ends up on my phones automatically through the developer tools or I've been able to grab it from the developer redistributables that I've got.&nbsp;I also keep a
 copy on a personal web site so I can just grab it from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

You are absolutely correct. And as soon as Microsoft provides .NET CF3.5 in a simple, downloadable, device installable file, it will also be the best place to get this critical piece of software.

            <p><em>New is not always improved ...&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>(sometimes it seems to me to be especially true at MS ... &lt;sigh&gt; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2013 MS "<em>improved</em>", ie changed, the "drawing engine", the part of the program that "paints"/draws Word on the screen. It does this drawing in fundamentally different ways. Ways that don't always appear better for everyone.
<br />
</p>
<p>Some people have found that turning off "Hardware Acceleration" helped. Apparently there is a bad interaction between the new code and the computer.&nbsp; Actually, the fix is to try switching the current hardware acceleration setting. Turn it on if off, off
 if it is on ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an external/extra video card, look up the instructions specific to it to turn off hardware acceleration.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If none of the following suggestions help, some people have found that tweaking the video driver helps.&nbsp; If you have the most current Windows driver installed, look to find out if there are builder specific video drivers and try installing them.&nbsp; Or if you
 already have the most current driver, try installing an older one, from Win 8 or even Win 7. Some people have reported that helped.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Symptoms</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>When you use Microsoft Office 2013 programs, you may notice that visual features differ from one computer to another. For example, on one computer, you may see animations in Excel when you scroll
 through a worksheet on one computer. However, on another computer, you do not see the same animations.
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Cause</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may experience these symptoms if you have a video configuration on your computer that is incompatible with the Office 2013 feature set that is responsible for displaying the application and
 for animations in the application.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>If you turn on the Manage 3D Setting on AntiAliasing – FXAA option for newer NVIDIA cards, you’ll see distortion or blurriness. This option is off by default because the option states “enabling

<p><strong><span>Workaround</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NVIDIA has released a newer driver that you can download from the NVIDIA website.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>The cause for Office, Modern UI and IE10 to look so bad is that they use a new graphics rendering API offered in Windows 8 (and with updates on Windows 7, too).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The new font rendering engine</span></strong><span> offered by this new API<strong> simply</strong>
<strong>doesn’t have Clear Type implemented</strong>. So unless Microsoft patches this new API to support Clear Type, no program using this API will ever be able to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason why Firefox (and Chrome, to an extend) are able to use Clear Type is because they still rely on the old Windows font-rendering API.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a bad decision by Microsoft, but their
<strong>reasoning </strong>behind that (from what I think) is also quite clear: It is based on the assumption that their
<strong>future will be in the tablet market</strong>. Since <strong>ClearType only works in one direction</strong> (horizontally, that is), it is totally useless if you rotate the tablet. The other thing is animation:
<strong>if you animate a Clear Type anti-aliased font, its boundaries will start to flicker</strong>. And since Modern UI is a lot about animations and transitions, this would offer a bad experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Last thing is the much higher ppi (pixels per inch) offered by tablet screens (&gt;200ppi) in respect to computer monitors (mostly &lt;=120ppi), where grayscale-anti aliasing is totally sufficient for
 crisp fonts.</span></p>
<p><span>And the worst thing: the Surface has a display with only 148ppi! So fonts look crappy on their reference design tablet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The bad thing is: no one can help you with the font rendering problem. You’re on your own, as a consumer. For me that meant to
<strong>downgrade back to Office 2010</strong>, <strong>ignoring Modern UI and all apps&nbsp;</strong>completely and
<strong>ditching IE 10 </strong>(but hey, that’s a no-brainer, isn’t it?).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p><span>With hardware acceleration disabled, AirSpace device renders using software rendering (WARP) that relies mainly on the CPU and uses limited or no graphics card resources. You can cause a lower
 frame rate and increase in the working set. Performance becomes more dependent on CPU characteristics, like memory, number of cores, and on how many apps are open, and can strain the CPU resources.</span></p>
<p><span>On Windows 7, Office animations are disabled. On Windows 8, animations are enabled because of D2D WARP improvements found in Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p><span>If you turn on the Manage 3D Setting on AntiAliasing – FXAA option for newer NVIDIA cards, you’ll see distortion or blurriness. This option is off by default because the option states “enabling
 this setting global may affect all programs rendered on the GPU, including video players and the Windows desktop.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Workaround</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NVIDIA has released a newer driver that you can download from the NVIDIA website.</span></p>
<p><span>Or since the above setting is global, you can click the
<strong>Program Settings</strong> tab of the <strong>Manage 3D Settings</strong> and customize your Office programs to turn the global setting for Antialiasing – FXAA to off. By default, the
<strong>Use Global Setting</strong> is the setting and will take whatever is set globally.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>When do you encounter this issue?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Is it a random error or does it occurs when you do a specific task on the system?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Since when are you facing this issue?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Do you have any third party software installed on the system (PDCR i.e. Pc Doctor)?</p>
<p>Check whether you have this file present in the system ‘c:\\Program Files\Dell Support Center\HWDiag’</p>
<p>I would suggest you to open Internet Explorer in safe mode with Networking and check whether the issue persists. Follow method 1 that is mentioned below.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Restart the computer and keep tapping F8 till you reach the boot menu.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Select Safe mode with networking from the boot menu and press Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not persist in Safe mode with Networking, then I would suggest you to do a clean boot. Follow method 2.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to do a clean boot and check whether you are able to install the programs. Follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>It might be some background process that is running on the system is causing this problem. I would suggest you to do a clean boot and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Log on to the computer by using an
 account that has administrator rights</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in
 the Start Search box and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password or click Continue&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the General tab, click Selective
 Startup and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the Services tab, click to select
 the Hide all Microsoft services check box and then click Disable all</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong>Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting,
 and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>After you have finished troubleshooting,
 follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click start, type msconfig.exe in
 the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the General tab, click the Normal
 Startup option, and then click OK.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>When you are prompted to restart the
 computer, click Restart.</p>
<p>If the issue is resolved, check which third party program is causing this issue. For further reference check the article mentioned below.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to clear the Cookies and Cache. Follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Open Internet Explorer and click on Tools.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Select Internet Options and click on Delete that is listed under Browsing History and place a check mark
 on ‘Temporary Internet files’, ‘Cookies’, ‘History’.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>if you uncheck ‘Preserve favorite website data’ all your favorite Website cookies and temporary files related to your favorite websites will not retain in the system.</p>
<p>I also would suggest you to do an Internet optimization and check whether the issue persists. Check the article mentioned below.</p>
<p><strong><span>How to optimize Internet Explorer</span></strong></p>

<li>
<div>calendar - randomly misses items - only around 1 third of appointments appear on my device (this is the most important issue for me)</div>
</li><li>
<div>contacts - any contact with a picture does not sync with my device (not a big problem - i removed the picutres and re-synced)</div>
</li><li>
<div>notes - all seem to sync ok (phew - thank god something works)</div>
</li><li>
<div>email - any email that has a from 'name' and not showing the actual 'email address' as the sender does not sync with my device. (this is a big problem for me also)</div>
</li></ul>

    <title>Pivot table reference - drag copying and keeping column reference - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jake the elder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot table reference - drag copying and keeping column reference</h2>
                    <p>I am using a pivot table.&nbsp; I am using the several query functions such as COUNTIF&nbsp; For example, one follows</p>
<p>COUNTIFS(BatchResultTable[Sample], $A3)</p>
<p>Pivot table is "BatchResultTable" and has column header "Sample".&nbsp; &nbsp;The $A3 references a cell on use page that the search match is trying to count.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where I use this COUNTIFS statement, I want to drag this formula across several columns to duplicate the formula.&nbsp; But when I drag copy, or even copy paste, the "sample" is automatically replaced with the next column within the original pivot table.&nbsp; I want
 it to remain the same fixed reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 20 columns that I want to drag copy, and right now I have to manually edit each one to correct the auto increment and changing the table columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I drag copy or even copy paste, and keep the pivot table reference the same (i.e. absolute reference within a pivot table).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar to use the "$A" to force it keep column A on the current sheet.</p>

<p>Not really.&nbsp; The advantage of the pivot table and using column headers is the readability.&nbsp; I used default row and column references before, and it got too hard to remember what columns were being used in the math.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting add - I did find that drag copying or copy/paste on the SAME sheet keeps the naming.&nbsp; But I am using a other sheets for the queries (pivot table has 8000+ entries).&nbsp; It is on other sheets that drag copying or copy/paste is "moving" the column
 references.</p>

            I'd suggest doing an online repair of the installation.
<br />
<br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:

            Hi ANdrew, first try to repair your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the online repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not, then try disabling Hardware acceleration:
<br />
<br />In Excel, go to File - Options - Advanced
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Diaplay
<br />
<br />Check the box marked 'Disable Hardware Graphics Acceleration'
<br />
<br />Restart Excel

    <title>Mail sent from linked account &#40;own domain via ISP-server&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mahnas92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail sent from linked account &#40;own domain via ISP-server&#41; won&#39;t save a copy in &#34;Sent Folder&#34;</h2>
                    <p>So I recently purchased a domain with webhosting and mail-server service, but got fed up with needing to sign in to that service to check my mail, and I also prefer the Outlook-app on my phone, rather than the built in E-mail or Gmail apps, so I decided
 to link that account with my existing hotmail-account. In that process I actively chose to include and sync the "Sent" folder from my personal domain - and that works fine for already existing sent-items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that whenever I use Outlook.com (or the Android-app) to send mail as myself from my new linked account, no copies of my mails are saved, neither in the standard "Sent Items", nor the new "Sent"-folder created for my linked account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note; this is <strong>NOT</strong> a synchronization problem, since I can't find the items sent with Outlook in the sent-folder from my service-provider's webmail either!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: Also, just tried to send mail from default app and competitor's services, and worked good! Please fix this issue ASAP!</p>
<p>EDIT2: Also, all new sent-items, regardless of origin (native webmail, gmail, default android app) correctly syncs and shows up in the sent-folder in Outlook, which indicates the sync implementation is flawless (except for the minutes-long delays), and the
 problem lays in Outlook API for storing sent-emails for linked accounts...</p>

            How is my ISP going to help me with Outlook.com, if it is obvious that everything from their end works perfectly fine?<br />
Connecting and linking my mail to different applications and services works fine. This problem only occurs on Office.com. Do you have concrete details on what might be the problem, so I can take it to my ISP? Because else I will basically be turning to my ISP
 for Outlook.com support...<br />
<br />
Edit: And I mean, even Outlook.com is working perfectly fine with receiving and sending mail via my ISP-mail. The sole problem is that outgoing mail, composed and sent via Outlook.com wont be saved in the "Sent" folder; not the Outlook one, nor ISP one either!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting an account using IMAP settings works by mirroring the same settings set by your email service provider. There may be restrictions on your account that they may have configured. It would be best to contact them and ask if they allow your account's
 folders to be synced using a different email client than what they provided you. Also, we would like to know if your account is personal or business.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have now been contacting my mail-service provider, lets call them ISP for matter of ease.</p>
<p>I am informed that your service needs to set up correct folders in for the mail-server to grab sent items...<br />
I just got this reply... and by this time I have no more patience to read on on the details, but apparently this is something you also write about in this page:</p>

(Scroll down to FAQ)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;From the site:</p>
<div>&gt;&gt;Why don't items I send through my connected account appear in the Sent Items folder?</div>
<div style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">
<div>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Outlook.com Sent Items folder only syncs what is available on the connected account server.

<h2>            Excel - Printing Two Pages To One Sheet</h2>
                    I have an older notebook and new notebook both running Windows 10 and using Office 365. When using Excel on the older notebook I could print two pages on one page but on the new notebook there is no option to print two pages on one page under Printer Properties.
 Is there a setting that I've missed? Thanks for your help!

<p>Thanks for the reply. I've updated all the drivers &amp; etc but no luck, so I contacted support. The person I spoke with was very helpful but unfortunately after connecting to my laptop remotely wasn't able to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They gave me the number to contact Microsoft Professional Support as apparently it may be a Macro Setting (?) issue. Haven't been able to contact them yet due to time constraints but will do so when possible.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Edge does not work with Intuit QuickBooks online. The Intuit login web page works, but once in the QuickBooks online app Microsoft Edge freezes. QuickBooks online works with Internet Explorer. Are there some setting I should change in Microsoft

<h2>            Release mails with ATP for a shared mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>With ATP we're having daily mails from MS talking about mails whic are placed in quarantine folder.</p>
<p>In these mails we're not having all mails automatically rejected.</p>
<p>As we're having sometimes false positive mails, each user is able to look at the quarantine web app to release false positive mail (<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://admin.protection.outlook.com/quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://admin.protection.outlook.com/quarantine</span></a>).</span></p>

<p>As I have shared mailbox for several users, how is it possible for an authorized user to release mails for a shared mailbox when all rejected mails aren't mentioned at all ?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance for your answer</p>

    <title>Word blinking all the time with busy circle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fr laisney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word blinking all the time with busy circle</h2>
                    It seems that there is a bug in Word (both Word 2003 and Word 2010 - I do not have 2007 - I work on Windows 7 professional).
<div>For a long time, Word was blinking all the time with the busy circle, making it very annoying to work with it. I tried using a previous version (2003), repairing it, uninstalling it and re-installing it, everything I could think and it did not work.</div>
<div>Then finally asking a friend of mine, he directed me to this "answers.microsoft.com" community, and I searched there and found that this problem has been going of for several years, at least since 2011, and in one thread I found the right answer:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is due to the fact that my default printer is not on-line.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When reading that, I immediately realised that this situation was mine. I went right away to "Devices and Printers", chose another default printer that is always "on-line" (a .pdf printer), and immediately the problem stopped. To make sure that this was
 indeed the cause of the problem, I did the opposite, and reset my default printer to a printer that was not on-line, and the problem immediately reappeared; I then chose an on-line default printer and it again immediately disappeared.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It looks like Word constantly checks the status of the default printer: it should not be so. Anyway, there is clearly a bug there, that needs to be corrected.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I wrote a comment on several thread mentioning this bug. But then I realised that they were old and it was unlikely that my comment would be noticed by a Microsoft employee that could initiate the process to correct the bug. So I write the present
 post, hoping that it will be noticed, in such a way that this bug will be soon corrected. It is easy to cause such a behaviour, as explained above; so it should be easy to "debug" it.</div>
                </div>

            &nbsp;Word depends on the printer to use the font in some times and this is a known behavior with the word. any how you may send the feedback to Microsoft about it.<br />

            Thanks for the reply. If it is a known behaviour, it seems to me that Microsoft should have corrected it much earlier.
<div>Anyhow, how do I contact the "feedback" to Microsoft? I thought this was the site where to give such feedback, isn't it?</div>
<div>In quite a few other threads, one can see a "support engineer" in these threads. I assumed they were "Microsoft support engineers", aren't they?</div>

            <p>I am not sure that Word needs the&nbsp;active printer to be on-line.&nbsp; Mine certainly is not as it is on a wireless print server that auto-connects when a print command is issued and it is often turned off completely as I probably only print a document a few times
 a month.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alos I often work on documents that will be printed on a printer that I do not even have, but for which I have installed the necessary drivers on my computer - This is the case when I need to incorporate A3 pages in a document while my printer can
 only print A4.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Definitely however, Word does require access to the driver for the active printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, for "active printer", read the printer that is selected in the Word Print dialog (or back stage print view in Word 2010).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I make these points on the basis of having worked extensively with every version of Word since Version 1.0 for DOS back around 1983.&nbsp; The requirement for access to the printer driver has probably only been the case since the advent of WYSIWYG and inkjet
 and laser printers.</p>

            Thanks, Doug, for your comments.
<div>To be more precise, my situation was that of a <u>network printer</u>&nbsp;which is "offline" when I am travelling, thus not connected with that (home) network. That precision might help debuggers.</div>
<div>I have also worked with Words for more than 15 years, and it seems that this problem happened to me only in the last two years, but also I have been travelling more in these last two years, so I can't say whether it was before, when I was not travelling.
 It may be connected with one of those "automatic updates" - sometimes, fixing something they bring other problems...</div>
<div>Yet with the diagnostic I have explained above, it is very easy to re-install the bug and take it away: if the default printer is a network printer, to which network I am not connected, then the bug reappears. If the default printer is any "online" printer
 (e.g. even a .pdf printer), the bug disappears.</div>
<div>Microsoft should correct it.</div>

            Seems to me that you should install a local copy of the printer.

            A printer is a hardware device, not a software file. One cannot "copy" a printer, as far as I know. One can only "install" a printer - mine was installed properly, according to the recommendations of the installation manual, and it works quite fine, of
 course when I am "online" with it, which is not the problem. The problem is that Word for some reason does not work properly when I am "travelling" away from my printer. That is the problem.
<div>The fix up of choosing a ".pdf" printer does work, without really addressing the problem. It seems to me that Microsoft should correct this problem, and it should not be difficult.</div>

            <p>If I were your, I would install another instance of the printer as a printer that is connected to the computer (even if it is not), rather than as a network printer,&nbsp;and then have that set as the active printer.</p>

<h2>            Stop any email that contains a&#40;n&#41; .ICS attachmemnt from adding the event to my calendars automatically....</h2>
                    In an effort to "control my inbox" I wonder if there's a way to stop any email that contains a(n) .ICS attachment from being automatically added to my calendars.
<br />
<br />
Apparently spammers have caught onto this "feature" and my calendar gets populated with meeting requests I have to decline.
<br />
<br />
Also, if they are categorized (by the sender), they screw up the sync between iCal and Outlook.
<br />
<br />
Can this feature be turned off ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,&nbsp; Mike<br />

<h2>            Exchange Server re-created a meeting that was missing from your calendar</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to get some suggestions on how to handle this scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an user who is no longer with the company, there were several meeting invites &amp; recurrence meeting that were created and now if the recipients of the meeting choose to delete them they come back on the calendar with the message "<span style="color: rgba(72, 85, 99, 1)">Exchange
 Server re-created a meeting that was missing from your calendar</span>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an expected behavior, if so how do we delete these meetings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hello Sai,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, when an user's Office 365 account has been removed, after 30 days, all data under that account will be delete permanently. Please see:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Remove-a-former-employee-from-Office-365-44d96212-4d90-4027-9aa9-a95eddb367d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Remove a former employee from Office 365</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your case, may I know whether that account hasn't been removed and these invites &amp; recurrence meeting created by that user before?&nbsp; Also, can the admin access to that user's emails via his Office
 365 account ? If so, the admin can delete the calendar events via navigating to <span style="font-weight: bold">
Calendar</span> &gt;<span style="font-weight: bold"> View</span> tab &gt; click the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Change View</span> option, choose <span style="font-weight: bold">List</span> &gt; delete all events in the Outlook client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, we'd like to know that user was hosted on cloud or on-premises?&nbsp; And,
</p>
<p>as you mentioned Exchange server, does that mean Office 365 Exchange Online or you have on-premises Exchange server in your organization like Exchange 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything is misunderstand, could you please clarify the issue in details for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

<h2>            5130 XpressMusic problem.. &#38;quot&#59;not enough memory&#38;quot&#59;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My music player and fm radio are not working; when I try to open any media file the screen goes blank and a pop-up says "not enough memory", however, when I use the music keys, media works though without displaying either the music player or fm radio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not using any of the phone memory, and have more than 400 MB free memory on the memory card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>

            Yo people, I got exactly the same problem, and I only restored my nokia 5130 back to factory settings, it took away most of the apps that came with the phone aswell, but that's another story I'm still trying to put together, anyways, I'm no I.T. genius
 or cellphone technician, but I think I know how to solve this mess, its the music player skins that got deleted somehow, and its located in the cellphone's hidden folders, I think its like 3 seperate skins you'll need to put back, but it's a massive mission.
 I'm gonna try that, and see if it works, and if it does, I'll reply again...
