    <title>Outlook 365 - Can&#39;t Select Multiple Emails - Can&#39;t Sort by - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 365 - Can&#39;t Select Multiple Emails - Can&#39;t Sort by Attachment Heading - Cant Block Senders</h2>
                    <p><span>I am an Outlook user now.&nbsp; I love the customization features and the generous automation capabilities this program gives us.&nbsp;
</span>I have automatic graphic downloading turned off so I don't broadcast my "active email address" out to all the Spam-Bots out there.&nbsp; I also have my "Message Read" delay set to immediate so it changes as soon as I access the message.&nbsp; This is a great time-saver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, o<span>n my Office 365 Outlook setup I have some issues that I don't see addressed anywhere else.&nbsp;
</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I have my Reading Pane located below my Inbox email headers.&nbsp; When I am working through my Inbox folder and I select multiple emails, the focus never moves from the original email selected.&nbsp; I only see the first email selected in the Reading Pane.&nbsp; The
 other emails are showing being selected, but the focus never changes, and the additional emails never change their status to "Read".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was reading email headers in my previous email client, <span>Windows Live Mail,
</span>I could just hold down the "CTRL" key and click on the headers one-by-one.&nbsp; The reading pane would be updated and the email highlight would disappear indicating the message was marked as "Read".&nbsp; If it was a "Good" email, I could click the message again
 to "De-Select" it, and so on, until my whole selection was only trash emails, then I could just hit "Delete" and they would be moved to my "Trash" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior seems odd to me that each email message you select with the "CTRL" key pressed DOES NOT receive focus in Outlook 365.&nbsp; Is this a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I can NOT sort junk or trash folders by the "Attachment" flag.&nbsp; I used this feature all the time in Live Mail mainly to check my spam folder for possible important emails, but it doesn't work in Outlook 365.&nbsp; Just another minor annoyance I guess, but
 all the other Column Headers can be clicked to sort the emails.&nbsp; Just the "Attachment Flag" column doesn't work.&nbsp; Is this another bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; "Block Sender" doesn't seem to work either.&nbsp; I amassed a large list of blocked senders, but the same ones keep getting through!&nbsp; I discovered the spam generators got smart and started changing their exact "From" email addresses in order to bypass any
 "Block Sender" request I may have in place.&nbsp; To compound the issue, there is a "From" display name that is different from the "From" email address", so if the Sender changes their email address (daily it seems) the same "From" names can appear over and over.&nbsp;
 This all serves to make the "Block Sender" function appear to be useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution seemed to come from an alert user that recommended making a "Rule" for the "From" name and sending everything "From" that name to the "Trash" folder.&nbsp; This has the added benefit of taking out multiple copies of the same email in your "Inbox"
 from the same Sender. &nbsp; But even with that &nbsp; I keep seeing the same senders every day.&nbsp; Ugh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem may be that there could be an "Never Block Sender" rule laying around in the system from when I was just starting out.&nbsp; I didn't realize at first that I could just click the header in the Reading Pane to see the message graphics, so I hit
 "Never Block Sender" quite a few times at the beginning.&nbsp; Many of these I want to block now, but they started out being trusted, so is it possible the system never really blocks them?&nbsp; I'm not sure, but they seem to keep getting through no matter what blockade
 I throw up.&nbsp; Changing emails is not a solution, so don't even go there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4.&nbsp; I found a work around for Outlook's inability to right click on a folder name and click "Mark All Read".&nbsp; This was also a feature in Live Mail that I greatly miss.&nbsp; I used it because I had set up many rules for channeling email I wanted to keep
 into various message folders such as "Customers", "Vendors", Insurance", etc.&nbsp; Every time I sent and received email, my folders would light up highlighted numbers indicating the new emails waiting to be read.&nbsp; Many times I wouldn't have enough time to read
 them all, so I just wanted to reset the "Unread Emails" highlighted numbers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The work-around is a little complicated.&nbsp; First I had to make a Quick Access Toolbar icon for "Mark All Read".&nbsp; There are explanations of how to do this elsewhere.&nbsp; I always put my quick access toolbar below the Ribbon so it is easy to access.&nbsp;
</span><span>Once you have a "Mark All Read" icon on your Quick Access Toolbar, you can activate it by "ALT+1 to "ALT+9" depending on its position in the toolbar.&nbsp; I recommend keeping it in one of the first 3 positions.</span></p>
<p><span>Now I can click on a folder name with my mouse in my right hand and clear the unread items by giving the two-finger "ALT+1" salute with my left hand.&nbsp; Then I can click another folder and press "ALT+1" back and forth until they are all cleared.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>T<span>here should be a "Mark Folder Read" or "Mark All Folders Read" button at the top, or at least an option to put it there, amiright?</span></p>

<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Not, its not a bug; its partly by design, so you can select messages to delete without previewing porrn or spam. 
<br />
<br />If you want the other selections to be marked read, right click and mark as read or press Ctrl+Q. 
<br />
<br />If you are deleting, the newest builds of outlook 2016  support marking read when deleted, so no need to mark them as read. (File, Options, Mail - very last item on page). 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br /> I can NOT sort junk or trash folders by the "Attachment" flag. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />It works here. Do you recieve any error messages when you try? 
<br />
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />"Block Sender" doesn't seem to work either. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Block sender is not very effective for the reasons you mentioned. It's best used for annoying people and companies who won't stop sending you mail (and should be pretty short), not spam. 
<br />
<br />Junk mail settings are in Home menu, Junk, Junk mail options. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />I found a work around for Outlook's inability to right click on a folder name and click "Mark All Read". 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Hmm. What version of Outlook are you using? Both the desktop install and Outlook on the web have this option. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />There should be a "Mark Folder Read" or "Mark All Folders Read" button at the top, or at least an option to put it there, amiright?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />There there no mark all folders read, but definitely mark all mail in the current folder is on the right click menu. Ctrl+A, Q is the shortcut to mark all read in the folder you are currently working in (Select all, mark read)

<p><span>Hi MacKenzie26,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your detailed description.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About first problem: Can’t select multiple emails. According to my understanding, you want to
<strong>multi-select</strong> unread emails and every time selecting one email, that email content should be displayed as well in Reading Pane? However, when you press
<strong>Ctrl</strong> key and select emails, the Reading pane only show the first emails been selected and Reading Pane won’t change to the following email’s content when you select the following emails, and these additional emails unread status never changed
 to read.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If so, by default, if you tick the checkbox “<strong>Mark items as read when selection changes</strong>” in File-&gt;Options-&gt;Mail-&gt; Reading Pane, when you select emails at the same time press
<strong>Ctrl </strong>key, only the first email its status can changed to read, and Reading Pane won’t show the next been selected email contents. You can just left-click each emails directly, every email you select will change to read and show its
 contents in Reading Pane.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About can’t sort junk or trash folder by attachment flag, you can select the spam or junk folder, then click search field textbox, the
<strong>Search Tool</strong> tab will appear, then click “<strong>+ More</strong>” button to add “<strong>Attachments</strong>” common properties, then you can filter emails in junk folder depending on whether they actually have attachments
 or not.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About spam emails, you can also manage your block sender list in Junk E-mail Option:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Ignore specific sender to move current and future messages in the selected conversation to the Deleted Items Folder:</span></p>

since I can't actually "see" the email, I can't very well select them for deletion.&nbsp; Do you see what I mean?&nbsp; When I multiple select with the control key, I need to see each item I select.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
They expect that you know its spam based on the subject and/or sender.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
See if you can find spam emails with paper clip icons next to them that don't have any actual separate files.&nbsp; Then try to sort them, and you'll see what I mean.&nbsp; They don't sort.&nbsp; The just stay there, probably because they aren't "real" attachments.&nbsp; I guess
 this didn't happen in Live Mail because it either included these "phantom attachments" in the sort, or it didn't generate ant "phantom attachment" icons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Either way, I know what is going on now.&nbsp; Maybe we should put in a bug report or a feature request here as well?<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
If you are looking at the messages in the junk mail folder, messages with embedded images should have the icon, since the messages are plain text.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Feature requests and suggestions go to outlook.uservoice.com.&nbsp; Bugs reports are more difficult - if you use an insider build you might have the option to contact support.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
Time for another feature request - Expand "Block Sender" Options to Include "From" name as well as Email Address and/or Top-Level or URL Domains to block.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />

Block senders can be useful, just not for every address who sends spam. Many spammers use addresses once and move on - adding these addresses just fill up the list with addresses that wont be used again.&nbsp; For awhile, i was blocking an acquaintance who kept
 forwarding chain mail crap and a couple of businesses who didn't have an unsubscribe link.&nbsp;You can block the new TLD like&nbsp; .info&nbsp; by adding it to the blocked list in this format: .info. These are definitely worth blocking, although maybe not info as more people
 are starting to use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the desktop version, you can block countries in the junk mail filter's international settings, and you can block domains.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t i sign in with my google account on my phone&#63;</h2>
                    When I put in my email address and pin it says "Your phone needs to communicate with Google Servers to set up ur account. This may take up to five minutes" and it shows a loading bar at the bottom of that message. Than after 5 minutes it says " Can't establish
 a reliable data connection to the server". I do have a SD inside my phone.

            <p>Hi Anna Kahn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds more like a connection issue as in either your cellular Data Connection or your WI-Fi connection. If you're on cellular, try finding a good Wi-Fi connection and try again. It could also be that Google's mobile servers were temporarily unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would confirm your login information by manually logging into your Google account via a web browser (not using the Autofill function).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!<br />
David</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - SD only pertains to data storage and will not affect your data connection(s).</p>

    <title>Renewed Code Signing Certificate not trusted by SmartScreen Filter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epicraft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Renewed Code Signing Certificate not trusted by SmartScreen Filter</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>Last year (2011) we gained enough downloads of our software for our code signing certificate to be trusted by IE9 SmartScreen Filter. We renewed our code signing certificate 2012 for a one year period and this new certificate is not trusted!!!</p>
<p><br />
I can understand the need for a new certificate to build up reputation with the SmartScreen Filter but a RENEWED certificate should really inherit the reputation of the old certificate as it is renewed and issued to the same entity.<br />
<br />
(It seems the current IE9 SmartScreen Filter performs the reputation check based on the certificate serial number, instead of to whom it has been issued to. The logical and fair thing to do would be to check reputation of the certificate based on to the entity
 (company name or person) the certificate has been issued to)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a major issue for us as our entire business depends on people downloading our software, are you in the IE9 or IE10 team going to fix this??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With best regards,<br />
Hans Sixhöj</p>

<h2>            video or audio codec&#47;file not supported win 10 1903</h2>
                    1903 update hp notebook 15 g070nr. after update to 1903, redeemed movie codes in VUDU and a few TV episodes but wont playback ANY videos "audio or video file not supported". Video playback trouble shooter "HEVC not installed' fixed by TS installing from
 Microsoft. no success. Movie &amp; TV app is always problematic freezing up everything forcing a hard shut down with power button. cant fix this so I use WMP 12 except it wont find my VUDU digital copies anyway. Video in Edge( VUDU website) is buffer hell so I
 use store app. always worked fine better than browser. Other videos downloaded from youtube apps and streaming apps(mp4) play fine in WMP but not .avi ? or tmp.? Any fixes for this new video issue in 1903? feature updates add this but always "break" something
 else to fix.&nbsp;

            Are you using WMP to play these files? WMP is very basic &amp; fussy about which files it will play.
<br />Try downloading KLite codec pack which has its own media player which seems to play many files which WMP does not.
<br /><a href="https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm</a>
<br />Or download VLC player:

            I use WMP for music and basic video(mp3 mp4) and Digital copys or purchases in VUDU store app or blueray surround as a media server(VUDU) for those HDX video and no problem intill 1903. I seriously thought about VLC desktop as it plays DVD discs I think.
 Movies &amp; TV, Photos, try to play HDX but just bog down and freeze or crash out. VUDU win app worked well but wont play old or new files accuired through VUDU. TS "fixed" HEVC file install but no effect. VLC seems better and better. thanks for advice Ill try
 soon.

            VLC is a nice player but I also found some driver update issues ie PnP display driver disabled itself and a missing Pcidriver and AMD grafic driver update issues in Reliability Monitors Problem Reports that I just discovered recently. Also saw a lot of
 HP driver updates installed since 1903. Device Manager trouble shooting helped to straighten out Problem Report issues so far I think. The VUDU app device manager was missing my laptop as a VUDU enabled device somehow and wouldn't work even in Edge but was
 fine on bd surround system w/ tv. Events and timelines, related system issues hardware driver updates must be related somehow because things seem stable. New Win10 versions can suck for hardware/device manufactuers and us users. glad theres forums like this
 to help non-techs like myself.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so far the sample data of the Inside out is just interesting to me the way they have design forms and tables. is so far catching my interest.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, since everyone has a different learning style and starts with different skills, it's very difficult to say one book is better than another to learn Access.</p>
<p>Jeff Conrad and John Viescas, the authors of Access 2010 Inside Out,&nbsp;are personal friends of mine, and I know the depth of their understanding (Jeff actually works for Microsoft on the Access team). That would obviously lead me to prefer that book. However,
 Roger Jennings (the author of Access 2010 In Depth) has been writing about Access for a long time, and also knows it well.</p>
<p>You might consider thinking of 2 or 3 specific issues you've been having using Access, then see whether you can find solutions to those specific issues in the two books.</p>

            I totally agree with Doug. And am in a similar boat. I know Jeff and John well, but I was the Technical Editor for Roger's last two versions.&nbsp;

            <p>Right gents am very grateful for the advised shared. i have to do the hardest work by reading them somehow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am actually begining with access, my issue is that creating tables forms reports isnt always a problem. but when it comes to writing querys i get stuck with things that should make great filtering in querys. i also have just little understanding of the
 2007 macros because of the few books i read.</p>
<p>big problem is always relationship of tables. thats why i want to read through these books. i will keep looking at both specialy if i dint get to undertsand the explanation the inside out i will read indeth. in that way i may finally depart from the struggle
 of not understanding relationsips in table.</p>
<p>Note: for modules and the rest that make access powerful am just zero.</p>
<p>but thanks for the assistance.</p>

Don't bother with 2007 macros. The macros changed radically from 2007 to 2010 so its not worth learning them (never was IMHO). Spend your time learning VBA, it can do anything a macro can do and MUCH more.
<div><br />
<div>As for relationships, that is not something that can easily be taught in a book on Access. You need to read up on Normalization and general relational database theory. While both books touch on it, its not too in depth.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>A very basic explanation is that data should exist in one place (table) only. That data is identified by a unique Primary Key). To reference the data you use the PK value as a Foreign key in another table. To illustrate this, take an Order entry application.
 Customers can put in multiple orders. You do not want to enter the customer's info every time they order. So you have a Customer table and the customer info resides only in that table. The Order table has an FK for the CustomerID. You use the FK to relate
 back to the PK in the Customer table to get customer info for the order.</div>

<div>By process of elimination, I have come to a conclusion this is a browser issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
I go to this forum:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.vegasmessageboard.com/forums/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vegasmessageboard.com/forums/index.php</span></a><br />
<br />
I click on "Chat room" on the menu with the slim green background. I am prompted to enter my username and password. It tells me "invalid username or password"<br />
<br />
I contacted a moderator at the site. He told me that usually, if someone is logged in on the message board, there is no prompt to enter a username and password. It takes the user directly to the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The moderator suggested the following:<br />
<br />
"Go here:<br />
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/do...manager07.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.macromedia.com/support/do...manager07.html</a><br />
<br />
click on delete all sites (this clears your cache for your flash player, which the chat room runs on)<br />
<br />
Next, log out of the board by clicking the Logout link above, or this one:<br />
<br />
Delete all your cookies from Internet Explorer<br />
<br />
Close all of your Internet Explorer windows<br />
<br />
Restart Internet explorer and log back into the board."<br />
<br />
It did not work.<br />
<br />
If normally there is no prompt to enter the password,username, something on my browser might be logging me out. I am not sure.&nbsp; This might be a clue.&nbsp; As soon as I click on the chat room button, there is the message "Incorrect username or password."</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try, (assuming IE8)<br />
<br />
Tools&gt;Internet Options - Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default".<br />
<br />
That login page is coded for a non-supported version of Macromedia Flash... the Moderator would probably not know what is going on.. they are not programmers. I would be very(very!) wary.<br />

<h2>            N80 - Suite Sync is broken</h2>
                    I updated the firmware on my N80 to the latest, all well and good. But now PC Suite Sync is broken. Neither the settings button or Sync button does anything. If I go into the sync menu on my N80, there is a PC Suite entry there but it's set to Bluetooth,
 which I don't use (cable), and I can't change it. I tried reinstalling pc suite software to the phone, but still nothing.<br />
<br />
Not a problem at the moment, because I backed up my contacts etc before doing the firmware update. But I usually sync my phone &amp; outlook once a week.<br />
<br />
I've uninstalled PC Suite, Cable Driver, PC Connetivity solution, cleaned registry entries, installed again, still nothing. Everything else works, content copier, Install Apps, just not sync. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Windows Vista Ultimate 32, Outlook 2007, latest PC Suite, Nokia N80 (latest firmware)

            I have exactly the same problem in Vista. However it did used to work and I have not updated the N80 FW recently - so I'm thinking it was probably a PC Suite upgrade that killed it.<br />
<br />
Selecting sync from the phone (using bluetooth or cable) goes through and the phone thinks its happy, but the PC takes no notice of the request. Selecting sync from the PC makes the icon on the system tray flash, but no error reports or anything. The "settings"
 button does not work at all.<br />
<br />
Help!

            I also have more or less the same problem. Running Vista 32 Business, Outlook 2007, PC Suite 6.84.10.3 on a Dell D430 and a Nokia N80.<br />
<br />
When I installed, and in between at odd moments PC Suite says that its connected (goes for both Bluetooth and Cable), but most of the time it says no phone is connected.<br />
Finds and connects with the phone just fine in connection manager.<br />
Although PC Suite claims no phone is connected Storing pictures and Phone browser works fine.<br />
Sync refuses to do anything, since it claims no phone is connected. I can press Select phone, but it doesn't give me anything.<br />
On the rare occation the phone shows as connected, Sync runs just fine, only it really doesn't update anything but notes...<br />
<br />
Anyone recoginize this?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try to register few dll files manually. This files are: FFControl.dll<br />
TIS_BkMrk.dll<br />
TIS_Nokia.dll<br />
TIS_Notes50.dll<br />
TIS_Org50.dll<br />
TIS_Outlook2.dll<br />
TIS_OutlookX.dll<br />
TIS_Synch.dll<br />
TIS_SynchControl.dll<br />
TIS_VistaPIM.dll<br />
TIS_Wadrb.dll<br />
<br />
Those are PC Sync files, maybe there is something wrong on registration. You can register files by:<br />
Open Start-&gt;Run and type: regsvr32.exe "C:\Program Files\Nokia\Nokia PC Suite 6\TIS_BkMrk.dll" and press OK. Do this same to every file mentioned in this discussion. After registering you should reboot computer.<br />
<br />
Does this help?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try registering another way:<br />
1. Browse to folder C:\Windows\System32<br />
2. Search for a file regsvr32.exe and creat a shortcut to your desktop<br />
3. Open properties of this shortcut and look for value Target. Value should be C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe<br />
4. Edit this value to be C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe "C:\Program Files\Nokia\Nokia PC Suite 6\TIS_Synch.dll"<br />
5. Press OK<br />
6. Select shortcut, press mouse 2nd button and select "Run as Admin"<br />
7. Press Continue on "User Account Control" dialog<br />
8. Perform steps 4 to 7 for every file I listed on my last post.<br />
<br />
Does this help? Starting regsvr32.dll this way will Vista give more rights to edit registry.

            Hi, Thanks for the tip, again.<br />
<br />
It did help a bit, in the way that Sync now detected that PC Suite was connected, but synchronizing still gave the same result. Nothing going from the PC to the phone.<br />
<br />
After that, I then reinstalled PC Suite and reinstalled the software on the phone.<br />
Then I created the sync-profile over again in PC Sync.<br />
<br />
This time it was able to synchronize and seems that additions and changes synch perfectly in both directions!<br />
<br />
:)<br />

<h2>            Emails not being recieved.</h2>
                    <p>Since the new, upgraded outlook I have discovered that a number of people are not receiving my emails. These appear to be new email addresses. After a lengthy call with Microsoft technical help I have discovered that I am not the only one who is experiencing
 this although the adviser told me that although I am not the only person experiencing this that&nbsp;the issue is not with Hotmail, instead it is everyone else's email that is faulty! I don't really know where to go from here, as I have to call everyone after I
 have sent them an email to see if they have received it. Very frustrating.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this or can anyone assist in helping me fix it?<br />
THANK YOU!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>We'd like to learn more about your concern. Can you tell us what banner you see in the upper left corner of Outlook? Is it
<strong>Outlook Mail</strong> or <strong>Outlook.com</strong>? Additionally, if your account was just migrated, it might take up to 4 days to complete the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response John.</p>
<p>Again this morning another email sent, and never received. When I called it wasn't even in their&nbsp;junk mail.</p>
<p>My outlook is the new version with the black banner that says Outlook Email, I access it through internet explorer.</p>
<p>My account was migrated a couple of weeks ago, around the same time that my emails seem to have been effected.</p>
<p>Any help you can give would be great, as opening another account will be such a pain, I have had this email address for about 18 years!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Hello. I have same problem i.e my emails are not received from Hotmail.co.uk. Well, that's not completely true. They are received by Btinternet.com but not by aol, gmail, live.co.uk and a couple of others.&nbsp; However, if I include an attachment they get
 through! I also use I.E.&nbsp; I followed advice above and deleted IE cache etc. and tried sending to one email address and it worked OK. I then logged into email from Edge instead of I.E and sent another email which got through OK. I will try more email addresses
 tomorrow. Ive had problems with I.E settings after Windows updates before but nothing as bad as this!&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry

<p>Hi, iggy_az, &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was searching for a solution to the same problem, and when I searched Google, this thread was the first result. It urks me to have found a solution to a problem, and have other people still searching, especially when they are the first result in a search.
 Do unto others... &nbsp; Anyway, here, this is Microsoft's Official solution to the problem.</p>
<p>In windows 7:</p>
<p>If you havent already resolved the issue, you will need to navigate to: C:/program data/microsoft/microsoft security essentials/support/ &nbsp; &gt; &nbsp; then locate the file: "MSSEOOBE.etl" and simply delete it.</p>
<p>Once you&nbsp;restart&nbsp;the computer, MSE will recreate it, and that should resolve the issue. It worked for me at least.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi ShobhitSaxena,</p>
<p>Upon researching about ‘Updating Inbox (3.99GB)’, I found a published article which indicates it’s a known issue that happens when the size of the folder being synchronized is above 4 GB, while the value shown in the status bar has an upper limit of 3.99
 GB. For your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2738323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2738323</a><br />
Please check if the resolutions mentioned in the article work for you.</p>
<p>However, if the issue persists after trying them, I’d like to collect the following information to further investigate the issue:</p>
<p>1. When can you reproduce the issue? Each time Outlook is started or at any time when the program is running?<br />
2. Have you tried <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating a new profile</a>&nbsp;and check if the issue can be replicated in it?</p>
<p>Any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Sam</p>

<h2>            How do I can I install Microsoft Office 2008 on a MacBook Air w&#47; a valid product key, but no CD drive&#63;  Can I download files somewhere&#63;</h2>
                    So, here's my situation...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm working with a brand new MacBook Air. &nbsp;I've got a copy of Microsoft Office 2008 (Home &amp; Student Edition) that needs to get installed. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I forgot to buy some sort of external CD drive for this MacBook Air, and I'm somewhere in the world
 right now where getting one is not an option.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This copy of MO has a valid product key left on it. &nbsp;One solution I've been trying repeatedly tonight has been using the "Remote Disc" trick with a second computer (my regular MacBook Air) - steps outlined
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately, the process keeps failing at random stages in the install process (which I suspect might be due to the wi-fi connection here, but I can't confirm that). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do I have any other options here? &nbsp;Can I download all the necessary files from somewhere official, just plug in my Product Key, and get an install going that way? &nbsp;Are there other options? &nbsp;Help would be much appreciated.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Use of Office 2010 Without Internet Access&#63;</h2>
                    I am helping my 84 year old uncle buy a new laptop and either Office or just Word 2010. He does now not nor does he ever intend to have internet service, so I am wondering if either, but most importantly Word, can be installed and used without internet.
 I know discs can still be purchased but it's been so long since I've used one I don't know if internet access is required. I am also wondering about updates- obviously he will not be getting any, and he does not have an email address to provide for registering
 anything. Will this be a problem?

            <p>You dont need internet access to run Office or Word, accepting Outlook, the mail component)</p>
<p>NB Office Starter, that is preinstalled on some PC's does require a connection.</p>
<p>You would need to use Phone Activation to activate Office or Word</p>
<p>Updates are mainly security updates, and if the PC is not connected, so most would not be of any consequence.</p>
<p>Updates can be obtained via another connected PC though Administrative Updates. ie the full update installation file is downloaded, you save the download, then run that file on the other PC</p>
<p>Registering software is optional, Activation is a requirement</p>

</p><p>The automated system won't allow me to activate my Office 2010 product on my new PC because it's already been used the maximum number of times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I deactivate my Office 2010 product on my previous computers (that I no longer have in my possession)? I did it easily a year or two ago over the phone but this is no longer possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable to see your emails older than two weeks and I'm here to assist you. This may be cause by the emails moved to another page of your inbox that's why you are viewing the latest emails and not the emails older than&nbsp;two weeks.
 I suggest that you try using the page mover just beside the <strong>Go to </strong>
button under the emails list, click the arrow pointing to your right and you will be able to view earlier messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to ask if you have more questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

Richard,
<div><br />
<div>I understand that there are arrows to direct me onto previous pages of emails. However my problem was that I cannot access emails older than 2 weeks. So I go to my oldest email in my inbox and it is from 2 weeks ago. Anything prior to this I would need
 to search for to find using either the senders details or the subject title.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Therefore I would like to know why outlook is auto-archiving my emails and how to stop this so that all of my emails can be seen via the inbox link.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Hi I have same problem as Krishna... really annoying for older emails to be hidden. Cannot find the go to arrow etc. I need to access older emails for legal reasons. Once accessed I'll sort and save them so that I don't have this problem again. 2 weeks is
 too soon to have emails automatically hidden from view. I am not aware of 'choosing' to archive or hide the emails.

<br />
First, you should see 0%, not 0.&nbsp; Format as Percentage with more decimal places.&nbsp; For example, with 2 dp, you should see about -0.37%.<br />
<br />
Second, see the RATE help for an explanation of when it returns the #NUM error.&nbsp; In a nutshell:&nbsp; usually in that case, RATE needs help in the form the 6th "guess" parameter.<br />
<br />
The problem is:&nbsp; how to estimate a "guess"?&nbsp; The fact is:&nbsp; I have seen RATE fail even when I provide the correct periodic rate as a "guess".&nbsp; It is just flaky in that way.<br />
<br />
Oddly, a "guess" of -1% or -10% often works even when RATE should return a positive rate.<br />
<br />
The important thing to note is:&nbsp; RATE computes a periodic interest rate -- whatever the units are for the first parameter ("nper").&nbsp; Ergo, the "guess" must be a periodic interest rate.<br />
<br />
[EDIT] As for why RATE returns a negative rate....&nbsp; It should be a rate between 0.0000000000001% and 0.00000000000012214%.&nbsp;
<br />
If you are computing loan terms and you see a negative rate returned by RATE, the take-away should be:&nbsp; 84.91 is an impractically small periodic payment to retire a loan of 4667.55 over 50 payments.&nbsp; A more reasonable minimum payment would be 93.36, which is
 a periodic rate of about 0.000378% (!).&nbsp; Even that is impractically small, IMHO.<br />

    <title>Start Tiles Backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norman acunis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Tiles Backup</h2>
                    <p>In Win 10 Anniversary, one could back up the appdata folder in users called TileDatalayer and have a backup of start screen tiles. &nbsp;I tested this function in Creator's Update and it does not work. &nbsp;The restore completes fine but the tile I unpinned after
 the backup remained unpinned after the restore. &nbsp;It would seem that the tiles reside elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Norman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just want to clarify, have you also consider performing a system restore? If you haven't, you may check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>to know more information. Refer to the
<strong>Restore from a system restore point </strong>section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it makes any difference.</p>

            System Restore is not what I want to do. I&nbsp; use third party macrium reflect for backup and restore.&nbsp; Folder backup and restore takes 30 seconds versus 9 minutes for full restore.&nbsp; so if you can confirm location of tile data which I documented in Anniversary
 edition.&nbsp; looking for equivalent location in creators update.

<h2>            How to insert picture in insert comment - excel 2010</h2>
                    <hr />
<div>I am trying to show a picture with a mouse over in excel. I tried the hyperlink but I would like the picture to show up with a mouse over and not show on an internet tab. I use Office Home &amp; Student 2010. I type in a name in
 the box than I click new comment. Than I right click and go to format comment and the only box that comes up is the font box. Is the full format comment tabs only in a professional excel or can I download them for 2010? Thanks

    <title>Read-Only Documents from Box, Office 365 Account required - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdmorgan01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Read-Only Documents from Box, Office 365 Account required</h2>
                    <p>I'm able to open doc files from iCloud and Box, but when I open files from Box (from within the Word app) they open as read-only stating that I need an Office 365 account to edit them. &nbsp;I can send the same files from my Box app to Word and edit them just
 fine, but I'm unable to save them back to Box using that method. &nbsp;If I don't need an Office 365 account to open and edit from iCloud, why would I need one for Box?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not going to buy an office 365 subscription. &nbsp;My employer provides my computer and software at work. &nbsp;I did buy a reduced-cost license for Office on my home computer through my employer, but this is only in case I would need to work on work documents
 at home. &nbsp;I have no other use for any Office products. &nbsp;If my employer decides to go with 365, then I'll have that account. &nbsp;Otherwise, it would be downright wasteful for me to have an ongoing expense for something that I personally have little use for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Office Mobile, however, I'm trying to use my iPad as a laptop replacement so it's imperative that I have the app. &nbsp;Specifically, I work with agreements and send and received documents with tracked changes, so I'm stuck with using Word itself rather
 than one of your more-than-capable competitors. &nbsp;I'm even willing to pay an upfront price to buy the Word app with all of its features open, but I will not pay an ongoing subscription cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, having said that, is anyone able to confirm that it is Microsoft's intention to force us to buy a 365 subscription to edit documents from Box, or is this a bug?&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Office Mobile (Android, iOS and Windows) all have free basic consumer editing but premium features and business editing is behind an Office 365 subscription. &nbsp;OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox (consumer only) and local are all considered consumer services, but when
 files are opened from the Document Picker, outside of those services named, we do not know the type of file and thus must assume that it is a business file. &nbsp;We are working on a solution to open up free consumer editing to additional services but this won't
 be coming for a little while. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier in this thread it was mentioned that you can send the file to Office using the 'Open In...' functionality but are unable to save the file back to Box. &nbsp;You are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the confusion!</p>
