<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. We apologize if you're having a hard time coping up with the change (from Hotmail to Outlook.com). I understand that you wish to setup email on your Kindle Fire.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Please be informed that when you use the Kindle Fire Email app, it uses POP or IMAP to connect to your account. POP or IMAP lets you use basic email features such as the ability to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
send and receive email Outlook.com email</a>. By default, the email application of Kindle Fire doesn’t support Exchange ActiveSync that allows connectivity and syncronization between mobile devices and Exchange Servers.

</p><p><span>A quick question before we proceed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you get any error message? If yes, what is the complete error message?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s restart the computer and then open the Excel in Safe Mode again and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do that, press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the Run open box type in ‘Excel /safe’ and hit ok. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: There is a space between Excel and /.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If application safe mode works, try disabling the add-ins associated with Office applications and check.</span></p>

    <title>Renumber WBS Codes for &#34;Selected Tasks&#34; forces renumber for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertp2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Renumber WBS Codes for &#34;Selected Tasks&#34; forces renumber for &#34;Entire Project&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a project file with a custom WBS code. When I select tasks and choose "WBS Renumber" and select "Selected Tasks" I get a message saying:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You have selected WBS code renumbering for the entire project". </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the same exact message I get if I choose to renumber the entire project. I have expanded all my sub tasks and have selected sequential tasks and I've sorted by ID. I've seen postings for previous versions of Project that have the opposite problem
 (where renumbering for the entire project doesn't work)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Is there something that prevents me from renumbering only selected Tasks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Is there a way to prevent a task from being assigned a WBS Code? I have a subproject for my resources on the first line and that gets assigned the first WBS Code, making all the other WBS Codes "1 more" than it should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>When I asked the question I was prompted to select that, so I assumed it would show up with my question. Oops. I'm using Project 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to create a macro with the following&nbsp;and it works as expected (passing False indicates only Selected Tasks should be renumbered):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WBSCodeRenumber All:=False</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use the following line, which brings up the dialog in the same way as using the pull-down menu, I get the same issue where choosing "Selected Tasks" still renumbers the entire project:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WBSCodeRenumber</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created a brand new project with 2 milestones and 3 tasks each and I am able to reproduce the issue I'm having.</p>

    <title>Account Recovery Form Rejected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> payton_tag7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Recovery Form Rejected</h2>
                    So I currently have two Facebook accounts, one of which I have not had access to for 4 years. This happened at Melbourne airport when I connected to the WiFi and somehow my passwords were changed to Facebook and my Hotmail account I was using at the time.
 I have not had access to either since and needed to create a new email address (Yahoo) and a new Facebook account.<br />
<br />
At the time I completed two recovery e-forms for my Hotmail account, both of which were rejected. A while back I tried a Facebook verification thing which didn't work. I decided to try the e-form again today twice (361406456 &amp; 361408387), both of which were
 not successful. I know the security question is my favourite historical figure, which I can't seem to get the answer to (probably because I made the thing in high school and would've put something stupid).<br />
<br />
Anyway, it has been really confusing having the two accounts (friends contacting the one I no longer have access to and me missing their messages/emails being sent to my old Hotmail account) and frustrating that it won't be deleted.<br />
<br />
I tried a live chat for password specialists, but they charge money and I don't trust them. I can't find any contact details for Hotmail. I have found my way onto here through scouring the internet. Please help!

            Hi Payton_Tag7,
<br />
<br />Try to reset password for your hotmail following this guide: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026971/microsoft-account-how-to-reset-your-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402697...</a>
<br />
<br />Remember that if you didn't log in in your account longer )more that 365 day) all emails are gone. 
<br />
<br />For getting an access back to the account you should be able to provide enough info about your profile / account history etc, if you didn't use account longer it would be hard.
<br />

<h2>            Lost emails in switch to Outlook. VERY ANGRY&#33;</h2>
                    When I was switched to Outlook with no warning I lost all my emails, every one and a lot of it was very important to me such as family history with photos that came from overseas. As it happens I was already in the process of moving them over to my gmail
 as want to delete my hotmail anyway but Microsoft got in first and ruined everything and won't respond to my emails. When I called them on tthe phone they said they could probably help me at a cost of £60! &nbsp;I told them I wasn't paying to solve a problem that
 I didn't create in the first place! &nbsp;I just find it hard to believe that in this computer age that they cannot retrieve my lost emails!

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>“By upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox. However, if your emails were over 270 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity
 in account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before rename, you can try to recover some of the deleted messages yourself (Link to recover deleted messages is under DELETED folder),
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please refer to the provided liink: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Deleted email messages</span></a><span>.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked you – ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under ‘Folders’. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Another reason why some users aren’t able to see old emails after rename is when their account was hacked and the hacker had already deleted emails in their account before their renamed the account.</span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Thanks!</span></span></p>

I "switched" to Outlook earlier this year and everything (inbox, sent ,etc) seemed to work transparently.&nbsp; About 10 days ago, when I clicked on the "outlook" button it sent me to a log in page (user name and password) -&nbsp; surprising, since it never asked for
 this before.&nbsp; I tried using my regular log in and pw and after a while it kicked me off and went through all kinds of machinations.&nbsp; Finally I established a new outlook accoun, which I am using to compose this email,&nbsp;but now seem to have lost my previous emails
 which included contacts, photos, tickets, tracking numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I port over the original email or have I lost them forever?</p>

<p>Dear Nathan,</p>
<p>Sorry, I was preoccupied in the past few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see. What I did was:</p>
<p>1. Download from Microsoft office link</p>
<p>2. Sign-in using my University ID</p>
<p>
</p><p>That could be the case since, although I installed it myself, it is part of Microsoft education&nbsp;thingi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to check with my colleagues and perhaps ask my admin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will update once I have the info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            reported error &#40;0x8004210A&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Task *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Receiving' reported error (0x8004210A) : 'The operation timed out waiting for a response from the receiving (POP) server. If you continue to receive this message, contact your server administrator or Internet
 service provider (ISP).<span>&nbsp; </span>The server responded: -ERR internal server error (6532)'</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have about 8 email addresses configured to Outlook.&nbsp; Only two of them @sbcglobal.net get the above message.&nbsp; I have Outlook check for messages every minute so sometimes I don't get the above error and Outlook checks messages without
 any issues and sometimes the script pops up asking to enter a login and password.&nbsp; I'll hit ok and then it's fine.&nbsp; This issue happens a dozen times an hour more or less.&nbsp; Passwords are fine obviously.&nbsp; Other emails I have are @yahoo.com and @charter.net.&nbsp;
 I also own 3 websites with emails that use the server @secureserver.net.&nbsp; Sometimes the above issue happens with @charter.net but maybe a&nbsp; few times a day.&nbsp; So virtually all other email addresses I do not have an issue with.</p>
<p>I've done quite a bit of troubleshooting.&nbsp; I deleted the profile and started a new one.&nbsp; Still the same above error.&nbsp; I configured the @sbcglobal.net with Windows Live Mail and I get the same error.&nbsp; I went on my other pc and did the
 same thing, same error.</p>
<p>I call AT&amp;T and had them test my emails.&nbsp; The used both of my @sbcglobal.net email and configured into their email clients and they said they didn't have any problems.&nbsp; My email settings are configured properly.&nbsp; This started happening
 just over two months ago, I had no issues prior.</p>
<p>I honestly do not know what's wrong and it's rather annoying.&nbsp; I normally don't rely on help in forums as I can mostly do everything myself, but this just makes me pulling my hair out as I don't even have a clue what's causing this.</p>
<p>I think AT&amp;T has an issue with their server or maybe not.&nbsp; It's leading me to believe it's an AT&amp;T problem as my other emails are ok.&nbsp; AT&amp;T says they have no idea what the issue is as they say everything is fine on their end, then they
 refer me to another department to purchase additional support to help me out with Outlook.&nbsp; I believe it's not Outlook.</p>
<p>So if anyone has any clue on what's going on with these @sbcglobal.net email accounts I would greatly appreciate it.<br />

            I've already read so many suggestions, if I knew the above was the case I wouldn't be posting. Yes there have been recent changes and updates, but that is not the issue.&nbsp; Keep in mind this is happening on my other pc which I seldom use.&nbsp; It was doing it
 on my other pc before and after I did a clean reinstall of windows.&nbsp; So nope, changes to computer is not the issue.<br />
<br />
As for the scanning feature.&nbsp; That is not the issue either.&nbsp; Why all of a sudden it's I'm having this issue two months ago and only for the two email addresses ending in @sbcglobal.net.&nbsp; Plus, I never had this issue before and I use a virus scanning feature
 for several years now.&nbsp; Nope that is not the issue.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else know the issue, possibly someone who think it's not the above?&nbsp; Preferably someone who knows what they are talking about.<br />

Well unless you mention exactly what are the steps you have tried, i am sure there is no way to know that.<br />
Also if you are not sure that it is not a system specific issue, obviously it is not an issue with Outlook, isn't it?<br />

            Ummm... we're not there and can't see your screen. Is this a split database (a Frontend with the forms, queries, reports and code) linked to a Backend with just the tables)? If so what did you move - the front or back end? How are you attempting to open
 the database? Can you find the accdb file (or files) using Windows Explorer?

<h2>            EXCEL Freezes and&#47;or is slow to fill in cells - and then randomly closes and all not saved lost</h2>
                    <p>I am about ready to stop using Office 365. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it three times already to try to fix this problem, so please don't tell me to try that (again).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using EXCEL, I have 3 major problems which I never had with any other Office version(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>When clicking or tabbing to a cell, it literally takes 3-4 seconds before I can type in that cell.
</li><li>When copying and pasting, it literally takes 1-2 minutes and about 50% of the time Excel will just crash when doing more than 2-3 cut/copy pastes in a row.</li><li>Manual saves (I save after every 2-3 cell changes/inputs) take literally 30 seconds-1 minute.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me what may be wrong. I have no other issues with my new Sony laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WIN 8 (afraid to upgrade to 8.1); 4 gigs RAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I open IE and go to my bank or credit card website, and then fill in cells on my budget spread sheet (one for each month of the year in one book) and the above problems occur every, single time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am about ready to go back to Office 2010.<br />

    <title>MS Publisher Font&#47;Line Spacing Issue with every Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shaunc78  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Publisher Font&#47;Line Spacing Issue with every Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 8, and now with Windows 10, we've encountered an issue with every single update that Windows rolls out where the paragraph and font spacing/kerning in text boxes shrinks, leaving about 20% more empty space in the text box.&nbsp; Needless
 to say, this throws off formatting of files, especially when aligned with graphics (which don't change their position on the page with this issue).&nbsp; It's become an annoyance that we just anticipate every time that infamous blue screen appears with a Windows
 update.&nbsp; This has happened consistently since the release of Windows 8 and has continued through 8.1 and 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if it's the way fonts are recognized and rendered from the operating system or what the deal is, but we use Publisher for our weekly church bulletins, and the file goes between 3 of us on staff each week.&nbsp; When the "font issue" creeps on to
 one of our machines, the formatting looks very different on that person's screen, so that when they try to "fix" the spacing and send it on to one of us without the issue, we have to "fix" it again.&nbsp; It's particularly noticeable when we have musical responses
 pasted into the service at particular times.&nbsp; When the spacing issue occurs, sometimes the music ends up in a completely different spot due to the line spacing shifting.&nbsp; Where the title of the song was originally right above the music, after the update, it
 can be as many as 3 or 4 lines above where it was supposed to be and the music then appears in the middle of a spoken response, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After months of searching online a year or 2 back, the only solution that I've found that works is to have the Windows 7 default fonts saved in a folder on the machine.&nbsp; You copy and paste those fonts into the regular C://Windows/Fonts directory, making
 sure to check that it's ok to replace the fonts (all 426 of them), and magically when you open Publisher again, the font spacing is back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why Microsoft hasn't put out a fix for this as it literally happens to all 3 of our computers every time Windows runs an update.&nbsp; I've probably run this fix 5 or 6 times between my desktop and laptop over the past 2 years and we've done the
 same on the other 2 staff members' machines.&nbsp; We have over 10 years worth of files that we refer back to when planning our services and newsletters, and without this little "fix," opening those older files is like a guessing game as to what will show up on
 screen.</p>

<p>When MSFT introduced Win8 Publisher users found that text rendered a different size than it did in Win7 and older. This meant that if you opened a Pub file that was created on a Win7 machine or older, on a Win8 or Win10 machine with Pub 2010 or newer you
 had a formatting and layout issue as you described. If you used Pub 2010 or newer on a Win8 or Win10 machine the one workaround we found was to install Win7 fonts. You could run Pub 2007 and 2003 on Win10 and the formatting was preserved. Here is just one
 reference that describes this text size issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>July 2015 - Reference: Publisher 2007 and Publisher 2013 paginates differently:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-publish/publisher-2007-and-publisher-2013-paginates/2ff3812a-5874-46dd-8c57-87aa3f86a321">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-publish/publisher-2007-and-publisher-2013-paginates/2ff3812a-5874-46dd-8c57-87aa3f86a321</a>&nbsp;- Well tested and documented thread showing the text rendering issue continues in Win10, but is
 limited to Pub 2013 and probably 2010. If you install Pub 2007 or 2003 in Win10, Win8, Win7, WinVista or WinXP then the files still render text the same and are cross OS compatible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on what you are reporting the Win7 fonts are now being replaced/updated every time you do a Win10 update. That is new information and if true then I fear the Win7 font workaround is no longer viable. Your only recourse is to reformat and tweak
 the layout of your old files using the new Win10 fonts and text size. This also means that everyone that edits that file must be using Win10 or Win8 machines and Pub 2010 or newer as the newly formatted files will not render correctly on Win7 or older machines.

<p>Well, I have 91.003 running on E72 since a year or so and it worked with it fine before.&nbsp;Nokia Software Recovery Tool only offers to reinstall the complete firmware which I am a bit reluctat to do - takes time to set everything back. I have no such thing
 as Settings » Current region » under FM radio settings, only "atlernative frequencies" and "access point". Why would the region matter for FM radio?&nbsp;Two more things. If I start tunning it never ends, at least on the time scale of ~10 min. Another maybe unimportant
 detail, the icons for radio app are different on E52 and E72 although they run same firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is more probable reason for this, a hardware or a software issue? Thanks.</p>

<p>The Nokia Software Recovery Tool does a reset plus a reinstall of all software/firmware components (Refurbish). It is like taking a phone&nbsp;out of the sales box, software wise. That rules out all software issue. If you go for a backup via the

<p>Interesting, because I double-checked with my Nokia E72 before I posted. In the Nokia Software Recovery Tool, your Nokia Product Code is displayed. Which one do you have?</p>

<p>Thanks for the effort.</p>

<p>I realized that there is no Settings &gt;&gt; Current region if&nbsp;the phone is&nbsp;connected to the network, only when offline. Nevertheless I went through the whole procedure as suggested -backup, reinstall latest firmware from scratch with Nokia Software Recovery
 Tool and the problem remains. So I guess it must be hardware related.</p>

<h2>            Read Only in Microsoft Word &#40;Office 2010 Pro Plus&#41;</h2>
                    I am the sole user of this Laptop but I keep having the problem of not being able to edit a file as it has somehow become Read Only. I have seen ways to get out of this but it is still annoying. It would be really helpful if I could fine a way in which
 I can set to programme to never save any file as read only. Thanks.

            Sorry to say Suvarna that No, it didn't work after all. I tried this with several folders. Some had a triple choice for Read Only being Blank square, Filled in Square or a tick in the square. Each time I did this, I went back to the folder again and clicked
 Properties and the square was again filled in instead of being empty. Ah! As I was writing this I realised there was something I hadn't tried. So I went back into the folders and clicked on Properties for the individual files and they didn't have the Read
 Only square filled in, so I assume they are not. Annoying that it still says in the title at the top that it is Read Only. And here we go again. I thought I'd try actually editing one of these files and was not allowed to do so because I got a popup to say
 that the file was Read Only. AAAAAAGGHH! Isn't it frustrating? Any more ideas please? Thanks.

            Sorry Stephan but I don't get an icon with the file. There is a Word icon but when I put the cursor on the file, the whole thing, including the icon is highlighted. If I right click that I get the Properties selection but that only gives the Read Only
 option as described above. I don't know if this might be of use but if, in Properties, I click Advanced, I get a tick beside "File is ready for archiving" and another beside "Allow this file to have its contents indexed in addition to file properties". Thanks
 for getting back.

            This is driving me crazy. I'm trying to write a sermon but every time I add something new and try to save it I can't because it says it is Read Only. I create a new file, a blank word document. When I&nbsp;write into that and save it in my file for such things,
 it says I don't have permission to save to that file. I'm coping by saving everything to a flash drive but I don't know what will happen when I try to print it out.

</p><p>Are you saying that this happens for all files that you create on your hard drive? If so, there may be a problem with file/folder permissions on your drive.</p>

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
To narrow down the issue, please perform the following action items:<br />
1. Check whether the same issue happens to other users?<br />
2. Ask the file owner to direct print the PowerPoint file to OneNote, and check the outcome.<br />
3. Create a new PowerPoint file in your language (Swedish), then save it as PDF and “Send to OneNote”.<br />
4. Create a new PowerPoint file in English, then save it as PDF and “Send to OneNote”.<br />
<br />
Let us know if there is any update.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jiaxing

<p>hi nick,</p>
<p>i would like to know if you want to add some columns to the library view. if so, it is right to do that via the
<strong>ellipsis</strong> menu <strong>&gt; modify this view</strong> as you mentioned. for more details, please refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>1. go to the library, then click the <strong>ellipsis</strong> or click the <strong>
modify view</strong> in the<strong> library</strong> ribbon.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1da3b828-ef4c-4aaa-951d-c37d5514cba3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d1da3b828-ef4c-4aaa-951d-c37d5514cba3" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. check the columns you want to add to the view as below:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=517312ca-bc66-4668-a577-e572f86a078a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d517312ca-bc66-4668-a577-e572f86a078a" /></a></p>
<p>we can also create a new column in the site so that we can select it when modifying library view. more details can be found in the article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-us/article/create-change-or-delete-a-column-in-a-list-or-library-2b0361ae-1bd3-41a3-8329-269e5f81cfa2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 create, change, or delete a column in a list or library</a>.</p>
<p>if there is anything misunderstood or unclear, please let us know. </p>
<p>regards,<br />

<h2>            Outlook not sending emails to addresses not on Contacts List</h2>
                    <p>I have scoured the internet for answer, and it looks like a ton of people have this same problem but NO ONE has provided a legitimate solution. In other Microsoft posts, some techs have been dismissive and saying its user error. Please do not dismiss this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type any new email address into the "To" field, I cannot send the message. I get a 'Cannot connect to server' message, and the draft remains unsent. But I send/receive other emails just fine. After typing the email into the To field,&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I do not want to add these one-time email addressess to my Contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) However, in an effort to get around the problem, I attempt to add the address to my Contact List. It will not let me.</p>
<p>3) It is a valid email address. I logged into my Outlook.com account and sent the message just fine from there. (But I should not have to do this.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a problem since I subscribed to Outlook 365 one year ago and started using Outlook on my new laptop. I've been logging into Outlook.com as a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! Very very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            All those Microsoft cloud services are not that slow as they were 2 years ago
<div>BUT</div>
<div>still E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G on desktop works snail pace, you need to have another feeling of time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And I know WHY;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft on purpose make such snail-pace enviroment not to cannibilse its desktop products.</div>
<div>Because all other cloud, SaS-es works much much faster, but Microsoft is unable to coide properly itys cloud? No, of course not unable. UNWILLING!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Desktop clouds with whatever dL/UL speed, say DL 10-20MBits and up, UL 1-10Mbits hardly useable (unless you adapt to snail's timepace..)</div>
<div>(my favourite LIVE services speed test is not on Calendar but on Outllok mail - to move say 400 emails from Junk to Inbox it takes rougly FIVE MINUTES - ha ha ha - sorry . It is not about anything on customer's end, it is about purposeful coding- after
 3 minutes, you got messages "200 mails are moved" - I exepct such operation to be fullfilled iwthin 5-15 seconds?).</div>
<div><br />
<div>But MSoft shoot itself in the leg with such spitting in the face of customers.</div>

            <p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; As mentioned in my question, I have already checked that I am using the most up-to-date version of my browser (IE9 for Vista operating system), and Microsoft Silverlight.&nbsp; I had also cleared the cache and temporary internet
 files.&nbsp; As it happens I was using a friend's laptop at the very moment I discovered my Hotmail had been "upgraded" to Outlook.&nbsp; This is a very new laptop with Windows 8 and, I assume, the most up-to-date browser (although I no longer have access to the laptop
 in order to check this, and my friend doesn't understand how to do it).&nbsp; The problem occurred on this&nbsp;very new laptop and also on my older laptop.&nbsp; The problem only occurs with Outlook calendar - Outlook email is OK, and all other websites are OK, and&nbsp;the
 problem&nbsp;started the instant I was "upgraded" from Hotmail Calendar (which worked perfectly) to Outlook Calendar.&nbsp; This cannot be a coincidence.&nbsp; Does anyone have any other suggestions please?</p>

            If you think the calendar is slow on your laptop/desktop, wait until you try it on a tablet (like my Samsung ATIV tab with Windows RT on it. And obviously latest version of IE10. I imagine it performs about the same as the Surface.).&nbsp;
<div>I can't open the settings without IE hanging and I constantly get "long-running script" alerts asking me to either cancel it or wait.

            ... actually I found that all those Microsoft cloud services works OK from my iPadMini and from Safari browser... WebApps/Skydrive are very nice and FAST and responisve. At the same time SkydriveApp for iOS sucks a big time in terms of viewing files.
<div><br />
<div>given all the other performance facts mentioned above, it sounds very weird, I still coroborate my conspiracy assumption, that MS on purpose makes its cloud service be slow to create stimulus to buy MS desktop software.</div>
<div>But for iOS probably MSoft made execption, as this market is so big and important.</div>

Autorecovery in Excel is useful only in the event of a crash while working on a file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you save a workbook the temp file created while you are working goes away and there is no chance of recovery in that case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upgrade to Windows 7 to get access to multiple past versions of files.</p>

                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have installed Office 97 from a old CD on my computer and when I try to run MS Outlook, the pop-up will appear. It says, that there is not default software to do this action. If it is installed, choose it from Default Programs in Start. Then I click
 OK and another pop-up says : Cannot start Microsoft Office.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I DON'T want to upgrade to newer versions, because I'm a one fan of old things. So, don't send me these kind of questions, please !!!</div>
<div>The version of Windows doesn't matter. I want only the solution of this problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me</div>
<div>Thanks for future replies</div>

<p>hi mchv2.0,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to turn off mobile view, you may try the following steps and check the outcome:</p>
<p>open the sharepoint site in the browser&gt;click the gear in the upper right corner of the site&gt; tap site settings.&gt;under site actions, tap manage site features.&gt;set the mobile browser view to deactivate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you still can view in mobile view, please switch back to pc view by referring to switch between mobile and full-screen view section in

<p>Hi Mchv2.0,</p>
<p>Have you tried creating a device channel?</p>
<p>Here are the steps.<br />
1. On your SharePoint site go to the site settings.<br />
2. Open Device Channels, it is located under Look and Feel.<br />
3. Add a new item to the list. <br />
4. For all mobile devices fill the Device inclusion rules with: $FallbackMobileUserAgents;<br />
5. Go to the site Settings and open Mater Pages, it is located under Look and Feel.<br />
6. Set your desired master page to show on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Please let us know your updates at your convenience.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Cliff</p>

<p>1. The mobile device, operating system version and browser version you use when experiencing the issue.<br />
2. Have you tried with different browsers and mobile devices?<br />
3. Have you tried on different SharePoint Online sites?</p>
<p><br />
Besides, I’d like to collect some information about your tenant for further investigation. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect it. You can access the it via this link:

<p>Hi Mchv2.0,</p>
<p>After setting up device channels for a site, the mobile view of the default mater page may not take effect as the mater pages set up for the device channels are prior to the default mater page. Therefore, you can also use the device channels to enforce your
 custom mater page for selected devices.</p>
<p>Besides, you can set up device channels no matter you turn off the mobile view off or not.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

    <title>Bug&#63; Getting Excel to stop adding Normal 2 style - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bug&#63; Getting Excel to stop adding Normal 2 style</h2>
                    <p>This isn't new to Excel 2016, but the issue persists.<br />
<br />
I have a book.xlt and sheet.xlt template in my Excel startup folder so when I create new workbooks or add new sheets, they pull from my templates to print settings and other preferences are already there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is, when I add a new sheet to a workbook created from my book.xlt file, I get a "Normal 2" style. I know for a fact the "Normal" style in book.xlt and sheet.xlt are identical because I simply created one workbook the way I wanted it and saved it
 twice, once as book and once as sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sometimes add more sheets and not get additional styles ("Normal 3" or "Normal 2 1") and sometimes I do. I actually have a StyleKill macro I run occasionally to get rid of all non-standard Excel styles, but this should't be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to prevent this, or is this just a bug in Excel I have to work around until they do fix it?</p>

            <p>I started with a blank Excel workbook. I deleted Sheets 2 and 3 because I only want one sheet in new workbooks. I turned off gridlines, and I preconfigured a number of print settings (landscape, fit all columns to a page, headers, footers, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I saved the file as book.xltx (I incorrectly said book.xlt in the OP) and saved it to&nbsp;C:\Users\usernam\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\book.xltx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then copied that file to the same folder and named it sheet.xltx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I create a new workbook via File|New, or add a new sheet with the plus symbol where the tabs are, it uses my templates.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of saving files in Start up folder try to create Excel Template file by following the article below and check if issue persist.</p>

No. Storing book.xltx and sheet.xltx there totally breaks the intended functionality. When you put them there, they do not get used when creating new workbooks or adding sheets to existing workbooks. The XLSTART folder is special in that regard. It is also
 where the Personal.xlsb file is to be stored.

            <p>You are absolutely correct. I am disturbed that a MS support engineer does not know about the use of Book.xltx and Sheet.xltx.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I asked you to use Template is to check if any Add-in is creating this issue and to check whether it persist on Templates as well. We tried to reproduce the issue but we could not reproduce it. You may try to disable Add-ins and check if issue
 persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
