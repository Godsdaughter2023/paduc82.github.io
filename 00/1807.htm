<h2>            Difficulty with mic while using Skype</h2>
                    With the new version of skype my voice does not carry to the other party. Repeated attempts with Echo and sound service gives me the message there is something wrong with your mic system. But when I test with voice recognition the mic works fine. What
 can be the problem?

    <title>How to get rid of Office 365 and install local Office 2016&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to get rid of Office 365 and install local Office 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>a few months ago I made the biggest mistake of my life: I signed up for Office 365 and installed Office 2016 on my Macbook. However, those never ending connections to MS servers really **** me off. I HATE cloud-based software, so I really regret having signed
 up for it.</p>
<p>In addition I do not want Outlook but it is installed every time using up disk space I don't want to waste for that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, today I purchased a key card for Office 2016 Mac Home and Student and downloaded the installer file using the serial number that came on the key card. After having installed it on my Macbook the first thing I saw was: Outlook is installed again!
 ****? I bought the version without Outlook. Second thing I saw was Little Snitch telling me that this damn Office365Service tried to go online again. I DID NOT WANT OFFICE 365 ON MY MACBOOK! How is that possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I immediately terminated the Office 365 subscription but cannot get rid of that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how I get a local installation of Office 2016 Home and Student on Mac - and get finally rid of Office 365. Is there a something like an ISO I can download and burn, to install Office 2016 locally?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>But how do I install Office Home and Student? I have no installer file. All I can download from office.com/myaccount is the file Office_2016_install.pkg or something, which I have already installed and which installs Outlook also (it is the same file I get
 when I download the Office 365 package, which I do not want!). </p>

            Are you sure that you aren't copying them to the SIM card instead?<br />
<br />
A sim can only store a relatively small amount of contacts.

<h2>            2710c-2 Firmware 9.69&#58; Invalid entries in my call log</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>since I updated my 2710c-2 to 9.69 and reseted it I have invalid entries in my call log (when I press call button), there are names without date and time, and I can not delete them, gives me always an error "Eingabe ungültig" in German, means something like
 "Input invalid" or "request invalid".</p>
<p>Can you help me?</p>
<p>Even resetting does not help and reflashing the firmware with Nokia Software Updater or Ovi Suite does not either.</p>

<p>I am having exactly the same problems, having updated to 9.69 from 9.67. There are now random entries in the call log which cannot be deleted - either there is no delete option in the option menu, or a 'Invalid selection' message is displayed. Deleting the
 entire log also does nothing to clear these entries.</p>
<p>There is evidently a bug in the new software. Hopefully Nokia will take action to rectify this but somehow I am not holding my breath.</p>
<p>By the way, Nokia’s firmware updating process is just short of scandalous, requiring multiple restarts, freezing during updating, requiring the usb cable to be taken out and put back into the phone a number of times ect – I was pretty sure it would end up
 bricking up my phone.</p>
<p>PS. What exactly are the supposed benefits of v. 9.69 vs 9.67? Can’t say I saw any obvious advantages of the new firmware…</p>

as far as the update requiring removing &amp; reconnecting the cable many u indeed are lucky that u didn't brick ur phone. Though the msg pop's up that it has disconnected there is also a notification at the start of update which states that u r required to ignore
 such msg.

<p>As of today no new firmware updates are available, so as 2710c-2 owners are still stuck with the buggy 9.69.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the the upgrade process, I only unplugged my phone when after what's seemed like eternity an error message appeared saying the update process was unsuccessfull.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all Nokia needs to get their act together, have been using Nokia since forever, but my next&nbsp;phone will no doubt be something else. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Magnus,</p>
<p>Since the contact information in Exchange Online is managed as properties of the recipients, which is different from the user profiles in SharePoint Online and Azure AD, we can’t sync it to SharePoint Online. If you need to transfer the properties massively,
 you may need to use some scripts to export the recipient details in Exchange Online and then import to SharePoint Online user profiles. If you need help on this, we suggest you turn to our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=scripting&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Can SuperAntispyware Pro coexist with Microsoft Security Essentials - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can SuperAntispyware Pro coexist with Microsoft Security Essentials both running in real time protection mode</h2>
                    <p><span>I have been running them both in "Real time protection mode" and was recently told by I YOGI technician that both could not run
 in real time protection mode on my laptop. I was then recommended to delete the Superantispyware and only use the Microsoft Security essentials but find the Microsoft product on its own does not adequately protect my computer. Then out of the blue today I
 got a call from a technician from Tech4PC who told me that the International routing system told them that I had several Polymorphic viruses on my computer he went as far as giving me my Windows CLSID license number from my system and taking me to my Task
 manager to show me how many error logs I had in order to convince my he was working with Microsoft in order to sell me his cleanup services. After this call I reloaded my Superantivirus software to work alongside my Microsoft Security Essentials software.
 Wow what a mess!<span>&nbsp; </span>Any ideas and or comments?</span></p>

That's how it's <em>supposed to work</em> in IE9, IE8 (and earlier) in all Windows versions.</p>
<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Did Win7 come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7, or did you upgrade from Vista to Win7?
</p>
<p>2a. Is Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (already) installed? See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Which version of the Windows operating system am I running?<br />

</p>
<p>2b. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?&nbsp; See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />

<p>3. Does the behavior persist if you start IE in No Add-ons mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; <strong>Start | (All) Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Internet Explorer (No add-ons)</strong></p>
<p>[Note:&nbsp;Disabling all Add-ons is <em>not</em> the same&nbsp;thing as opening IE in&nbsp;No Add-ons mode!]</p>
<p>4. Does the behavior persist after you Reset IE Advanced settings &amp; reboot?<br />

<p>5. What's the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite
<em>and when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>6. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>7. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>8. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>

Does your ISP offer a (free) Norton or McAfee "security suite" (e.g., Norton Security Suite; McAfee Security Center) or...?</p>
<p>I'm only asking because Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not uninstalling or upgrading cleanly &amp; there's a specific removal tool you MUST download/run&nbsp;BEFORE installing any other security application (even another Norton application).</p>

Hello, Oldman22,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what is known as a "ByDesign" feature of Internet Explorer</p>
<p>The folder remains open until you close it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make it easy</p>
<p>Use keyboard</p>
<p>Alt+C opens Favorites</p>
<p>Down arrow to navigate to folder</p>
<p>Right Arrow to Open</p>
<p>Left Arrot to close</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use the above shortcuts, Alt+C returns you to the folder you selected and opened. Left Arrow will close it and down arrow or up arrow will take you to the next folder to open with right arrow.</p>
<p>This will continue as you use Favorites.&nbsp; The last opened folder will appear when you re-open Favorites.&nbsp; Using the left arrow, you can close it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using down or up arrow you navigate to next folder.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp;setting up the Excel file for Gage R&amp;R studies and I ran into a problem with being able to update the ANOVA table as values change. I am trying to create a macro for it, but I am running into a problem where I get an error message that the ANOVA table
 doesn't have an input range. How do I fix this?</p>

<p>If you are using the analysis toolpak to build your ANOVA table, it is static.&nbsp; It isn't built with formulas so you have to rerun it with a new definition for the source data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, if you look up the the proper formulas, you could recreate the table with excel built in formulas in each cell and make those formulas dynamic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Eliza
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which Antivirus utility do you have installed? Can you try disabling it temporarily to see if the apps work?
<br />
<br />Also, try launching each Office application in safe mode to see if they work. If they do, its possibly a bad add in.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-o...</a>
<br />
<br />Press the windows key + R and write the command to open the office app in error, below are the commands to open all office apps:
<br />
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK. 
<br />
<br />Disable add ins:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the problem persists:
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try running the applications again. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a repair install:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

<h2>            My computer is running out of space. Nothing is different from before when this was not a problem.</h2>
                    How do you determine if someone else is accessing your computer? I spoke to a private investigator and he said that someone else accessing your computer creates a space problem.&nbsp; He said if you are constantly having a space problem that someone could be
 accessing your computer. My computer is constantly out of disk space for the last few weeks and this was not a problem I had in the past. I have taken programs off to create space and the problems come back right away. I run security essentials scans several
 times a week.

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll deal with the possibility of infection shortly, but first let's rule out a simple matter of some unexpected or unintended change that may be causing the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my little blurb on improving space and speed in Vista or Windows 7 systems – and some can apply to XP as well but the reference articles and procedures will be different but you should be able to either figure out how to do what is suggested on XP
 or search Bing for an article which addresses that topic for XP or an equivalent program that works with XP (and it also suggests other things of value that you can consider or ignore - the choice is entirely yours). All of this is your choice, actually -
 I'm just presenting some options that may help and that have helped many others (and that I pretty much use myself though sometimes I do procrastinate I'm sad to admit and there are some things I won't do no matter how beneficial - for example, I refuse to
 delete my cookies (but that's a personal choice as I prefer the benefits of having them when going to previously-visited web sites over the limited amount of space recovered and speed gained given their small size)). Much of this should be part of normal maintenance,
 but that includes some other things (like creating periodic system restore points - probably at least weekly as they don't necessarily improve speed, space or performance and may in fact even do the opposite in some cases) not addressed here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system. There are ways to handle this (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course
 the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at
 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM (well, almost 4GB, more like 3.5 actually) and the 64-bit version can use even more). If space
 is the issue, replace your hard drive with a larger one, add a second hard drive (if it is a desktop system), or add an external hard drive. Those are hardware answers (which cost money). We'll now discuss software solutions (which are mostly if not entirely
 free - at least the options presented here - there are 3rd party programs that provide additional options but they really aren't necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster or Enhancer, or Repairer or Fixer software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you have thousands of errors just to get you to download
 and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause). Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install
 to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise). Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
To improve your speed and space, do Disk Cleanup using: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</a><span> in Vista or </span>
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/818-disk-cleanup-open-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Disk Cleanup - Open and Use - Windows 7 Forums</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will
 harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files. If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then
 that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</a><span> in Vista or
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Optimize-Windows-7-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Optimize Windows 7 for better performance</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Do all of the options (or at the very least, consider
 them - many can help a great deal).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least once every month or so, run CCleaner <a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.piriform.com/</span></a> with as many options as you choose to delete (but be
<strong><span>careful</span></strong> because this program if not used properly and with caution and with you paying attention to what you are doing can delete important and even critical files that could cause a great deal of trouble).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Uncheck anything in the Registry section and in the Application Section, uncheck Microsoft Antimalware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clearing out your temporary files can also save you much space and improve performance and while some of the above will clear a lot of the temp files, they won't cover them all. This will. I recommend running it every month or two. It is TFC by Old
 Timer </span><a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/TFC-Temp-File-Cleaner-OldTimer-file187.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TFC - Temp File Cleaner by OldTimer - Geeks to Go Forums</span></a><span> and you should download and save it to your desktop. When run,
 it will close everything else, so be sure to save anything you're working on and basically close all your programs. If it asks (and when done even if it doesn't ask), reboot to complete the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced. It's a trade-off. The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points you will be able to retain -but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough
 to save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them). Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html</a></span><span> in Vista or
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/5482/make-system-restore-use-less-space-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/5482/make-system-restore-use-less-space-in-windows-7/</span></a></span><span> in Windows 7.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears. Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup. That will probably be the majority of items there - if
 not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient). This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup). When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary,
 I noticed startup was quicker, response times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster. Better still, download Autoruns
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you
</p>
</span><strong><span>can’t</span></strong><span> delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which
</span><strong><span>MUST</span></strong><span> not be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system). If unsure, leave it alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources). Windows Defender is a good AS program. The free Microsoft Security Essentials
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well. If you're using MSE, you don't really
 need Defender and MSE will deactivate it when installed (but you would with many other AV programs - though some of them also deactivate Defender). I would also suggest downloading
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a> and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>*********************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now, let's address the possibility of an infection.&nbsp; Please proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you
 shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            When I send an email, the email duplicates itself in my sent box.</h2>
                    On my iPhone 6, when I send an email, the email duplicates itself in my sent box, but only sends 1 email. This is starting to be aggravating because my sent box is filling up fast... How do I stop it from duplicating? I have already deleted account and
 rebooted it, reset the iPhone, hard reset... Etc. Apple care is acting like they don't know why it's happening and does not have a solution other than returning phone. My sprint carrier doesn't know what to do. Any suggestions on how to stop the madness!!!!

<h2>            Messaging App stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Messaging App stopped working all of the sudden. It shuts off on its own after about 5-10 seconds from the moment I turn it on. I really wish there is something I could do without having to reinstall Windows (that usually brings me a whole bunch of other
 problems)...</p>
<p>I tried to get an updated version of the Messaging app from the store, but is says that I already own the app and gives me only the option to Launch (with the same problem of shutting off in a few seconds). And there is no way to uninstall the app because
 it's a part of the Windows 10 package...</p>
<p>Hopefully someone could help me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Kapka </p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macros</h2>
                    <br />
How do I create a Macro for the Word command " Alt+H+K+A "?&nbsp; This command is in the Home tab then selecting the "Line and Paragraph Spacing" icon then selecting "Remove Space After Paragraph." &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Which strokes will be recorded by the mouse, and what strokes will be recorded by the keyboard?
<br />
<br />
When I try to run a very simply MS Word 2016 Macro now, I often get the following error message: "Can't execute code in break mode."&nbsp; This appears in a little box that says, "Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications"
<br />
<br />
How do I stop this. I have already stopped recording the previous Macro. The "Record Macro" and "Pause Recording" options are greyed-out.
<br />
<br />
I wish I knew the basic rules for creating Macros. <br />
<br />
Also, what is the default directory for Macros? <br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate if you could let me know what is the default directory for Personal Templates.<br />
<br />
My computer has three hard drives. It has a solid state C:\ drive for programs, and two 7,500 RPM hard drives mirrored RAID-1 for documents and data. I first tried to tell word to keep my personal templates on my D:\ drive because my D: drive is the only drive
 that gets backed up, but it didn't like that. So, now I have to switch it back.&nbsp; When I click on View macros, none of my Macros are visible even though they still work. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you very, very, very much for your help. &nbsp; Did I miss a "very" in there? <br />

<p>You have two issues. The first is that you want to be able to easily change formatting to suit you.</p>
<p>The second is you want to understand how macros work in Word.</p>
<p>Take the time to look at the page Doug gave you. It will save you time. Macros in Word are visual basic for applications procedures. They are not recorded keystrokes or mouse movements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The macro recorder does not work for many Word functions. Here is another useful page.

Writing Word Macros: An Introduction to Programming Word using VBA by Steven Roman, PhD</a>
</p>
<p>It is old, but remains a good resource.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to your first issue...</p>
<p>Learn to use styles for your formatting. That will save you both time and frustration.</p>

<p>One other thing that you should look into is use of your own custom templates that have styles set the way you want.</p>

</p><p><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Templates in Microsoft Word</a>

<p>
</p><p>You can create a new document based on one of your own custom templates and formatting (using styles) will already be set the way you want. You can also save your own styles or style modifications in the normal template so that they will be available whenever
 you start a blank document.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail sync problems - HELP&#33; &#40;Nokia N8 - Anna &#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I got a problem with my hotmail sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deleted my account without wanting to, and now i want it back - before I could sync all my folders in the hotmail account, but when i'm trying to make a new account it only syncs the inbox/sent maps? The other maps doesn't even appear on the screen when
 I go to maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I set up the account in a way so all maps are sync?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is going on for weeks now on my E6 as well. Somtimes Hotmail set-up works and then it doesn't anymore. Once you try to re-install then it only makes normal POP mail available, not via Nokia Messaging and that's why you only see the Inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have complained to @nokiacares on Twitter as well many times and they said it will be fixed....eventually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe you buzz them on Twitter as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does it work then? I understand that this is not a solution, but after Symbian Anna upgrade that might help.</p>

<p>I have removed and add my hotmail account and it seems to work again : thank you !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUT !!!!</strong></p>
<p>It remains <strong>THE</strong> big problem since Anna : I have to reboot my device several times a day because emails software&nbsp; hangs up with the white circle turning forever with no mails coming. It's a BIG issue that can lead users to change for devices
 with emails working as it should be.</p>
<p>Do you have a solution for this problem ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ovoid rebooting my device, I have set to receive mails anly&nbsp;once a&nbsp;&nbsp;day and I manually sync to receive mails... of course it's not a good solution, it's just for a short time waiting for Nokia to fix it or before going to another brand...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I alway have to wait ("retreiving"... message) to read emails even with parameters set to load fulle mail and graphics or attached files downloaded "from time to time" !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any informations from Nokia will be appreciate by all of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2013 Crashing &#40;Repeatable steps&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I select a range in Excel 2013 and copy, then hit New Workbook to paste selection, Excel crashes. This happens every time if I use this order of events, and regardless of whether I use keyboard shortcuts or the mouse (or even VBA - see below example)..</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Sub Crash_Test()</div>
<div>&nbsp; Range("a1:b2").select</div>
<div>&nbsp; Selection.copy</div>
<div>&nbsp; Workbooks.Add 'Crashes here</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I create the new workbook prior to the copy, then no crash and no problem - a frustrating workaround that I have forgotten when it counts!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read forums that suggest disabling all COM-Add Ins as this is the likely cause, but unfortunately with all disabled the problem persists. Can anyone suggest a troubleshooting path here please?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows Event Viewer shows the following for every crash;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><i><b>Faulting application name: </b>excel.EXE, version: 15.0.4420.1017, time stamp: 0x50673286</i></div>

<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>UPDATE:</div>
<div>I started excel in safe mode, and the problem went away... (Excel /safe)</div>
<div>Yet I do <u>not </u>have any Com-Add's enabled at all??</div>
</div>

            <p>I had this issue as well, and as soon as I removed the "Paste and Transpose" shortcut, it resolved.</p>

<p>Thank you for finding this as it is posted elsewhere and it appears nobody else has moved it forward!</p>

<p>For&nbsp;Office 2007 you had to purchase a language pack to get additional languages. However, that is no longer possible, because Microsoft no longer offers language packs for that version.</p>

<h2>            &#91;SharePoint&#93; Disable header in Modern page</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p><br />
I want to disable header in modern page. I tried adding css by sharepoint extension, but there is still a blink which is not very good in terms of user experience. Is there a better way to achieve it? Thanks.</p>
