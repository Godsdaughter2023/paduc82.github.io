<h2>            Microsoft Notification emails in Chinese</h2>
                    Some of the Microsoft live security and family safety emails are in Chinese even though I have chosen English as my language. &nbsp;I have selected Singapore for my home country because that is where I live and work. &nbsp;Is there a way to change it so I receive
 all my emails in English?

            Hi there!<br />“When someone signs in to Skype, their status will show them as being online.<br /><br />However, sometimes they may not be visible straight away or they may have set their status to Invisible.<br /><br />If the contact is online, you can call them or send them instant messages even if their status has not yet been updated. If you do call or instant message them, their status will usually be updated immediately, unless they have chosen to be invisible. <br /><br />Learn more about status settings and how to change them.”<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA87/why-is-a-contact-who-is-online-shown-as-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA87/why-is-a-...</a>

    <title>Autocomplete numbering depending on letter entered - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a.r.m.s.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autocomplete numbering depending on letter entered</h2>
                    <p>I am using Excel in Office 365 Home Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I autocomplete numbers depending on the letter of the alphabet I enter? Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In cell A1 the number is M27</p>
<p>In cell A2 the number is F43<br />
In cell A3 the number is F44</p>
<p>If I enter F in cell A4, I want it to autocomplete as F45</p>
<p>If I enter M in cell A5, I want it to autocomplete as M28</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will only be using the 2 letters M and F.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody said this is "macros", something only available in 365 Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help please?</p>

<p>You may do it without macro, by using a helper column.</p>
<p>Assuming you will be giving only M or F in column A starting with cell A2,&nbsp; row 1 being header.</p>
<p>Now Give this formula at B2 and copy it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=A8&amp;COUNTIF($A$2:A8,A8)-1+IF(A8="M",<strong>27</strong>,<strong>43</strong>)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I watch anime on-line and on&nbsp;both sites for&nbsp;Naruto and onepiece this message appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video playback was aborted due to a corruption problem or because the video used features your browser did not support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using internet explorer 11 but before I upgraded to windows 10 I never had any issues</p>

<h2>            How can I share JUST the content of a OneNote page with a link&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried sharing a single page by creating a link, but it does not work properly.&nbsp; It not only shares the page content, but the entire screen, including all of the other page tabs in the section.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this?&nbsp; In Evernote, I can share
 JUST the note by sending a link.&nbsp; This is worthless as I don't want to share any more than the note's content.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Password protected pdf in Onenote</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find this problem in the threads and hope I am not duplicating anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I insert 2 pdf files into OneNote from my OneDrive - one is password protected, the other is not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once inserted the&nbsp;non protected file will open for viewing on a double-click (after the standard warning on&nbsp;opening attachments).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The password protected file gives the standard warning about opening attachments and then the 'Enter password to open this file' dialogue box appears.&nbsp;I enter the password (correctly) and receive an error message&nbsp; ' Can't open this file / there is a problem
 with the file format). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then&nbsp;copy and paste this file from the OneNote page (via right-click / copy / paste) to an entirely different location. Now on&nbsp;double click at the new location&nbsp;I get the same ''Enter password to open this file' dialogue box.&nbsp;I enter the password (correctly)
 and now the file will open for viewing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously am not looking to copy my pdfs out of OneNote in order to view them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>

<h2>            power point freezes when I edit data of a chart</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try to edit data in a chart for a slide in PowerPoint my whole machine almost freezes. &nbsp;It suddenly started to happen last week with one chart and it now happens with most charts. I read on another site that I should clear out any files in the TEMP
 folder, but this was on a PC site. If this would work where can I find this folder on my Mac?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many Thanks,</div>
<div>Mark</div>

            The first suspicion is update level of the software. Make sure you have OS X [?] as well as Office 2011 [14.2.5] fully updated. Once all updates are confirmed/applied, run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions &amp; Restart your Mac.<br />
<br />
As a test, you can create a new User Account then run PPT while logged in as that user. See if the same type of behavior occurs while doing similar tasks.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists, reply with any additional details you can supply, including;<br />
<ul>
<li>At exactly what point the system starts to bog down... As soon as you click the Edit button? After Excel opens? While you're changing cell content?</li><li>What file format are the files saved in?</li><li>Are the files stored locally?</li></ul>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>To follow-up on what Bob said, be sure to update Office (Help menu of PowerPoint &gt; Check for Updates). &nbsp;An update was just released, so you should have PowerPoint 14.3.0 now.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac IMAP Multiple Duplicates - Deleting deletes original email in Gmail</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using IMAP to sync emails from my gmail-based work email account to my computer, using Outlook for Mac 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once within outlook, rules are sorting them into folders (still within the same account), not on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of them are duplicating up to 10 times, others three or four.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i go through and delete all of the duplicates, about 5mins later when it syncs, the original is marked as deleted as well and appears in my deleted items folder (i.e. i lose all of them, not just the duplicates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is becoming increasingly frustrating with threaded emails, as i have to go through 50-60 sets of emails in the thread (6-8 copies for each date/time) just to find the right email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas??</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the threads that i have found have either been different or have not posed a correct answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>J</p>

            <p><span>Hi JirikHaselgrove,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, I know that the emails you sent will be duplicated when you use a Gmail account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I noticed that you mentioned “It was sent twice”, please try the following steps to see whether it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click <strong>Tools</strong> -&gt;<strong> Accounts</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Advanced</strong> -&gt; <strong>Folde</strong><strong>rs</strong> and then confirm whether you have enabled “Don’t store a copy of sent messages”.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c37e09f-5cb6-461e-941a-6db31064fd6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c37e09f-5cb6-461e-941a-6db31064fd6c" /></a></p>
<p><span>2. Totally close the Outlook for Mac client and then use Gmail’s Web App to reply the emails. Check whether the emails are duplicated. This step help us to identify whether the issue is related to your account or Outlook for Mac.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please try updating your Outlook for Mac client. Our latest public version is 15.30 (170107), please navigate to
<strong>Help</strong> -&gt;<strong> Check for Updates</strong> -&gt; Select <strong>Manually Check</strong> and then Click
<strong>Check for Updates</strong>.</span></p>

<h2>            Asha 302 Contacts not showing names only numbers</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>I've recently got an Asha 302 for work use and wanting to syncronise my contacts with Microsoft Outlook.&nbsp; Set it all up to go but when it copied everything across it shows numbers rather than names.&nbsp; All my contacts in Outlook are obviously filed by company
 name given that it's companies not people that I deal with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know how I get my phone to show company names rather than their phone number?&nbsp; I don't want to have to go through my contacts in Outlook as there are over 350 contacts that would need changing and there really must be a way to get it to look at the
 'file by' name surely???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIA</p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />The first thing that i would check in your case is that if you have an Antivirus please make sure that is not preventing you from sending emails with Outlook, it could be by default or even it could be an add-in within Outlook.
<br />
<br />If that's not your case follow this.
<br />
<br />Try opening Outlook in safe mode.
<br />
<br />Windows + R, then type outlook.exe /safe
<br />
<br />If that worked, disable the suspicious add-ins that you think might be causing the problem.
<br />
<br />Disable the addins
<br />

<br />
<br />If that doesn't work.
<br />
<br />Create another Outlook profile, add the account and try again (This won't erase anything).
<br />
<br />Go to Windows Control Panel &gt; Mail &gt; Show Profiles &gt; Add.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work perform an Office repair.

<br />What are you using for antivirus?

<br />Does it open in Safe mode?  To open Outlook in Safe mode: Close Outlook then hold Ctrl as you click on the Outlook icon. You'll get a message asking if you want to start in Safe mode. Click Ok.

            Hi Diane, I tried the "safe" mode and the only email that would go..was to my email to my aol.com account. that seemed to go seamlessly. No delay no problems. So safe mode almost works. I am missing a "set up" step somewhere. Please advise. Thanks for
 your patience,

            In case your email client is other than outlook, you need to configure correct IMAP/SMTP server information while adding a new account using manual configuration option in Outlook. Get your email host server IMPA/SMTP address from their website or customer
 service and repair your account in Outlook with correct incoming and outgoing server information. Alternatively, delete the account and reconfigure with correct IMAP/SMTP server details.

            I'm not sure you are missing anything - if it works in Safe mode but not in 'normal' mode, then something is interfering.  Can you send AOL mail in normal mode? 
<br />
<br />Did you get the same error message in Safe mode?

<h2>            Unable to Match Desired Fields for Mail Merge</h2>
                    Hi - I'm using Office 2003 and am trying to create mailing labels.&nbsp; I have the data in an Access database that I started creating in Word and finished creating in Access.&nbsp; When I try to add the fields that I want I can't find all the necessary fields.&nbsp;
 The fields that are missing were added when I went into Access to add more data.&nbsp; I thought maybe that some of the field properties were different between what was showing up and what wasn't but they are the same.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks in advance!

            Hi - Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I figured it out because of what you said about queries.&nbsp; The problem was the fields that I was looking for weren't in the query.&nbsp; I manually added them and now it works just fine.&nbsp; Thanks!

<p>I'm not sure I follow exactly what has happened, but</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. when you create a recipient list in Word 2003's MailMerge function, Word creates an Access/Jet .mdb file that has a table called Office_Address_List with 13 standard columns in it (unless you changed the list of items in Word using the Customize... button),
 and a query called "Office Address List" that executes the SQL code</p>
<p>SELECT *&nbsp;FROM Office_Address_List;</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. Word uses the Query as its data source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. each column is defined as an optional 255-character Text field</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. As long as you added your fields in the Office_Address_List table in Access and set tem to be the same data type, I would expect them to show up in Word's Recipient List when you next opened your Mail Merge Main Document. However, if you did anything
 in Access while that address list database was open (such as create a Report, or anything that adds tables or queries, then it is likely that Word will no longer treat the data in the same way, because it no longer thinks it is an "Office Address List" (OAL).
 It may not allow you to edit the data in Word and it almost certainly will not let you Customize the columns. It should still /see/ the columns though. I don't know what the limit on column count for an OAL is. You probably also have some leeway on the column
<p>The only additional thing I would try is to reconnect to the data source from Word. Here, it does not seem to be necessary, but I would still try it.</p>
<p>Sorry I cannot pin down the problem for you - maybe if you could describe exactly what you now have in your .mdb, and what you are not seeing in Word, it would help.</p>

    <title>Messages sent from external applications like mailto&#58; links get - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george t. murphy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Messages sent from external applications like mailto&#58; links get put in wrong sent items folder</h2>
                    <p>Here are the details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 Windows SBS 2011 server (Windows server 2008 R2 with Exchange 2010.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>2 Windows 7 64 bit client PCs running Office 2010 Home and Business 32 bit.</p>
<p>Outlook 2010 is setup for 3 accounts.&nbsp; 1 Exchange account, 1 POP3 account, and 1 IMAP account.</p>
<p>The POP3 and the Exchange account all get sent to the Exchange mailbox which is an OST file (cached mode.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The IMAP account has its own PST file.&nbsp; Sent items and Deleted items are correctly mapped to the IMAP folders in the advanced account settings.</p>
<p>The IMAP is the default account, this has to be the way they are setup to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley as the IMAP is securely hosted by a thrid party financial company which archives all client mail, and all client e-mail must go through this account (uses
 SSL.)&nbsp; The Exchange and POP accounts are secondary accounts not used for client communication.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Both systems have all updates done, running Office 2010 SP1.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have configured the registry setting to force Outlook 2010 to always use the default account (the IMAP account,) as illustrated on this
<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/2010/multiple-accounts-and-the-default-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
site</a> </p>
<p>What is happening is this; when I am working in Outlook, I have no issues.&nbsp; New mails send out using the IMAP account, and after being sent, are placed in the sent items of the IMAP account PST folders.&nbsp; Direct replies to e-mails from the POP3 account or
 the Exchange account are placed in the Sent Items of the Exchange Mailbox OST after they are sent.&nbsp; Both accounts are selected in the Send and Recieve group, automatic send a receive every 5 minutes or when a message is sent.&nbsp;Works great.</p>
<p>However, when Outlook is closed, and I try to send an&nbsp;e-mail from another application, for example from Paper Port scanning program, HP scanning program, clicking on a mailto: link, or simply right clicking on a file in Windows Explorer and selecting send
 to &gt; mail recipient, the e-mail gets sent out OK, using the correct default IMAP account, but for some reason, the e-mail gets placed in the wrong sent items folder.&nbsp; It always gets placed in the Exchange mailbox OST sent items folder, and never in the Sent
 items folder of the IMAP account PST.&nbsp; I have tried several things to fix this, and have not been successful.&nbsp; Is there a way to get these e-mails funneled to the correct sent items folder, or is this a bug with Outlook 2010?&nbsp; Right now, my customers are having
 to manually move the sent items over into the correct folder, and this is a huge pain.&nbsp; This e-mail may have confidential infomation, and their secuirty audit requires it to be stored on a secured 3rd party server and not their own Exchange server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have included my techlogs of what I have done to try to fix this item below.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Research into issue with external mailto: calls to outlook sending out e-mails and not storing the sent item in the correct IMAP account PST sent items folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Could not find the exact issue here, as their mail seems to go out using the correct default IMAP account from tests done to my account and others, it just gets stored in the wrong sent items folder.&nbsp; Did find some similar issues.&nbsp; I found several technet
 message boards on various issues with multiple accounts in Outlook 2010.&nbsp; First off, IMAP accounts do not have the mapping to store deleted and sent items on the local computer PST by default, this mapping has to be setup, I have done this, but some settings
 need to be double-checked to make sure they are correct.&nbsp; Not all folders on the IMAP server can be mapped to folders in the local PST, while Outlook 2010 improves on IMAP support, it is still lacking in areas.&nbsp;

<p>Another huge issue found is that apparently the behavior of how Outlook 2010 handles the Default Account setting has changed from 2007 and before.&nbsp; Now Outlook has a "smart" sense feature, it will automatically pick the account to send items with based on
 the PST or OST data file the user is currently in.&nbsp; That means while reading messages from the Exchange account, Outlook will automatically select the Exchange account to send new messages from when clicking on the new message button.&nbsp; This has serious implications
 when using IMAP accounts, as most IMAP accounts do not allow contacts, notes, tasks, and calendar entries, so IMAP account will not be selected when viewing these items and clicking new mail (creating an invitation in the calendar, sending a contact, etc.)
 the account attributed to the PST/OST that contains the calendar, contacts, and other items will.&nbsp; This means that the customer may send out client mail using the Exchange or POP accounts by mistake.&nbsp; Also, this affected external calls to send e-mail from
 other applications, and clicking on mailto: links, apparently Outlook would get confused about what account to send out with and frequently chose the first POP account listed in the accounts panel when it couldn't determine what set of folders were open.&nbsp;
 This feature really irked many Outlook users, and the threads on this issue were huge.&nbsp; There are some hotfixes that deal with the issue, which I obtained, but it looks like most of these should be included in Office 2010 SP1.&nbsp; I will try to install hotfixes
 onsite.&nbsp; Before SP1, the only fix was to install hotfixes, then create a registry entry to always prompt for an account to use when sending messages.&nbsp; Even when the Sp1 update installed, a registry entry still needs to be created, but this will now force Outlook
 to always use the default account when sending a message.&nbsp; I believe for the customer this should be the preferred behavior, as per their security requirements we do not want the risk of accidentally sending out using the wrong account, this may also fix the
 mailto: behavior.&nbsp; <br />

<p>Arrived at customer site, began working on e-mail issues on both computers.&nbsp; Followed suggestions from Technet forums, checked that the IMAP account was set to store deleted items and sent items on the local computer in the properly mapped folders.&nbsp; This
 works fine from within Outlook after tests, sent items going to proper folder.&nbsp; Attempted install of hotfixes, but all three are already installed as part of Office 2010 SP1.&nbsp; Made registry modification to enable always sending as default e-mail account, rebooted
 computer.&nbsp; Test mail sending after reboot from within Exchange box, using correct IMAP account now.&nbsp; Also using correct account when sending mail from contacts or calendar.&nbsp; Test sending a mail using mailto link from outside Outlook, and from right clicking
 a file and using send to link, going out with correct account, but still saving the sent item to the wrong sent items folder when Outlook is CLOSED.&nbsp; Nothing in the Technet forums worked to fix this behavior.&nbsp; "</p>

<br />
That's the default behaviour. AFAIK there's nothing you can do about it apart from moving items sent by that method into the correct Sent Items folder manually.

<p>Hi VoytekAndrzejewski,</p>
<p>To look into the issue, I’d like to confirm some information below:</p>
<p>1. Do the Outlook client and OWA (Outlook Web App) both encounter the issue?</p>
<p>2. Do those problematic emails have the same attributes?</p>
<p>3. When did the recipients receive these emails and how about the date stamps in their Inbox?</p>
<p>4. Has the user set up any settings such as <a href="https://support.office.com/client/Yes-ea346137-e1e2-4ec4-a77b-1522b75b15d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
delay or schedule sending email messages</a>?</p>
<p>In addition, please let the admin run a message trace to check the flow of these emails. To run a message trace:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. in OWA the emails are date stamped correctly but are listed incorrectly. They are actually at the top of the list as if they were date stamped after the current day... weird.</p>
<p>2. Nothing similar in the emails that I could see, in actual fact they are going to both internal and external recipients.</p>
<p>3. The recipients receieved the emails weeks ago but we cannot check the date stamps unfortunately.</p>
<p>4. No settings like that. A very standard setup without rules.</p>
<p>Ill run a trace and respond back</p>

<p>Hey Larry,</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to look into this. </p>
<p>That was the first thing we checked. Timing on the machine was accurate and the user confirmed that he had not changed the date at any time. The only other device he uses is a mobile phone and that is also accurate.</p>
<p>We have not been able to replicate this issue and have never seen it before. Just interested in what caused it and hoping it never happens again.</p>

<p>Hi VoytekAndrzejewski,</p>
<p>Thanks for providing the mail header and message trace results.</p>
<p>After checking them several times, everything should be fine. So there may be some other specific settings causing the issue. Since the issue occurs all of a sudden and affects a few emails, it’s no feasible to trace the root cause now. I’d suggest you report
 it to us if it occurs again, then we will escalate it to our relevant team to check if it is related to the backend. Your understanding is appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

    <title>Office for Mac won&#39;t validate following upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cliffope  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office for Mac won&#39;t validate following upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to High Sierra. After that, I was prompted by Microsoft Updater to upgrade to Office for Mac 15.39, which I did. On then opening Word for Mac, I was prompted to activate. Nothing happened for approx 1 minute. Then I got the spinning wheel
 of death for approx 1 minute, then the application crashed. I've tried repeatedly from Word and Excel, but always with the same result. In the meantime, I'm subject to all the usual limitations of not having validated, including the inability to save my work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's frustrating when you do everything right and something goes wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's even more frustrating when you don't find lots of other reports of the same thing going on or others jumping in with replies - this happened to me and this is how I fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point we don't know where to turn. It could be the install of Office went haywire. It could be something wrong in Mac OS. It could be a font issue. All 3 of these are large areas to explore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a first troubleshooting step, I advise testing in Safe Mode. Restart your Mac and hold the Shift key down the moment you hear the startup chime.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you see the swirling circle you can let go of the Shift key. Your Mac will automatically fix problems with your startup disk and reduce the available font set, and prevent other apps from launching at startup. It takes longer to boot to safe mode, so
 don't be alarmed if it seems like it's taking forever</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get to the desktop, open the problem app(s). Does it work OK (yes or no)?
</p>
<p>If yes, then maybe simply starting in Safe Mode fixed the problem. Do a regular restart and test again. Does the app work now (yes or no)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of possibilities for troubleshooting based on the results of testing is Safe Mode. Please reply with the results of your testing.</p>

<h2>            Build 10049 - Recurring issues with NVIDIA 349.90 Driver</h2>
                    <p>I have had issues with recurring blue screen failures with the NVIDIA 349.90 driver delivered via Windows Update.&nbsp; It seems somewhat more stable with Build 10049, but was a bigger issue in builds 9926 and 10041.&nbsp; I have no such crashes using the most recent
 driver directly from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to a mini-dump from a crash that occurred during a boot from power-up which again points to the NVIDIA driver as being the issue.</p>
<p>

            Ok it's the driver and you need to by pass windows driver update in other words dont let windows update the driver but use the nivida software to update there seems to be a issue with the driver over lay by this i mean in the device settings the nvidia
 the driver issuer must be nvidia and not Microsoft. you need to enter safe mode and delete all the driver software from the computer and allow the computer to only use the nvidia issued driver

            <p>Thank you. &nbsp;I know how to bypass and resolve the issue so my computer does not crash by using the driver from NVIDIA instead of from Windows Update, which is what I had been doing.&nbsp; It used to be simple to hide any individual problematic update using the
 former Windows Update user interface.&nbsp; The design of Windows 10 has currently changed to where our only choice is to disable ALL "Windows Update" delivery of driver updates.&nbsp; The alternative is having individual drivers that crash our system repeatedly auto-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My purpose in posting this is to ensure that Microsoft and NVIDIA are aware of the issue and get some live data back to resolve it.&nbsp; This has been an issue for at least 3 Builds of Windows 10.&nbsp; There is no easy way to provide specific feedback for BSOD crashes
 via the Windows Feedback App, as it is not interactive.&nbsp; We can make a statement as to what happened, but there is no way to provide enough data to interactively troubleshoot issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was purposely using the delivered driver so that when a crash occurred I could possibly provide some data to be of help in getting the driver fixed.</p>

 The kind of errors i get are also the same as mentioned for the aforesaid. I tried to reproduce the steps that were mentioned for WM6 with similar problem but failed. is there any difference for the same, or should do a hard reset to rectify my problem. Hard
 reset means i lose a lot of time and data. If in case i do a hard reset what all data will i lose from my phone? Please help me find a way out of this problem.</span><br />

<span>The problems are:</span><br />

            I think it may be time to do a hard reset (clean reset) - this will clear all your data , but will take the phone back to 'as new'

    <title>Update Operation Fatal Error when installing Technical Preview Build - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update Operation Fatal Error when installing Technical Preview Build 10041 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In trying to perform an upgrade install of the Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 10041 (as is the latest available for direct download as of my writing), I am running into a problem I cannot find mention of anywhere else on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fall into two categories with regards to this build: A) Product tester who actually needs to test application performance under Windows 10 on bare metal, B) Semi-crazy techie who loves using (usable) beta software as his primary environment ;)</p>
<p>so it is rather important to me that I get this working on my machine in some non-virtualized respect. I am reluctant to do a full/fresh install if installation problems are happening, because my Windows 8 product key has been f***ed up from the start (likely
 some random database corruption) and I've had to utilize phone support to get around an "unknown error" the last two times I've had to use it. So, for fear of that key completely crapping out on me, I don't want to move to Win10 unless I'm confident it will
 install and I can stick with it (for better or worse) through the end. Problems within the Preview after I install it I can deal with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I first tried to install the Preview through the standard Windows Update method. The installer took about 7 hours (but from reading lots of internet discussions, stupidly long install times in that range seem to be a common problem with this builds separate
 from it actually failing). During the reboot between the "Setting up Devices" (Or is it Setting up Drivers? I forget) and "Taking Care of a Few More Things" (Again, possibly paraphrased), for about a split second, underneath the Windows logo and throbber,
 some error like this appeared:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Fatal Error Performing Update Operation # of ##: ERROR CODE</strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">It only appeared for a fraction of a second, and I had no chance of reading the precise numbers or error.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">However, the installer then seemed to continue, and went until the main circle was at 100%. As soon as 100% hit, however, the screen went black for something like 30min. Then, I briefly saw "Attempting to recover installation" before
 "Restoring your previous version of Windows." And I was, quite impressively considering how far along that installer was, back in Windows 8.1 completely unharmed.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I tried again by burning an ISO and doing a disc upgrade install. I let that one run overnight and was asleep for the error, but I was back in Win8.1 in the morning, so I can only assume a similar thing happened there.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">As for my system specs, I'm running on a MacBook Pro 9,1 under Boot Camp. I am upgrading from Windows 8.1.2 Pro with Media Center. I have found other online accounts of people quite successfully installing Windows 10 on Macs, so
 that isn't the issue.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Does anyone have any clue as to what this error might have been/be, and how I might fix it? Or at least have it on good authority that a fresh installation would be unaffected (meaning it's software-related)? If not, I can try installing
 to a VHD, which would at least let me product test on bare metal, but wouldn't have the harddrive space to be my daily driver and would probably only get used occasionally.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!</p>

            <p>The Mac is a unique case. Its proprietary hardware even though it uses off the shelf components. Although some persons have gotten Windows 10 to successfully install on Macs, which build were they using? Were they actually using build 10041 or build 9841.
 Support at this time varies across builds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking into account the driver model for Windows 10 has been refined since Windows 8, it is likely you will have to wait until Apple officially supports Windows 10 with updated Boot Camp drivers, its possible you might even needs firmware updates for your
 Mac. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My recommendation also would be to avoid builds 10041 and 10049 at this time since they are quite unstable because of their rapid delivery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, you have Windows 8.1 Update 1 with Media Center, Windows 10 upgrade will remove Media Center, so keep that in mind and ensure you have a backup.</p>

You will be able to download the update through Windows Update or you can download .ISO media and use it do an in place upgrade. For many persons, using ISO media will be the preferred method since you will have a backup copy for reinstall purposes if needed.

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll go ahead and, next time I have time to leave my computer alone for long enough, do a clean boot and try again. Maybe something I have running is silently screwing things up (though I'd be surprised to see such an issue manifest so late, strange problems
 often have seemingly unrelated solutions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, I'll go ahead and try clean installing to a reasonably-sized VHD so I can at least do the testing I need to do. At this point you've convinced me not to try a full overwrite. Unfortunately, this MacBook is the only computer I have to
 test on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that option, I'll have to try getting creative with an external HDD perhaps, or just ask around for another machine I can use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll also see what the TechNet people have to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Media Center: Is it just not included in the Preview because it's a prerelease? I don't particularly care about the Media Center program, just the DVD codecs. Are those still present in 10? Are there any plans to keep any sort of DVD support in
 the operating system?</p>

Okay,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
So I tried the clean boot: Still didn't work, but the error I got was different.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
This time, it still failed at the end of the installation, but I got this error in a window when it rebooted back into 8.1:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
0x8007002C - 0x4001C</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
While I could still only find a handful of other people who've had this error, at least it was more than zero.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
From reading their threads, I now have a couple other possibilities to try:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Uninstall security software (you'd think the clean boot would have the same effect, but worth a try)<br />
Clean the Windows Update cache</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
One person also had it caused by a symlink being present in a system folder, but I am not aware of that being the case on my system.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
So I'll try these two things&nbsp;<em>next&nbsp;</em>time I have the ability to let my computer sit for 7-8 hours installing an OS.</p>

            <p>Alright!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Success!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say which was really responsible for fixing it (since I tried both at once), but clearing the Windows Update cache and uninstalling security software allowed the installation to go through without any error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't mark myself as an answer, so... not really sure how to close this now.</p>
