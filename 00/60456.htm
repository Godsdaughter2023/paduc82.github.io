<h2>            Notebook keeps saying Low Disk Space. Error message also says 0mb on drive.</h2>
                    <p>I have bought this ASUS Notebook in February and it has Windows 8 preinstalled on it. I have had numerous problems with Windows 8 since then. My problem now is that I keep getting messages saying 'Low disk Space' and&nbsp; 'Drive C has only 0mb of free disk space'
 etc. I have not installed any programs on this notebook, whatsoever, therefore, I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>I have thought of doing a system restore but it doesn't let me due to the 0 disk space?
</p>
<p>I have contacted the Answer desk, yet they weren't helpful. They told me to contact ASUS but ASUS told me to contact Microsoft. Who do I ask for help?
</p>
<p>I need to resolve this issue from my notebook as it is slowing everything down and causing quite a large amount of disruption. I have no idea why this has happened as I have only had this Notebook for 4 months. I am quite fed up of the mount of problems
 I have had and had to fix since I have had this Notebook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please help me sort this issue out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If that was mine, I would probably from control panel, administrator tools, run the disk cleanup.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you right click it and run as administrator it will run the system cleanup scan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I would look down the list of items its going to clean and hopefully
 see where the problem is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If disk cleanup will run ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be prepared for a couple hours or more for that to finish cleanup.&nbsp; Or just look at the scan and figure out what is eating up space hopefully to start with.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp;I cannot do disk clean-up. It said calculating disk space. Then it gets to an error message saying to free up disk space by removing programs. However I do not know which programs to delete as I have not installed any programs since
 I have bought this Notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankyou. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a computer manufacturer sells a machine with Windows Preinstalled, they are in fact the ones responsible for providing assistance.... It's part of the deal they get from Microsoft when purchasing the licensing.</p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as your actual problem goes though, I recently came across something that indicates at least sometimes this is related to Search Indexing basically going nuts....The file getting out of control seems to be... C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications\Windows\Windows.edb....</p>
<p>This file is in an area that is locked unless you have altered the Ownership\Permissions of the folders, but you should be able to get to DATA and check it's file size to see if it's the culprit...</p>
<p>If so, here are a couple of links with more info.....</p>

    <title>Storages Spaces Configuration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jgt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storages Spaces Configuration</h2>
                    <p>I've read a lot about Storage Spaces but I've not taken the big step at this time and would appreciate suggestions for the best setup. I have a large tower that will hold a total of 10 drives. My boot drive is a 500GB SSD and this will NOT be part of storage
 spaces. &nbsp;My main concern is to protect my data (Libraries) and System (OS) backups of my four PCs. Currently I use a windows application (Syncback PRO) to run nightly backups of my data and have the original and two backup copies of all the data. I use Acronis
 True Image to capture nightly incremental backups of the OS (4 PCs) and keep seven generations only because I have been burned when trying to restore something and could not find it in generations 1-4. At this time I devote about 21TB to backups (this is my
 data and system backups) and devote about 13 TB to data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My initial thoughts was to create one huge storage pool using double parity and just put everything in it. This would provide two drive failure. Second option - Another thought is to create two pools, one for my data and the other for backups. If I go with
 the 2nd option just because of hard drive physical space limitations (I only have room for 10 drives) I'd go with single parity, this would provide protection with only 1 drive failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past I used a RAID 5 configuration for my backups but I was at the point where I needed a larger capacity which required purchasing 8 new larger drives all the same size (big expense), dumping everything to temp drives (lots of time and more drives
 are needed) from the existing RAID, creating a new RAID with the new larger drives and then copying everything from the temp drives to the new RAID (lots of time). The problem with RAID 5 is that it only provides one drive failure and over the period of using
 the RAID 5 I had a total of 3 drives fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The huge advantage of Storage Spaces is that I can use different size drives, I can add drives as needed, I can replace smaller drives with larger drives as needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that it will be necessary for me to purchase a controller card so I can add more drives to my tower, my mother board has 8 ports and currently they are all being used. All of my other drives are attached via USB and several are on USB hubs.</p>

            <p>First Storage Spaces like RAID is not a backup.</p>
<p>If the data is important to you then you'll have at least 2 locations for it. One in Storage Spaces, and the other in another location. I use a NAS for my secondary backup.</p>
<p>Next, the different size drives do cause issues with how much you can use. Say you have 2 drives, one is 1 TB and the other is 2 TB. In storage spaces you can only use a maximum of the smallest drive. So in this scenario you'd only have a total of 2 TB of
 space, 1 TB from each drive with 1 TB not being used on the 2 TB drive. It is best for the Storage Pools to use the same size drives.</p>
<p>You are thinking of JBOD storage, however Storage Spaces doesn't support that method of storage.</p>

            <p>It is my understanding that Storage Spaces is very similar to JBOD in that I can use drives of different sizes and the resulting storage pool is the total of all the disk minus space for the overhead. The overhead depends on the type of&nbsp;<span>data
 resiliency you use, currently following are the different types (NOTE, this is my summary from my readings and I may have some incorrectly stated).</span></p>
<ol>
<li>None: Windows will store only a single copy of your data. You’ll lose the data if one of your drives fails, but no space will be used on backups. Requires at least 2 drives, data is lost if one drive fails.</li><li>Two-way mirror: Windows will store two copies of your data. If one of your drives fails, you won’t lose your data. This requires at least two drives, one drive can fail and you still have your data</li><li>Three-way mirror: Windows will store three copies of your data. If one or two of your drives fails, you won’t lose your data. This requires at least five drives, one drive can fail and you still have your data</li><li>Parity: Windows stores parity information with the data, protecting you from a single drive failure. Parity uses drive space more efficiently than mirroring, but file access times are slower. &nbsp;Required at least three drives, one drive can fail without data
 loss.</li><li>Double parity: In the latest version of Storage Spaces released together with Windows Server 2012 R2 one more layout was added (as I understand this is also in Win10 as well). This layout is similar to a RAID6, which utilizes two different parities meaning
 that a system can survive a double disk failure. Requires at least seven drives, two drives can fail without data loss.</li></ol>
<p><span>Another advantage of Storage Pools is that if the system fails, let's say that Windows 10 fails and requires a complete reinstall. You could just remove the disk and put them
 in a new Windows 10 (or 8) system and immediately whatever is on the disk is available. After you rebuild your system you could then remove the disk from the temp system, install them in the new system and now your data is available without any additional
 effort on your part other than some very minor task such as assigning the drive letter and such. I don't think this would be true for RAID or a NAS.</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>If a Storage Pool is upgraded to I believe the Anniversary Update for Windows 10 then it isn't backwards compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not like JBOD. For example, your Two-Way Mirror, if you have a 500 GB drive and a 1 TB drive, then the max size for that 2-way mirror is 500 GB.
</p>
<p>As for the None, if you have the same drives, the max you be able to store is 1 TB (500 GB on each drive), not 1.5 TB. Storage Spaces writes to each drive equally and when the smallest drive runs out of space it stops.
</p>
<p>Doesn't matter about the parity or mirroring, if your computer fails and takes out all your drives and you have no backups, then the data is gone. That is what I'm referring to. You should always have two distinct copies of data to have a backup. If you
 aren't concerned about the data don't worry about it.</p>

            <p>OK, I’ve ordered the SAS9211-8I 8PORT Int 6GB Sata+sas Pcie 2.0, I found one “used” for $75 on Amazon, also ordered two sets of Mini SAS Host/Controller to 4 SATA Target/Backplane Cable. All should arrive by late next week.&nbsp;<br />
1.<span> </span>I think as a first step after I install the card is to remove five drives from external enclosures, install them in the tower, connect them to the card and test. I have several drives 2TB and smaller that I can install as a test and confirm
 that it is working. Once I know its working, I can&nbsp;<br />
2.<span> </span>Assuming the test is successful then I will copy necessary files/folders from three drives to other drives. If necessary I will use drives in external enclosures to complete the process. Initially all I need to do is free up 3 drives.<br />
3.<span> </span>Either now or later make a bracket that will house 3-3 ½” drives that I can mount in the tower, this will allow me to attach a total of 8 drives to the controller card and use all eight in the Storage Spaces. &nbsp;I don't think heat dissipation
 from the drives will be of concern. My tower has four 200mm fans and four 120mm fans<br />
4.<span> </span>Using the three freed up drives create a Parity Storage Space Pool with 80TB “thin provisioning” (this is for future proofing and allows me to add more disk to the pool or change small disk for larger disk as necessary) using the REFS (Resilient
 File System, per MS it is a new “local file system. It maximizes data availability, despite errors that would historically cause data loss or downtime. Data integrity ensures that business-critical data is protected from errors and available when needed.”
 This Storage Space will be for my backups and eight drives will provide much more than I currently need thus I may never get around to adding the additional 3 disk. Initially this array will consist of 3-6TB, 2-4TB drives for a total of 26TB of storage less
 the overhead. Obviously this will take me several days where most of the time is just moving files from one disk to another. If I had the cash I could make the task easier by purchasing 3 WD Black 6TB drives. The WD Black is my drive of choice and currently
 6TB is the largest size but I may consider the Seagate Enterprise 3.5 HDD (Helium) which is available in the 10TB size but at $470 each it makes a big hole in the budget. However based on price per TB it is less expensive than the WD Black 6TB at $303. &nbsp;I
 always recommend enterprise class drives, if you can afford it. &nbsp;They also come with a 5 year warranty as opposed to the standard 3. &nbsp;I'm slowly migrating to the enterprise drives. I think my next drive purchase will be the Seagate Enterprise&nbsp;Capacity 10TB
 drives.<br />
5.<span> </span>Share the new Storage Space with full privileges on my network so my other systems can access it. &nbsp;<br />
6.<span> </span>Verify and understand how HDS is now reporting on the disk in the Storage Spaces. &nbsp;Set email alerts to ensure I know a drive is failing.<br />
7.<span> </span>Change all necessary applications on four systems to point to the new location as I add the data to the new Storage Space. Mainly this will be Acronis True Image and Syncback Pro.<br />
8.<span> </span>After the above is completed I can the start the process to create a 5-disk Storage Space for my data using 2-6TB drives, 3-3TB drives and repeating the above steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - As test drives for the new Storage spaces, I've installed in the tower 3-2TB and 2-1TB drives and connected them to the power supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I received confirmation that the LSI controller card &nbsp;and cables have shipped. The cables should be here Saturday but the controller card will not arrive until Monday per the tracking info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I install the cables and controller card I will </p>

<p>I attempted with two different setups on my Win10 x64 system using deleted volumes in each setup, thus when I start Storage Spaces only the deleted volumns are presented to me. Currently I have 19 drives (including my SSD boot drive) connected to my system.
 Five are connected to the LII SAS9211 card, five plus the SSD are connected to the motherboard, the remaining drives are connected via USB 3 ports.</p>
<p>

<li>My first attempt involved using the LSI&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SAS9211-8I 8PORT Int 6GB Sata+sas Pcie 2.0 card. Initially I thought this was a NON-RAID card but have discovered that it really is a RAID card. So far I have
 not been able to get into the BIOS of the card and ensure that the RAID function is turned off. Tomorrow I will call LSI support and see if I can determine what I'm doing wrong. Also I will look for a non-RAID card that I can use. Attached to the card are
 five drives, 2-1TB, 2-2TB and 1.5TB drive. I was going to start with just three drives and then as an exercise I would add a 4th drive and then another exercise to add the 5th drive. BTW I can and have used the drives attached to the SAS9211 card. I can write/read
 to any of the five drives.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Because the 1st attempt did not work I moved the backups off of three drives (3TB, 4Tb, 6TB). Again I get the same message. The three drives I'm attempting to work with are directly attached to my motherboard.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I've searched the internet for this error and did find other others that had encountered the error but their solution did not work for me or I did not understand what they had done.</span></p>

            <p>Have you tried just doing a Simple Provision (first option) on one of the drives directly attached to your motherboard? Maybe start small first just to see if the most basic setup works.

<p>Also, don't over provision yet. You can always increase the size of a Storage Space later.</p>

            On my system, I open Storage Spaces, I see the three unformatted drives all are selected, I click the Create Pool button, I see the window that states "Preparing Drives" and within a 2-3 seconds the message changes to "Can't create the pool". I never get
 to anything past this.

            <p>The drives I'm currently working with are directly connected the the MB. Also I do have five drives connected to the card. I can access all of the drives in the tower and can read/write to them as NTFS simple drives. At this time I just wanted to get the
 three "data" drives which are connected to the MB working in a storage space, later after I contact LSI (hopefully tomorrow) and I get the drives that are connected the the MB working then I'll retry with the drives connected to the card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current thoughts are&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Storage Space Pool with the drives connected to the MB using 1-3TB, 1-4TB and 1-6TB using Parity. After I get the initial 3 drives working and move data to it I will add a 6TB and 4TB drive to the pool. This will be for my "data" libraries.</li><li>Create a 2nd Storage Space Pool with the drives connected to the card, this will be used to backup my data. I will start with 2-2TB and 1-1.5TB drives, then add 2-1TB drives. Move existing backups to this space and as I free up larger drives I will replace
 the smaller drives. Currently I'm using 3-6TB, 4-3TB drives for my backups. Because the drives are currently NTFS simple drives some of my backup are duplicated on multiple drives. When I get storage spaces working I will only have a single backup of each
 library.</li><li>I'm creating two storage spaces because I want to seperate my "data" from my backups. I realize that both are residing in the same tower and if the system crashes or the MB dies I then need to move the two storage spaces to either one new system or two
 new systems.</li></ol>
<p>Per Hard Disk Sentinel all of my drives are good, a couple have low health and will be completely removed from the system once the drive contents are moved to the two storage pools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a layer of extra protection using Hard Disk Sentinel I will run the level 4 (Read/Write destroy data) surface test on each drive before I put it into production. Following is the description of this test from the help file.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Reinitialize disk surface</strong> (Pro version only) - Overwrites the disk surface with special initialization pattern to restore the sectors to default (empty) status and reads back sector contents, to verify if they are
 accessible and consistent. Forces the analysis of any weak sectors and verifies any hidden problems and fixes them by reallocation of bad sectors (this is drive regeneration).<br />
<br />
Enables better use of the disk as after the test the spare area will be used instead of any problematic sectors.<br />
Very intensive and time-consuming test, especially if the level (the number of overwrite cycles) is set to higher value.<br />
<br />
The simple version of this test is usually (incorrectly) called as low level format by other tools. It can be effectively used to permanently destruct stored information (Navso P-5239-26 standard data destruction).</p>
<p>This will help ensure that the drives are good. The bad news is that this takes a LONG time. Following are the time estimates for the three drives that are connected to my MB and targeted for the first storage space. If the test encounters problem areas
 the actual times for the test will increase.</p>
<ol>
<li>3TB drive - 14:05 hours</li><li>4TB drive - 22:45 hours</li><li>6TB drive - 50:50 hours&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>In that the testing on the three drives for the "data" storage space will take an elapse time of about 50 hours (the new estimate is 49 hours) I decided to kick off the same test for the five drives connected to the card. The tests are now running on the
 five drives and all will complete well before the 6TB drive attached to the MB. The estimate assumes that there will not be any issues that extend the time.</p>

            <p>I'm still doing a lot of research and find it difficult to find meaningful information for the home users. Most of the stuff I have found is for the big IT shop with 100's of disk and numerous VM systems setting on top. I understand that a lot of the big
 shop stuff applies to the home user as well but trying to get through the details of the big shop articles and rule out the stuff that does not apply to the home user has left me confused and seems to be forcing me to learn a lot of stuff that does not apply
 to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any meaningful resources (document, forums, etc.) that are easy to understand for the home user that wants to implement Storage Spaces?</p>

 that a Code 31 error will be reported to the device manager. When this error occurs, it means that the device is unavailable due to the lack of a driver.</font></font></span></p>

            Hey DrakeThorsen,
<br />
<br />Let's get you back on Windows 8.1. Please note you need a license for this to work, you do not have any downgrade rights to 8.1 when using Windows 10.
<br />
<br />That being said, here's a link to the ISO files that you need: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />I recommend using this utility to put this ISO on a spare flash drive that you have: <a href="https://rufus.ie/en_IE.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rufus.ie/en_IE.html</a>
<br />
<br />If you need any help running Rufus at all, fire back with any questions you may have. Good luck getting 8.1 on your computer.
<br />

<p>If you're sure that Windows 8.1 has drivers for your hardware, and you don't mind losing all the pre-installed software that came with your computer (or purchasing it at retail,) and you're okay with voiding your warranty and losing access to manufacturer
 technical support, and you're confident in your technical skills to do a clean install (or are okay with paying someone else to do it for you,) then you can purchase a copy of Windows 8.1 and do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can download the software for free directly from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
right here</a>&nbsp;and pay Microsoft directly after the software is installed. Instructions will appear on your screen.</p>

    <title>After Win 10 1709 update, display crashes miserably when PC wakes up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After Win 10 1709 update, display crashes miserably when PC wakes up from sleep.</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a serious display issue that I suspect Windows 10 1709 update is responsible for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I put my pc to sleep for like more than 10 hours, it wakes up on its own and the display totally crashes. As captured below, the whole screen is not working but the mouse cursor is distinguishable as it is now a separate square box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I can hear system sounds when I randomly click on the screen and keyboard input also seems to work though it's only a guess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't come back from that state unless I force reboot my PC by long pressing the power button. I know it's bad for a PC but it's really the only option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect WIn 1709 update because it's the biggest major change that's happened on this PC recently. The other candidate for the cause is Avira's startup optimization which seems to re-order many startup programs from 'during boot' --&gt; 'after boot' and so
 on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I performed this optimization long time ago and it didn't cause any problem then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm looking for an answer that can explain why this is happening and what the solution is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any further information like error Event ID from Eventviewer's&nbsp;system log, let me know. I'll follow up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate the prompt response. Could you confirm if you have updated the driver through<strong> Device Manager</strong>? If yes, you may download the latest driver from the manufacturer's site to ensure the installed driver is compatible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you have downloaded the driver directly from the manufacturer's website and still encounter the same issue, we suggest that you roll back your driver to rule out driver related issues. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on <strong>Start </strong>menu or the <strong>Windows </strong>icon.</li><li>Select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Click the drop-down arrow for the audio driver you want to restore.</li><li>Right-click on the audio driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, select<strong> Roll Back Driver</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

            Hi Susan,
<br />
<br />Yes you can buy adapters for smaller to bigger jacks. I'm thinking your needing adapter 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm. 
<br />Depending where you are, any type of Electronics store should have them. 
<br />
<br />Regards,

</p><p>
</p><p>Hi Yashwanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Firstly, I have not moved any files between the accounts which are corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I created a new account as you suggested, and that appears to work at present, although it is set to English UK as default but the keyboard is USA, and I cannot change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirdly, I ran the troubleshooter&nbsp;which showed around 30 files, but I have no idea which ones could be causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Perhaps you could explain why I am having so many problems.</p>
<p>To reiterate:</p>
<p>I have 2 accounts on which&nbsp;I can no longer access the start screen by clicking on the "windows"&nbsp;start button in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>Neither of these accounts will access&nbsp;Microsoft Edge as the icon has disappeared.</p>
<p>One of the accounts takes 2+ minutes to activate (i.e.&nbsp;from when I enter the password until the desktop appears).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway I can uninstall Windows 10 and reinstall it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting very frustrated as I have followed all the previous suggestions to resolve these problems without success.&nbsp; If they had occurred within the 30 day period I would have reverted to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to hearing from you shortly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

            <p>Hi Arun, many thanks for your prompt reply. I downloaded the Windows 10 ISO and burnt to a CD, and as suggested, I ran the program. Unfortunately, I did not have the "Automatic Repair" in the advanced options. What was there was: System restore, Command
 prompt, System image recovery, UEFI firmware settings, Startup repair and Go back to previous build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run the "Startup Repair" option but it came back with the message "Couldn't repair your PC".&nbsp; Below is the srttrail.txt file it pointed me to.</p>

<p><br />
You are better to do Copy and Paste and then delete from the old location rather than Move, particularly if you are wanting to "move" a number of documents/files in one go. If something happens in the middle of the "Move" process then you might well LOSE your
 document(s) entirely.</p>
<p>And of course you can make nested folders.</p>

The Media you choose to install from will depend on certain factors, such as the Boot Scheme used by your computer (BIOS, UEFI) in addition to the storage device (hard disk partitioning layout). Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file.

<p><span><span>如果您确定这是导致此问题的原因，如果计算机无线导致控制器或手柄断开连接，则应尝试将无线2.4Ghz频段的频道更改为其他频道。</span>
<span>如果您的计算机和路由器支持，您甚至可以更改为5Ghz。</span> <span>大多数人只有1-11可供选择。</span> <span>另一种解决方案是在计算机上使用有线连接来避免这种情况。</span>

If you are sure that this is the cause of this problem, with the computer wireless causing the controller or handle to disconnect you should try changing the channel of your wireless 2.4Ghz band to another channel. You could even change to 5Ghz if your computer
 and router support that. Most have only 1-11 to choose from. Another solution would be using wired connection on your computer to avoid this. For further information please see this page:

<h2>            Messaging&#58; You have added all the accounts available for this app</h2>
                    Okay, I just yesterday bought the new Windows 8 and I wanted to set it up.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem is that in the Messaging-app I apparently can not add my second Messenger account. Right now I got it connected to my first Messenger account and my Facebook account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But I got two Messenger accounts - why can I not connect to this one as well. I feel the Messaging-app is great, but when I can not connect to my secound account I will have to keep using Windows Live Messenger on that, and that kinda ruin my experience
 of Messaging-app.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please look into this, and post a reply.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The error I get is: "You have added all the accounts available for this app". I got a screenshot for this if you want to see.</div>

            Hi <u>ThomasKanto,</u>
<div>Sorry that you are having this problem hopefully this info will help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a security feature in Windows 8 you are unable to add multiple accounts to the Messenger Application on a single Windows Account. The reason for this is because the way that messenger is built it processes the Information from the services you are registered
 to (Windows Live, Facebook, Twitter etc...) and sort's them into their own group so that it doesn't get confused.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But if you were able to have multiple account's signed in at once it would have to work overtime to sort out the different data from the different accounts and slow down and cause errors.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only solution I can give you is to create a second user account on your Computer and use your other account for it. But there is currently no way to have 2 accounts running simultaneously for the same service,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am sorry for the inconvenience,</div>
<div>Thanks for your time, hope this helps.</div>
<div>-Ian</div>

            This is a pretty dumb "feature" and seriously has to be changed.
<div><br />
<div>I use my *personal" account to login to windows, but want to use my "public" hotmail account to do MSN chats. If I have to add a NEW user to Windows that would be more of a hassle.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please update the messenger app to allow multiple accounts, this is downright stupid right now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>edit: Oh and for some reason my hotmail account is banned from Live, for an unknown reason, so using this for Windows 8 login is already out of the question as I can't use it to play games (even games I already own on that account!). So in other words
 when I upgraded to Windows 8 I lost: e-mail, chat with contacts and whatever else I used my hotmail account for ... unless I make a new user for that account.</div>
