    <title>How to make a screenshot and send it as an email attachment - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make a screenshot and send it as an email attachment</h2>
                    <p>Please, how do you make a screenshot of a web-based&nbsp;financial platform and be able to send it as an email attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm doing now is go to the website, right click on the webpage, save as, it does so as a kernel-like icon&nbsp;containing lots of files&nbsp;using 1.41Mb. In addition to that there is an Open Office.org 1.1 Text Document as a file using only 188Kb. Assuming that
 both of these can not be opened at the same time, tried to open the lesser&nbsp;file and it opens in Libre Office&nbsp;Writer and the page appears as off-skewed and is in html&nbsp;&nbsp;and totally undecipherable. Using the save as type: Webpage Complete as well as HTML only
 and same result, totally undecipherable. I don't have a scanner, if only I could get a legible screenshot and send it as an attachment in an email, do we need a scanner in this case? Perhaps I'm not saving it in the proper format, when opening the kernel there's
 hundreds of files, essentially a no go there. I'm&nbsp;just a "babe in the woods" with computers. It all boils down to copying a webpage and sending it as an email attachment so would a&nbsp;jpeg be the&nbsp;way to do it?&nbsp;If so how do you enable that, I have not significantly
 changed anything on the computer, it's virtually&nbsp;at default on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Windows 8.1 operating system. Any help would be great, the solution may be simple, I just don't know where to look for it.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One-S Controller left stick drifting..unusable</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought the Battlefield 1 package&nbsp;version of the Xbox One-S, and the left stick of the controller that came with it is now drifting really bad, making the controller unusable.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I thought it was something physical with the controller until about a week later my other, older Xbox One "Day One 2013"&nbsp;controller started doing it too. Thinking it wasn't a coincidence, I looked&nbsp;online and&nbsp;found other&nbsp;incidents of this, learning&nbsp;it could be an update issue.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I followed the instructions given to others in the thread with the same problem:</p><p>1)&nbsp;I made sure all controllers were updated first (said each one had latest update already, but updated them again just to be sure).</p><p>2)&nbsp;Then I held the Xbox One power button for 10 seconds, to shut everything down.</p><p>3) Then I unplugged the Xbox One power cord, and left it unplugged for 5 minutes.</p><p>4) Then plugged it back in, and powered on.&nb

</p><p>Hey there, COWBELL!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm sorry to see any stick drift issues on the controller. Unfortunately, after doing all the troubleshooting you've done, this means that the controller needs to be replaced. If you bought the console within the last 90 days, the controller is still under warranty (some European countries have a 1 year warranty for accessories, though). Please reach out to our phone or chat teams via our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page to set up a replacement controller.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please keep me updated on the situation!&nbsp;I'm happy to help if you run into any snags. :)</p>

I'm just wondering if you can offer some insight, on how best to handle this so I get one that will stay usable for a significant amount of time, and hopefully where I don't have to keep paying to ship it since I already paid the first time. I'm on disability and it was hard to get it together and get it out the first time... Any&nbsp;help would be appreciated!&nbsp;Thank you!</p>
<p /></blockquote><br />
<p />
<p>What an interesting interaction from the update!&nbsp;Yes, I will suggest you reach out to our phone or chat support again (if you haven't already).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It does sound like the update had done something, rather than the controller itself having a manufacturer malfunction. Especially since your console said to update via USB when there is wireless updates available.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you get the new one, immediately connect that up to the console via USB&nbsp;cable. If you can, use a different one than the one you used last time to update it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me know if you hit any snags. I apologize for my delay in this response; we were incredibly busy due to the BC&nbsp;sale last week. However, if you need further assistance, I'm happy to help out more.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Blue Screen error</h2>
                    For the past week, I have been receiving a few BSOD. They occur after about 20-30m of running Windows 8 during the first boot up of the day. After the first BSOD of the day, the software works fine without issues. I ran sfc /scannow and memtest, it was
 fine. I also ran the chkdsk but it was fine.<br />

<strong>1.</strong> Check with the System Maker's Support&nbsp;(Motherboard Maker for custom systems), their<br />
on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums as this may be (or will be) a<br />
known issue. Update the<strong> BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and
<strong>the major on-board</strong><strong>and<br />
separate device drivers</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when<br />
possible) actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out the dust bunnies, clear
<br />
the vents, and ensure the fans are working. If a laptop about all you can do is reseat the<br />
memory and clear the vents.<br />

<strong>3.</strong> Check the hard drive for errors - run CheckDisk (see methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Test the memory very thoroughly. Keep in mind that memory tests do not detect all<br />
errors such as&nbsp;the tiny speed differences between memory modules that appear to be<br />
identical. So it may be necessary to swap the modules in and out in different combinations<br />
and patterns (see memory test methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>5. AFTER</strong> 1, 2,&nbsp;3, &amp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<strong>IF</strong> the issues continue run Driver Verifier (see nethods bekow).<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings
<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop <br />
and Start Screen.<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower
<br />
memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory
<br />
tests fail to show a problem.<br />

</p><p>The hard drive may have been displaced slightly, but that is easy to check out. Remove the cover and reseat the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse than that, the hard drive may be damaged internally, but you will not find this out until you reseat it and try to install an OS onto it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before re-installing Windows, remove the drive, connect it up as a slave to another system and then run CHKDSK on it. In some cases, this can correct issues with a drive which will not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If CHKDSK and a re-install don't work, you will have to replace the drive. You might want to have the entire machine checked out before spending cash on it..

            These crashes were related to memory corruption (probably caused by a driver).<br />
<br />
Please run these two tests to verify your memory and find which driver is causing the problem.&nbsp; Please run verifier first.&nbsp; You do not need to run memtest yet unless verifier does not find the cause, or you want to.<br />
<br />
If you are over-clocking anything reset to default before running these tests.<br />

            <p>Hi Thanks for the detailed message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Verifier but the system would crash even before getting to the loading screen. I didn't see any specific drivers, only DRIVER_VERIFIED_DETECTED_VIOLATION
</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the guide it says 'If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode. '</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean to restart the computer to boot into Safe Mode once I've selected the drivers to test?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e msconfig &gt; boot &gt; safe mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uploaded a minidump of the pre windows crash here:</p>

            <p>Hi. Sorry for the late reply on this. I have been abroad for work and haven't look at my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Malware bytes as you suggested the drivers were causing an issue. However, I am now getting another BSD. This time the rror is : SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDELED.</p>
<p>what failed: dxgmms2.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is related to graphics drivers, but most forums are related to Nvidia graphics drivers. I am using intel HD graphics card in my laptop. what to do?</p>
<p>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it
<br />
<br />Dual booting should be the same for everything or very similar at least. 
<br />
<br />Did you use any guides? It's a little complicated to explain step-by-step how to install a dual boot here but you can look at guides for ubuntu here&gt; <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-bo...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />or here &gt; <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/install-ubuntu-16-04-alongside-with-windows-10-or-8-in-dual-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tecmint.com/install-ubuntu-16-04-al...</a>
<br />
<br />The basic guide is to backup your data &gt; create a disk with ubuntu on it &gt; disable secure boot  &gt; Then boot from the USB &gt; install ubuntu

<h2>            Black ops 3 - Xbox 360 keeps crashing.</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone else experiencing their 360 crashing and other issues whilst playing BO3?</p>
<p>I've read that it may be an issue with the memory of an 'older' console... Well if this is the case, how can they release a game for a console which cannot cope with the memory requirements?</p>
<p>hope I am not alone.</p>

<p>Unlikely that it's a memory issue--All Xbox 360s, regardless of version iterations have the same specs. The only difference in them is manufacturing, which plays virtually no role in performance. It could however, be an issue with your storage device, and/or
 cache. </p>
<p>What exactly happens? Your game locks up? Console restarts? Exists to dash? All of the preceding errors are game errors and need to be dealt with by the publisher.</p>

<p>one thing you can try is clearing the consoles cache 3x to see if that helps anything.

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Sorry, this console can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play until your subscription payments are up to date.&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay get this one guys and yea ima use this thread and all other i can find for this stupid issue. I bought a pre-owned Xbox from Game Stop and this was about 3 months ago and NOW it says that same pop up "Sorry, this console can't play until your subscription
 payments are up to date." I pay the $10.00 a month for gold and the other account on it used a 12 month gold card. It was from the old owner of the Xbox 360 that never paid it.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>ALSO I HAVE TALKED TO THREE BILLING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT PEOPLE! ALL SAID THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO</em></span>!</strong> i do not know who the old owner was but this isn't fair that i paid for the Xbox
 360 and my memberships and now i can't even play my game because you guys cant figure out how to separate the old account and up date YOUR systems so i can go back to using MY Xbox.&nbsp; So yea i agree with the others. Please find a way to fix this.</p>

<p>Well if its not your account (meaning you did not create it), then theres not much you can do. What happened is called a "payment suspention" Meaning the credit card on the account was charged but not paid. Therefore it owes money. Seice its not yours. You
 cant really do anything. As far as i know, Youll have to create a new account. Sorry.</p>

<p>I've created two new accounts. It's my entire console that won't let me do anything. Once i got the pre owned Xbox 360 i deleted the other account and all the saves. Like i said both of the accounts on the Xbox are up to date. It's because of the entertainment
 plan from what i was told which is a two year contract with the person that originally bought the Xbox and then sold it to game stop which is where i come in and buy it. That account has nothing to do with me or this house hold, so i don't understand how i
 am punished for something that has nothing to do with me. </p>

<p>Since the console that was sold to you by GameStop is a console on a 2-year contract, you'll need to work with GameStop to get an exchange. It's not your fault that they sold you a console that was still tied to someone else's account.</p>

<p>That's what im currently trying to do. I figured i might as well see if Microsoft can just use the serial number to disconnect it from the other account considering they should make it so that kind of thing can be avoided. I literally waited in line for
 over 9 hours for the assassins creed 4 just so i can get home and play it and my roommate was watching netflix when i walked in and then ONCE i turned it on in my room because i had to move it from rooms that pop up happened and now i cant even play it so
 i not only wasted all my time but also all my money because Microsoft didn't just make a way so they can separate the accounts for this kind of thing. Game stop is one of their main ways of selling what they have to sell so you would think they'd figure things
 like this would happen. I'm just trying to get this fixed so i can go back to playing what i paid for.</p>

<p>Okay so far what's going on is i can't exchange the Xbox because it's passed the return date. Microsoft WON'T just cut the tie or let me send it to them and they send me a different Xbox even though i have a warranty. I am now forced to wait 1-2 weeks just
 for a possibility to get the 2 year contract removed or moved into my name and to be honest after all this i really don't think im even going to be helped. So it's game stops fault for them selling a Xbox with a two year contract and Microsoft's fault for
 not telling game stop to not buy those Xboxes from anyone because of this exact reason. I paid full price for a pre owned xbox and now i cant even get what i paid for? And i even have the warranty but it doesn't cover this? Anyone have any suggestions for
 me to do? OTHER THEN PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR MICROSOFT SINCE YOU GUYS ARE NO HELP!</p>

<p>Honestly if you have already talked to MS on the phone and they said tjey will try and transfer the old account to you there really isnt much else for you to do. Although I am rather curious why they wont fix this issue for you if you bought a warranty for
 the console. How did you purchase the warranty? From gamestop or from MS through xbox.com?</p>

<p>They wont transfer the old account because the old account isn't mine. They said their going to try and get rid of the contract or change it into my name. Which i doubt they will do. I bought the warranty at the same time as the console at game stop. Its
 showing on their systems though. They know i have the warranty but apparently it just doesn't matter. I'm getting NO help from Micro soft even though all i SHOULD have to do is send them the Xbox and they A: send me the same one but without the contract. OR
 Just delete the contract and all traces of it. Or even just completely erase everything on the Xbox. The formatting didn't work either i tried that. This is just straight insane that i had to pay FULL price for the pre owned Xbox and no help by the people
 that made the system. </p>

<p>They can't just "delete the contract". It's a legally binding contract that the person electronically signed/agreed to when they purchased said console. Eventually, these consoles are banned if the payment on them is not made. You won't be able to get any
 help from Microsoft on this matter because they won't be able to simply change the name on the contract to yours, it's not how these things work, and it would be illegal to do so.<br />
<br />
You'll need to go back to the place of purchase and get them to take the console back. Wherever you purchased it from should not be selling contracted Xbox 360's. That's their fault for even accepting a console without looking at it or confirming that it was
 under contract.</p>

<p>Microsoft still should have made a way that they can handle this kind of problem because im not the only one that this has happened to. I know its game stops fault which is why im going after them as well. Still doesn't change the fact that they should have
 made a way to either change the name or to be able to take the system back and send out a different one. Especially since i can prove that i DID NOT agree to their terms nor did i sign ANY contract. So basically why should i be screwed over by both game stop
 for selling me this and microsoft for not making a way to fix it? Its just nuts.</p>

<p>G'day Blader! So sorry to hear that you've had to go through this mess with a pre-owned Entertainment For All console, and I wish I was able to help directly from here.<br />
<br />
<strong>You've taken the right steps to get this sorted out.</strong> It looks like the proper team is now investigating the case and they will do what they can to get you back to gaming. Please understand that it can take some time to look into this though.
 Hassassinade has it right in that the contract can't simply be deleted. That contract binds the console you have to the person who registered for the plan, and there's a process to untangle that big knot.<br />
<br />
The team that's taken your case will be in touch with you as they make progress, so please keep an eye on your email inbox and spam folder! If you don't hear from them within the estimated time frame they provided, go ahead and give our phone team another call
 with the case reference number and they can see what's up.</p>

<h2>            USB 2.0 Driver</h2>
                    <p>Connection a Dash Cam to a USB port 2.0 to view files on my dash cam. Cam did not seem to function properly, only able to view or do certain stuff. After I unplugged the Dash Cam &amp; inserted cable to my cell phone which I used to transfer pix to or from my
 cell phone I noticed there was no longer a connection &amp; unable to see Cell Phone Icon anymore. Maybe there was a virus on the dash cam (is this possible?) as it said windows cannot connect, there is a problem with you're driver. I uninstalled the driver, reinstalled
 the driver to no avail. It keeps saying the best driver is already installed. There is no CD for the cell phone to install a driver nor is there one for the dash cam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Win7 &amp; using a Sky 5.0W cell phone&nbsp; android v4.4.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!! Driver wanted...USB 2.0 DRIVER or whatever works.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may experience this challenge if there is an issue with the cable that you are using to connect to the computer. To isolate the issue, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried using another cable?</li><li>Have you connected to another computer using the affected cable?</li><li>Did you try to connect the phone and the dash cam to another computer?</li></ul>
<p>Also, we would like to request a screenshot showing the error. Please make sure that any personal information isn't visible on the screenshot.</p>

<p>Thx for reply. I tried 3 different cables all with the same results. I have not tried another computer as I only have one &amp; never thought of using a friends computer but when I explained my problem I was told maybe I have a virus on my cell phone &amp; the person
 was worried their computer may get infected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened Device Manager &amp; tried to update driver but it said the best driver is already installed. Windows said there is a problem with the USB 2.0 driver but Microsoft update does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could take a screenshot as requested but now I am on Win7 &amp; do not know how to access the clipboard app to view screenshot files. When I was on WinXP I would go into sys32 &amp; send clipboard shortcut to desktop. Now I can't find clipboard on Win7, just one
 (says clipboard) that does a screenshot just like the print screen app, but where are the files it takes a pix of? Where do I find clipboard on Win7 to view the files so I can show you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, Thx for you're reply.</p>
<p>~~~vapor~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Please note* I forgot to mention I am on Win7 Ultimate 32 bit. Thank You.</p>

<p>Thank you for updating us with the status of this concern. To better isolate the issue, we suggest that you try to connect another device and also use another USB port to see if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for taking the screenshot, press the<strong> Print Scrn</strong> key on your keyboard then open
<strong>Paint</strong>. After that, press <strong>Ctrl + V </strong>simultaneously to paste the screenshot. Save it by pressing
<strong>Ctrl + S</strong> at the same time. A window will open and choose the file format as
<strong>JPEG/JPG</strong> then press <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Bart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the screenshot you provided, receiver see your status is "Presenting", it states that you are trying to present your screen, if the receiver didn't click "Accept the Meeting", see
<em><strong>sreenshot 1</strong></em>, it will show "Connecting" on your side like the
<em><strong>screenshot 2</strong></em>, and the receiver will see "Accept the Meeting Content" or "Ignore" on their side, if the receiver want to see your screen, they should click the "Accept the Meeting", then they can see your screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Screenshot 1</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4cf38b93-e8a0-4d5c-a169-0659a46f655b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4cf38b93-e8a0-4d5c-a169-0659a46f655b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Screenshot 2</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af2c0fd2-4fb6-4f41-8700-6b95a03cdd29?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af2c0fd2-4fb6-4f41-8700-6b95a03cdd29?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, please make sure the receives click the "Accept Meeting Content" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you shared your screen, but the receiver can't receive your request, they can't see the "Accept the Meeting" or "Ignore" button, it will&nbsp;generate the issue you mentioned. So we will narrow down if this issue is the receivers can't receive your
 share screen request or the receive didn't click the "Accept the Meeting" button. So, please choose a contact and send the test IM to him, after that, you click share your desktop with this contact. At this time, please ask the receiver capture a complete
 screenshot like my <em><strong>screenshot 1,&nbsp;</strong></em>we will help to check if the receiver can receive your share screenshot request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, if this issue is the receivers can't receive your screen sharing request, please logon your Skype for Business account on other PC/client to check if this issue relate to your Skype for Business accoun or your Skype for Business client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, may I know have you follow my above method to delete the Skype for Business cache?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Bart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback. Now, I understand that this issue may relate to your contacts can't receive your screen sharing request and they can't accept your screen sharing request, then you can't share your screen with you contacts. To focus on this point,
 please help to check following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If you can send messages or have a call with these contacts who you can't share screen?</li><li>If these contacts can share their screen with you?</li><li>May I know if you are not able share screen with others all along? Since it may relate to policy and the company policy can't allow you share the screen.</li><li>May I know if there is any other people in your organization also can't share the screen with others?</li><li>May I know if you are using Skype for Business online service or Skype for Business on premise? If you are not familiar with us, please involve your organization admin to confirm it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, in order to further investigation, please help to&nbsp;logon your Skype for Business account on other PC/client to check if this issue relate to your Skype for Business account or your Skype for Business client. You can ask your admin to check it,
 you can add your Skype for Business account on your personal PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total process which solves
<br />
the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461</span></a><br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
Hope these help.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Expansion Pass &#43; DLC missing from &#38;&#35;39&#59;Ready to Install&#38;&#35;39&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently had a network issue while moving from one location to another in Destiny. &nbsp;I received the 'boar' error code that indicated the DLC purchased may have been damaged or corrupted. &nbsp;I cleared the Xbox One cache, which didn't change anything. &nbsp;I uninstalled
 Destiny, took 3 days to re-install/download updates etc. &nbsp;When I again got into the game, the DLC was still missing. &nbsp;It does not show under installed or 'Ready to Install'. &nbsp;I uninstalled my expansion pass as well thinking I may fix it by re-installing that,
 but that has also not shown up in 'Ready to Install'. &nbsp;The marketplace for the expansion pass, and both the expansions I
<strong>had already downloaded once</strong> all show that I have to<strong> pay for them again</strong>. &nbsp;I no longer have the code I used to redeem the expansion pass almost a year ago. &nbsp;There is no support information available on why this content has disappeared
 or how to get it back without paying for it again. &nbsp;My account is in good standing. I would appreciate some help with this matter.</p>

    <title>Explorer.exe and task manager - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Explorer.exe and task manager</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 home premium</p>
<p>I have this weird problem. explorer.exe is using 50-60% of CPU.<br />
If I open task manger and maximize the screen CPU usage returns to normal.<br />
However once I minimize or close task manager explorer.exe returns to heavy CPU usage.<br />
I can do this constantly (maximise and minimize task manager) and CPU usage keeps changing.<br />
Very strange (and no I have not had anything to drink)<br />
<br />
Cheers</p>

<p>The culprit was Stardock's DeskScapes.<br />
When using a maximized screen DeskScapes does not come into play. However when you restore down it does.<br />
I do not know if all the animated backgrounds are effecteed or if it was just the one I was using.<br />
Changed to a static background and all OK.<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />
