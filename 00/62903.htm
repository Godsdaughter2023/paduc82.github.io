<h2>            Email Not Working All of a Sudden - NEED URGENT FIX</h2>
                    All of a sudden I can't receive emails. I forwarded myself something for work and it's not in my inbox. Nothing has appeared in my inbox for a few days now. I have not changed any settings. All I get is spam from porn sites and political crap. I need to
 respond to a message by tonight or my job is in jeopardy. I am using Outlook on Windows 10 and I have also tried the live.com website and the problem is both places.

            Hi Starwind 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Can you email from live.com to any other email address other than your work one?
<br />So send a message to a friend or family etc do they get it?

            Your best bet then is to contact Microsoft directly so they can look at your account.

<h2>            Windows 10 Dell Latitude E6410 - sound problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to resolve the issue I've just faced. Spent whole evening on it and couldn't resolve. I have Dell Latitude E6410&nbsp; with Windows 10 professional on it. It worked perfectly till the latest update came from November, 10th which I've installed
 just today. I lost the sound in the system. As I understood, Windows 10 recognized 2 sound devices - speakers/headphones (default) and some kind of phone connections (sorry I have it in Russian and can't translate 100% accurate). But in reality speakers/headphones
 (default) device doesn't work, all sound goes through the phone connections, some system-hardware relations mistake. I deleted drivers and rebooted laptop - Win 10 installed them same way. I've tried to download drivers from Dell - it says new system is not
 supported and it can't be installed. I got the sound back by turning off&nbsp;speakers/headphones (default), but I can't control anything - their is a sound and I can listen music/watch video but sound buttons doesn't work since they all related to&nbsp;speakers/headphones
 (default which I turned off). Your help will be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I partly solve the issue using the link below (everything else didn't help). I installed some common driver even Windows was saying it is not compatible with my device . I have sound back, sometimes it doesn't respond (can't increase/decrease sound bar)
 but it is better than nothing.<br />

            <p>I had the same problem and found a fix. I have installed this audio driver (the 2nd one on the page, the Hard-Drive file format) in compatibility mode for Windows 8 (even though I'm on Windows 10, I gave it a try) :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/ca/en/cabsdt1/drivers/DriversDetails?productCode=latitude-e6410&amp;driverId=R278544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/ca/en/cabsdt1/drivers/DriversDetails?productCode=latitude-e6410&amp;driverId=R278544</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are the steps to follow :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Right click on the "IDT_92HDXXX-HD-AUDIO_A17_R278544" file</p>
<p>- Select "Properties"</p>
<p>- Click on the "Compatibility" tab</p>
<p>- Check the "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and select Windows 8</p>
<p>- Click "Apply", then "OK"</p>
<p>- Run the program and follow the steps (it will end up asking to reboot your computer, do it)</p>
<p>- When the laptop is back on, right click on your speaker icon (bottom right) and select "Sounds"</p>
<p>- Click on the "Playback" tab and select "Speakers / Headphones"</p>
<p>- Right click on it and select "Properties"</p>
<p>- Click on the "Enhancements" tab and check "Loudness Equalization"</p>
<p>- Click "Apply" (preview results if you want) , then "OK"</p>
<p>- Go on YouTube and play a video as the ultimate test</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem fixed !!!</p>

    <title>one week xbox live suspension - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radsean paul  say:</h3>
<h2>            one week xbox live suspension</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Sean, and i have just received a weekly suspension, which completely shocked me, I'm not an aggressive or foul mouthed&nbsp;player. I play pubg with random guys and during the squad chat, yesterday I think, someone (I know his gamertag) starts cussing at me, I think as he died and I couldn't help him, so I retaliated in a private message mentioning a couple of bad words to him. I guess I should have used my mic and cussed at him back during the game rather than send a message. Is that acceptable to not receive a ban then, is it okay to cuss live in the game? I guess I have to bite my tongue from now on. But for these bans we should be given a prior warning, not handed a weekly ban from voice/text communication straight up. I'm losing patience with Xbox live service here. Before I played this game, I never received any bans. This is crazy.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Tom.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try letting Windows Update reinstall them first to see if the problem continues as sometimes it doesn't repeat.  
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this pertains to Chrome Browser you can also try resetting it in it's Advanced Settings, or uninstall it from Windows 10 in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, restart PC and then reinstall from a fresh download.  
<br />
<br />Then make sure Flash Player is working for all browsers by running this tool:  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a>.  If it needs installing then be sure to uncheck the boxes for the freeware freeloaders which are NEVER needed.

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

</span></span></span><span>What is the make &amp; model of the keyboard?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>

Adding to TaurArian’s suggestion, </span><span>you may check if you are able to use the on-screen keyboard correctly:</span></p>

<h2>            Running and Optimising an Older Game</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to run Brave Dwarfs 2 on windows 10 but I have come across several issues in the process. The main issue is the seed of the game - everything moves in slow motion even when optimised and with appropriate affinity settings (assuming that is 0 CPU).
 Setting the priority higher does speed up the game but glitches the game out making it look like a sweet piece of vaporwave art but renders the game unplayable - can anyone please help?&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. The compatibility mode is a feature in Windows 10 that would allow users to run older programs in their devices. Based on the result that you've shared, we'd recommend contacting the developer of the specified software to check
 if there are available updates or emulator for this program that would enable it to work in the latest version of Windows.

<h2>            PC powers up by itself</h2>
                    My PC that has Vista 64bit powers up by itself. I was on this PC XP&nbsp;loaded and looked up when I heard the post beep, I quickly depressed the power button and unplugged the power cord from the wall. My friend was over earlier installing software for me.
 I was wondering if he gave himself remote access rights as he was admin today on it. If he did do this, he powered my PC from home and is that possible?<br />

The PC can't be powered ON remotely without special means however it could have rebooted<br />
on its own or it could have BIOS settings that allowed it to wake up. Could it have been in<br />
Sleep or Hibernate mode?<br />

            Try the following possible fix: 
<br />Re-registering the Taskbar
<br />
<br />If the issue resurfaces, then try this method to fix it using Windows Powershell. Powershell is a command-line tool to configure system settings and automate Windows tasks.
<br />
<br />First, create a system restore point and then follow these steps to use Windows Powershell for fixing taskbar issues:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key on your keyboard and type in powershell. Right-click Windows Powershell (Desktop App) and select Run as administrator. Select Yes in the UAC window that pops up.
<br />2. Now paste the following command, as suggested in Answers, in the PowerShell window and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />4. Scroll down to locate the folder named TileDataLayer and delete this folder.
<br />
<br />If you are unable to delete this folder, Run services.msc to open the Services Manager, scroll down to Tile Data model server service and stop it. Now try to delete the folder again.
<br />
<br />5. Now check if your taskbar is working as expected.

<h2>            My Windows 10 Laptop Shuts Down Itself When the Battery Reaches about 20&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm currently running the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) in an HP Pavilion 10-f001au laptop. The problem starts after I upgraded to the Fall Creators Update. My laptop now shuts itself down inproperly when the battery reaches about 20%. The shutdown
 is abnormal, because it's like when you force your computer to shut down with the button (no "Shutting down..." animation). When I turn it back on, everything starts normally but I'd lose all my opened windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating the Microsoft AC Adapter and ACPI-Compliant drivers but it had no success. I also tried resetting my windows and had no success too. I have my Windows right now updated to the latest version. My power configuration is attached on the
 image below:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I thank you for your responses and looking further for answers</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused by system conflicts. We appreciate the information you've provided to help us understand the issue. However, we need some clarifications for further isolation. Can you answer the questions below?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What do you mean by " I also tried resetting my windows"? Did you reset the PC back to default settings or did a restart/reboot of Windows system?</li><li>If you reset it back to default, how did you do it?</li><li>When you turned it on, is it connected to the charger? If yes, how many battery percentage does it have?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, try performing a clean boot to help eliminate software conflicts that might be one cause of the issue as well. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to perform a clean boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out to your response. </p>

<div>Thank you for the response,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I did <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>factory reset</em></span> my Windows. I did it via boot menu (F8 when it boots), and selected that one with "Reset Windows, delete apps, and keep your files". So I think the clean boot isn't an
 option because I have no apps installed that can make such a conflict? (I will still going to try clean boot today. Thanks for the suggestion!)</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>And yes I connected my charger when it booted, otherwise it won't boot because the system detects no battery charge available.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Upon writing this reply I purposely let my battery drop and waited it until it shut itself down. My last check was 17%, about 10 seconds before it died. After the laptop shut down, I plugged the battery and turned it back on and saw 20% (Charging) battery
 and I had to reopen all windows. So it's like charging normally. But why would it died at 17%?</p>

<p>Thank you for the response. If you're still experiencing the issue even after doing a factory reset, then this might be caused by a hardware related issue. We suggest contacting the device manufacturer directly for hardware diagnostics, specifically on the
 battery of the device, to help check for hardware failures. </p>

<h2>            windows 10- system password- not users login</h2>
                    Three year old Lenova z710.&nbsp; Upgraded from 8.1 to Win 10 a few days ago.&nbsp; User login pw stayed the same. Dvd drive would not work so I shut down and tried to open BIOS (separate button from power button on my machine)&nbsp;&nbsp;to check the boot order.&nbsp;A password
 box opened that did not accept my login password.&nbsp; This never happened with Win 8.1.&nbsp; Is there a standard system or admin password that&nbsp; Win 10 requires that Win8.1 did not?&nbsp; How do I set or, probably,&nbsp;an admin password?

<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing issues with accessing the&nbsp;BIOS password. We will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know&nbsp;you are the administrator to access the BIOS on your device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that only the system administrator with all the permissions can access the BIOS. If you haven't set the BIOS password, the manufacturer might have set it for the laptop/ computer owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that you can access it only if you know the password. If not you will have to contact the computer seller/ manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. Feel free to contact us for further assistance on Windows Operating System, we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

<h2>            Determine O&#47;S Version</h2>
                    <p>My Dell laptop had an Windows 7 Ultimate when given to me so I know it is not the O/S bundled with it when bought. I was not given the installers or the recovery disk. The recovery partition was deleted when the new O/S was installed. Dell does not support
 it anymore. The product key sticker is no longer on the laptop case. How can I find out if the O/S is full version, OEM version, or RETAIL version? I am asking because I want to find out if I can transfer it to another computer. I do not know if I can rely
 on the return from running "slmgr /dli" from command prompt.</p>

            Hi BeautyAVS,
<br />
<br />Odds are it is an OEM license since it is on a Dell laptop.
<br />
<br />Right Click the Start Button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in or copy and paste. Then hit ENTER.
<br />
<br />slmgr -dli
<br />
<br />On the Description line it will say  OEM. Volume, or Retail. Only the Retail can be moved to another computer after being removed from that one.
<br />
<br />Hope that helps you.       
        </p>

            Its OEM.
<br />
<br />If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.

<p>You may have missed a point. I said I know the O/S is NOT THE ONE ORIGINALLY BUNDLED with the laptop. And at this point, I may opine that a store would not bundle an ULTIMATE with a laptop unless the buyer asked for it at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I implied I tried "slmgr /dli" (in command prompt) which returned "Windows(R) operating system, RETAIL channel..." and "Status: Licensed" but I said I do not know if I can rely on this information.</p>

<p>Thank you. Your reply is quite helpful. But I did mention "slmgr /dli". This implies I tried it and it returned: "Description: Windows(R) Operating System, RETAIL channel"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really looking for assurance that I can transfer because I am thinking of buying or building a new PC and transfer the O/S. This entails a sizeable cash outlay and if the transfer does not work, I will have to add another substantial amount for an O/S.</p>

            We are unable to determine that. The COA sticker would be the determinant factor or having the original license. The Windows 10 install will identify all as retail, whether you upgraded from a retail or OEM license.

            Yes I fully understand as Windows will cost between 99 to 199 to purchase a new license.

<h2>            Apple iPod nano not compatible with Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>original title: Apple iPod nano</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is Microsoft ignoring the huge problem of incompatibility of Windows 8 with iPod nano devices. I have seen many frustrated nono owners who are desperate to solve that problem. What are they waiting for????????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 5th generation iPod nano is not recognized by my new HP computer with Windows 8. I continually get WDF_violation blue screens every time I plug it in. I send the info to Microsoft and there is nothing but silence and inaction. Apple blames Microsoft and
 their new software. Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves. Why can't someone from Microsoft and Apple sit down and work out the issue of compatability. I can't believe that is in the interest of either company not to do so and do so quickly. Until it is
 done I will spread the word that Windows 8 is a piece of "poor workmanship" (code for you know what) and shouldn't be touched with a 10 foot pole. A pox on Microsoft if they don't get their act together quickly! Apple customers should think twice before buying
 an Apple product thinking it will automatically be compatible with Windows 8.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft does work with third party device developers when they request help to make their devices compatible with a particular version of Windows. This is one of the main reasons that the MSDN (Microsoft Developers Network) exists.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
If you look at the Windows Update History in a Windows 8 computer, you will likely see many Compatibility Updates. These updates are the result of the collaboration between Microsoft and the app, device developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
However, they do not normally have any input in the development, testing, or distribution of those devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a device manufacturer states that the device is compatible with a particular version of Windows by including it in the System Requirements, this means that they have tested the device with that version of Windows and found it to be compatible. The ultimate
 responsibility for compatibility is up to the device developer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, Microsoft does collaborate with Apple, Google, and most other major Software, Hardware developers. Business is business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>
        </p>

What specifically is your issue.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have installed iTunes 10.7 and 11.0 on Win8 and sync my iPod classic without issue.

            You have an<strong><u> iPod classic.</u></strong>&nbsp; Obviously, it is compatible with W 8. I have a 5th generation iPod nano and it is not, per Microsoft HQ in Redmond WA. I downloaded iTunes 11.0 and it was no help. An Apple tech told me that there is nothing
 that can currently be done to correct the problem.&nbsp; So, I am sitting here with an iPod that I can't sync to download new music purchases to it. So, I won't buy another song until that is no longer a problem. I assume others think the same way.&nbsp; That can't
 be good for their iTunes sales business. There is no way in hades that I am going to buy songs that I can't download to my nano, even if I CAN listen to them on my computer or burn them to CD's and listen on my stereo. I want portability. That is what iPod
 nanos and other portable Apple devices are all about.

<p>My 5th generation iPod nano is not recognized by my new HP computer with Windows 8. I continually get WDF_violation blue screens every time I plug it in. I send the info to Microsoft and there is nothing but silence and inaction. Apple blames Microsoft and
 their new software. Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves. Why can't someone from Microsoft and Apple sit down and work out the issue of compatability. I can't believe that is in the interest of either company not to do so and do so quickly. Until it is
 done I will spread the word that Windows 8 is a piece of "poor workmanship" (code for you know what) and shouldn't be touched with a 10 foot pole. A pox on Microsoft if they don't get their act together quickly! Apple customers should think twice before buying
 an Apple product thinking it will automatically be compatible with Windows 8.</p>

Restore your classic to factory settings within itunes.&nbsp; This will work.&nbsp; Your music will be wiped from the device, but you can then immediately sync it up.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it seems to be a problem with apple ipod devices and their security feature that disallows just any computer to hook up and take music off of the device.&nbsp; Restoring the ipod will trick it into thinking your computer is its' first time.&nbsp;

            You can download to an I pod nano using windows 8. I just did it. In windows find the download you purchased, copy it. Open I tunes and under you device click on music. Go to edit and click on paste. This will paste it&nbsp;into your music list, then at the
 bottom of your music list on the right you will see sync. Click that. It works.

                    <p>I'm doing an in-place update with an ISO file from the C drive. When I click setup it works fine and the blue screen progresses all the way to 100%. But after it says it's going to reboot, nothing happens and a window pops up saying "Windows 10 installation

<p>
</p><p>I have to use an ISO because regular updates download/install fine but when I restart, no updates are made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the setuperr log file from the panther folder from the ISO installation. There are a lot of registry errors. In particular it mentions which seems relevant: InstallAtShutdown: The system cannot find the path specified. [0x00000003]</p>

    <title>Controller is broken and refuse to fix it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jk im black  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller is broken and refuse to fix it</h2>
                    
<p>So I talked to Xbox support about my controller not working properly. The right analog stick constantly drifts upwards which makes it practically impossible to play first person shooter games or if I attempt so will make me sick to my stomach as it simulates
 a 10+ minute roller coaster ride. The X button will not work for games such as NBA 2K15 and will not release a shot at all, therefore forcing me to use the as mentioned drifting right analog stick that will again refuse to let me shoot the ball. My problem
 is you guys (Microsoft) won't even allow people to mail in their controllers to get fixed for a certain amount and shipped back. Why is that? I thought this was supposed to be customer service.</p>
<p>Instead, I got that I would have to pay 60 dollars for a new controller, plus shipping and handling instead of just driving to the Gamestop not even a mile from my house and on top of that if it breaks in any way after 90 days I'm ***. You guys will not
 even fix it in any way for a fixed price. I have looked on Youtube for ways on how to fix my controller myself, the X button problem from what I'm seeing is basically impossible to fix yourself due to the wiring in the controller. The analog sticks are fixable
 but first you need a specific tool you'll have to go to a hardware store for and then order some cheap analog sticks on Ebay for something like maybe 10 bucks at most from China.</p>
<p>So again, you have to wait at least a week to even fix the analog stick problem yourself. I have been a loyal Xbox fan since the original Xbox, I've had multiple red rings of deaths but other than that I never had a problem with the Xbox controllers on any
 system. I don't expect you guys to fix my controller for free especially if it's after the warranty is expired but the fact that you guys do not offer even an option of "mail it in and we'll fix it for 20 dollars" screams cheap and that you guys are not worrying
 about the customers. If you want a controller to work, well you have to buy a brand new one that'll charge shipping and handling for and of course wait for it to get to your house.</p>
<p>This problem isn't anything new since you guys have made threads about it, other people have made threads about it, there are posts on other websites about it and multiple Youtube videos on how the controllers are bad, how you guys refuse to do anything
 about them if the warranty is expired and videos on how to attempt to fix them yourself. My point being, why don't you guys at least look at your policy on this situation because honestly it's sad that people who have supported your company for so many years
 are getting *** by the lack of empathy to even fix a controller at a fixed price.</p>

<p>Hi JK IM BLACK,</p>
<p>Unless the warranty for your controller is still valid, you will either have to fix the controller yourself or buy a new controller to fix the joystick problem.</p>
<p>I'd like to recommend some helpful tip for using your controllers in order to get the most usage out of them. I personally have had an Xbox 360 for almost five years and the original controllers I have used, and still use, are still in good condition.</p>
<p>1. Try to buy Microsoft certified controllers as they *usually* last longer than cheaper off-brands</p>
<p>2. Store your controllers, and your console and accessories for that matter, in a room temperature and dry room.</p>
<p>3. Be gentle with your controller, especially if you're playing first person shooters with a mic (AKA don't let your emotions out on your controller)</p>
<p>4. If you do not want to undergo the first three tips, buy a longer warranty to ensure that you are covered every time you play.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can be back to gaming in no time!</p>

<p>Sorry, followed every single tip you gave without even trying. Even if I bought a longer warranty I've had the controller since launch date. A year warranty would've expired November 2014, as I stated in my original post I HAVE looked up ways to fix my controller.
 The analog problem would cost at least 10 dollars in parts, the X button has no way to be fixed due to the way they set up the controller.</p>
<p>So once again, my original plea...JUST CHARGE US A SET FEE TO FIX THE CONTROLLER AND SEND IT BACK.</p>

<p>Also it's not an Xbox 360 controller that is having this problem it's an Xbox One, such as yourself I have owned an Xbox 360 for quite some time. Since launch date of that console to be exact, I have had multiple controllers for that console and none have
 ever broken. But all of a sudden 2 years into owning an Xbox One I already have a controller broken and have seen a lot of evidence from people online that I am far from the only one.</p>
<p>So why are these controllers 60 dollars again? The same as a new video game? I thought these controllers were supposed to be new and improved. Not just a new way of spending money every 6 months or so. And also apparently you can't say
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp;<span>on these forums or else it's a bad word</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 USB 3.0 xHCI driver problem</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Hello all,<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I bought my Acer V3-772G about 1 month ago.<br />
</p>
<p>Yesterday everything was working fine and today i noticed than none of the 4 USB ports were working (laptop was suspended since yesterday)<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>No USB connected sound, nothing. Mouse/pendrive/HDDs/... does not work. They work in Linux and BIOS so its not a hardware problem.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that on the device manager I had problems with the "USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller Driver" as the driver was not loaded. I saw online people saying to unistall and reboot. Did that and again no USB working, on device manager, the device with
 problems was now "USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller".<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16267bbd-91f1-4a13-aa6f-e54cbfa2659c" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I tried the following with NO success:<br />
</p>
<p>-Downloaded "USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller Driver" from Intel website (available only for W7) - Didnt work<br />
</p>
<p>-Full windows restart - The same<br />
</p>
<p>-Unplugged battery and power for some mins, rebooted - Same<br />
</p>
<p>-Deleted all USB devices (hubs and so on), rebooted - They showed up the same<br />
</p>
<p>-Unistalled all updates from 2 days before (till the point I know it was working) - Driver dates changed to month before - Same result<br />
</p>
<p>-Tried to search on BIOS to disable USB3.0 and put 2.0 - Did not find<br />
</p>
<p>-Tried to run the advanced start to disable driver verification in order to install the W7 drivers - Did not find the startup options using advanced restart or recovery (Acer: ALT+F10 while booting) (explained

HERE</a>)</p>
<p>-Tried to check BIOS options to disable xHCI USB3.0 in Advanced tab - Didnt find (explained
<a href="http://community.acer.com/t5/Notebooks-Netbooks/Acer-V3-772G-UEFI-BIOS-advanced-settings/m-p/236446" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>)</p>
<p>-Tried to go back to other restore point - Didnt work, complained that disk may be corrupted<br />
</p>
<p>-Executed Widnows chkdsk /r several times - No errors found - Nothing solved<br />
</p>
<p>-Defragmented disk - No errors, didnt help<br />
</p>
<p>-Executed chkdsk /r - No errors, solved nothing<br />
</p>
<p>-Tried to make a repair (refresh) without loosing files (using recovery partitions) - Didnt manage (Told me that was unable and nothing was changed)<br />
</p>
<p>-Used a DVD of W8.1 of a friend to execute recover - Wile trying to recover, told me that disk/partition was locked - Checked and its NOT
<br />
</p>
<p>-Used command prompt (via windows recovery on boot) and copied all files from backup drive (i guess) X:\Windows\System32\Drivers\usb* to local drive C:\Windows\System32\Drivers - Rebooted - Still nothing&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea or any help? They just stopped working. I bough laptop already with windows 8.1 and they worked for 1 month<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
