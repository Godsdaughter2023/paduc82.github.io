<h2>            Designer Bluetooth&#174; Mouse doesn&#39;t move after using for a while</h2>
                    I have a Designer Bluetooth Mouse, after I connect it to my laptop for a few hours then It can't move anymore. I tried to pair again but It can't connected to my laptop. I tried to fix troubleshooting in OS but everything is OK, I mean it doesn't have
 problem with drivers or something else. My version of windows is Win10 version 1709, OS build&nbsp; 16299.192

    <title>windows 10 basic display driver resolution options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danp83  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 basic display driver resolution options</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a desktop and an ultra wide monitor (2560x1080), and the max resolution option is 1280 x 1024 with all resolutions stretching to the display to the screen obscuring it visually.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver in the system is "microsoft basic display driver" version 10.0.17134.1&nbsp; Updating the drivers does nothing, as it says it's all up to date.&nbsp; It also doesn't allow me to uninstall the drivers or try to revert to an older version (these options are
 blanked out).&nbsp; I've searched quite a bit and found nothing that works.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any advice?&nbsp; Also - is there the possibility that my computer just isn't capable of accommodating for that resolution?<br />
<br />
My tower is: HP Pro 6005 SFF AMD athlon II X2 B28 3.40GHz, 16GB DDR3, Windows 10 Pro 64 Bits</p>

            Hey there Dan, I believe this is an issue with you not seeming to have a Graphics card. Your on-board graphics may not have the ability to display such a high, stretched resolution.

            Hi Dan
<br />
<br />If you are running the Microsoft basic display driver, that means you basically have no video driver loaded on your system . . .
<br />
<br />That driver is meant to be used when installing Windows so you can see what you are doing and then you must install the correct video driver for your system . . .
<br />
<br />That HP system has Nvidia graphics, you should install the correct driver for that from the link below . . .
<br />

<p>if the monitor supports the resolution, then the display drivers or capability could be the issue.</p>

            Hi Dan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's only a placeholder driver which doesn't give decent resolution or allow Sleep or Hibernate.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues with Windows Updates one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I can no longer see email Subject lines of any old email &nbsp;upon opening a&nbsp;subfolder of the Storage Folders&nbsp;but for the latest in that subfolder prior to opening it! Instead, a vertical lineup of all these old emails waiting to be opened appears to the left

</blockquote>
<p>I'm sorry, I'm having difficulty visualizing the display you're seeing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I'd just say that if you imported a lot of folders and messages, it will take some time for Windows Live Mail to index them all. The message list is simply a set of entries from the message database index, and until the index is complete, it will
 not necessarily be an accurate representation of the messages actually residing in a particular folder. When you select one of the messages, the program tries to find the message&nbsp;you selected to display its contents.&nbsp;This may produce unpredictable results
 if the index is incomplete.&nbsp;It's as well to allow the program to get on with its housekeeping undisturbed - e.g. overnight - before using the program.
<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you go through this procedure, e.g.&nbsp;before bedtime:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Windows Live Mail, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options and on the <em>General</em> tab deselect
<em>Send and receive messages at start-up</em> and <em>Check for new messages every</em> n
<em>minutes. </em>This is to avoid any disturbance to the indexing process caused by the arrival of new messages.</li><li>Press Ctrl-Shift-Escape to open Task Manager. You may have to adjust the size of the window to be able to see the lists of processes. Look for
<em>Windows Live Mail (32 bit)</em> in the <em>Processes</em> list.</li><li>Close down Windows Live Mail and wait until <em>Windows Live Mail (32 bit) </em>
has disappeared from the Task Manager <em>Processes</em> list.</li><li>Re-launch the program and leave it alone for several hours, e.g. go to bed!</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>By morning, the program will most probably have finished indexing all those new files. Have a look and then come back here and tell us what you found.</p>

<p>It's hard to make a firm diagnosis without knowing the full text of the message you are seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, when a web browser tells you that your connection is not secure, it means to say that the web page you are trying to view cannot establish a secure connection with your web browser. That's because the owner of the web page has not arranged to
 have a secure connection. There's nothing you can do about that. If the connection between the web page and your browser isn't secure, an attacker can observe everything you are sending to and receiving from the web page and tamper with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real solution to this is for the web page owner to ensure that your connection is secure from the very first second that you connect. Otherwise, there may be methods that setup a secure connection after your web browser has already connected to the web
 page, and that's what you may be seeing.</p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get back into my account, Microsoft refusing to help</h2>
                    
<p>I've been locked out of my account for months.&nbsp; I had my account set up as auto log-on and one day it suddenly asked me to enter in my password.&nbsp; I can't remember the account, and was forever since I logged on.&nbsp; I've been attempting contact with MS support
 for months and trying to password reset.&nbsp; My Xbox Live account was set up with an email account my brother set up years ago and he cant remember the password.</p>
<p>Support refuses to reset my password.&nbsp; Any info I enter into the account to verify won't work as its been set up by my brother and not me.&nbsp; Even entering my credit card info isnt working, and for some moronic reason, MS Support can't do a simple procedure
 as resetting a password.</p>
<p>When I attempt to reset my password and enter in my alternate email address, MS sends the password reset to my cousin's email, who has an email address just one letter off from me....despite the fact that I manually enter in the correct address.&nbsp; To make
 matters worse, the second he gets the reset link and sends it to me, it says it has expired.</p>
<p>Why the hell is it so difficult for a company to do such a simple procedure as resetting an account's password?&nbsp; I need to reset it so I can log on to Xbox Live and change the account email to my actual email .&nbsp; I've been dealing with this for 4 months now.</p>

<p>Yes I have. &nbsp;If I use the email option, no matter how many times I type in my actual email, which ends with two n's, it sends an email to my cousin whose email ends with one n (our email addresses are basically our first initial and last name). &nbsp;We've done
 this about 7 times already. &nbsp;And when he immediately forwards the reset link to me, it says it has expired.</p>
<p>If I use the other option, it asks me to fill out all my information but the info for the account was made by my brother and isnt accurate to me and he doesnt remember what he put.</p>
<p>I've called support multiple times and they keep telling me "we can't reset a password". &nbsp;Really....a support group can't do a simple basic support action like resetting a password? &nbsp;They can't confirm my ID with perhaps my date of birth and CC info and
 do a reset?</p>
<p>The thing is, they wont even cancel my Live membership and I'm still being billed for this. &nbsp;I really would like to contact an admin or supervisor about this as its flat out ridiculous at this point.</p>

<p>I did a live chat with an agent last night for over an hour. &nbsp;Agent was helpful but I really just don't understand the difficulty with this situation. &nbsp;They confirmed every single piece of ID information with me, even sending me a confirmed support number
 to my phone number on record, and they still cant reset my password. &nbsp;Just how much information do you need to do such a simple task? &nbsp;The agent escalated the issue, and hopefully I hear back from someone about this.</p>
<p>It's absurd that I've been having this issue for 4 months without any resolution, and still being charged for Gold.</p>

<p>Hi there Goon. The difficulty in this situation is that as you yourself stated, your brother is the one who set up the account and therefor it has his information on it. What this means is that he is the owner of the account and not you. MS won't reset the
 password for you unless you can prove yourself to be the owner, which it sounds like you are failing to do. Maybe you can have your brother attempt to reset the password, or being you said your cousin is getting reset links instead of having him forward them
 to you, have him reset the password and tell you what he set it to, or even you can tell him what to set it to when he gets the link.</p>

<p>The central issue is that the Microsoft Account covers more than just Xbox, therefore Xbox support doesn't get to control the passwords. &nbsp;The best option to avoid this sort of thing in the future is to keep your security information up to date, it's Microsoft's
 job to keep your account SECURE, it's your job to keep it available.</p>

<p>Instead of having your cousin forward the password reset email to you, ask him if he can &nbsp;click the link and just set a new password for you. Let us know if this works. The link may be expiring because it is being forwarded. Make sure he uses Internet Explorer
 if he has any problems with the link.</p>
<p>If it does work just go to account.live.com, sign in with the email address and new password, select security info on the left and add your email address and mobile number to the account.</p>
<p>If it says "as you are trying to access sensitive info we need to verify that it's you" blabla and you can't receive the code, just click the dropdown menu and select "I don't have these anymore". It will ask you to put in an email address and contact number
 you have access to and trigger a 30 day wait for it to be updated.</p>
<p>Even if it does trigger a 30 day wait you will still be able to sign into your profile again.</p>

<p>This happened to me just after I got through beta testing the Live Beta for the xbox 360 that first introduced Internet Explorer. When it went live, I got locked out of that account. I know all my info down to the security question and still no dice. I've
 tried repeatedly to have an email sent, and I never receive it. I can't even get Microsoft to talk to me. At least you got that far. lol

<p>Feyd03 I can't really say but it sounds like your account may be blocked. Also check your spam and junkmail folders, especially if you are using a gmail account.</p>

<p>* Make sure you are using internet explorer when you try to send yourself a password reset link, dont use a tablet / google chrome etc etc.</p>

<p>I'm the TC of the thread. &nbsp;Looks like live chat worked, got everything reset and I got logged back onto Live. &nbsp;So relieved!!</p>
<p>I didnt want to create another thread about this, since it relates....but now that I'm back online, does anyone know how to correct a contact email address on my account? &nbsp;For some reason Microsoft is sending any password resets or notifications to my cousins
 email address (our emails are the same except mine ends with just one extra letter). &nbsp;I logged onto my Live linked email and went into Security info but when I click edit details, all it does is give me an option to send some code to my cousin's address. &nbsp;I'd
 like to fix this as I've been quite harrassing him with all the notifications.</p>

<h2>            Computer crashes after installing Avast Internet Security.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Blue Screen Crash.</p>
<p>When restarting one of my PCs after installing Avast Internet Security the PC crashes with blue screen. Avast says it is caused by a afd.sys driver. My other PCs with the same Avast product work fine. I copied the driver from one of the working PCs but the
 problem remains. Any idea anyone and I'll buy you a pint....</p>

<p>There are lots of different blue screens of death (BSOD). &nbsp;We need to know what your BSOD says.</p>
<p>Does your system boot successfully so you can use it, crash every time you reboot before you can use it or boot and run for a while and crash sometime later?</p>
<div>
<div>
Please provide additional information about your system:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
What is your system make and model?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
The next time your system crashes, provide more information about what you see.</div>
<div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that information too.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>

<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>

            <p>anytime an ungraceful shutdown has occured you should run checkdisk with the /r parameter:</p>

<p>How to perform checkdisk</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you do not have Recovery Console installed, then run from the start menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>go to start, run, type in cmd</p>
<p>
</p><p>in cmd type in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk c: /r&nbsp;&nbsp; and press enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>type Y for yes and press enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>type exit and press enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>restart pc, allow checkdisk to finish and run again</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is a lengthy process depending on the size of your harddrive, the percentages will fluctuate, this is normal, you can view report in the event viewer.</p>
<p>go to start&gt;run&gt; and type in eventvwr.msc, click on the applications directory, and in the right hand panel choose winlogon.</p>
<p>==================</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the ungraceful shutdown may have corrupted your flash player, uninstall reboot and then reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=================</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had avast installed on my xp, but it did not work well with Malwarebytes Anti Exploit and Firefox, which is my current browser, so I installed 360 Internet security from Quiho, it is free and works very well as an alternative to avast:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.360safe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.360safe.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>=============</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you are still using IE as your browser, stop and install firefox or chrome or another browser of your choice, just insure that it is compatible with xp</p>

                    The event log says: "The Audio Service service hung on starting."<br />

My systems sound works through the Notebook's built in speakers.&nbsp; If I plug in my headphones they also work.<br />

When I do start the system with the headphones plugged in Windows starts normally without this error and with the Aero default view.<br />
<br />
Strange that it behaves like this and it is somewhat annoying.&nbsp; How can this be fixed so that when the headphones are unplugged everything starts normal?<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>First make sure that Windows audio service is running on the computer.</p>
<p>a. Open Administrative Tools by clicking the Start button, clicking&nbsp; Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking&nbsp; Administrative Tools.<br />
b. Double-click Services. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
c. Right-click on the <strong>Windows Audio service</strong>, and then click Properties.<br />
d. On the General tab, next to Startup type, make sure that <strong>Automatic </strong>
is selected.<br />
e. Also make sure that the service is <strong>started</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If there is still no sound after enabling the Windows audio service then refer the below link and run the troubleshooter and check if it works.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for fixing common sound problems</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>If the above step fails then you will need to install latest audio drivers on the computer by visiting the sound card manufacturer website and check if it works.</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Visit your manufacturer's website to download the latest audio drivers.<br />

    <title>Incorrect Alt-Tab behavior after scrolling with the mouse wheel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjh42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect Alt-Tab behavior after scrolling with the mouse wheel</h2>
                    Word 2010 does not properly respond to Alt-Tab after scrolling with the mouse wheel.<br />
<br />
When working in Word 2010, if I have not used the scroll wheel since the Word window became the active window, and I press Alt-Tab, my Most Recently Used window now becomes the active window, which is expected behavior.<br />
<br />
However, if I have used the scroll wheel in the Word 2010 window to navigate between pages in a document, and then press Alt-Tab, the Word 2010 window remains the active window, and I have to press Alt-Tab again to get to my MRU window.&nbsp; It is as if using the
 mouse wheel causes the system to think the active Word 2010 window is also the MRU window, which obviously cannot be the case.<br />
<br />
In other words, I open Word 2010, which shows a new blank document. I make Windows Explorer the active window.&nbsp; If I now Alt-Tab from Windows Explorer to Word 2010, then press Alt-Tab again, Windows Explorer becomes the active window, which is correct behavior.&nbsp;
 However, if I Alt-Tab from Windows Explorer to Word 2010, then scroll with the mouse to move the blank page down a bit, then press Alt-Tab again, Word 2010 remains the active window, which is incorrect behavior.<br />
<br />
Can someone help?&nbsp; I am using Word 2010 (14.0.6123.5001 32-bit) under Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1, both with all available updates as per Windows Update.<br />
My mouse is a Logitech Performance Mouse MX, with SetPoint 6.32.7.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any assistance with this.<br />

            I have almost exactly the same setup, except for a Logitech M510 mouse instead the MX. I can't reproduce your problem, which indicates that the cause might be an add-in that's interfering.<br />
<br />
Try holding down the Ctrl key while starting Word, to start in Safe mode, and try Alt-Tab again. If that makes the problem go away, restart Word in normal mode and try disabling one add-in at a time.<br />

            I'm wondering whether the problem might be in the SetPoint software or the driver. According to
<a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/mice/performance-mouse-mx?osid=14&amp;bit=64&amp;softwareid=671&amp;section=downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/mice/performance-mouse-mx?osid=14&amp;bit=64&amp;softwareid=671&amp;section=downloads</a>, SetPoint version 6.50.152 is available.<br />
<br />
Also, according to what I read, the Performance MX has an area under the thumb that simulates an Alt-Tab click; the M510 doesn't have that feature. Maybe it needs some configuration that I'm not aware of.<br />

            Good point, although the thumb button is actually configurable, and mine simulates the Enter key.&nbsp; I have since performed the following tests:<br />
<br />
I exited both Word and SetPoint, unplugged the Logitech "Unifying Receiver" for the Performance MX mouse, and plugged in a simple Dell corded mouse, which has just the standard two buttons and a scroll wheel.&nbsp; I retested, and the issue still persists.<br />
<br />
I then tested with Word 2010 on a co-worker's machine, and did not experience the issue.&nbsp; That machine has only the following differences from mine:<br />
- Windows 7 Professional 64-bit SP1<br />
- Logitech M510 mouse<br />
- SetPoint is not installed<br />
<br />
I then closed Word on my machine, and plugged the Unifying Receiver for my co-worker's M510 mouse into it.&nbsp; I did not start SetPoint.&nbsp; I retested, and the issue still persists on my machine with this setup.<br />
<br />
I have also made the following observations on my machine, while using the original setup:<br />
- The issue is still present when scrolling up (or down) while the page is already at the very top (or bottom), resulting in the page not actually moving.<br />
- The issue is still present when using side scrolling (a feature of the Performance MX mouse) instead of rolling the wheel.<br />
- As soon as I perform either type of scroll, the title bar of the Word 2010 window changes to a lighter color, just as it normally does when switching to a different window.<br />
<br />
This may not seem like much of an issue, but since I'm used to not even having to think about how to do an Alt-Tab, it's been driving me a bit nuts today.&nbsp; I realize this is a rather long post, so if you (Jay or anyone else) have read this far, please know
 that I do appreciate it.

            So you've changed the mouse hardware and the receiver hardware, but the common piece in the path that has the problem is the SetPoint software.
<br />
<br />
It may or may not not help, but I'll suggest uninstalling SetPoint through the Control Panel's Programs &amp; Features, and either reinstalling 6.32.7 or updating to 6.50.152.<br />

            I can certainly try that, but if the issue is still present while SetPoint is not running, and while using a non-Logitech mouse, how could SetPoint be the cause of the issue?

<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />If you do a straight upgrade your settings will be retained.
<br />If you do a clean install so wipe your hard drive then do a backup.
<br />You can use a free software like Veeam to do this, this is what i use and swear by it.
<br />See link.

<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />If you upgrade your System from Windows 7 to Windows 10 all your personal data will be kept automatically. 
<br />To upgrade however you need to buy a new license for Windows 10, if you didn't upgrade before July 2016.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need more help.

            When Windows 10 was first released to the general publioc, it allowed a person to upgrade from Windows 7 free. It also gave the option of keeping all of the programs and data that were instaled at the time. The free upgrade isn't possibe any more, but I daresay that if you purchase a Windows 10 license and create an installation media, that installation would still allow you to upgrade but keep the current data and programs.
<br />
<br />That said, your PC will probably run better if you back up all your data to an external disk or USB memory stick, install Windows 10 cleanly by reformatting the disk, then reinstalling the programs you were using. You do have the installation media for thos programs, correct?

<br />Performing an in place upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 will preserve your personal files, apps and settings including book marks. Here is a tutorial of how an in place upgrade works:

<br />It is always important before upgrading though you create a proper backup of your system. Please see steps how to do that:

                    <p>Used Windows 10 Custom upgrade and Personalization Setting had a of settings that&nbsp;had I was not sure about. The wording had "inking type" and "inking data". What does it mean when&nbsp;"inking" is on/off?<br />
<br />
Also, prior to the update, the display stated my software and hardware was compatible.<br />
After download and install, when windows was starting it deleted many programs that was "not compatible with this version of Windows".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there was an update to One Drive which got an error, and the display closed without any action from me.<br />
<br />
I hope using this upgrade (Window 10) gets better, because typing this frustrating. Any time I use the pointer to go back into the sentence to make a correction it deletes/overlay the character - I have to press the insert key each time. Hopefully there is
 setting to fix this.</p>

</p><p>Then there was an update to One Drive which got an error, and the display closed without any action from me.<br />
<br />
I hope using this upgrade (Window 10) gets better, because typing this frustrating. Any time I use the pointer to go back into the sentence to make a correction it deletes/overlay the character - I have to press the insert key each time. Hopefully there is
 setting to fix this.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>Don't have a tablet, have a PC.</p>
<p>Have gotten the "not compatible with this version of Windows" notification with 3 power on.<br />
Each time it appears that other updates are being installed, security, Defender definitions, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully when everything is up-to-date the "not compatible" notifications will cease.<br />
If not, I will be posting on the problems board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I have notice that some sites ask me to update my browser (thinks I am running something other than IE 11).&nbsp; I can only guess that their inquire is returning/identifying the O/S and not the browser.<br />
This occurs more frequently on PCs I have upgraded from Vista - Win 7 - Win 10</p>
<p>(also noticeable on upgrade from Vista - Win 7 - Win 8.1 Pro).</p>
<p>Being curious&nbsp; I searched the register for Vista and got many matches.</p>
<p>Don't know if Microsoft has plane to change/update the register. but </p>
<p>I hope identifying the O/S from the browser does not become a future problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update failing some updates reverting changes</h2>
                    Hi,
<p>I hope you can help me. I have for some months now been experiencing problems with Windows Update. As experienced by many other users on the forum there is particular updates that fail to install properly and when booting up I get the reverting changes message.
 I have tried many things to rectify the problem, but none seem to have resolved the issue. I have tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- hotfixes<br />
- sfc /SCANNOW – no problems<br />
- Checking for Malware (Malwarebytes – removed some things)<br />
- net stop WuAuServ, rename SoftwareDownload folder, net start WuAuServ<br />
- Windows built-in Windows Update troubleshooter<br />
Under System and Security, click Fix problems with Windows Update.</p>
<p>- Msconfig – Hide Microsoft services, then disable all other services</p>
<p>- Also – try to boot in safe mode, but Update is disabled in safe mode, also can’t install downloaded updaes this way.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;dotNetFx45_Full_setup.exe<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WindowsUpdate Diagnostic.diagcab did show the message available at: <a href="http://www.ackniculous.com/windowsupdateproblems.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ackniculous.com/windowsupdateproblems.docx</a></p>
<p>As you can see there is a couple of entries in there that are concerning me, the following not fixed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Some security settings are missing or have been changed<br />
-&nbsp;Service registration is missing or corrupt<br />
-&nbsp;Windows Update error 0x80070057 (2013-10-14-T-03_26_12P)</p>
<p>Not fixed:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Problems installing recent updates</p>
<p>Detected:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Missing or corrupt files</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking through the forums I see suggestions on what to do, but am sometimes unsure of whether the suggestions are the latest ones, whether they are applicable to my operating system, whether they are applicable to my particular problem or in which order
 to do them. Unfortunately I have tried many things and have not recorded the order in which these things were done. I would appreciate it is someone were able to suggest solutions to try and the order in which to do them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main update I am having problems with is: Definition Update for Windows Defender – KB915597. I can install this and when windows shuts down it says installing updates and gets to about 5%, then shuts down. When it boots up it does Configuring Updates,
 gets no further, then says Reverting changes. Then it reboots again. This is annoying as it takes a lot of time. Then, once the computer has re-booted and I look in Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Windows Update\View update history I can see that it
 says that the update has installed successfully. So – has the update installed or not? Seems maybe it has, but then why all the hassle of ‘Reverting changes’?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens frequently as there is frequent updates to Definition Update for Windows Defender – KB915597.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I open and run Windows Defender it states that I have the latest definition file. Perhaps there is another update that has not taken?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also had problems with Update for Windows 7 for x64-Based systems (KB2592687) – RDP Protocol 8.0. I wanted to install this as I would like to install all updates, but have unselected it as it continually fails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also unselected Bing Desktop v1.3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have hidden Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2807986) again as it continually fails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also found that I am unable to install several updates at once, and so can so can spend a lot of time installing them one by one and rebooting between each one, but they do seem to get installed ok if done this way (except for the ones that are found
 to be problematic).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is a Toshiba Satellite Pro C850-10X laptop<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium SP1<br />
Windows Update is set to download automatically, but let me choose when to install.<br />
I have Avast Anti virus installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the strange things that I should mention is that I have the computer fully encrypted with TrueCrypt, but hope that this is not an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for such a long message. I have tried to explain my issue in as much detail as I can, in order that you might suggest the correct thing to do. Please do ask if there is anything else you need to know before we try some fixes. I look forward to hearing
 your suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been prompted to write you such a long message to hopefully give you the information you need. I have posted at this time as after the recent (21) updates in October I now have four that will not install. They are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2862330)<br />
Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2862335)<br />
Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2868038)<br />
Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2884256)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to install each of these individually, but they still failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I very much hope that you will be able to step me through some instructions to resolve this. I am relatively happy to try some commands you may suggest. You may want to see some logs and I am not sure what to do here so you will need to step me through each
 task step by step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case it will help you I am presently also having problems updating Adobe Flash player as the installer says that the user does not have sufficient privileges. Not sure if you can help with that issue, but I am also wondering whether this points to a problem
 with the way the users are set up on this computer, so that may also be something we need to investigate.</p>

            <div>Hi Geethu,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks for getting back to me with suggestions. I have spent a few hours tonight following these steps. I downloaded and then ran System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB947821) [August 2013].</div>
<div><br />
<div>It installed (took a long time stuch at 50%) and then when it finished I just closed it. I hope this is what was meant to happen. I then tried to reboot and install the updates. Tried all of the updates, but they failed and then I tried one by one, but
 they still failed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I moved on to step 2. I downloaded and ran the fixit MicrosoftFixit50123.msi. Same result unfortunately, the updates are still failing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So it seems that Definition Update for Windows Defender is possibly installing now OK, but I still have the following not installing:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2862330)</div>
<div>Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2862335)</div>
<div>Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2868038)</div>
<div>Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2884256)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Plus unselected:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows 7 for x64-Based systems (KB2592687) – RDP Protocol 8.0 - tried this today - did not install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Plus hidden:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2807986 Important)</div>
<div>Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2853952) Recomended</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have also seen http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975777 relating to 'There is a delay when you shut down, restart, or log off a computer that is running Windows 7'. This could also apply to me, I have the exact same thing - would this perhaps help me?</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, any next steps to try would be greatfully recieved. Many thanks.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>All four of the updates listed are for USB drivers. Of these KB2862330, KB2862335 and KB2868038 are know duff updates to kernel USB drivers. Not encountered KB2884256 but it is another kernel USB driver update. My feeling is to Hide all four updates and
 if any of them have installed and then&nbsp;to remove them and any dependent updates from add/remove programs. If any dependencies need removing, then hide them in Microsoft Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then monitor Microsoft threads for KB2862330 (the Microsoft Update from ****). Make sure that you have a valid backup of your data before making changes.

            Hi MethylPropyl,<br />
<br />
Many thanks for getting back to me. I was not sure if you were saying these are bad updates and to not install them. Reading what Microsoft says about this they seem quite serious and prevent elevation of privileges, remote execution of code or take over of
 my machine and sounded like I should get these installed. It is a shame that there is no more suggestions on why these won't install and what else could be tried to get them installed.<br />
<br />
Upon your advice I have hidden them so as to not waste time creating restore points, installing, reverting changes and re-booting each time I use my computer, but would welcome any other information that explains why these will not install.<br />
<br />
I am also unsure how to tell if there is any dependent updates and how to know if they need uninstalling or not. Any advice on that would be appreciated as well.<br />
<br />
As I have hidden all these updates at least I will not have the annoyance of them not installing, but I am still left wondering if there is something wrong with my Windows 7 install.<br />
<br />
If anyone else has the time to help that would be great. I am wondering if there is some user permissions or something that have got out of sync and need resetting or something.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also check the status of the individual bulletins as Microsoft add more comment. So far they have not mentioned specific computer make and model numbers or specific USB-related software.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that forcing these updates is good general
 advice because there are many reports of serious faults after installing them.</p>

            OK Methyl, thanks for continuing to offer advice. I have disabled the problematic updates for now and the Windows Defender updates now seem to be going in without reverting changes which is good. I find it strange that Microsoft release these updates and
 make it look like they are really important and must be installed otherwise people will die, but you are stating that there is no need to install them and conversely that they should not be installed as serious faults can occur. I can't reconcile these two
 positions.<br />
<br />
I don't think I understand how to keep checking the various bulletins and find if anything is relevent to my situation or not. I'm tempted to just leave it for now.<br />
<br />
However, can we continue talking about my connected problem? Users does not have sufficient permissions?<br />
<br />
I am presently getting this issue when trying to update adobe Flash for IE and Firefox and at the moment don't have Flash in those browsers. Flash is OK in Chrome. I have looked at the Adobe Flash advice and my login is administrator. I have tried to follow
 their 'Take Ownership' advice for my C drive, but could only take ownership of the folders and not the whole drive. I wonder if I need to do some sort of reset using subinacl. I admit I have not provided too much info about this, but don't know what you need
 to know in order to advise. Please can you ask me some questions and hopefully we can move forward with this issue.<br />
<br />
I will try what Adobe are calling a clean install of Flash, but I do need to get to the bottom of my permissions problem.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for any help you can offer.<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)">If you encounter problems updating or you are not using the Automatic Update you should manually update
 by selecting Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Check for Updates. Check the boxes before the updates you want to install, click on Install and click again on Install in the next window and the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed
 without interruption. Multi-tasking at the time updating is in progress is unwise. The progress window will tell you what is going on. You need to be patient.

 install one at a time so that you can find out which update is causing the problem. Manually installing and restarting your computer also allows you find out more quickly whether the problem is resolved. Automatic updating is a scheduled operation, which may
 execute up to 24 hours later.</span></p>

<h2>            does IE ActiveX work of microsoft surface&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Many times before I've been trying to open files on a Microsoft Surface Pro. But each time It says I do have to turn off Protected mode to open the file and shows the name IE ActiveX Interface Marshaling Library and having to open it. Each time I dare to
 open it, it flunks out by disappearing after a split second. How can I stop this and open the so called 'system'?</p>

<h2>            XBOX 360 Internet Connection Test Fails but I CAN login to XBOX LIVE</h2>
                    
<p>Wondering if anyone has seen this before.... I switched out my Comcast cable modem this past week and ever since, all of my XBOX 360 systems fail the XBOX Live test at Internet Connection. The really strange thing is they all can still log in to XBOX LIVE
 and play online (outside of the test).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modem is an **** TM822G and appears to have no configuration portal. I just feel like the tests should work if LIVE login and play work. I don't like the idea of not knowing what is going on with my home network that is preventing the test from working.</p>

<p>Afraid I don't know too much about this specific issue, but the problem was mentioned by Misses Quinzel a few days ago in
this thread.</p>
<p>To quote part of the post:<br />
"<em><span>Hey, guys! I'm sorry to see that you are unable to connect. I just wanted to pop in and let you know that if you are able to sign in and use Live services, than we are looking into why the connection test says you are not able to connect.<br />
...<br />
<span>We really appreciate your patience while we work on resolving this!</span></span></em> :D"</p>
<p>It sounds like that's what you're experiencing. Hopefully they can get the problem worked out soon!<br />
At least you're still able to play online though! :D</p>

<p>I'm getting "There is a problem with your connection", I choose "more info" and it says "Internet Error". If your PC on the same network can browse the web goto internet-help. The XBOX Live service alert site says there is a problem with The XBOX Live site
 "Limited Services". My question to Microsoft is why are you giving people instructions on the Xbox platforms to troubleshoot their modems and routers? "unplug the power from your router or modem for 30 seconds.." When Microsoft already knows according to their
 service alert that there is a glitch in their service platforms. I'm angry :(</p>

<h2>            Windows XP, I can not install Silverlight</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;I thought it had been installed, but might have been lost when I did a&nbsp;complete restore.&nbsp; I'm always hoping the problem will resolve on it's own..dah.&nbsp; I would love to do the uninstall, install fix, but Microsoft Silverlight&nbsp;nor any&nbsp;other of the
 names I've read to look for appears in my add and remove programs folder. I'm not a technical genius..."system restore more than once...that is my proof!&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I do believe I read it might have something to do with microsoft sync?&nbsp; That I had two different versions...the last should have been unistalled.&nbsp; I have not located anything through search.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I hope you might have some suggestions for one who loves computer science, but has a bad memory for detail. That is a dangerous combination and might have caused this and other problems over the years.</strong></p>

            <p>Hey bumbum102,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I received this same message on a fresh OS installation on a laptop. I had to restart the computer and the update starting working. The users above were correct that the system was updating something, since when I rebooting the Installing Updates message
 appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps others.</p>

            <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I was having the same problem in win 7 64 bit Prof,</p>
<p>Please use WSUS offline update and let it download the tool to get offline updates and then once the download it over, it will ask you to create output folder to and please give path to get the widows updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the download it over please run update installer from the folder which the wsus created.</p>
<p>Run it once, it will take time and then restart now will prompt you to restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please restart, after it comes back, go to normal windows update from your control panel, it will be able to sense and down the windows updates.&nbsp;</p>
