<h2>            Midi, general midi driver, sounds bad.</h2>
                    I recently installed a new motherboard/processor on my comp and windows 7. Everything is 5-10x better, especially recording. BUT I have one MAJOR problem and I can't find any help for it online (I've searched for HOURS!).<br />
<br />
The MIDI sound is terrible, playing a midi file or just within a program like Guitar Pro. I write my songs in guitar pro so I need this fixed ASAP it's driving me nuts.
<br />
<br />
The motherboard I have is the "Gigabyte EP43-UD3L"<br />
<br />
In guitar pro, it can't play through a full 3 minute song without sounding like ____ by the end (going off time and the sound just gets worse and weak) it can't do slides. You do a 3 fret slide on a guitar and it hits a random tone in between notes and I dunno
 everything sounds awful! The drums are backwards (57 crash used to be on the right and now its left). Oh and when you do strumming on the guitars, there's an annoying glitchy CLICK and the rhythm is off time etc.<br />
<br />
Is this a general midi problem with Windows 7 or is my computer just special? <br />
<br />
This whole post probably sounds like a rant, if more details are required to get some help/tips just lemme know and I'll answer any questions.<br />
<br />
I almost wanna go back to XP just so I can use guitar pro again, oh and the RSE sound engine is the worst thing ever, so that isn't even an option.

            If you use a Windows 7 compatible driver, I see no reason why your Midi interface should not work. I would check sound driver availability.<br />

            According to Lexmark you can use the Vista driver to install the z600 printer in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
Choose your z600 model here:<br />

<br />
Then download the Vista drivers for the correct bit type - 32 or 64.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Under System, you can view the system type, it will say 32 or 64 bit.
</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Install the drivers before connecting the printer to your computer. After installing connect the printer, if it’s still not recognized:</span></p>

    <title>Connect Surface 3 Pro to iMac shared printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billforest  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connect Surface 3 Pro to iMac shared printer</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a Surface Pro 3 with Windows 10. I am trying to connect to a shared printer on my iMac. The iMac is running 10.10.5 and is connected via USB to an HP Officejet All-in-one 4315v printer.&nbsp; I can connect to the shared printer wirelessly from
 my MacBook. </p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What I have tried:</strong></p>
<p>From searching forums for a solution, I installed Bonjour for Windows 2.0.2. When I run Bonjour on the Windows 10 Surface it sees the shared HP printer (connected to the iMac). Once I select it, I then choose HP. The list of various HP printer models come
 up on the right hand side. However, the Hp Officejet All-in-one 4315v (or even an HP 4300 series) does not show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried selecting various other HP Officejet printers to complete the process. However, when I try to print something, it doesn't print, and the printer icon on the Windows machine says 0 print jobs. There is a choice to use a disk (the HP disk that originally
 came with the printer) to add a driver, but I don't have that disk. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then connected the Windows machine to the printer directly with the USB cable. It automatically found the printer and added it. I thought this would add the necessary driver. It prints fine when directly connected to the printer via USB. However, when
 I try to connect the Windows Surface to the printer through Bonjour, the driver/model still does not show up, and I am unable to print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, perhaps there is a better solution than using Bonjour, or perhaps there is a way to get Bonjour to see/use the correct driver. Can anyone suggest a solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bill</p>

<p>Thanks for helping. I cannot seem to find any newer version of Bonjour than the one I have. I don't see one that says it works with Windows 10. The latest version from Apple appears to be the one that I have.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you aware of any changes made to the computer, prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Run the fixit available at the following link.</p>
<p><b>Fix problems with programs that can't be installed or uninstalled</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Refer to the following link:</p>
<p><b>Error 1311, 1335, or 2350 "Source file not found...data1.cab" when installing Adobe products | Windows</b></p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If
 you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks</p>

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />First, you can get Win32 Skype here:
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />Please try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try re-registering Store and clearing cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-register-store-app-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-reg...</a>

<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall or a VPN.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.

<p>My XBox One Console starts up and shows this error. I cannot find any mention of this error in XBox Support, so I don't understand the next steps, except contacting support.</p>
<p>My Xbox is more than 2 years old so I assume the usual warranty has already expired. Any input on this error is appreciated.</p>

<p>This issue often is caused by corrupted data in the console which prevents the home screen from loading correctly, this can often be fixed by a factory restore. Now as you can't actually access the settings to do this there is a way to restore to factory
 defaults using a USB flash drive.</p>
<p>If you visit the offline system diagnostic support page you can download the Restore Factory Defaults file:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool</a></p>
<p>Read through the process of formatting the flash drive etc thoroughly and follow the instructions as if you were doing a system update but using the file you downloaded you may find that your console will then boot correctly.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you!</p>

    <title>Windows User migration &#40;and data migration&#33;&#41; from one OS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larslundstad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows User migration &#40;and data migration&#33;&#41; from one OS to another, but also from one domain to another.</h2>
                    <p>We are on the verge of moving over appr. 100 colleagues from a newly acquired company.<br />
The users on the old 2012 Domain are running a mix of Windows 7, 8 and 10 and Office 2013 and 2016, with their data stored locally on their PC’s.<br />
<br />
Our own 2016 Domain is setup with Office 2016 and roaming profiles and we of course want the new users data on redirected folders for security reasons (important stuff stored locally gives me the creeps!)<br />
<br />
My technician conducted an initial survey and quickly discovered that the only tool capable of successfully migrating User settings, from one Windows version to another and one Office version to another, is MS USMT. Several initially very promising tools has
 been tested. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We did create a simple setup with scripts that lets us run USMT as a standalone tool and it seems to work pretty well..</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we need to figure out how to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Migrate data to the roaming profile <br />
- and to the correct roaming profile version folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>We do have some applications &amp; settings that USMT apparently does NOT migrate.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to how 1 &amp; 2 can be handled will be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Lars</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said by Noor_Azam below Technet is where you should go. <br />
<br />
That said I can warmly recommend USMT as the tool to use</p>
<p>
</p><p>no. 1 on your list is already taken care of by USMT :-) <br />
All you need to do is restore the users profile to the roaming PC on your AD, <em>
prior</em> to letting the user login on that PC the first time.<br />
Then all restored user data will automatically be copied to the redirected folders and to the version compliant to the Win 10 PC the data is residing on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding making USMT migrate extra stuff, you can check out the MS <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/usmt/usmt-xml-reference" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
USMT XML reference</a></p>
<p><br />
At https://ehlertech.com/ there is a catalog of optimized and <a href="https://ehlertech.com/customxmls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
customized XML files </a>for free download and I warmly recommend those.<br />
In case you need extra customization help, Thomas Ehler from EhlerTech has been most helpful over the years.<br />
And please use his GUIs for running USMT - You can even pull user profiles from offline harddrives/dead PC's ;-)</p>

 info after visiting sites linked to the Edge home page?</p>

            <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also have an inordinate amount of spam now coming in. I&nbsp;spend ages every day adding rules to delete message from this sender or that sender, I even take the time to go into the properties of the message to find the actual email address that has been used
 (today one of them came from me apparently!) I have also used the "Block Sender" route but they just keep coming. is there no way to somehow&nbsp;ensure that the rules and or block sender are indeed working? It seems that you block one that has a title of "free
 life insurance" only to get another that has the title of "free life insurance**" and so it goes on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite the assurances I am pretty certain that Edge and MS / Windows have a question to answer here in terms of culpability, having to use a password to open up Win 10 in it's self seems to me to be suspicious, particularly as my email address is&nbsp;cunningly
 shown to all who are looking at the screen erroneously or otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally Glad to have any proper guidance on how to bracket email categories and stop them all.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay in replying.&nbsp; I never received an alert that your reply had been posted, and only saw it when checking out the notification of Stewpau's reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use the Outlook Webmail application, I use Outlook 2013 supplied with Office 2013.&nbsp; I have never used Outlook.com as my email application, nor did I use&nbsp;Live Mail or any other webmail applications that Microsoft has&nbsp;provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not automatically send out receipts for email, and I use Shift+Delete to permanently delete Spam and Junk, or other unrequested&nbsp;email rather than just Delete, which I also believes the sender from getting indication that an email had been received or
 handled.&nbsp; For these, and reasons stated below, I do not believe that Outlook 2013 is the specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or other social media.&nbsp; I have not changed my browsing patterns or the websites that I visit.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I believe) I have all the sharing options turned off except for within my homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only changes to the environment that I operate in is Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; Hence my question about leakage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The influx&nbsp;of spam as slowed, but has not dropped to previous levels.&nbsp; I don't know how many 'updates' have been pushed on my system,
 or&nbsp;whether any of them plugged any possible leakage.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If my inquiry caused someone to look for and start correcting a problem, then I'm glad.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The email addresses are all nonsensical and obviously SPAM.&nbsp; I have called Microsoft and BT my internet provider and they just say block sender! but this is useless as the senders' email addresses just change all the time.</p>

            <p>Just a general observation since the idea has been thrown out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have created a self fulfilling proficiency.&nbsp; You have spam so you look for posts talking about spam.&nbsp; You find such a post, therefore you assume everyone that has upgraded to Windows 10 has the problem.&nbsp; In fact if you scan all the posts here, pretty
 much none of them are talking about an increase in spam.&nbsp; The threads I see on spam have to do with the fact that the Windows 10 Mail app (which you are not using) doesn't have any local handling of spam, and people are requesting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Windows 10 from December of last year, and through the release, and continue to use it.&nbsp; I use Microsoft Edge for a lot of my web browsing, and I also use most of the other available web browsers.&nbsp; I mostly use Outlook 2010 for my email,
 but I also use the Windows 10 Mail app for "quick" checks.&nbsp; I have email accounts on Google, Yahoo, Outlook.com, Sonic.net.&nbsp; I haven't seen any increase in spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you seem to think there is a connection between Microsoft Edge and your email account.&nbsp; The only way that would be possible is if you are entering your email address/password at sites where the page is not encrypted.&nbsp; Otherwise there should be no connection
 between your web browser and your email account.</p>

            <p>One more thing.&nbsp; Google has excellent spam filters, so you might consider getting an account with them.&nbsp; I have a small business that sells a program through a website.&nbsp; Needless to say that email address is available for all to see.&nbsp; I don't remember ever
 even getting any spam at my Outlook 2010 client level.&nbsp; Just the opposite, I have had a few times where it thought something might be spam, and I had to mark it as not spam.&nbsp; Anyways, at the server level that email address tends to get about 10 spam emails
 a day.&nbsp; Mostly with Chinese characters in them interesting enough.&nbsp; These all go into the servers spam folder, and since I'm using POP instead of IMAP, I don't even see them.&nbsp; They get automatically cleaned out, but every once and a while I go to the server
 and scan them just in case.&nbsp; I have actually never had an email marked spam that wasn't spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also say that as you can see I have a lot of email addresses.&nbsp; That is because I use them for different things, like private, business, financial institutions, and last websites/possible junk email uses.</p>
<p>When I setup these email addresses I just set them to forward the email to either my business or private account.&nbsp; Only my friends and family have my private email address.&nbsp; Only financial institutions have that email account.&nbsp; The rest I tend to have one
 main "bulk" email account, but sometimes I need accounts that come with email accounts like playing a Yahoo game or using their financial pages.&nbsp; The whole point here is that if an email address starts to get overrun by spam I could just shut it down, and
 create another.&nbsp; BTW I have one email account that is the primary one tied to my ISP.&nbsp; That is an account that is very hard to change, so I don't use it for anything.&nbsp; It is just forwarded to my private email address.</p>

            <p>Hi &nbsp;thanks for your post Jeff.</p>
<p>Its always upsetting when problems arise on your system.</p>
<p>Now Im not sure if this has anything to do with your problem but it may be worth while checking out.</p>
<p>I found two referances to e-mail malware and how to get rid of them</p>
<p>This site</p>
<p>

<p>If you run the programs I would reboot after each scan.</p>
<p>Hope this will help</p>

            <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 a couple days ago and received over 100 junk emails today in Outlook. &nbsp; Normally it would be maybe 5 or 10. &nbsp;It's suspicious that this happens at the same time. &nbsp;I don't see any way to change spam filters, if
 there are any, to make them more strict. &nbsp;I would appreciate any solution to this situation. &nbsp;I have a g-mail account for business but don't want to change my main email address from Outlook.com. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently I had a similar problem. If I e-mailed someone using Microsoft Edge + Outlook, I generated repeated e-mails to that person. What seems to happen is that when I send, Outlook says it "can't send the e-mail now". If I then try again, that seems to
 trigger the SPAM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my password and then tried running Outlook through Chrome. That seemed to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my password and about a week later received a msg inside Outlook that my version was out of date. I updated it and I seemed to be able to run Outlook in Microsoft Edge. That lasted for about a week. However today the same problem returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why Outlook + Microsoft Edge combination would generate SPAM while Outlook + Chrome is okay. But that is my solution for now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also run my anti-virus software. However doing that previously didn't detect any problems.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Celina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>From the description, it shows that you would like to know if it’s alright to set the network as private and have network discovery, file sharing, public folder sharing, media sharing turned off. I will help you to clarify this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a home or small office network that has Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) enabled, there are two network connections, one public and one private<br />
The public network connection is the connection to the Internet. Any type of modem, 28.8 or 56 kilobits per second (Kbps), ISDN, DSL, or cable modem, that is connected to the computer can provide and direct network communication to and from the Internet to
 all the computers on your network. The modem acts as a network adapter <br />
</p>
<p>The private side of the network are the computers that are connected together as shown in this illustration The computers on the network communicate with each other and send Internet requests through the network to the ICS host computer. The ICS host computer
 sends the request to the Internet and then returns the response to the computer that made the request.<br />
Using this connection model provides increased security for your home or small office network. Files and folders that are shared on any computer are protected and will not be seen by people on the Internet.</p>
<p><br />
If you would like to share files and printers on your network, make sure your network location type is set to Home or Work and that network discovery and file sharing are turned on.</p>
<p><br />
Please refer to the links for more information on networks: <br />

<h2>            Error says the PCW.SYS is corrupt on my Win 7. Can only get to C&#58;&#92; prompt</h2>
                    I was not doing anything, just watching the screen saver running. No recent downloads. No game playing. I hadn't even moved my mouse in quite a while. The only thing that I can think of is Avast wanted me to renew my subscription. They said I only had
 a few days left. When I booted the computer back up it went directly to the startup repair. Eventually it said I had one root cause The PCW.SYS is corrupt. Since then I've gotten Root cause found: Boot status indicates that the OS booted successfully. But
 then it will say that the problem could not be repaired! On then next boot I'm back at the same place. Lately "Boot status indicates that the OS booted successfully" has shown up quite a few times. I have the "D" volume set to active. It was that way when
 I checked it and I left it that way. I'm use-to booting from the "C" "drive" what is now called a volume. There is more to tell, but I would like to get a sense of what is going on. One more thing. I ran windows defender offline and it said there were no viruses
 or malware. I created the CD on the day I used it so the definitions should have been up to date. Please keep in mind that I can only get to a Command prompt.<br />
<br />
One more thing I'm communicating using my XP computer. The system seems to think I don't know what OS I'm trying to repair.<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
<br />

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I really have no idea how your threads work or, for that matter, forum threads in general!<br />
I uploaded the information you requested in the Private messages section and started looking to my inbox for your reply. If I was suppose to upload the files in the public section then, I apologize. I'm thinking that uploading them in the public section would
 defeat the purpose of the private message though. I don't actually know why the minidump and the ntbtlog can't be public. If there is no sensitive information in the files then they should be public so everyone can profit from the solution.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I was expecting I would have access to both my public and private messages on my computer after I logged in. So far I have not been able to make that happen. So currently I have two tabs open. Fortunately I have only one public and one private reply. I can
 see it would get complicated jumping from one tab to the other to keep up with everyone who is trying to help. It does answers the question why do some of the threads appear to have missing replays. If there is no reason to keep this thread private then can
 you combine the two in the public section.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I left the uploaded files in the private section but I can reload them to the public section if you like.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I'm uploading this reply in the private messages section as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

            <p>Anshu</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In reply to your original post. I thought that since you directed me to look for a private message the help you provided would come through that section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the first question: I no longer get the message. The computer goes to the system volume and runs the startup repair. That eventually allows me to open a command prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not getting any blue screen error messages, but I never get past startup repair.</p>
<p>The active volume is the "D" ( system ) volume, not the "C" ( Windows ) volume. I haven't had anyone say that you can change the active volume but windows may change it right back if it can't boot. When I looked "D" was the active volume. I didn't change
 it. So either Windows did or it always boots from there. I didn't even know it was there. In Windows 3 you could put an administrator copy of Windows in a separate directory to make reloading it faster. CD's solved that problem, but I didn't realize they started
 doing that with newer computers. I knew I should have created a boot-able CD, but I never stopped to learn how and do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On method one there is nothing external attached, except a mouse on a usb port. The touch pad is too sensitive and I didn't find a way to adjust it. I prefer a real mouse anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have a last known good configuration, So that leaves method 3. I have just reviewed it and there is nothing that will help, save for the reinstall.</p>

<p>I had this problem; tried Startup Repair, even from another repair disc; tried System Restore; copied RegBack into the config file to attempt to restore Registry; chdsk; sfc /scannow; disabled automatic recovery. None of these worked. Error log pointed to
 the pcw.sys corruption. As a last ditch attempt, I copied the pcw.sys from another pc (same architecture-64bit) on to a thumb drive. Went into the Command Prompt option of Recovery tools (click Advanced Recovery options link after Startup Repair fails) and
 copied it from the thumb drive to overwrite the corrupted file. Restarted and it asked if I wanted to Launch Windows Normally or enter Startup Repair; chose Launch Normal and it finally started up and works fine now.</p>
<p>I'd be glad to clarify anything here if you're not sure what I'm talking about. Hope this helps someone. I spent a couple evenings trying to fix this and was afraid my only option was clean installation.</p>

<h2>            Battlefield 4 - Cd riscado e agora&#63;</h2>
                    Galera estou desesperado, Meu irmão esbarrou no console enquanto eu jogava, ele fez um ruido estranho e desligou. Quando abrir e tirei o cd, estava com um risco em forma de circulo no disco. Agora quando estou jogando no multiplayer de vez em quando me
 aparece o erro "Impossível ler o disco" e tenho que reiniciar. Como devo proceder? Só comprando outro mesmo?

<h2>            Windows Update and troubleshooter will not work</h2>
                    <p>Windows Update loads IE, takes me to proper site, but the shield is X'd and when I hit Check for Updates, it tells me it can't do it because the service isn't running, when in fact it is. Also, troubleshooting doesn't work for any topic. It fails with an
 unknown error. I've looked all over the Internet for solutions to this problem, but none so far has worked. I see other people doing the same thing, for the same problem. Is Microsoft going to fix this at some point (and in some way that doesn't require using
 Windows Update to obtain it)?</p>

<p>In addition, when I try to sign in to this forum, it never recognizes me and I have to sign up with a new user name.</p>

<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt;  Click Hardware and Devices &gt; Click Run the troubleshooter and follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall mouse driver and reinstall it

<h3> jinxed violynne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t remove my credit card info despite auto-renew turned off.</h2>
                    Read the support and I've got to say: this is utterly ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I want my credit card info removed from my Microsoft account. I do NOT like the fact Microsoft is pushing this "all platform" idiocy on us. I have ZERO trust my information is protected on every device Microsoft is throwing its "services" on. If my phone gets
 hacked, everything tied to my Microsoft account is vulnerable. <br />
<br />
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT AN ENTIRE YEAR TO REMOVE IT! <br />
<br />
This is a security concern I'm not happy with and I want my credit card info removed ASAP. You've got my user account. Get it done.
<br />
<br />
From now on, I'll be using Live or Microsoft store cards for purchases. <br />
<br />
NONE OF THESE ALLOW ME TO TAKE OFF MY CREDIT CARD AS THEY ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS VALID PAYMENT TYPES!
<br />
<br />
Isn't this Microsoft's payment system? How is it alternatives it sells aren't counted as payment types? Instead, they just "register" as "credits". UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.

    <title>Outgoing mail not working on Windows Mail with Comcast - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericdash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outgoing mail not working on Windows Mail with Comcast</h2>
                    I have windows&nbsp;Vista and use Windows Mail (not Live) V. 6.0. I have had Comcast as my ISP for over 10 years and have had Comcast setup as a POP account to send and receive mail. I recently bought a house in an area that is only served by Wave broadband.
 In order to still retain my Comcast e-mail address, I have asked someone else to host my old comcast e-mail address. Comcast has discontinued my service, but I can still sned and receive e-mail via the Comcast.net web mail portal and can also send and receive
 comcast e-mails via my HTC Evo Shift 4G but now...I can only RECEIVE, but not send Comcast e-mails on my Windows mail. None of the setting have changed, but I did attempt to use the alternate 587 instead of 25 for the outgoing mail server port, but this does
 not help. Is there something else that is preventing me from sneding e-mails with my comcast e-mail address?

            Hi, that dump file indicates your ATI video card driver is the cause of the Blue Screen
<br />
<br />Windows has probably installed a driver through Windows Update that is incompatible with your System . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (Accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />
<br />I would suggest rolling back your video driver, by right clicking on it, choose Properties - Driver - Roll back Driver
<br />
<br />If that does not work, go to the Support page on the Asus website, download and install the video driver they recommend - it may be an older version, but it should work!

<p>Excellent I will do that now, It gives me three rollback choices one from a few months ago, and one from 2015, both by AMD and one called Microsoft basic display adapter, I will try the 2015 one and go from there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>So *DCP watchdog violation * came back after trying all drivers, however on the last driver I tested it with, it gave me *Thread stuck in device driver* which I was having a problem with before but got rid of . . . now its returned, here is an updated DMP
 file created just moments ago.</p>
