    <title>With the free Win10 upgrades, is Microsoft doing away with consumer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            With the free Win10 upgrades, is Microsoft doing away with consumer retail licensing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft in a variety of forums over the last few months has repeatedly stated that
<strong>"Win10 upgrades will be free for those who qualify, and will be maintained by us for the life of the supported device.</strong>"&nbsp; Or, words to that effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is simple: is the license for Win 10 that I will receive, since I am upgrading from
<em>retail</em> Windows 8.1 Pro, a retail license to use that copy of Win10&nbsp; indefinitely wherever I may choose to install it (one device at a time),
<em>or</em> is the license tied to a specific "device" (or piece of hardware), just like a current OEM Windows license?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way of asking the same question:&nbsp; <em>Will I have to buy a new license for Windows 10 every time I decide to change out my motherboard?
</em>(Which is something I do every couple of years.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone who can give me a link to a Microsoft employee who has put it in writing, whatever the answer may be.&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download a .ISO file and upgrade each computer offline. The ISO should be available by the time Windows 10 launches. To know more about Windows 10 check the link below.</p>

<p>The problem with Soumya's reply is that it just specifies that you have physical access to the ISO and can install it. &nbsp;But, it doesn't answer your question about what that "upgrade" will do to your full retail license. &nbsp;I'll keep looking, too. &nbsp;But as of
 right now, every single reference to the upgrade contains some variation of the undefined weasel words of "for that device."</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, that was my original impression, too--that my question wasn't really answered...but I think maybe this is really a case of Aul not choosing his words as carefully as he might've.&nbsp; At least, I hope so...;)&nbsp; If I can download the RTM .iso and then use
 it to legally upgrade any machine I own, then that would indicate to me that Win10 is not actually going to be tied to my hardware, but rather to my legal license for a qualifying upgrade product (Win7/Win8.1/&amp; a particular Win10 Insider build--I'm guessing
 at that last...)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that what may happen is that the RTM will check for a valid activation for Win7/8.1, and then parley that information into an activation for the copy of Win10 that is being installed.&nbsp; In this way, if a person has one qualifying upgrade license but
 has installed it to 10 separate machines (illegally), then once the bootleg machines hit the Internet, nine of those 10 copies will be theoretically deactivated...;)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would allow Microsoft to do away with "phone activation" and that sort of thing--which was a huge waste of time &amp; money, anyway.&nbsp; They also could strip out all or most of the hardware checks they put into earlier Windows versions...which was just a
 huge waste of everyone's time &amp; code, I think you'll agree. (If Internet activation failed on account of a hardware change, then you'd phone activate, answer "One" to the question asked, and then sit there and type in a ridiculously long string of numbers
 fed to you by the disembodied voice and you would then be activated, anyway.&nbsp; Ridiculous to have to jump through those hoops to do something that was perfectly legal--upgrade your hardware.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone activation really sucked, too: I haven't run Win7 in a long time, but when I bought it I bought Microsoft's factory "Family Pack" @ retail which provided for three concurrent licenses.&nbsp; Problem was that "Phone Activation" was unaware of Family-pack
 keys, so that I had to actually lie and say "One" because if I said "two" or "three" then phone activation would refuse to authorize!&nbsp; Then I had to simply call right back and this time say "One" to get authorization...;)&nbsp; Here's hoping Microsoft gets rid
 of all of that garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what the company has said about bootleg copies of the upgradable OSes not shunning their bootleg status through the Win10 install process (you upgrade from a bootleg copy of Win7 you wind up with a bootleg copy of Win10), it certainly looks as if
 Microsoft is now tying everything to the license instead of to the hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be a giant step forward in consumer friendliness for Windows if that is the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But all of this is conjecture...less than 60 days now and counting to RTM...!</p>

<p>Hi Curt,<br />
<br />
Regarding the situation, I suggest you remove the existing product key from the machine, and sign out of the previous user account in Office applications.<br />
<br />
To remove the existing product key, please refer to <strong>Step 4</strong> in the article below:<br />

    <title>My Nokia BH 903 review &#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thechosenone22  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Nokia BH 903 review &#33;</h2>
                    Given I'm a bit of an afficienado of Bluetooth headsets, I jumped at the chance of reviewing the Nokia BH 903 Bluetooth stereo headset and found it to be a fully featured device with some interesting features.<br />
<br />
Links for the UK version of all the devices detailed in this review can be found at the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
Opening the box itself you get the device itself, a couple of foam earpads, a new style (2mm) Nokia charger as well as the manual.<br />
<br />
Although described as a "headset" the first thing to note about this device is that it uses earphones and not the "in the ear" canal type connectors found on the BH 103 model or the "traditional" over the head type headphones such as the BH 604 model.<br />
<br />
This is particularly important if you have the type of ears where you always find your iPod earphones always fall out if you're running for the bus ! For this reason I've always tended to purchase devices with the "in the ear" canal type connectors, however
 I found the BH 903 to be very pleasant in use and I think this is in no small part due to the triangular shape of the earphone itself which is partly encapsulated in rubber with foam pads also being supplied with the unit. For those with the "iPod ear issue"
 as I like to call it, these devices should definitely be added to the "must consider" list.<br />
<br />
The major problem I've found with most Bluetooth stereo headsets so far is actually portability. Devices such as the Nokia HS 81 or (even worse) the Motorola S9 have a hard "frame" which goes around the neck of the wearer which whilst comfortable, is definitely
 not something you can put in your pocket whilst the device is not in use without worrying about whether you are going to hear a cracking sound when you sit down.<br />
<br />
Happily there's no such issue with the BH 903 - it features a fully adjustable soft "neck" band which sits around the neck with the actual device hanging off this similar to how a pendant would be worn. Each of the earphones is then threaded through each end
 of the neckstrap and can be adjusted depending on how close you want the main controller unit to sit near your neck or how much slack you require for each earpiece. On the lead running to the left earpiece is the "satellite" controller unit which houses the
 microphone and answer/end/mute keys.<br />
<br />
The device itself is A2DP compliant and so can be paired with any music player also adhering to this standard (as well as any phone !). It is capable of remembering the last 4 paired devices and features its own subliminal display (similar to that found on
 the front of the N93i) which enables it to give much more feedback and functionality to the user than other lesser featured units. The styling of the BH 903 most closely follows that of the recently announced N78/N96 and features a similar touch sensitive
 area by which the headset volume can be controlled.<br />
<br />
The BH 903 manages to pack a lot of features in it's remarkably small frame - the device contains a FM receiver with the earphone cables doubling as the antenna - I found reception to be crisp and it managed to automatically pick up and save local radio stations
 complete with station name (the BH 903 supports RDS) with absolute ease.<br />
<br />
As the device has a display it is also able to offer additional functionality and feedback to the user which is not apparent in other devices - for example if Bluetooth connectivity is lost to the host device, it can be reinitiated from the headset itself.
 The main control unit also offers music player control settings as well as mirroring the call control functionality available on the microphone unit. With compatible devices, the BH 903 can also display the current time, and has automatic keyguard functionality.<br />
<br />
In use, I found the volume for both music playback and calls absolutely fine unlike other non Nokia devices which haven't really been loud enough for noisy environments. Likewise the microphone also performed well, although I found that due to the technology
 and location it did pick up quite a lot of ambient sound as well as the caller's voice - so if you're at a pub or club when you should be somewhere else this is definitely NOT the headset you want to be using to call your other party ! :)<br />
<br />
Not for the first time in evaluating Nokia devices, I am now lamenting the fact that I already have a device of the same family that I am currently reviewing, as I would quite happily have purchased this device had it been available at the time of purchase
 instead of the one I am currently using. Definitely a headset to put on your shortlist !<br />

            This one you missed as well, released in 2006. Has it's downsides, but it was OK for me: Nokia HS-12W<br />

Anyway, I am buying now BH-903. Let's see how these to compare.<br />

            Okay, have this little sucker so I'll answer it for myself. RDS doesnt seem to have support for radio text, it only displays names of radio stations, btw. FM reception seems to be very good.<br />
No problems with Nokia N80. Can even stream music from phone to the headset in stereo mode, but the quality isnt very good, apparently because of bluetooth 1.1 spec of the phone.<br />
Havent tried much FM radio recording, but after starting recording software phone makes active connection with the headset which stops to play radio and switches to "voice" mode.<br />
Pairing after turning on the unit takes only few seconds.

<p>If you have control over the printers and you know the names of the printer drivers and the Tray IDs for those printers (see<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/fax_from_word.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/fax_from_word.htm</a> ) then it is a fairly
 simple matter to create a macro that will print pages 1 to 4 and 6 to one tray and page 5 to another (or any combination of trays and pages)</p>
<p>You haven't said which printers you actually have, so I cannot be 100% sure that the tray IDs I have quoted are correct - you can use the above link to verify. With that established, the following macro should work. Note that the three Inst statements which
 search for the driver names are case sensitive. If you have more than one HP or Lexmark driver available you will have to fill the required names fully, or pick from a list - see the routine for selecting a colour printer.</p>

<p>I think I have solved part of the problem.<br />
<br />
I uninstalled office 2003 and installed office 2000, created the document with the printer settings to tray 2.Saved the document. This works correctly on 1 printer.&nbsp; Now I need to find the right printer drivers for the other printers.Any suggestions for a lexmark?<br />

Will keep working at it.<br />

<h2>            Issue with real time sharing - &#34;Sorry, something is preventing us from sharing this.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to be able to use the real-time sharing function, but whenever I click the Share button in Powerpoint and Word, I almost always get the message "Sorry, something is preventing us from sharing this."&nbsp; This happens even when I try to share a document
 between two of my own computers.&nbsp; I can still collaborate, but the delay between any updates is sporadic and often takes several minutes.&nbsp; Is there any way that I can make the sync more instantaneous?</p>

            For me, it has to do with the onedrive app built into windows 10. Once I stop the onedrive app from syncing my local files, Office sharing works perfectly. As soon as I turn onedrive back on, the error returns.

            <p>Thanks Daniel,</p>
<p>Indeed, I had a close experience to yours:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have 2 computers where I log on with the same Windows/Microsoft ID and have OneDrive sync ON.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Created a file in Word and saved it to Onedrive, pointing to a sync-ed Onedrive folder that can bee seen using FileExplorer. Then when I wanted to share it, this time it said that I first must save it to the cloud. So I did it but it created a new file with
 the old filename + a series of letters&amp;numbers (to avoid duplicate).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted then to test opening and modifying that file on the other computer by opening it from a Onedrive folder but by clicking it through the FileExplorer. Again, problems. But opening Word and opening the file by choosing "from" Onedrive, worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the sharing thing works only if files are used directly by addressing a cloud location and not a local folder that is synchronized to the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This still does not excuse that lame error message. Why not displaying this result instead of "something blabla", Microsoft ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store doesn&#39;t load after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE device, which I have upgraded to Windows 10 two days ago from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Now I have a problem that Windows Store is not loading - neither by clicking on a Store tile/icon, nor from any other link. I didn't experience such issue before the migration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on a Store tile it seems that the application starts loading - a black screen appears - but in a second it returns back to the same screen where I was&nbsp;without giving any error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other applications seems to be working properly except one -&nbsp;MSN Weather - probably it wants an update after the migration. At the moment clicking on its tile the application&nbsp;is loading but&nbsp;instead of showing weather information it&nbsp;shows some description
 about the application and a button "Go to Store" ("Przejdż do Sklepu" in local language).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information:</p>
<p>OS Version: 10.0.10586.218</p>
<p>Language: Polish (polski)</p>
<p>Region: Poland (Polska)</p>
<p>Regional Format: match phone language</p>
<p>Time Zone: UTC+01:00 Sarajewo, Skopie, Warszawa</p>
<p>Feedback &amp; Diagnostics: switched on</p>
<p>1 SIM (obviously)</p>
<p>1 SD: 32 GB (removing it doesn't help)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that will help to resolve my issue.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi, If you're still having the same problem, last May 11 we have released 10.0.10586.318 OS update that includes reliability, performance and stability improvements. Try installing the update as soon as it's available for your phone. To check for OS update,
 go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Phone update and tapping Check for updates.&nbsp;If the issue persists, you may try turning off the&nbsp;auto update of date and time and see if it helps.&nbsp;

    <title>Reclaiming Dead Install Licenses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron hartley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reclaiming Dead Install Licenses</h2>
                    Lets say that a while back you installed Office 2010 on a computer at your small business. This is just regular vanilla Office 2010 Pro in a box, not any sort of special corporate licensing. One of the PCs is now as dead as doornail. This computer is completely
 fried, getting into the OS isn't even an option, nor is clean installing (I may pull the hard drive and erase it from another computer). You can't and won't be using the dead Office install anymore but presumably that still counts as an install. If you now
 need to install Office 2010 Pro on a new computer on an otherwise maxed license, what should you do? How do you reclaim dead installs?

            <p>Yes, the activation process does count installs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What you are talking about is known as "transferring" the license from the dead machine to the new, "third" install.&nbsp; That is allowed in the license and activation system.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to do that you have to ensure that the "old machine" is no longer running
 Office.&nbsp; Normally that is done by uninstalling Office, BUT ..., a "dead" computer also qualifies as an "uninstall".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The uninstall process does NOT talk to the activation system, unfortunately. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For the 3rd machine, you do a normal install and activation.&nbsp; Sometimes the activation system will recognize that the "dead" machine has not been used in some undefined long period and will assume you are transferring the installation and allow internet
 activation.&nbsp; As you are concerned about, normally it will not, triggering an error message about "too many installs".&nbsp; That is still not a problem.&nbsp; Instead of internet activation you have to do a phone activation.&nbsp; But you have to follow a special procedure.&nbsp;
 If you follow the normal phone activation prompts you will also get the same error message.&nbsp; Instead, when you phone in you have to wait a long time without replying to the prompts (or enter a bunch of wrong replies) until the phone system recognizes that
 you "need help" and offers you the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; Explain that you are transferring the license from a dead computer. They should immediately allow the activation to complete.&nbsp; If they do not co-operate, ask to speak to a supervisor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As Palcouk pointed out, MS has partially changed the activation system with the current version of Office.&nbsp; Office 365 licenses allow the USER to control their multiple activations by logging in to a web page.&nbsp; USERS now can 'deactivate' an installation
 to allow them to easily use that install count on another machine without MS intervention.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, the "Office 2013" licenses, (separate from "Office 365/2013") still does not give users that control.

    <title>Excel Online is no longer able to open my workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericlandry1615  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Online is no longer able to open my workbook</h2>
                    I have a document that I access every day in Excel Online. This is very vital to my operation. Recently, I am having issues where my excel online workbook can't be opened and I am told to try opening again later. I have tried restarting my servers, desktop,
 router, and modems. Nothing works. I have also tried multiple browsers and accessing through my phone. How do I prevent this error from continuing to occur? The workbook won't even open for me to view let alone edit. This is severely hindering my operation.
 Please help! Thanks in advance!

            The problem is intermittent with all excel online files. Some files will open and others will not. Then the next day, the ones that wouldn't open will and the ones that did won't. I am able to download the file from One Drive and re-upload but the issue
 is that this a shared file and I will have to constantly send out invites to people to be able access the sheet.&nbsp;

            <p>I have having the exact same problem. I also agree that re-uploading the file every time would be useless since we would have to resend the link each time and the save that link in everyone's favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having the issue with one single file. But we only use one file. When I try to open it in desktop Excel, it says I am editing it so it can't open. But I don't have it open anywhere. I even signed out of OneDrive and anything Microsoft related and
 that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like you, sharing this file is vital to us. If we can't get this figured out in a day or two we will need to switch to Google Sheets.</p>

</p><p>For today, we're trying to increase this time limit to help relieve the issue in the short term.&nbsp; For now, the immediate suggestion is to make sure to close the documents as you finish using them, and encourage anyone with whom you have shared the documents

<p>
</p><p>Can you clarify your situation?&nbsp; Are you saying that you were able to open a workbook before, and now you cannot?&nbsp; When was the last time that you successfully opened the workbook?&nbsp; When did the problems start occurring?&nbsp; Does it sometimes work and sometimes
 not?&nbsp; Are you collaborating with other users when editing these workbooks, and is it possible other users are leaving the workbook opened overnight?&nbsp; Does this happen with just one file or with multiple files?&nbsp; If you upload a new copy of the file, can you
 open the new copy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to our monitoring of the problem described by EricLandry1615 and&nbsp;SDavis503, the issue does not seem to be occurring anymore after our attempts to change the time limits.&nbsp; However, the error dialog in SDavis503's post can happen for a number of
 different reasons, as it represents a generic failure.&nbsp; Without more details, it will be difficult to assist.</p>

            <p>Thanks Saravanan, R for the informative reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes this is definitely a different error dialog from the issue which was discussed by the original posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mention, the spreadsheet is large and potentially complicated.&nbsp; If it takes too long to open, it will not be supported in Excel Online.&nbsp; If you notice that it takes 5-10 seconds to fully open/calculate in Excel when you download it, then it may be
 too complex for Excel Online to handle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention that you are using Office 365.&nbsp; In this case, your best option may be to initiate a service support request through Office 365.&nbsp; This post was talking about a more widespread problem, rather than a problem with loading one particular workbook.&nbsp;
 They may be able to provide more personalized support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can make the workbook smaller or less complex, you may have success opening it in Excel Online.&nbsp; Depending on your calculation requirements, you may also be able to get the workbook to load in Excel Online by changing the calculation method to Manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find an article like this one useful, which describes methods to improve calculation performance, as well as how to change calculation method to Manual:</p>

            Our team is having the same problem now - none of our 365 shared files will open in time before the error message. All working fine a week ago, then suddenly, no-one can open any online files. The files haven't gotten any more complicated or bigger in
 that time. Any suggestions? We really need to be able to share the files and edit from multiple locations.

<p>I am going between 2 sheets and I'm getting more and more confused with the process...if you wouldn't mind giving me some idea of what I could be doing wrong I would greatly appreciate it....&nbsp; here is the steps (and yes it is homework :) )</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>format the information on the “Product List” sheet as a table. Your choice on color/style, but it should only have a different first row.</li><li>Convert the table back to a range for the “Product List” sheet.</li><li>Switch to the Product Sales Feb 2017 sheet. On this sheet, determine your retail price based on the Product in relation to the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Product Name</em><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>on the “Product List” sheet. HINT: There are multiple ways to
 reference this, but the typical way to do this is using the VLOOKUP function.</li></ol>

 know what it is). If i press one of these 2 then excel unlocks and starts accepting other keyboard inputs, otherwise i have to switch between applications or another open excel workbook to temporarily solve the issue.</td>

<p>Hi Jerson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read your post carefully and I want to share with you my idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before all, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
File</span> &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">Account</span> &gt;<span style="font-weight: bold"> Update Options</span> to update Excel to latest version(1905).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that Please following steps to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
repair Excel client</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists could you tell me if the issue only happen in Excel? When your keyboard have been locked in Excel, are you able to use shortcuts in other Office applications like Word
 or PowerPoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eric </p>

<p>Office is currently updating.</p>
<p>The problem stays as long as i don't switch to another open excel, powerpoint, word etc.. After i ALT+TAB, the application i alt tabbed to will work fine as expected and if i alt tab back to the excel workbook which was keyboard locked it will start working
 again.</p>

<p>Hi Jerson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the issue seems happen randomly and disappears when switching windows, it is difficult to find the root cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you go to <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">File</span><span> &gt; </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Account

            Hello Santhosh,
<br />The software I would recommend is Word for Android, but as you said, there is not  Malayalam Font  on it. You could the procedures described in the following articles, but they are not from Microsoft and as the author stated in one of them you would do it at your own risk.

    <title>Advanced Find not working in Outlook 2016 &#40;part of Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antares  say:</h3>
<h2>            Advanced Find not working in Outlook 2016 &#40;part of Office 365 ProPlus&#41;</h2>
                    <div>Hi there,<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been an MS Outlook client user for 20 years. One of the features I always used, and still need and use a lot for my daily work is "Advanced Find", as I need the level of granularity it provides to get accurate search results out of my .PST files,
 which unfortunately the Instant Search box does not provide.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything worked fine for me up to Outlook 2013.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But after a recent update to Outlook 2016, Advanced Find just stopped working.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did some research and found that at some point in time, Microsoft decided to remove the Advanced Find function overnight as it erroneously considered it a "legacy feature with little use". But after receiving tons of complains from power users who actually
 used Advanced Find, Microsoft (apparently) added Advanced Find back to the Outlook client. That can be seen in the following links:</div>
<div>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10-mso_2016/outlook-2016-advanced-find-functionality-has/1e49b3b2-0751-4362-8be0-84e3418cac56?page=1</div>
<div>https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows/suggestions/31057162-bring-back-advanced-find-to-outlook-search-tools#{toggle_previous_statuses}</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, that does NOT seem to be my problem, as my Outlook 2016 client still has the Advanced Find function visible and available.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is... it just doesn't work!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No matter the complexity of the search criteria I use - as simple as looking for all a given sender's emails in one Subfolder in a .PST, to looking for all emails sent between two given dates in all Subfolders in a .PST file via the "Advanced" tab, to
 more complex search's - Advanced Find does NOT bring ANY results. Zero. Nothing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I'm wondering that MAYBE, Advanced Find got broke in some older version and the "solution" was to remove it, instead of fixing it... and perhaps I'm stuck in one of those old versions that have Advanced Find broke.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Outlook client is part of the Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus package with the following current versions:</div>
<div>- Version 1705 (Build 8201.2200 Click-to-Run)</div>
<div>- Microsoft Outlook 2016 MSO (16.0.8201.2200) 32-bit</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I didn't find any reports or questions on this specific issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please can you help?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, if this is a known issue with the version I'm using, please can you tell me which is the earliest version that has the Advanced Find function fixed?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<p>Hi Des,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Capture a screenshot for the error message. Capture a screenshot for the page where you encounter the error message.
</p>
<p>2. Do you encounter the error message in Outlook Web app click a group, and then click Files tab? If not, let us know the detailed steps before you get this error message?</p>
<p>3. Do all group members run into the same issue? If you are in Outlook web app, click "..."&gt;Site. Check if you can access the site which is used to store group files.
</p>
<p>4. Do other groups have the same issue? Make sure if the issue is related to this specific "student" group.
</p>
<p>5. Do you have admin role in your tenant? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

    <title>Inbox and Sweep Rules&#58; categorizing email by sender domain rather - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sos_hk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inbox and Sweep Rules&#58; categorizing email by sender domain rather then specific email address</h2>
                    <p>Greeting!</p>
<p>I have been using hotmail since forever.</p>
<p>I like the inbox rules that can help me to filter and categorize various type of email.</p>
<p>Recently, after upgrading to Outlook.com, I found that one of the previously available options in rules is gone.<br />
</p>
<p>I used to be able to set up a rule to sort emails from a specific domain and move to a specific folder.</p>
<p>Now, I can only do the same to specific email address, but not domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is, since the emails are from a bank, and somehow, the sender email address is different every time. If the option of sweeping by domain is not available, there is no way I can filter it since I can not predict the random email address the bank
 would use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any brilliant expert here can help me with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced.</p>

            For some reason, the "Set Default" button won't allow me to click it at all. Also, I've already updated everything, and I also uninstalled the "Realtek High Definition Audio" then restarted my computer. None of these have worked so far.

 desktop even though I have my speakers plugged into my headphone jack always.</p>
<p>And my laptop also does not show these icons.</p>
<p>I would try to re-install Windows again or do a Pc Reset.</p>
<p>Funny no one mentioned what build or version of Windows you are running.</p>
<p>What are you running?...this might help to troubleshoot further....thanks.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t forward emails. Error message&#58; &#34;Could not complete the operation because the service provider does not support it&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Okay. I've been working on this for a while now.</p>
<p>I have two mail accounts (provided by my email providers) which can't forward emails to any address. It doesn't matter if the email to be forwarded has an attachment or not, but I always get a
<strong>"Could not complete the operation because the service provider does not support it"
</strong>error message when I to forward them. I have a Gmail account linked to Outlook and it&nbsp;works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can receive email to their inboxes&nbsp;without issues,&nbsp;the issue is always with forwarding emails. Here are the things I've tried to fix this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Outlook safe mode.</p>
<p>2. Repaired Office (quick and online).</p>
<p>3. Reinstalled Office.</p>
<p>4. Verified settings for both accounts, and the providers said everything is good.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Repaired PST files for both accounts.</p>
<p>6. Created a new, separate&nbsp;profile just for both email addresses.</p>
<p>7. Forwarded email online, and there were no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I've tried removing them then adding them back to Outlook, but I can't seem to add them this time.</p>
<p>Any good&nbsp;advice will help me with this. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Okay. Just an update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to add the other two email accounts, but both of them are having issues with sending or forwarding emails where I see the same message
<strong>"Could not complete the operation because the service provider does not support it"
</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to forward/send email from <strong>within Outlook</strong> when I see the error message. Both addresses can receive email fine and I've verified the settings are correct. I also tried forwarding email using their web mail and I was able to. It
 seems the issue is exclusive to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Skype for symbian such a shame</h2>
                    Hi nokia community,<br />
<br />
skype for symbian on my belle nokia 701 is a complete disappointment, not even a single feature is new.<br />
<br />
It is same old skype for symbian packed with new touch UI, and why doesn't skype support video call for latest belle devices?<br />
<br />
Seriously it feels like living in old times, having all the hardware required on my device but still unable to make use of front cam , is nokia doing anything in this regard?<br />
<br />
After all nokia and microsoft are partners now, they should take care of things like these, why we symbian users are left behind without any useful productivity apps like other leading OSes in market?<br />
<br />
Please let me know your views, and is there any way I can use my device's for video calls (other than network video calls)?<br />
<br />
Your support would be highly appreciated.<br />

            Actually i didn't mentioned the problem with the skype for belle, which is that on my nokia 701 after 1 - 2 hours of skype voicecall it gives me ''memory full'' error, which then cause me to restart skype. It is so uncomfortable!<br />
<br />
And there is no split screen option to chat while on call. As per functionality and inconvenience it is a copy of skype which i was using on my N81 last year.<br />
<br />
Nokia should do something to bring skype support in asap.<br />

<p>Yes, Skype for Symbian is a true disappointment. I understand that this is not Nokia's direct fault, but I think that such OS developer as Nokia has to do some negotiations with major software suppliers, because nowadays an OS without extra software is just
 big nothing.</p>
<p>I understand that, as Microsoft owns the Skype now, they are not interested in Symbian anymore and put all efforts into Windows phones. But in the end, who will gain from that? Symbian users will get dissapointed and will choose Android or Apple over switching
 to Nokia's Win phones. So, both Nokia and Microsoft will suffer.</p>

Would anyone like to share some other app for video calls like yahoo video, windows live video?<br />

<p>I agree, Skype is completely useless with voice calls, I at first put this down to the other party trying to connect to me using video calling but after reading the above I wonder whether that was the case. :smileysad:</p>

<p>
</p><p>NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as an alternative, you can exit Word and rename Normal.dotm in your user profile folder. Restart Word and the default settings will be restored.</p>

<h3> ibroxbear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove Music sync itunes&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    My problem is the iTunes folder in My Music.&nbsp; Groove Music is set to only sync My Music folder.&nbsp; It does this fine except it duplicates many albums as they are also in the iTunes folder.&nbsp; I moved the iTunes folder to My Documents and deleted the iTunes
 duplicates in Groove Music.&nbsp; Fine so far except 1. Moving the iTunes folder from My Music removes everything in iTunes and 2. That no matter if you change in iTunes preferences location folder to restore it continues to default My Music and add all music albums.

            Many thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I am using the Groove app on my PC.&nbsp;which I recently updated from Windows 8..1 to 10.&nbsp; When I opened the Groove app for the first time it scanned everything One Drive etc for music before I could get the chance to change the
 setting to just add music from "my music folder".&nbsp; Anyway once that was sorted I noticed the duplicates due to the iTunes folder in "my music folder" being added.&nbsp; A lot of my cd albums are in both "my music folder" and my ITunes library.&nbsp;
