<h2>            The photos app on my Surface Pro cannot start</h2>
                    <p>I cannot open the photos app on my Surface Pro.&nbsp; When I double click on the photo file from my desktop, it either shows up black on the application or the app will load for a minute and then shut itself down immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open the application from the start screen, it loads for a minute and then shuts down automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restarted the computer twice.&nbsp; I've also shut down the computer.&nbsp; Neither has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please!&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft.net Framework3.5 service Pack 1&#38;.net Framework 3.5 Family upgrade &#40;KB951847&#41;</h2>
                    I have my computer set to update Microsoft each day but one update dated <br />
2/24/2009 is refusing to update and seems to be causing a problem. It <br />
is:Misrosoft.net Framework 3.5 service Pack 1 &amp;.net Framework3.5 Family <br />
upgrade (KB951847) x86 and is listed as important. When it fails it comes up <br />
with code 490 Windows encountered unknow error.<br />
Can anyone advise how I can resolve this?<br />
I went to a sight&nbsp; and got this answer:<br />
Here's your answer from MS,,,<br />
These procedure should take care of the issue with .NET Framework<br />
<br />
1) Download and run the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility. Use it to remove<br />
<br />
the .NET Framework 1.1 from the machine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows Installer Cleanup Utility<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301<br />
<br />
But when I tried that I got the message that denied me Permission&nbsp; code 800A0046 Source Microsft VBS Script runtime error.<br />
How can this be fixed?<br />
<br />

            <p>There is something very strange going on with your system and I would not be surprised if you run into problems with other programs. You may want to consider doing a repair or reinstall of Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been running Win 10 since January using Firefox during that time, and have it installed on 2 other PC's that have recently been upgraded and all work fine.</p>

            <p>There are three methods or reinstall:</p>
<p>1. Browse to the root of the install USB/DVD and run setup.exe. This will keep all your programs already installed and your data. It is worth trying this route are your programs may be fine after. There are lots of posts on how to create the USB/DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the other two, press Winket-i, select Recover and then Reset this PC. Options are</p>
<p>2. Reinstall and keep data</p>
<p>3. Wipe everything and reinstall</p>

<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions to be installed. The Product Key&nbsp;determines which Edition is installed.
</span></p>
<p><span>Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I apologize for not addressing you in a timely manner. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the computer is newly purchased, then it would be best to get in touch with the computer manufacturer to get this fixed. (If it's within the warranty period).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>1. Insert the Windows 10 installation media and boot the computer using the disc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>You need to check the computer manual on how to set CD/DVD drive as the first boot device in the BIOS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Once you boot using the Windows installation disc, on the Windows 10 installation window, click on Repair your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and in the<span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span><strong><span>Advanced options</span></strong>.&nbsp;Select<span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span><strong><span>Command
 Prompt</span></strong>. Enter the following four commands into the prompt.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bootrec /rebuildbcd</span></strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span>4. After the completion of the commands, restart the computer and check the status.</span></p>

    <title>Miracast unstable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> branko119  say:</h3>
<h2>            Miracast unstable</h2>
                    <p>Concerned equipment: A Likesme, Wireless Display dongle, with Miracast on a TV's HDMI. A Windows 10 compatible, I5 laptop 2.3 Mhz. and 8GB internal. The laptop is on a maximum of 15 feet from the TV and at 12 feet from the Wifi modem. Windows is set to optimal
 performance for background programs. And a 5GB cache to disk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Miracast operates a short time and drops, when given more work. Working it displays with a delay of 2 seconds and with a streaming video it's sometimes choppy, not on the laptop. Because everything works when starting, and the connection is established easily,
 I think the drivers on my computer do not work properly. I use Microsoft's latest drivers. And since Miracast is a standard and everything works a short time, it is unlikely that device errors are the cause. It could be that my wifi signal interferes with
 the Miracast signal, but I changed the channel of my modem receive signal. That does not help, I know it does nothing to the Wifi signal itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have frequently internet loss, when the dongle is connected. I have otherwise no problems with for months. I can establish the connection easily again through the action center. Windows itself does not. Although my connection is set to automatically
 select ... which apparently does nothing to automaticly set it up again. But that's another issue. Occasionally it's sometimes necessary to reset the provider modem, but it remains okay for months. Can you advice me a better driver? Or who has recommendations
 for changing settings on the laptop, making connections more stable? Or which other advice can you give me?<br />

<h2>            Windows suddenly recognizes my Canoscan 8800F as a WIA device and won&#39;t open canon driver when scanning through graphic programs anymore.</h2>
                    I have been using a&nbsp;Canoscan 8800F along with Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro to acquire images for the past 2 years. Up until a few days ago when scaning an image through these programs, the canoscan driver would open up. All of a sudden the WIA driver opens
 up instead. My scanner is now recognized as a WIA device. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the scanner and drivers several times without success. I can only assume that a recent windows update caused this to happen. Is there a way of getting the scanner to
 again open up the canon driver.

<p>Hi Kennyway,<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Is the device functioning properly?</p>
<p>There are 2 types of Drivers available from Canon. <br />
•&nbsp;TWAIN <br />
•&nbsp;WIA (Windows Image Acquisition)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;WIA is an imaging architecture that builds on (Still Image Architecture ) STI and does not require TWAIN, although TWAIN is still supported alongside WIA.
<br />
<br />
However, try these:<br />
<br />
<strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;Use the Windows Clean up Utility to remove the Canon Driver and then reinstall the driver again.<br />
1. Visit the following link to download the utility: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/9/D/E9D80355-7AB4-45B8-80E8-983A48D5E1BD/msicuu2.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/9/D/E9D80355-7AB4-45B8-80E8-983A48D5E1BD/msicuu2.exe</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
2. Save the file to the computer. <br />
3. Install this tool on the computer. <br />
4. Click Start -&gt; (All) Programs -&gt; Windows Installer Clean Up. <br />
5. See if you can find Canon Drivers. If so, remove them. <br />
6. Restart the computer. <br />
After that, try to reinstall the drivers once again</p>
<p>Refer the link below which shows the driver description: <a href="http://software.canon-europe.com/products/0010501.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://software.canon-europe.com/products/0010501.asp</a></p>
<p>Refer to the below link for more information: Windows Image Acquisition (WIA)&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi <span>Bruce Almighty</span>,<br />
<br />
<span>The feature you are inquiring about is really a great idea and would be a great feature to have.
I will submit this request to our product team.<br />
<br />
As a workaround you could set the photos to be hidden so that you could hide your private photos from being viewed by others, please follow the steps provided below:<br />
<br />
1. Select the photos that you want to hide in Windows Live Photo Gallery<br />
2. Right-click on the image and select <strong>Properties</strong><br />
3. Under the <strong>General</strong> tab, on the <strong>Attributes</strong> section, mark the
<strong>Hidden</strong>&nbsp;tick box <br />
4. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and select <strong>OK</strong><br />
<br />
By default your computer will hide those images instantly, to view those images again, you must have to do the option to Show hidden files.
<br />
<br />
Here's how to display hidden files and folders:<br />
<br />
<span>1. Open <strong>Folder</strong> <strong>Options</strong> by clicking the
<span><strong>Start</strong></span> button,&nbsp;clicking <span>
<strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong></span>, clicking <span>
<strong>Appearance</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Personalization</strong></span>, and then clicking
<span><strong>Folder</strong> <strong>Options</strong></span>.</span>
<br />
2. Click the <span><strong>View</strong></span> tab.<br />
3. Under <span><strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>settings</strong></span>, click
<span><strong>Show</strong> <strong>hidden</strong> <strong>files</strong>,
<strong>folders</strong>, <strong>and</strong> <strong>drives</strong></span>, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.<br />
<br />
If you want to hide them again, do the same steps provided above but under <strong>
Advanced</strong> <strong>settings</strong>, you must click <strong>Don't show hidden files, folders and drives</strong>.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            No, you would have the machine preloaded with the downgraded OS (XP), when you are ready to upgrade to Windows 7, you use the product key on the COA sticker attached to the chassis of the machine.

(<strong>done!</strong> ) </li><li>Perform the downgrade (<strong>by myself</strong> ) or authorize a third party to install on their behalf (or with the help of a technician).</li></ul>
<br />
The Downgrade Process:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Obtain genuine Windows media and a corresponding product key for the eligible version of Windows for downgrade (<strong>done!</strong> )</p>
<ul>
<li>The media should come from a prior legally licensed version from the OEM (<strong>mine!</strong> ) or Retail channels.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><br />
2. Insert eligible downgrade version of Windows media in the CD drive and follow the installation instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Type the product key. (I think they mean <strong>Windows 7 Product key</strong> that is in my laptop's<strong>COA label</strong> ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. If the software was previously activated (<strong>yes!</strong> ), you will not be able to activate it online. (<strong>I know!</strong> ) In this case, the appropriate local Activation Support phone number will be displayed. (I think they mean "<strong>activate
 via phone</strong> " ... Just like 7, the <strong>automated voice</strong> will give a<strong>verification ID</strong> after typing the<strong> installation ID
</strong>finally <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">after hours of effort typing it again and again</span> (read by another question: http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7install/thread/fd745eb5-253a-452d-b7f3-2a09597f4e2a/#3dd4c9cc-c09d-4fd1-bb58-3440fcded2f0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or if I directly contact <strong>the appropriate local Activation Support, </strong>
(i.e. a human support personnel!) will they collect / record whatever we converse?! The 7 automated voice is a stupid... It accepted all the set digits and after that it simply said "yours is invalid" !! It requested me to contact a real personnel... But it
 cautioned me ... It said something like this: whatever I talk <strong>will be recorded</strong> for some oh!-king! (pun intended!) purposes... like improving something?! well... I was shocked! Recorded?! woot?! why should they record?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like Yahoo! Privacy Policy: http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/ca/yahoo/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Yahoo! uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal
 and external clients." may be, remove that ad thing... But I think automated procedure does not collect and save any information...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. When it is determined that the end user has an eligible Windows license (<strong>I know... Mine is eligible...</strong> ), the customer service representative will provide a single-use activation code (<strong>just like 7's Verification ID</strong> )
 to activate the software"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
OEM Versions of Windows 7 Eligible for Downgrade
<p>Only certain OEM versions of Windows 7 include downgrade rights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows 7 Professional</strong> and Windows 7 Ultimate include downgrade rights to<strong>Windows Vista Business</strong> and Windows Vista Ultimate.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it! Even if you go to Dell.ca, "build your system". you can see this page: http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/1369/thedellonlinestorebuild.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Dell does not decide to plunder additional C$$$$$$ by having another with "<em>downgrade right</em> s</strong></span><strong>"</strong> ... Meaning?!</p>
<p>"</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows 7 Professional</strong> and Windows 7 Ultimate include downgrade rights to<strong>Windows Vista Business</strong> and Windows Vista Ultimate.
</li><li><strong>Windows 7 Professional</strong> and Windows 7 Ultimate include downgrade rights to<strong> Windows XP Professional</strong> , Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, or Windows XP x64 Edition.</li><li>Other OEM Windows 7 versions (for instance, Windows 7 Home Basic and Windows 7 Home Premium) do not include downgrade rights."</li></ul>
a.k.a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>every 7 pro (OEM) has the right to be downgraded to vista business or xp pro</strong></em></span>...
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I think if I have a Windows Vista Business x64 <strong>Retail</strong> DVD/CD/ISO (I don't know where to get! I'm only having a XP Pro CD &amp; a 7 Pro DVD given by my friends as a gift!), will it accept my<strong> 7 Pro x64 OEM key</strong> and will it
 have an option to 'activate via phone' later ?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if so, if I change my mind, can I use my 7 DVD and enter my 7 OEM key?! <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>ie. can I go back and forth from 7 to vista/xp and from vista/xp to 7</strong></em></span></p>

<p><strong>"So, what are Windows Vista “Downgrade Rights”?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
Windows Vista Business and Windows Vista Ultimate have what Microsoft calls “Downgrade Rights.”</strong> (not Premium?! here is the answer: "Other OEM Windows 7 versions (for instance, Windows 7 Home Basic and Windows 7 Home Premium) do not include downgrade
 rights." -&gt; from 7's though!)&nbsp; Downgrade Rights means that<em><strong>anyone with a Windows Vista Business or Windows Vista Ultimate operating system can downgrade to Windows XP Professional provided they have the media for Windows XP Professional.</strong>
</em>Customers may use one operating system at any single point in time (cannot run both operating systems simultaneously unless an additional license is purchased).<strong>(</strong> heck! we know that!!<strong>)</strong> For customers who decide to exercise
 Downgrade Rights on their own, however, please note that Dell will only support the factory-installed operating system. Windows Vista Home Basic and Windows Vista Home Premium do not have this option, as they are not capable of downgrading to Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean for Dell to exercise “Downgrade Rights” for me? Where can I find this option?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are configuring your system online or through the help of one of our sales experts, you will have the opportunity to select which operating system you would like on your PC. When selecting your operating system, you will see an
 option called<strong><em>“Genuine Windows®&nbsp;Vista Business with Windows® XP Pro Downgrade Rights” and “Genuine Windows®&nbsp;Vista Ultimate with Windows® XP Pro Downgrade Rights.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">”</span></em></strong><strong>*</strong>
</p>
<p>With these options, you may purchase the licensed rights to Windows Vista but have Dell factory install Windows XP Professional. You will also receive a backup media disc for Windows XP Professional as well as the media for Windows Vista so you can upgrade
 when you’re ready. Furthermore, with these options Dell will provide technical support for the factory-installed Windows XP Professional image and your licensed version of Windows Vista</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">* (-&gt; which I think <strong>Dell does not with 7</strong> ... I didn't see an option with "<strong>downgrade rights</strong> " in the<strong>latest systems with 7</strong> ...</span> If it does, could you please send
 the link?! Even if it does, it is just a parsimonious pervert... ;P) blah blah blah!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can I downgrade on my own? </strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Yes, you can</strong> as long as you have your own <strong>Windows XP Professional media</strong> (i.e. from a prior purchase)."<strong>(</strong> Wait a minute... Did they mean<strong>XP/Vista CD/DVD/ISO</strong> ?!) what does "prior purchase mean
 in this context?!) :-/<strong>)</strong> However, Dell’s standard policy is to provide technical support on the operating system that comes pre-installed on your PC.<strong>[No problem... With all due respect, your support<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SUCKS</span>
 ... anyways... :(]</strong> Dell does not encourage you to change your operating system on your own as this can be a complicated process.<strong>[I love complication and I do many things better than the technicians themselves! :)]</strong></p>

-&gt; (popeye!!) Well, I think it is official... Windows<strong>Vista</strong><strong>sucked/sucks</strong> (most people thought/think so... May be, at least for owners of low-end computers)... Because of that, many people [including my own sissie* (sorry!
 sister! :D)] wanted to downgrade to XP... So, because of this<strong>huge ocean of hatred</strong> (Bieber, anyone?! Just have a look at his "Baby" (he calls his "baby" love "baby" because he is a "baby"... I call my lady love "Babe" because I'm a "gentle"man...

 too...</span></span>:) That's why the hand held ones are called "flash"light! LOL XD Even I was kinda attracted to 7 before buying my new laptop (bought just few months before! 740 i7!) Tried hmmmmm your MVP askvg's ... But :( It did not suite my needs...
 Seven Tranformation pack?! messed my system and was forced to do a system restore though it won Softpedia (I still remember Site advisor's red flagging! kinda funny! LOL) Editor pick... Well, most of 'em (including MPlayer full version!) are good... That's
 how I found out/discovered MS' (Casino) "Royale" theme... I added "Casino" before "Royale" because that's my only (I think I didn't see "Gold Finger... I think I will... In the future... May be, Mr. craig is too tough to be bond... Personally I prefer Brosnan
 as Bond oh! Craig is also good! LOL) favo(u!)rite Bond movie... :) From the bottom of my heart, I hate luna(tic) theme... Even thought to buy Windows Blinds... Kinda cheap... Isn't it?! LOL But I love Royale theme (smooth edges, kinda adds flashy touch to
 XP... Even http://www.askvg.com/download-windows-xp-royale-blue-theme-for-windows-7/ says Royale Blue theme (Noir sucks! LOL) is good... wow! People using 7 want Royale Blue!! Kinda funny! Transparency is gone!! I like Royale theme with 7 like transparency
 for my XP Pro... :) Though i <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hate</span> the "crown" (</span> http://preview.tinyurl.com/39kbcqo<strong>)</strong><span>, I love this "Royale" Blue... :) :) :) :)<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>MS has done four good things... One is you know... extending period (both XP and downgrade (possibly upgrading after downgrading too...!) rights..), Royale theme for XP (though it is just a slight alteration of de(the)"fault"(y)
 Luna(tic) theme... MS keyboard... MS wired keyboard 500 black&nbsp; (http://www.microsoft.com/canada/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=063) though space bar is kinda shaky... Many be... Because I played few games?! Hank 2010?! Madness?! Well, but

 has good precision.... But it lacks smooth and soft clicks... But Dell's is kinda good... :) After spending thousands of CAD, all i got are a mouse, a 2 MP web (heck! I can't connect the web... :) camera and huuuuge 500 GB hard disk... :( :( :( Last but not
 the least... Our "rocket science", Microsoft Security Essentials... Also free for small business, huh?! http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mssmallbiz/archive/2010/09/22/announcing-microsoft-security-essentials-available-free-to-small-businesses-in-october.aspx I just

<p>You know what to do?! I didn't violate any terms and conditions...&nbsp; http://www.microsoft.com/info/can-en/cpyright.mspx (hey, where is "o" after "c" ?! LOL) I even changed my pic to a public domain one! ;P Oh! I also changed to my name!! :P</p>
<p><br />
Did I troll?! Nope! According to PCMag.com (http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=trolling&amp;i=53181,00.asp#) , "trolling" has three meanings:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<span><strong>(1)</strong> Surfing, or browsing, the Web. (we all do this, don't we?! :D)<br />
<br />
<strong>(2)</strong> Posting derogatory messages about sensitive subjects on newsgroups and chat rooms to bait users into responding. (Where is Ron?! Read his answer...</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>"</span> "Will Vista and XP accept 7's OEM key while activation?! Just wondering" OF COURSE NOT!<strong>What a stupid question</strong> . If you want to know about downgrade rights call Volume Licensing.<strong>Now that
 you have insulted a whole country and more, why not just go out and hunt some bears with your hockey stick and your skates on? Heck I usually<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> stick to insulting</span> just one person at a time.</strong> " So, he

 He also has talked about "sensitive" things including but not limited to: "hunting other animals" ... Did you watch 'The Cove' ?! Do you love when an innocent and friendly dolphin (if you ask me, dolphins are better than dogs! LOL) get killed<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">in
 the extreme level of gore</span> (a red sea (not the one in between asia and africa! LOL) a sea /ocean full of blood! definitely... whales and dolphins have more than our 5 liter/litre) After all, Polar Bears are "Vulnerable species" link: http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2006/05/01/polarbears060501.html
 At least... We must not eat/kill our "unofficial" national symbol, Polar Bear... Heck!&nbsp; "Australians urged to eat kangaroo" (!): http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7645969.stm wait a minute... "Sheep and cows produce a high amount of environmentally unfriendly
 methane gas through belching and flatulence." wow!! What about<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">humans</span> ?! We all know... humans, the "ultimate" predators... The "most developed" "most important" creation of "god" destroy the environment a bajillion
 (!) times more than what innocent "sheep" and "cows" do... HUMANS "PRODUCE"<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">THE HIGHEST</span> AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE... Heck! We are even dared to cause "celestial damage" ... NASA kinda wanted to destroy moon:
 http://blogs.suntimes.com/shinyobjects/2009/10/nasas_new_moon_mission_ram_it_with_a_rocket_look_for_ice.html&nbsp; Why not do a chemical reaction with Hydrogen and Oxygen?! Seen "Day after tomorrow" ?! There won't be water scarcity if we continue to increase global
 warming... I think the whole earth will be covered/submersed with water if polar caps melt... After all,&nbsp; water bodies dominate our earth... :) Be prepared to witness "satellite meteorites" ..! because of "space pollution" http://www.economist.com/node/16843825
 So, I think they are supporting "cannibalism" ?! Or should we resurrect "Colosseum" instead of watching "simulated" WWE ?! ) LOL</p>

 ... e.g. I've talked about having a currency symbol for CAD... I've typed "CAD",&nbsp; "C$$$$$$" many times here.. So, wouldn't it be good to have a single sign, eh?! Even in this post, I've talked about hmmm "whaling" and "killing and eating other animals" "destroying/
 polluting both environmentally and celestially" because Ron wanted me to "hunt some polar bears with "my" hockey stick and "my" skates on" (!) Just like that, everything is interconnected... It is a network that is even more confusing than Navis' to mortals...

    <title>Windows 10 - My computer will not shut off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sstraveler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - My computer will not shut off</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo desktop (model H500s) and it will not shut down with Windows 10.&nbsp; It is a fairly new machine -- just over a year -- but I made the mistake of upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking on the Interrnet I saw this seems to be a common problem and for the moment the work around is to press shift and then shut down and it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the discussion seems to be be with laptops and their power settings ... but mine is a desktop
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I would like to get the machine to work correctly.&nbsp; Someone told me it is a driver issue and I tried to get answers at Lenovo and that was a waste of time.&nbsp; I can not figure out which files to download from their site and I asked on their community and
 got no replies.&nbsp; I asked their tech support and they were too busy trying to sell me a tech support package that costs more than the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what I need to update to make this work .... or should I just try and uninstall Windows 10 and go back to Windows 8???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

</p><p>I tried running the troubleshooting as directed for power and it said no changes we necessary on the system yet the computer still has the problem.&nbsp; When you click of shut off it goes through the power down procedure and about 60 seconds later turns itself

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t Windows 7 &#34;show me other ways to activate&#34; on a virtual machine&#63;</h2>
                    I am attempting to activate Windows 7&nbsp;by phone (because the machine doesn't have an internet connection) for a virtual machine ( I do have a separate liscense for the Virtual Box), but when I try to activate, the "show me other ways to activate" option
 is inactive (i.e. it is "grayed" out). Why won't Windows 7 let me access this activation method?

<p>I just had to reformat my Latitude D31, and don't know how to make the wireless network connection appear on the network connections list.&nbsp; The wireless is turned on and the router is working.</p>
<p>On a related (sort of) topic, before the reformat I had a blue screen that said since more memory was being used than was installed, there was no memory for anything else.&nbsp; The computer runs (I reinstalled WinXP, but in setup the message still comes up.&nbsp;
 Is this normal?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Old laptops use to come with very little memory.&nbsp; Since then software needs outgrow the amount of installed memory</p>
<p>Check the amount of memory that you have and see if you can upgrade.</p>
<p>You can find and extended manual on Dell' support for the Laptop.</p>
<p><strong>As for the Wireless.</strong></p>
<p>It could be that the Wireless card is Not operational and need reinstall of drivers.</p>
<p>Maybe this can Help.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, and try to connect with No Wireless security.</p>
<p>When working turn On the Wireless security.</p>

<h2>            Skype error message&#58; weak internet signal</h2>
                    <p>I am using Skype on my MacBookPro. Never had any issue. Use it daily. Over the past few weeks, I cannot connect to audio or video. Getting a message saying "weak internet signal". I can stream video, no problem. I use the same internet on my phone, no problem
 with audio or video. I can message on my Mac only. Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Un-zip function does not work. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian e.g.young  say:</h3>
<h2>            Un-zip function does not work.</h2>
                    My computor came with Vista installed.&nbsp; Initially the un-zip function worked but eventualy quit.&nbsp; So I downloaded Winzip which only worked sometimes.&nbsp; Contacted the Microsoft help technition but that was a waste of time with no solution forthcoming.&nbsp; But
 I had an option for a free upgrade to Windows 7 which I excercised.&nbsp; The un-zip function did not work on that either, so once again downloaded Winzip which worked occasionaly.&nbsp; Then I tried 7-Zip which worked on one occasion, but does not work at all at this
 moment. However, my old computer which has Windows XP continues to give me reliable un-zips of all my downloads.&nbsp; I use this computer for downloads, burn them to a disc and install them into my new high speed computer.&nbsp; This is a clumsy long winded way of
 receiving downloads and I seek advice on how to make the unzip function in Windows 7 work.&nbsp; Despite of charging me a&nbsp; large price for Windows 7, Microsoft is no help in solving my unzip problem.<br />
Sincerely<br />

<h2>            Unable to connect any phone to my laptop after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi.. I am using Lenovo Yoga 500 laptop. I upgraded to Windows 10 two months back. Since then I am unable to connect any phone to my laptop. I tried windows phones and android phones. Devices are connecting and disconnecting frequently and windows explorer
 is crashing. The same phones are easily connecting to Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs. I tried on 3 laptops with windows 10. Unable to connect in any of these. So I assume this is a problem with windows 10. Pls help me to establish the USB connection. Also I am wondering
 why this issue is not resolved in any of the cumulative updates till now.</p>
<p>One more issue I am facing with windows 10 is that the windows update setting&nbsp;is not responsive and crashing sometimes. Pls help me to resolve this too.</p>

<p>Hi Anoop,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the USB connection fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any error message while installing the Windows Updates?</p>
</strong><span>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted, incompatible or due to hardware problems.<span>
</span></p>
</span><span>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: <span>Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with devices and hardware. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Update the USB drivers</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Most hardware interfaces require driver software to work properly. If you recently upgraded from one version of Windows to another, power outages, viruses, or other computer problems, it's possible that the drivers have become corrupted. Downloading and
 installing the <strong>latest driver </strong>can resolve these types of problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below article to know how to <strong>Update drivers</strong>:</p>

<h2>            The file is possibly corrupt. The file header checksum does not match the computed checksum.</h2>
                    <div>Specs--</div>
<div>Model: Alienware M15X</div>
<div>OS: 64-bit Windows 7&nbsp;</div>

<div>(If you need to know anything else, let me know. I will do my best to find this information).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Hello! I am having a world of trouble trying to fix my computer. What happened was I installed an Alienware theme on my laptop, and while uninstalling it, my computer crashed. Now I have the message "The file is possibly corrupt. The file header checksum does
 not match the computed checksum," in white text on a black background when I try and boot into Windows 7. My guess is that my boot image is corrupt because the theme made its own boot image, and when the uninstall crashed, the file became corrupt. Since then,
 I have tried booting Ubuntu from a USB drive, same error. Booted with one stick of RAM each (they seem fine), same error. Made a System Repair disk using another 64-bit Windows 7 computer of mine (my computer doesn't seem to recognize the CD-R in the DVD drive),
 same error after some noises. I tried pressing F8 to &nbsp;get to the Advanced Boot Options menu, but the same error text pops up. I can access my BIOS.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All help appreciated. I am desperate to get this issue fixed.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Cameron ,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the computer does not seem to recognize the CD-R in the DVD drive probably boot order is set to Hard Disk Drive first. I would suggest you to change the boot priority to CD\DVD in BIOS and then try to perform startup repair.<br />
Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>In order to make changes in the BIOS, I would suggest you to contact the computer manufacturer.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Unplug any external device connected to the computer except for keyboard and mouse and check if&nbsp;issue persists.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>M</strong><strong>ethod 2:</strong></p>
<p>Startup Repair is one of the recovery tools in the System Recovery Options menu. This set of tools is located on your computer's hard disk and on the Windows installation disc.<br />
Startup repair:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Also, if startup repair does not help, you can perform a system restore and check.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p>What are the system recovery options in <span>Windows 7</span>?</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">Note: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</font></span></p>

<p>Hope this information is helpful.<br />

    <title>twitch.tv lags while moving the mouse over the stream in microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deyanyanev  say:</h3>
<h2>            twitch.tv lags while moving the mouse over the stream in microsoft edge</h2>
                    I don't know if this should be posted here or in twitch forum I'll try first here. As the title says every time I watch stream in twitch and move the mouse a little or just move it over the stream it always lags. How do I fix this? I see other people have
 this issue and they're unable to fix it. I use livestreamer in my laptop because while watching it from the browser the CPU heats over 60%+ and with lifestreamer is around 25-50. So let's get started. On my computer I use Microsoft edge and every time I decided
 to watch stream from it, it lags. I don't know if the problems on me or the edge browser. I think I have the latest adobe flash player installed in edge. Any suggestion beside using livestreamer how to fix this lag? Before a couple of days I didn't had it..
 I don't know from where the problem came...
