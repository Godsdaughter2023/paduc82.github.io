<h2>            VS2017 message&#58; publishing to the selected azure virtual machine has not been enabled</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">I am looking for help on how to resolve the following informational message when creating a publish profile in visual studio 2017: "publishing
 to the selected azure virtual machine has not been enabled".</span><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I'm trying to set up a new publish profile for my production server. I have already successfully set one up for my development server. Both servers are Azure VMs. They use different network security groups.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I get this message when selecting New Profile-&gt;Azure Virtual Machines (click browse), selecting my production server and clicking OK.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I have already triple checked my firewall settings on both the VMs and Azure Portal. I don't think these are the cause though because I do not get this message when I choose my db server which doesn't even have IIS set up. My db and production server share
 an Azure network security resource group.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I'm using VS Community 2017 15.9.2 with an Azure VM and WebDeploy 3.5</p>

C:\inetpub\logs\wmsvc has no logs on my production server but DOES have logs on my development server which makes sense since it's working there.</p>

    <title>12 Go RAM suffering from insufficient memory problem in win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            12 Go RAM suffering from insufficient memory problem in win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been in this big trouble with my computer since several weeks. &nbsp;i wished that u guys can help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i mentioned in the title, i have a laptop with 12 G RAM running win 10. &nbsp;The virtual memory option, i have leave the computer to manager it himself. &nbsp;So, theoretically, &nbsp;i should be fine with my hardware and the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since several weeks, my laptop keep telling me that i have insufficient memory and i need to shut down tasks in order to avoid a system crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, i am very confused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As you can see in the picture, the consumption level is at around 36%. That's odd. Because that means with 12 Go RAM, i am using about 4 Go when i get this snapshot. But &nbsp;if i added all the process consumption together, that's even less than 2 Go
 what i am using. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58ff064e-d165-4535-bcdd-25ccf647186e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58ff064e-d165-4535-bcdd-25ccf647186e" /></a></p>
<p>Secondly, even at 36% consumption level, my laptop should still work fine.<strong> But when i open 3-5 more chrome session or edge sessions, the consumption level rise to around 45%, then i keep receiving that not insufficient memory alert. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no choice but to shut down several of them. &nbsp;Otherwise the system will crash soon enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>At first, i was wondering if that's chrome's problem. Then i try with Edge, same results</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Then i run several anti-virus program to check if my computer was affected, the results are all clean.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have did a memory hardware check, turns out hardware is at excellent status.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what happens to my computer? &nbsp; And what should i do to get out of this difficult situation ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for all the suggestions and solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Where is Windows Temporary Internet files located&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I installed Quicken Home &amp; Business 2011 on my Windows 7 PC last week. Everything seems to work OK but I keep receiving an error message saying Quicken is unable to find the file:&nbsp; C:\Users\my name\App.Data\Local\Microsoft\Windows Temp. files\Low\content.
 IE5|MSORDUCB\cfx 61058[1].qfx file.<br />
Having contacted Intuit several times they suggested a clean re-installation of the Quicken program and this I have tried three times ensuring that all old Quicken files have been removed.<br />
I am still unable to navigate to the referenced file as there is no Windows temporary Internet file listed in the Microsoft Folder. Simiilarly there is no such file in the Roaminf folder if I substitute it for Local.<br />
I am wondering if the error message is valid for a PC using Windows 7? Shoulkd there be Temporary Internet Files in the Local\Mcrosoft tre? If so are they produced by Windows or the application (Quicken in this case)?</p>

<p>When you are installing Quicken (if you haven't tried this already), try right-clicking on the actual Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one and the same folder but shown in different locations (or maybe a copy of it probably by design?).</p>
<p>C:\Users\usernamexxxx\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files</p>
<p><br />
C:\Users\usernamexxxx\AppData\Local\Temp\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\ then various alphanumeric folders containing files</p>
<p>You can also view the files via Internet Explorer and the T.I.F. via Tools/ Internet Options/ Browsing History/ Settings/ View Files</p>
<p>Most of the files in the T.I.F. folder are made up of pieces of web pages, copies of downloads, and Cookies.</p>

            <p>I had this same problem following a windows update to 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The way I fixed&nbsp;it is to uninstall the sound card in device manager. You get to device manager by going to search, and just searching "device manager". there should be a sound section at the top where you can uninstall.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then search for the soundcard (in my case, IDT high definition audio CODEC) + windows 8, on HP's site. download and restart, then I had sound! Only took like 10 hours of trying all kinds of things. Best feeling ever after I got it fixed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Will</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Edit: My sound stopped working again, but a restart fixed so I don't know if this is a perfect solution. I also found the following. hope one of these works for you.

<p><span>My mom bought me a brand new Xbox and Microsoft banned it within a week...they won't tell me why it was banned either...probably because they know i didnt do anything wrong....I've called Xbox support, emailed Xbox support, and tweeted Xbox support
 but no one will ever help me?? I did nothing wrong and they just banned my Xbox?? They are always avoiding me and no one ever helps me?? This thread will probably get deleted too...even though im not violating any rules...Microsoft owes me a brand new Xbox
 and they know it!! I've never violated the Terms of Use and if you have proof then please provide it...this is very unfair?? I just want to play Xbox with my friends!</span></p>

<p><em>You have been told multiple times in all the different threads you have created that the XBLPET do not discuss console bans.&nbsp; They do not hand out console bans for nothing, so either your mom was lied to and it was a pre owned console that was already
 banned or you broke the TOU.<br />
<br />
I seem to remember it was established in another thread of yours that this console was an Elite, and most likely becuase of that was not new.<br />
<br />
Its quite simple really, either way an explanation is not given for console bans so you either need to buy a 'new' console or not.</em></p>

<h2>            No automatic answering setting anymore&#63;</h2>
                    In the previous version I could specify Skype to automatically open when my daughter skype me. As I am 98 years old I do not know which button to press anymore. Now my daughter cannot configure Skype to do so. Is this right or haven't I found this setting
 yet? If it still exists where can I find it and configure my computer that way?

<p>
</p><p>I definitely understand where you are coming from. It is correct that the Skype on mobile devices does not have an option to set the automatic answer. We are still updating the new Skype functionality for mobile devices and you can assure that this will
 be forwarded to the development team as feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, you can advise to use the new Skype for Windows desktop, Mac and Linux and set the automatic answer there. To enable this option, please refer to the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select your <strong>avatar</strong>.</li><li>Scroll to <strong>Calling</strong>.</li><li>Enable <strong>Answer incoming call automaticall</strong>y.</li><li>Optionally you can set <strong>Start my video automatically</strong> as a secondary option.</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 2012 Server R2 - Windows Domain short name</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologies in advance if part of this doesn't make sense. but i will try explaining it as clearly as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my old work place we was able to use a alias to recognize the networks domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.g Domain name was lets say: mydomainname.internal\</p>
<p>
</p><p>However we was able to give it some form of initials to shorten it i.e dm\username.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it made life so easy when we had in to remote into machine as most, as the remote access software we use asks for the domain name and we could just type the initial like dm\username and it would recognize it as "mydomainname.internal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps in explaining my question</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone could point me in the right direction, i would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a new (January 2016) Win10 laptop - after being screwed up by the January WUs, I eventually was pointed in the right direction to my OEM, HP, and they sorted out my problems. I've had a few hiccups after every WU and was disappointed that the Anniversary
 Update didn't resolve my problems as most had thought/hoped for. So I'm still left with OneDrive holding all my files/folders etc and not syncing with those in This PC from which many folders &amp; files have disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;also have a four-years old lap top. It worked well in Win7 until being completely screwed up by a forced and unwanted free upgrade to Win 10. I haven't used it for five or six months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Users have had new problems caused by WUs - take a read through the MC and you'll see many such examples eg "Defender now screwed-up", "Edge&nbsp;file download security warning when I open a Favourites link", "Lost files", "Lost/unable to open Photos" and
 even "WAU still keeps crashing".</p>

<p>Finally when this new PC is finally 'clean', I will look at a Clean Install. By then I hope that the current spat between an Insider on the one side and several 'big names' here about the Insider's view on a technical issue (partitions?) will have been resolved
 one way or another.</p>
<p>In closing, I am getting used to Win10 and in most ways it's better than Win7 but why oh why are there so many problems apparently caused by Windows Updates?</p>

            Taffy- I understand your frustration, and applaud your efforts in this Microsoft Community. I just wanted to point out that the
<em><strong>Insider</strong></em> designation is meaningless. It just means we get updates before they are released to everyone. Although I have many years of experience, I am not an expert, on the Windows platform. &nbsp;The problem comes in when people want their
<strong><em>OPINIONS </em></strong><em>to be '<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">righ</span>t'
</em>At any rate, I only try to help. I get tired of the trolls, and have tried to not participate in the community any longer.
<strong>Good luck</strong> with this <em>new thread.</em>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;You're right in principle but in the case of the Clean Install, the profile of the&nbsp;Insider in question says
</p>
<p><em>"Working professionally within the IT world for over 25 years, mostly with select small businesses and select residential clients. Heavy concentration on forensics and security; and device utilization."</em></p>

</p><p>I fully realise that this is a Community forum, not a Microsoft Help Desk, but when experts have opposing views on a Clean Install (which is apparently what I need to do - or have done, which is a route I'll probably take) it's hard for thickies to know

 that helped the sellers offer nice hardware at a reasonable price, have a very limited 'free' oem support lifecycle, and may negatively impact the safety, security, stability of the PC with a Microsoft OS as it updates, upgrades, and/or hardens its OS (and

</blockquote>
<p>My my my Taffy, I see that you rewrote, reposted, or&nbsp;added to your question here. I'll attempt to address in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I'll ask a question, is your intent to retain all of the OEM software and applications intact for future use and is that why you are attempting to fix rather than replace?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the presumably empty&nbsp;folders in your new laptops&nbsp;user account also show the green OneDrive insignia on the folder face?</p>
<p>That is what some others that have had (do have) this problem report. If so there is a registry error fix for that (not a work around). Are there also other accompanying issues that manifested at the same time? Is the new laptop still now on the WAU v.1607
 or did you do the "Go Back to an Earlier Build" roll back that is/was available for you&nbsp;to do for a 10 day period?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first question in my reply also applies to the old&nbsp;laptop.</p>
<p>Does&nbsp;the old&nbsp;laptop boot up to the windows environment?</p>
<p>If so&nbsp;there are 2 ways you could go here.</p>
<p>If not let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer to have the old&nbsp;laptop be a Windows 7 device once&nbsp;again (MS is no longer forcing the upgrade to Win 10) This can be done (and no it does not involve the rollback that was and&nbsp;is no longer available&nbsp;in&nbsp;the laptop). If that's what you want to
 do then&nbsp;let me know and&nbsp;include the answer to the first question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I'll interject that there are updates to check for on the old laptop from the OEM either way you decide to go with it, the most important being a possible bios firmware update to the most recent version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want the old laptop to be Windows 10.</p>
<p>You've stated that you haven't used the old laptop for 5 or 6 mos. since the forced upgrade was done so I presume that it has the Win 10 v.1511 on it less the updates of the same time period? Do you have the physical media created&nbsp;for the v.1511 or did you
 create a recovery drive after the upgrade?&nbsp;Let me know and we can go from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually a true&nbsp;clean install is just that, it wipes the hard drive of all the old, reformats&nbsp;and repartitions it, and installs a fresh load of the OS to be built upon from there without having to try to deal with any of the&nbsp;old garbage or preinstalled&nbsp;"bloatware".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;An ISO file is basically a Disc Image File used to create physical media.&nbsp;You are correct to not go about using a "non-Microsoft site" to download a Windows ISO file as this is readily available from Microsoft. (Since 08/02/16 the download from&nbsp;MS&nbsp;is v.1607
 and that&nbsp;is not a problem, I'll explain later if you choose this route).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the "discussion" about the size of partitions, this is a legitimate discussion concerning certain circumstances as I referred you to&nbsp;in one of your other threads with a link to a thread containing a real&nbsp;world example, however, when doing a true clean
 install this becomes a non-issue as the installer is creating the partions to accommodate it's own needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to do a true and fully clean install. Backup all of your important data to an external storage device and then let me know when your ready&nbsp;and I will then&nbsp;post the complete instructions for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I hope I've been able to clear some things up for you here. Let me know if you want more info or help with the issues you have been experiencing.</p>
<p>

    <title>Error code&#58; 0x80240024 when trying to download some apps&#40;other - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error code&#58; 0x80240024 when trying to download some apps&#40;other apps download ok&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I recently did a clean install of Windows 10 on my PC and when I tried to download the Netflix and a photo editing app I get: Try that again, Something went wrong error code: 0x80240024. This is only happening on two apps and all others download just fine.
 I searched and tried several different things, like clearing the store cache, the app troubleshooter, resetting the store app... Nothing seemed to help so since it was a fresh install I thought maybe something went wrong during the install process, so I deleted
 all partitions and did another clean install and am still getting the same error on those two apps only. I again tried resetting the store cache and so on, but nothing has helped.</p>
<p><br />
I ran a sfc /scannow on the new install and it found no errors. I then did all the updates and tried to download those apps again, but still got the same error. I ran another sfc /scannow and it found errors that it was unable to repair, so apparently performing
 the recommended Windows updates corrupted something(that's pretty bad Microsoft). I was able to use the DSIM commands to restore health and ran another sfc /scannow and it was able to repair all the files this time. I should not&nbsp; have to do this after only
 installing Windows updates, but that's just my opinion and another issue that has since been repaired. I am however still getting the same error when trying to download the same two apps after this second clean install, so something strange is going on.</p>
<p><br />
With all due respect Microsoft advisers, please do not recommend a Windows reset or another clean install as that has not helped the situation. It appears to me that this has something to do with my Microsoft account since it happened on two clean installs.
 Both installs were using a local account if that matters. As I said I have already reset the store cache and ran the app troubleshooter and that has had no effect so far. Any help is appreciated.</p>

                    I have a Surface Pro 3 that is just three years old. I noticed that the top of the screen is coming apart from the back of the computer. The computer is still working, but the screen is affected from the top. What can be done for this?

<h2>            Paint 3D Bucket Tool</h2>
                    Hello, I have a question concerning the bucket tool in Paint 3D. Even after turning the tolerance down to 0, the bucket fills other colors surrounding the one I am trying to fill. This is a problem as I am trying to leave certain pixels another color,
 and the bucket does not fill only the one color it is supposed to. Is there any way to only fill one singular connected color?

My responder said that there is no provision to change the picture in my computer system summary.&nbsp; I thought that was the end of it.&nbsp; FYI, I do appreciate the quick response and the very good service you provide.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; :-)<br />

    <title>No bootable device Lenovo Flex 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aliabdullahsv  say:</h3>
<h2>            No bootable device Lenovo Flex 3</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a lenovo flex 3 and about 2 months ago I dropped it when it was on sleep mode. When I turned it on again, it operated for 30 second and froze after. I forced it to shut down and turned it on again but it was stuck on the lenovo screen. A little while
 after a message appeared saying that it is recovering the error. When it finished, the message "no bootable device restart the system appeared." I shut it off and searched for solutions online and found some suggestions like:</p>
<p>1) openning the bios and go to boot and change the boot mode to legacy support. (Didn't work)</p>
<p>2) Another solution was to get the HDD out and plug it back in. (Didn't work)</p>
<p>And most other solutions were revolving around these two options including setting the HDD as a priority but all didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the bios information menu my HDD name appears under Had disk, so I'm assuming it is not damaged or it might be disregarding its appearance there I do not know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to this problem?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><strong>No bootable device found</strong> error may indicate a hard drive issue. Part of the resolution is configuring your BIOS and HDD which would be best handled by the device manufacturer. For further assistance, please get in touch with your device

            Yes, for sure. I have to believe that the problem of the "missing brightness slider" is the result of the age of the laptop, as everything is up to date. I was just looking for the possibility of a workaround to restore it to the Power Options page. Thank
 you for your help.

<p>Rented Mass Effect 3 from gamefly, played fine until I added some DLC.&nbsp; Now once I get the screen with the NEW GAME/CONTINUE GAME etc. options, I get a CHECKING DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT message in center of screen with a spinning LOADING icon in the bottom right,

            <div>Hi John,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To use Windows 8 to wipe out the print request from your printer's memory, follow these steps:<br />
<div>1.From the Start screen, click the Desktop tile.</div>
<div>2.Choose your printer's name or icon from the taskbar; when the Devices and Printers window appears, right-click your printer and choose See What's Printing.</div>
<div>3.Right-click your mistaken document and choose Cancel to end the job. Repeat with any other listed unwanted documents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Your printer queue can take a minute or two to clear itself. (To speed things up, click the View menu and choose Refresh.) When the print queue is clear, turn your printer back on; it won't keep printing that same darn document.<br />
•The print queue, also known as the print spooler, lists every document waiting patiently to reach your printer. Feel free to change their printing order by dragging and dropping them up or down the list. (You can't move anything in front of the currently printing
 document, though.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.<br />
