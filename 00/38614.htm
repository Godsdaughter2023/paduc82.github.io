            <p>Unless you have an optional memory card installed in your phone which Windows will see as a flash drive, you will have to go to the phome manufacturer website and download 'connection to PC' software, often called 'Phone Tools' or similar..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you give make and model of phone, I will see what I can find out for you.. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>You'll need to see the phone's manual to find out as they vary.&nbsp; It's probably in the same section as the instructions for installing in on Win7.</p>
<p>It might be as simple as opening Windows explorer &amp; seeing the phone appear as a drive just as if it was a USB memory stick.&nbsp; In that case you can just&nbsp;look through&nbsp;the phone's folders &amp; copy the photos across.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In some other cases, the phone software has to be run to create a sort of dummy drive so look for the phone maker's name in your Start menu, All programs folders and see what advice &amp; applications are in there.</p>

            Hi Raj.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's a Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.
<br /><a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.
<br />

            Hi Mike, I am Rob, an independent and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br />
<br />Definitely sounds like a hardware issue and since the computer is new and still under warranty please contact HP's  Support and the seller. As OEM they are responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done. 
<br />
<br />Having had and helped many others with similar issues on new computers I have learned the hard way that working with the system maker's support is definitely the best move.
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance. Feedback definitely helps us help all.       
        </p>

            Hi Mike,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            No sound from desktop front jack headphones or microphone</h2>
                    <p>There was no sound at all but after uninstalling the AMD High Definition Audio Device and RealTek High Definition Audio drivers in Device Manager&gt;Sound there was sound from the rear jack external speakers but not the front jack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By right clicking on the sound icon&gt;Playback devices, I get the rear external speaker displayed but I can't get the headphones to do so when I right click and click show disabled or&nbsp;disconnected devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also gone into Control Panel&gt;Sound&gt;RealTek Audio Device, but I can't see how to add the speakers and mic.</p>

            <p>Guys I found the answer. I had to go into the Audio Manager - on my computer (a SAMA desktop with a system manufactured by MSI) called "RealTek HD Audio Manager", from Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In it I clicked on the cog icon for settings, and clicked on "Disable from jack detection". Surely it should say "Enable"!!! That enabled the front jacks to be highlighted and working.</p>

<h2>            a program always tries to run as administrator, how to make this stop happening</h2>
                    Hello:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I recently had to run a program from Google Chrome as an administrator. However, ever since then whenever I run Chrome Win7 tries to run it as an administrator. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the program, but it still tries to run it as an administrator.
 How can I make this stop? Thank you.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

<p><span>Hi Daniel – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.
<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>This is pretty easy, unless the software developers have set the “requireAdministrator” tag<br />
in their app.manifest file for their Executable (exe) file. However, bringing in some details,
<br />
programs like Mozilla FireFox® (FF) or Google™ Chrome require a UAC elevation due to the<br />
program restrictions, so when these programs try to download a new update for the
<br />
Web browser, they then ask you for permission since UAC is enabled. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I assume that you have a shortcut of Google™ Chrome
<br />
on your desktop. If this is true, then just right-click the <br />
shortcut and choose Properties. <br />
<br />
Navigate to the Shortcut tab and click Advanced. <br />
A small dialog will appear, if the Run as administrator <br />
checkbox is checked then uncheck. But, if it isn’t then<br />
this is a Google™ compatibility improvement. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
I hope you find this information useful and if you need any further assistance, <br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know. </span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information was helpful…</span></p>
<p><span>Have a nice day…</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,<br />
Fisnik</span></p>

    <title>HDD partially corrupted&#63; Is that even possible&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eatbologna  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDD partially corrupted&#63; Is that even possible&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an original Elite unit with a 120GB HDD. I've been having a really hard time downloading the games with gold game for this month; (Darksiders II) it gets to 70% and then there's an error, my console freezes, and I have to do a hard restart. Sometimes
 I even get a E68 error. I've cleared my cache, deleted the corrupted data, etc. etc. The only thing I haven't done is format my HDD because I don't want to lose my saved files on downloaded games (see my other post). I've seen a lot of people with similar
 problems reporting that it's an HDD corruption issue. I decided to do some experimenting and I've come up with an interesting hypothesis...</p>
<p>To test if this was an issue with my HDD or with the download itself I took my hard drive out and restarted my console with a 32gb USB&nbsp; plugged in. I was able to download the game in its entirety onto the USB which is cause for alarm number one. After that
 I said OK, let me see if I can transfer that to my HDD now from the USB. It gets about 3/4 of the way done and then there's an error again freezing my system and causing an E68 - cause for alarm number 2. At this point I'm like OK, I probably need to format
 my hard drive; but let me do just a little more testing. This is when things get interesting.</p>
<p>The next thing I did was transfer the games that I have saves with to my HDD so that I won't lose my progress (again, see previous post). This worked just fine, and now I have extra space on my HDD. I previously had about 40 gigs left, now I have 60 gigs
 available. This is where my theory comes into play as stated in my title. I started to COPY the data back onto my hard drive starting with the largest files and working my way down. Everything worked perfectly up until my HDD was back down to only 40gigs;
 at that point every time I tried to move a save data (only 1.1gigs) I get an error message that says "There was a problem performing that action". Does anyone have any idea why that could be? Why would my HDD work perfectly up until it is 2/3 of the way full?
 Is there some sort of partition in the hard drive and that is the only one that is corrupted? Is there any way for me to just format that area? Everything else works perfectly fine. I can even play the games that I had copied.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that E38 is really the issue here... I got it just that one time and after I turned off my console and restarted it I haven't gotten it again. My real question is about why I can't transfer my data once my HDD reaches (approximately) 66% capacity
 and if that's possible to fix. I will call support over the weekend I guess... but I'm sure they are going to tell me to re-format my HDD.

<p>The problem is that your drive might have bad sectors when you removed the files those sectors were free again &nbsp;andyour xbox&nbsp;uses them again .</p>

<p>try using the drive in a different console if you can.</p>

<p>This problem could be a number of things:</p>
<p>1 size of hard drive like 20gig and so one. You cant put data on the hard drive if the number of gigs on the is larger than the game data.</p>
<p>2. Your hard drive one the xbox 360 is damaged.where you can get a 360 hard drive at gamestop for cheap.</p>
<p>I hope this infromation helps your problem. Worst case you get a new 360 hardrive at game stop</p>

<p>I had this exact problem. I assume it's faulty sectors on the drive. Using the Xbox format command will not help.</p>
<p>When you try to download a game it will fail part way through and then need a hard reboot. When you go to system-storage-hard drive-games and apps, you will see a yellow circle with an exclamation point on it. Delete this, then do the following:</p>
<p>Keep downloading demos (preferably large ones) that you don't want to play. These will fail, but do not delete these files from storage, this is effectively marking the bad sector space as being used. Eventually the downloads will start working (unless,
 of course, your entire drive has failed).</p>
<p>Now download the game you want. You may find that there are later sectors that have also failed, so you may have to repeat this technique. This has worked for me.</p>
<p>Really the Xbox should have more than a format command, it should be able to check for and mark bad sectors.</p>

<p>Hello Scooterfuller,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; I have a very straight forward answer for you.&nbsp; all you have to do is create the folder that you want everything from the usb drives to go into, then copy by drag and drop method.&nbsp; I've included the steps below on how to do this.<br />
</p>
Moving and copying files by using the drag-and-drop method
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common way to copy and move 
files and folders is by using the drag-and-drop method, which means that you select one or more files and
drag them to another 
location. For example, you can drag a file to the Recycle Bin to delete the file, or drag a file to a folder to copy or move it to that location.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwindowshelp.microsoft.com%2fBetterWhenConnectedHelpWS%2fGetContent.aspx%3fassetID%3d9a12f3f6-ebc4-4d1f-9e18-0ce63cecb3b9%26amp%3bdocumentSet%3den-US%26amp%3brenderKey%3dSIGNED1" /></p>
<div>How to drag files</div>

<p>When you drag a file or folder, exactly what happens depends upon what you drag and where you drag it. Pop-up windows containing information appear when you drag a file over a destination—pay attention to these to find out what will happen
 when you release the mouse button. You can also refer to the following table to learn more about what happens when you drag files and folders.</p>

<td colspan="2">Hello again.<br />
<br />
Xbox and app were both up-to-date, so no issues there.<br />
<br />
I've reinstalled the app and it has made no difference.<br />
<br />
I did another programme session this morning (9th March) and again it is<br />
showing on my Nike+ account on the Nike website and in the iPhone app as a<br />
Quickstart session. I've attached a screengrab from the Nike+ website<br />
showing the session today recorded as a quickstart.<br />
<br />
As I'm sure you know a Quickstart session is meant to be a 5 minute work<br />
out, on the screengrab it clearly shows a time of 32:05.<br />
<br />
What next?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. Please check that the app version and software version on your xbox are also up to date. Besides this, I suggest reinstalling the app on the phone and see if this makes a difference. This would help us determine where the problem comes
 from.<br />
<br />
I thank you in advance for your dedication and I will be looking forward to your reply.<br />

<td colspan="2">Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I'm on OS 6.1, iPhone 4<br />
The app is the the latest version from the App Store<br />
I've not seen this issue before<br />
I've not tried setting it up again as I doubt it will make no difference as<br />
the Nike+ website is alos showing my Programme Sessions as Quick start<br />
sessions.<br />
<br />
The last two Programme Sessions I did on the Xbox on Tuesday 5th March and<br />
Thursday 7th march are showing as Quick Start sessions (I also did a quick<br />
start session on Thursday 7th March).<br />
<br />
The Nike+ Kinect iOS app also has a screen that keeps telling me to start a<br />
new programme which is obviously already started. Looks like something is<br />
not syncing correctly between the Xbox and Nike+ account.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Have you tried <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing your cache</a> as a good first step to see if that can help. Also, are you using a game off a disc or do you have the downloadable version installed on your Xbox 360? Drop us a line and let us know. We are here to help!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Games is on disc.</p>
<p>I cleared the cache as instructed, I actually did it twice as it was so quick. I then loaded Nike+ Kinect Training and let it sync, bot no change. All my 2nd Programme Sessions are still shown as Qick Start sessions</p>
<p>This morning I did a Programme Session and again on my Nike+ account on their website and on the iPhone app it has recorded as a Quick Start session. I'm sure as you know &nbsp;a Quick Start session is just a 5 minute workout while I am on week 3 of my 2nd Programme
 and my Programme Session today lasted over 35 minutes and I gained 595 NikeFuel points.</p>
<p>What else can I try?</p>
<p>I started a forum topic on this and other users are seeing this issue:</p>

            <p>Hey folks! Hmm, this is an odd problem but we're definitely gonna do our best to help you figure it out. ^_^<br /><br />Can you tell me which iOS app specifically is showing the incorrect data (phone, tablet, etc)?<br /><br />Also, is there a way you can try doing a program on a different Xbox LIVE profile? This will help us narrow down if the problem is with your profile by itself.<br /><br />Thanks for sticking with us! I know it must be a pain but we're gonna keep fighting for you! ^_^&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lot of what you ask for is in my original post and in the trail between myself and Nike support.</p>
<p>Its the NIke+ Kinect Training app. I've tried it on iOS 6.1.x on iPhone and iPad both sync with my account and show the same data as does my Nike+ account on the Nike website.</p>
<p>It seems the way the programme session type data is being updated to the website is wrong and therefore its being recorded wrong on the website and iOS app.</p>
<p>To be honest the NIke+ Kinect Training has more bugs than a nature reserve! Its seriously needs an update pack.</p>

            <p>Hey again Gryphon! Sorry about asking which iOS device you used it on. You're absolutely correct, I totally missed that part of your original post.<br /><br />Have you or ICTheSoulHunter tried seeing if a session still posts in error from a different profile on your same console? If it's possible for you to do this (even if you just make a free silver account to try it out), it will give us a clue as to whether the problem lies with your profiles or not. If you can't do that (or would just rather not) that's totally fine. Another step we can try is clearing your cache (as&nbsp;Mister Rush suggested above, feel free to use that guide again). After you clear your cache, redownload your profile (use this guide:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete</a>). That could help solve the issue for you. I truly hope it does.<br />

 and Nike fuel synchronization problem, and after the fact that the in-game training time is wrong, among other things...).</p>
<p>I agree with TheGryphonThree, this game has many bugs, even though some of them are unimportant, makes you feel the game is just not a "good quality" game:</p>
<p>1. From time to time it "freezes" for a few seconds when you are about to start an excersize.</p>
<p>2. The workout time is not synchronized at all (it have never been synchronized for me: in game time is a lot higher than real time, and web site time is closer to real time, but still a bit off)</p>
<p>3. Even after I bought the "upper body and core" package, it would still offer it to other console users (but would not allow buying again, of course, which is good).</p>
<p>4. Now the program sessions are being shown as "quick start" sessions in the web site (but are correctly registered as program sessions in the game).</p>
<p>5. Some drills have flaws in the movement detection (specially for kids, I think it is related to size).</p>
<p>6. It doesn't really seem to "adapt" to each person, for example: my little girl could barely complete 15 push-ups, but taking a lot of time, however, the game just decided to increase all drills to 20 (!).....the same as me. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, it looks
 like it does the same thing for everyone at the same time, like if the profiles were somehow "tied", however, it does have *some* different drills for each of us (but most of the drills are just the same, with same time and repetitions for everyone, regardless
 of physical condition, or "fuel print").</p>
<p>7. When I tried to challenge one of my family members (wife, or one of the kids, for example), it just didn't work, they never got the request.</p>
<p>To tell the truth: I don't find any of these issues particularly serious (for now), lets see what happens once I finish the program, if it finish correctly and advance: the issue would still be considered "minor" by me. The other issues, well, we are just
 "working them around", for example: by asking the little girl to take more breaks, and just disable movement tracking and do a simpler version for some drills (that are just beyond her strength, for now), using tricks to get the system to recognize the movements
 (such as holding a light object, like a game box, in the hand for Romanian dead lifts, or adjusting Kinect angle for others, and so on..).
</p>
<p>For now, I think we (TheGryphonThree and I) &nbsp;should try to contact other users, just to evaluate how widespread this issue is (the "quick start" instead of program thing). &nbsp;I got the feeling this started after they fixed the synchronization and disconnection
 issue.</p>

<p>Hiya <span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">ManjunathRamesh,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that the issue is still being persistent. I recommend to install your profile into a USB Drive,&nbsp;then restart the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Make sure your account is installed onto the USB Drive and not the console, then&nbsp;see if that will allow the account to register.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(Plug in USB&gt; go to Settings&gt;System&gt; Storage&gt;Hard Drive/Memory Unit&gt; Profile&gt; Transfer/move profile to USB&gt;&nbsp;Restart console and make sure profile is only on USB)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once the profile is moved, then&nbsp;attempt to connect to the live services. If there is still an issue, then remove the hard drive from the console.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Turn off console&gt; Unplug console&gt; Remove the hard drive from the console, then plug in the USB&gt; and test the services again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(If it works then the hard drive could be corrupted, and if the console does not have a hard drive then it may just need extra space/Storage to register the information so get a hard drive or USB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>let us know if that works</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Store Applications in Windows 10 are installed in the <strong>WindowsApps</strong> folder located in the
<em>C:\Program Files</em> folder. By default, almost all system files, system folders and even registry keys in Windows 10 are owned by a special built-in user account called
<strong>TrustedInstaller</strong>. You might need to take ownership of the files and folders in order to access these files and make modifications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>C:\Program</strong> files using the <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Change the File Explorer settings temporarily to <strong>show hidden files and folders</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>WindowsApps</strong> directory. Right-click on it and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Security</strong> tab and click on <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>The window <strong>Advanced Security Settings</strong> <strong>for WindowsApps</strong> is now visible.</li><li>Click on the<strong> Change</strong> link next to the <strong>Owner</strong> label.</li><li>The window <strong>Select user or group</strong> is now available.</li><li>Type your user account in the area <strong>Enter the object name to select</strong> and&nbsp; click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Set full access to the app folder for your account. Right-click on the <strong>
WindowsApps</strong> folder &gt; <strong>Properties </strong>&gt; <strong>Security </strong>
&gt; <strong>Add</strong>.</li><li>The window <strong>Permission entry for data</strong> is now visible.</li><li>Click on <strong>Select a principal</strong>, then add your account.</li><li>Set permissions to <strong>Full control</strong>.</li><li>Run <strong>PowerShell</strong> as an admin and re-register all of the packages by typing the command: Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
</li></ol>
<p>

<p><span><span>Hello mpeco,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This sounds like a problem with your video adapter drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would recommend contacting your OEM or video adapter manufacturer and obtaining the most current drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If your manufacturer has not released Windows 7 drivers yet then try the most recent Vista drivers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Let us know if this resolves your problem.</span></span></p>

    <title>Large number of errors in Windows Error Reporting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dues56k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Large number of errors in Windows Error Reporting</h2>
                    Not 100% sure if this is the best Topc area to post in, but I have been having trouble getting an online game (Magic: the Gathering Tactics) to connect to their online servers. I submitted a support ticket and one of their tech support guys, after exhausting
 options such as opening router ports, disabling antivirus software/firewall and rebooting with all startup items disabled asked me to supply him with an export of MSInfo32. They mentioned that the size of the error reporting section was of serious concern,
 especially as a great deal of them were critical windows errors. The exported .txt file is 9mb in size.<br />
<br />
I googled a handful of the error lines and from what I could gather these seem to be related to system crashes/blue screens. However they are logged almost daily with many error lines per day and I have only had a very limited number of crahses in the 1-2yr
 period I've had this PC that I can recall.<br />
<br />
How can I find out what's causing these errors and resolve them? There's way too many to paste them all in here, but I can give some examples if required.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Link to the Windows Error Reporting section of the MSInfo32 exported .txt file -

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>Looking at the Error Reporting log, I don't see anything extraordinary going on.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these are simple Application Errors which are usually logged when a program stops responding (Hangs), takes a long time to load or a long time to shut down. These are all Non-critical errors.</p>
<p>I'm not sure when you saved this file, but it only shows 4 errors since September 2011. Most of these errors are concerning MS Messenger, Internet Explorer, a variety of gaming related programs, etc.</p>
<p>That error log covers a full years worth of errors from 1/26/2011 to 1/30/2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend that you concentrate on the issue with "Magic: the Gathering Tactics" and post as many details about that problem as you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If you wish to clear up your error reporting logs so you only have the most recent, then save the following as a .bat file, say, "<span style="font-weight: bold">Clear EventViewr.bat</span>" by pasting it into Notepad (only) and selecting
Save as type:</span> window, you'll have an automated Error Log clean up tool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just double click and off it goes!! :D<br />
Hope that helps <br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to have a look.</p>
<p>I don't know why it's sorted the errors out in this way, but if you actually scroll down, below "17/12/2010 4:04 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application Error" is "20/02/2012 12:15 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Error Reporting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fault bucket". From there, there's many errors since the start
 of the year with quite a few just from that date alone. I initially thought as you did, that there were no recent errors until I was scrolling through to check the different Event Names.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Thanks again!

            <p>It is very difficult to see the wood for the trees.&nbsp;The file would&nbsp;need&nbsp;extensive editing to get it to&nbsp;make any sense. &nbsp;It does contain errors which occured today contrary to what others say. Any reports more two days old should be put to one side. I could
 not see any Event ID or Source references which make me wonder where these details were taken from.
</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the details are useless for realistically diagnosing problems. You can pick out bits like Windows Update failing but you cannot pick out key errors to fix. You would need to concentrate on system errors working through as they occur
 when the computer boots before tackling Application errors. </p>
<p>My feeling is that it would simpler to format the disk and do a clean install of Windows 7. How you exactly do this depends on what you have by way of a Windows 7 disk or whether you will need to restore to factory settings? You also need to know how you
 are going to handle motherboard drivers unless you are restoring to factory settings?</p>
<p>What is your computer make and model? If it is not a branded computer what is your motherboard make and model?</p>

            Thanks for taking a look.<br />
<br />
The details are a direct copy/paste from the MSInfo32 export file.<br />
<br />
It's not a branded computer and the motherboard is an ASRock X58 Extreme. I could go about locating my Windows and Motherboard discs and do a clean install, but I would very much prefer not to.<br />
<br />
These errors don't seem to directly impact my use of the computer from what I can tell (No regular crashes/blue screens), but the tech support guy I spoke to from Sony Online Entertainment seemed to think that it was a serious cause for concern. My support
 ticket is still open with them and I'm waiting on a reply but so far they haven't implied a direct link with the game not working to the errors I have logged, but since they mentioned it was a concern, I thought I'd make sure there wasn't something seriously
 wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
In terms of not getting the game itself to connect, I am able to start the launcher fine and log into my account from there. On the launcher screen I click to run the game and it goes into a full screen loading screen and just hangs there for a few minutes
 until it gives me an error message that it can't connect.<br />
I have tried forwarding the required ports on my router, disabling antivirus/firewall and doing a clean startup without success.<br />
This is the only game I am having issues with.<br />

            I think you may have taken that the wrong way. Obviously I care about maintaining my PC or I wouldn't have taken the time to ask people who are more knowledgeable than I about the issues
<br />
I've come across. <br />
<br />
Seeing as the errors aren't causing system crashes or conflicts with my daily use, I felt I could wait to see how both this thread and my support ticket developed in terms of possible solutions rather than just wiping everything and starting over. Am I wrong
 in this line of thinking? I don't know, that's why I'm here to ask.<br />
<br />
I see your analogy with the car engine and I am here asking for possible solutions, although is wiping and reinstalling Windows the same as keeping the oil levels up in a car? If it turns out that I have to wipe the drive and re-install than so be it, but I
 still won't understand what has gotten me to this point which I believe is important, especially if I'm to keep my system maintained and not just get right back to where I'm at now?
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time spent looking into my file up until now and if anyone else has any insights, I'd love to hear from you.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Mouse 3500 - mouse delay after no movement</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the microsoft wireless mouse 3500, and it works fine except for one annoying thing.
</p>
<p>If the mouse hasn't moved or done anything for a short time, if I try to move the mouse there will be a short pause in which mouse movement is ignored</p>
<p>ex: I will move the mouse to the left, and it will ignore the fact the mouse is moving until ~.5-1 second later</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to stop this from happening, it is very annoying to constantly have mouse movement ignored unless I am moving it nonstop.</p>

            <p>HI Michael,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in&nbsp; Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>From the issue description, I understand that you are facing a lag in the mouse performance. We will help you to resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does this issue occur with a particular program?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message on the computer?</p>
<p>3. Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install the latest driver for mouse\touchpad and you can also try to reduce sensitivity of touchpad and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>1.Issue is with any program/desktop</p>
<p>2.No error message</p>
<p>3.No changes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Status of device: Working fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem from what I can tell seems to be that whenever the mouse isnt active for a short time the light turns off and it takes a second for it to recognize movement and turn back on. (If I hold down the left/right mouse button the light will stay on
 and the problem doesn't appear)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Problem isnt with trackpad, the mouse settings given from the driver seem to only effect assigning buttons, otherwise its just the default mouse settings which have no effect on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling drivers, I am using the latest one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<p>Is there a way to have the mouse remain active permanently instead of it trying to save battery by going into what seems to be a sleep mode whenever it is inactive for a short period of time? This seems like it would solve my problem.</p>

    <title>No video when recording games with Game DVR - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldgoldeye  say:</h3>
<h2>            No video when recording games with Game DVR</h2>
                    <p>Recently when playing games through Steam and using the Game DVR background recording function I have found that when recordings are commanded by default WIN+ALT+G they have no visual content, only audio. I have traced this back to the Windows service xbgm
 not running. When the xbgm service is commanded to start then Game DVR background recordings function as before.
</p>
<p>What has changed with the last Windows 10 update to affect this service? Can MS address this anomaly with a future update?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are unable to record Games in background properly when the Xbox Game Monitoring service
 (xbgm service) is not running. I appreciate the time you have spent to work on this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>By default the startup type for Xbox Game Monitoring service (xbgm service) is set to manual, you can change
 the startup type of the service to Automatic and check if that helps. To change the startup of the service, please follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press and hold
<strong>Windows + X</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type
<strong>services.msc</strong> and click on OK.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Look for the
<strong>Xbox Game Monitoring</strong> service and double click on it.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Change the
<strong>Startup type</strong> to <strong>Automatic</strong> from the drop down.</span></p>

<p>Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Last Friday I changed my gamertag, but it's not showing yet. I've contacted xbox support twice now and the only thing they told me was to wait another 24 hours.<br />
Does anyone else have this problem? or does anyone know how to fix it?</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>With regards to changing GT, there are a few issues reported similar to yours. But seems to have been fixed already. Some say that removing the account from the console and adding it back again worked. Also, trying to change it again on the console to the
 same gamertag you chose online worked. They where not billed a second time after attempting to change it through the console.</p>

<p>What you have to do is go through the website again and claim that gamertag again if you did it on a computer. It happened to me too. It charged my $10 and didn't change my name so I had to come back to the website and claim it again. When you hit "Claim
 It!" it will change instantly so remember to search the gamertag with your desired capitalization or else you'll have an ugly gamertag like mine (which is all lowercase). Best of luck to you sir :)</p>

<p><strong>I recently purchased a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 and was able to install the latest Intellipoint 8.0 software. However, the mouse does not respond at all. I can move the mouse all over and do not get a response out of the pointer on the
 screen nor do button clicks do anything.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have run the Microsoft FixIt tool and updated a driver for the nano transceiver that I thought would help, but alas it did not.&nbsp;<br />
