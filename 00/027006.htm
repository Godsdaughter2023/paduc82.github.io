<h2>            Outlook 2016 Calendar Events Font and Line Spacing</h2>
                    I am using Office 365 and Outlook 2016 (for Windows) desktop. Why do the calendar events notes display with Times New Roman?&nbsp;The info fields (subject, location, dates) use Calibri, which is much more legible.&nbsp;How do I change the&nbsp;default font Outlook&nbsp;uses
 for the notes area?

            I'm not at an Office 2016 system right now, but in other versions of Outlook, you can set the font on File&gt;Options&gt;Mail&gt;Stationery and Fonts. The default font for a mail message also applied to the notes section of a calendar entry.

<h2>            O365 Office Update &#40;Manual&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am a long-time MS user and have grown accustomed to regularly running the system update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visit the MS Store,&nbsp;I just learned today that updates to O365 desktop applications are not performed with system updates (like previous other versions of office) and must be initiated manually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be accomplished from within one of the desktop O365 apps:</p>
<p>File&gt;Office Account&gt;Office Updates&gt;Update Now &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be helpful if there were a notice when updates are available... Not sure why this isn't (or when it may become) available.</p>
<p>

            <p>Office 365 still updates automatically but indeed via a different mechanism. The manual method is similar to the manual method of Windows Update; To check for new updates before or more frequently than the automatic update does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is an update available that hasn't been applied automatically yet, then this is also shown on the Office Account page.</p>

<h2>            SMS tones on I-mate PDAL are too short&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>hi..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have i-mate PDAL, i copied some WAV files to the /Windows/ folder so i can choose them from /Sounds &amp; Notificatios Settings/ to use them (or one of them) as a /New text message/ ring tone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it really works, but when i get a new text message the WAV plays for 3 or 4 seconds only!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>why it doesn't play the full WAV song? is there any way to play it full?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i even tried to assign SMS tone for some contacts using the software /Photo contacts 5 pro/ but it plays the WAV or MP3 for 3 or 4 seconds too!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any advice?</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

            I've never played around with the tones but I would imagine you could add a different file that has a longer duration.&nbsp; I'm just assuming that would give you the longer tone you want.

<p>actually, i added files with durations up to 5 menutes (full songs) and shorter too..</p>
<p>the files i added to /windows/ folder are WAV files.. i even assigned MP3's using /Photo Contact 5 PRO/ but its all the same, all files WAV and MP3 play for 3 or 4 seconds!</p>

<p>Then in fact it might well be that the SMS tones will only lsat that long.&nbsp; If that is the case, it might require a registry editor to do the trick.</p>

<p>i don't think editing registry would help.</p>
<p>any way i did edit the registry and found the key:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mobile Device\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\ControlPanel\Notifications\{A877D65B-239C-47a7-9304-0D347F580408}]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is nothing about duration time..</p>
<p>what i found in the key is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Default---- REG_SZ----- Messaging: New text message</p>
<p>* Duration----- REG_DWORD------ 0x00000000 (0)</p>
<p>* Options----- REQ_DWORD------ 0x00000001 (1)</p>
<p>* Wave----- REG_SZ------ Italy music</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thats all.. if i change the Duration value from (0) to (1) then it will desable the tone.</p>

<h2>            TrackPad issues - Windows 10 preview</h2>
                    <p>Since install of windows 10 on top of windows 8.1 i have seen issues trackpad. the settings in sympatico driver are still the same but the trackpad is acting differently. the speed is different, the scrolling isnt working.</p>
<p>i have tried reinstalling the driver but no difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the driver isnt supporting this OS yet but just wondering who else is facing hardware issues in this release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>My Logitech Trackpad does not have everything working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest problem is the click features for the Logitech Trackpad. A double click is performed with only one tap on the Touchpad.&nbsp; I have tried changing the settings in the Logitech control panel and also on the Windows Control Panel Mouse Trackpad control
 panel.&nbsp; Nothing has worked so far.</p>

            <p>I've been looking in a folder in the root of my other operating system (windows 8.1) on my HP laptop called "SWsetup" which contains all programs and drivers that come preinstalled with my laptop. If you still have your old operating system on a different
 partition or something, it might be worth the look</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where I found my mouse driver installer. Everything mostly works now except for scrolling in apps besides built in ones (excluding windows store)</p>

            When I reinstalled my Synaptics driver, it looked more like it was running as windows 7. Everything seemed to be working, except that the two-finger scrolling now only works in File Explorer. Is there any fix for this? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>The computer I am running Tech Preview on is older.&nbsp; The touchpad has margin scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Dell driver and control panel for the touchpad.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Mostly I use the Logitech Touchpad if it will work with Tech Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell did not give drivers for Windows 8/8.1 on this computer model, so I had been using Dell Windows 7 drivers on almost everything.&nbsp; I think I may have loaded some other (I think it was Lenovo) driver for the Bluetooth radio.</p>

<h2>            Windows Insider Preview Build 15063.11 Start menu indexing error</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running Windows 10 Education build 15063.11 (Insider preview with a clean install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed a few programs and apps which show on my start menu. However, when I try to search for them after pressing the win-key, it is unable to find the apps that I have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, some windows settings such as task manager, and task scheduler cannot be launched from windows search despite them showing up when I search for them. I have tried launching them by pressing enter, and mouse clicking but they show no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made sure that my Indexing option indexes the AppData and the Start Menu folder and have attempted to rebuild the index. This did not fix my issue.</p>
<p>I have cortana and seach online results option disabled as I do not need them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know any solutions to this issue?</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds similar to a problem a user is having with launching apps from the Search results.&nbsp; A difference would be that you are applying a Settings filter.&nbsp; In fact, I'm surprised that doing that would allow me to launch Task Manager because it's not
 really a "setting".&nbsp; When it launched it opened only in the last view I had it open, so no clue even about what "settings" I could be thinking about.&nbsp; In the case of Task Scheduler I can do a right-click on the result.&nbsp; If I let Task Manager show as an app
 I can then get a right-click result with it too (so for example could opt to launch it elevated).&nbsp; I suspect having it listed under "Control Panel" may be an error. &nbsp; OIC.&nbsp; In fact, when I do the same search in Control Panel then I do see two shortcuts which
 would launch (or switch to) Task Manager.&nbsp; Strange.&nbsp; The confusion then is mostly that Control Panel is not also launched to help you understand how Task Manager is being launched when associated with Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, can you open Control Panel (e.g. Run... control.exe with Win-R), do the search there to show its shortcuts and launch TM that way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I know nothing about the Educational version but can imagine that you may have some policies in place that would inhibit certain functions. &nbsp; Tracing with ProcMon may help uncover things like that.</p>

            Oops, sorry for the confusion. I did not apply any filter. I mean that some settings or windows apps won't launch or respond to any mouse clicks despite showing up in the search results.<br />

<h2>            Moving from Outlook 2010 to 365 Outlook 2016</h2>
                    
<p>I have spent over two hours on the phone with MS Tech support with no success today, so I hope I can get help here.
</p>
<p>I have been using Outlook 2010. It regularly grinds to a halt telling me the .pst file has reached its max size (2Gb) I then have to delete loads of emails I really need to keep just to keep it running.</p>
<p>I was told I should change to Office365 business and all my troubles would be over.</p>
<p>I installed outlook &nbsp;2016. Opened it up, and it was automatically accessing my old .pst file. Within 30 minutes I was enduring the same seizures as on 2010.</p>
<p>Two hours on a help line drew a blank.</p>
<p>The agent was unable to tell me how to use a different data file format now I have 365, or how to move over my old messages and calendar in a way that would not bring the 2Gb limit with it. I was gutted . He told me buying office365 business was no good,
 I needed business premium. With a 50Gb mail box. But still had no idea how to save all my existing appointments and messages to work in 365.</p>
<p>It seems ludicrous. As far as I can see 365 is no different to Outlook 2010 other than having a blue theme instead of yellow. If anyone has any wisdom it would help a poor frustrated and disheartened soul. &nbsp;

 “There was an issue with looking up your account. Tap next to try again.”. I receive the same message whether using a Wi Fi or Mobile Data connection. The skype software is the latest version 8.4.0.53426. The Android version is 7.0. I have checked the internet
 to find a solution and tried all the suggestions but none help. These suggestions included:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">-Reinstalling Skype app</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">-Clear apps cache and data</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">-Sign in with my Microsoft account but receive message "Unable to sign in. Please check your internet connection and try again."</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have tried to create a new skype account with the phone but I can’t and receive a message to say check the internet connection, which is working perfectly
 with all other apps.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have a second older smartphone (Samsung) that connects perfectly to the same skype account using the same Wi Fi connection. My tablet also connects perfectly to the same skype account
 using the same Wi Fi connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Can anyone offer a solution?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Later I connected to a public Wi Fi and successfully logged in to Skype with the LG G5. Came back home and I could still make Skype connect
 through my home Wi Fi. I then uninstalled Skype and installed it again. And it would not connect just like before. Not sure what this means. Please advise. Skype never used to have this many problems!</span></p>

<p>All of the above I had tried before with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AnywayI have resolved the problem by returning to the public Wi Fi site and reconnecting to skype. I returned home and skype has worked perfectly ever since using the original home Wi Fi network I had a problem with. Why I had to initialize skype on a public
 network before it would work at home I have no idea but it works now and I shall leave it at that.</p>

<h2>            From&#47;To names have disappeared from search results</h2>
                    In the last week our Outlook 2016 Standard users have noticed a change in how their current mailbox search results are displayed.&nbsp; Prior to this week the results showed the From/To name in the results set (along with the subject and 2 preview lines of
 the body).&nbsp; Resetting the view, rebuilding the search index and blowing away the profile all have not solved the issue.&nbsp; All clients are fully up to date.&nbsp; Clients are on Windows 7 and 10.

            Hi Sean,
<br />This fixed the missing From field in Search for another user:
<br />If you have Outlook.com or Exchange and can edit your registry, see if setting this key fixes the display. 
<br />Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Search 
<br />REG_DWORD: DisableServerAssistedSearch 
<br />Value: 1

            That works to restore the functionality but doesn't seam to fix the entire issue (the view changes for instance).&nbsp; Is there a fix coming?&nbsp; I assume an update caused this?

            Yes, it appears to be caused by the Dec update. 
<br />
<br />There will be a fix, but I don't know when - they tend to be a bit slow at the end of Dec as a lot of the engineers take vacation. Best case scenario - by the Feb update. Worst case: spring. 
<br />
<br />I'll see what i can find out, but most of my contacts are in the group that took vacation. :(

            <p>If you have a "picture" with areas that need filling, you'll need to draw a freeform shape around the edge of the area you want to fill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you haven't told us which version of PowerPoint you are using, and that's going to make quite a bit of difference!&nbsp; Can you describe what you see along the top of your PowerPoint screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. To determine the version, you could look under Control Panel &gt; "Add remove programs", or "Programs and Features".</p>

            <div>No can do. &nbsp;Not in PowerPoint, at any rate.</div>
<div><br />
PowerPoint is pretty good at editing "vector" graphics (pictures constructed of mathematical descriptions of lines, curves and so on). &nbsp;It's not much at editing "raster" graphics (pictures constructed of lots of dots of different colors that, like a pointillist
 painting, coalesce into a picture if you stand far enough back).
<div><br />
<div>You'll need to do the fills in an image editing program or, possibly a better idea, use a tracing program like the one included with CorelDraw to convert your raster image to vector graphics that can then be filled however you like.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another thought: where do the technical drawings come from? &nbsp;Probably not an image editing program in the first place. &nbsp;If you have access to the originator of the drawings, see if they can export them in WMF or EMF formats. &nbsp;You could bring these into

<p><br />
There is a big difference between three separate lines (which are not fillable) and a freeform shape (which is fillable)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said, draw your triangle with a Freeform shape (usually on the right-edge, middle row of the Insert Shapes gallery in the ribbon).&nbsp; Close the shape by double-clicking on the starting node.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you'll be able to fill it (before you do your exporting experiement).&nbsp; Whether it will be fillable AFTER your exporting/importing experiement, I don't know.&nbsp; Please try it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may help to have the Selection Pane showing when you ungroup the re-imported picture, as there may be more than one freeform shapes that result when you ungroup the imported picture.&nbsp; Home tab &gt; Select (right-hand end of Home tab)&gt; Selection Pane</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, it may be that ppt2010 or 2013 may have improved functionality in this area due to the Combine Shapes utility.&nbsp; Steve may be able to comment more about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for pattern fills, they got hidden in the User Interface in 2007, but you can still apply them&nbsp;with VBA code, or an add-in (<a href="http://www.pptalchemy.co.uk/patterns.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pptalchemy.co.uk/patterns.html</a>&nbsp;or
<a href="http://www.andypope.info/charts/pptpatternfills.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.andypope.info/charts/pptpatternfills.htm</a>).&nbsp; Not sure if they made a come-back in 2010 or 2013....</p>

            <p>Rich, the problem with re-drawing is doubling the work. The triangle was a mere simplified experimental vehicle, where the re-drawing effort using the freeform tool was negligible. However, I am looking for a more efficient way for adding pattern fills in
 actual section drawings, where re-drawing every cross-section would incur significant effort. For example, part of a cross-section may be an elliptic curve, which already appears in such a simple case as when a cylinder is partially cut with an oblique cut.
 You would agree, that getting that elliptic section&nbsp;accurate with the freeform tool requires significant amount of work. Partitioning the cross-section in order to&nbsp;easily draw&nbsp;the elliptic section with the oval tool would incur matching pattern fills at the
 boundaries of the partitions, again incurring a significant amount of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The export/import technique suggested by Steve would avoid re-drawing if it only worked. (Export/import itself is not what I need) Can the export/import technique be modified/refined to make it work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the&nbsp;'combine shapes' utility sounds interesting for the 'pattern fill' purpose at hand, Steve or anyone else&nbsp;can comment?</p>

<div><br />
<div>Not if you're exporting from PowerPoint and reimporting. &nbsp;That'll bring back the same bunch of dots, not editable shapes, that you began with. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If redrawing, then yes, combine shapes might be quite useful for some of these things. It allows you to do things like starting with one shape and using another shape to nibble parts of the first shape away ... using a circle, for example, to cut a partial
 circular shape out of a rectangle.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But again, where's the original image coming from? &nbsp;If you can get it in editable vector format to start with, it'd save you a LOT of trouble and time.</div>

<p><br />
I understand you don't want to do it this way.&nbsp; But purely FYI, if you want to draw a curvy freeform, start off using the
<strong>Curve </strong>shape.&nbsp; You can of course convert any of the lines in a freeform/curve shape between straight and curved by right-clicking and Edit Points.&nbsp; Then right-click between two nodes and choose Straight Segment or Curved Segment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use the <strong>Arc</strong> tool.&nbsp; Almost all (if not all) shapes are fillable, except for a Line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I fully acknowlege that&nbsp;"<em>Partitioning the cross-section in order to&nbsp;easily draw&nbsp;the elliptic section with the oval tool would incur
<strong>matching pattern fills at the boundaries of the partitions</strong>, again incurring a significant amount of work.</em>"</p>

<br />When in your application press CTRL 6 it will show the folders in a different view. Can you see your new calendar in that list under Calendar or is it under another folder?

            If you right click on it you can Move the Calendar folder you created to Calendar and it should then show on the Navigation pain under Calendars or create a new one from the CTRL 6 View. Right click on the Calendar then click New Calendar from there within the Calendar folder.

            Hi Greg,
<br />Try to reset the navigation Panes. Close out of outlook and then press the Windows key and “R” to open the “Run” dialog box.copy the command    
<br />outlook.exe /resetnavpane   and paste it in the run text box. Say OK outlook will restart. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work do a repair on your office.

            <p>The text of a document has been saved into your Normal.dotm template, which serves as the basis for every "new blank document". To fix it, you can either open the Normal.dotm template itself and delete the text, or (if you don't have a lot of customizations
 saved in the template) rename or delete the existing Normal.dotm and let Word create a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instructions for doing these procedures are in&nbsp;<a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/AppErrors/BlankDocNotBlank.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/AppErrors/BlankDocNotBlank.htm</a>. However, as the article is rather old, you can
 ignore its instructions for finding and opening the template, and use this instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Alt+F11 to open the macro editor.</li><li>Press Ctrl+G to open the Immediate window in the editor.</li><li>Type or copy/paste the expression <strong>NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument</strong> into the Immediate window and press Enter at the end of the line.</li><li>Close the macro editor. The Normal.dotm template will be visible in the main Word window.</li></ul>

<h2>            Convert a Birth Date to MM&#47;DD of a Specific Year &#40;to be used in a subsequent formula&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to determine if someone has 40 days of seniority at their birth date of a specific year.....I can't figure out how to do it.&nbsp; Can you help?</p>
<p>For example:&nbsp; My birth date is 05/03/1969; I'm employed on 04/01/2008.&nbsp; I would need to determine if I had 40 days of seniority on 05/03/2008; then again the next year on 05/03/2009.</p>
<p>My first failed attempt was to convert my birthday to the year I'm studying; to come up with everyone's birth day in 2008...I never got further than that (I was planning on comparing my seniority date to that result).</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can give.</p>

<h2>            Outlook &#40;O365&#41; for mac suddenly becoming incompatible</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently a lot of the macs I manage at a school outlook has suddenly started becoming incompatible.<br />
No other office application does this just outlook, one day it is working and the next the symbol changes and when anyone tries to launch outlook it says outlook is incompatible for your mac.<br />
Its happening on a range of mac os x levels roughly 10.12.5-10.13.6.<br />
I have tried redownloading and installing the office suite again, but randomly it will happen again.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrading from 10049 to 10061 stuck on &#34;Upgrading your System 100&#37;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I upgraded from Windows 10 Build 10049 to 10061. The download process went *fairly* smoothly and it rebooted normally. On startup it goes to the "Upgrading your System" screen under the Windows Logo. So far so good. The problem is that when it hits 100%
 it sort of just hangs there. It doesn't freeze (the dots are still spinning) but nothing seems to happen. It doesn't seem to be a time issue, I left it for two days at 100% and it was still stuck there. Getting frustrated I turned it off, and went to the troubleshooting
 menu to rollback to 10049. It says that it is unable to do so, and suggests I should simply refresh my system. I do that, and I've had the same issue again: it's been "refreshing" for the past 24 hours asking me to "Please wait...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? Do I need to re-install from an ISO?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marc</p>

            <p>I've seen a post suggesting unplugging the network to let it finish and then plugging it back it. &nbsp;I haven't had that problem, so I can't comment more on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go back and download build 9926 and update forward by setting the update speed back to Fast. &nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso.</p>

            I would do this but I can't boot into Windows at all. That stage of the update process is done. It's as if it hangs on the "first boot" of 10061 without actually getting to windows.

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - not receiving e-mails.</h2>
                    <p>I have set up Outlook to receive e-mails from my Sky.com account. Initially it downloaded thousands of e-mails stretching back to 2009. However it does not seem to be uploading new messages. I tested the settings and all was well - I received a copy of the
 test e-mail I also received another e-mail today much to my surprise - there are many more in my sky inbox that have not come through to outlook. Has any body got any ideas. This is becoming rather frustrating and I am seriously considering not continuing
 with Office 365 once my months free trial is over. I am unwilling to pay for something that does not appear to work.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set my account up as POP. IMAP is enabled on my sky account. Have tried disabling IMAP but makes no difference.</p>
<p>My e-mails are received on my Samsung Galaxy SII mobile phone and come through with no issue.</p>
<p>I do not receive any error message</p>
<p>I have Windows Defender and Windows Firewall set up. As far as I can see the Firewall lets Outlook through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have sent a test message to myself which has been received by my Sky account and on my mobile phone but not on Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colin<br />

<p>I suddenly found out that certain emails that were mailed to me are not being received in my Windows Live Mail?&nbsp; (mainly from my electric co., insurance co., Amazon, even a friend that is in my address book)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had a problem receiving emails before?? and i have had Outlook and Windows Live for yrs.&nbsp; They arent going in my&nbsp;Junk email&nbsp;folder either?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent myself an email and it comes to my Inbox.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have sent email to others in my Address Book asking them to reply so i know if i get emails and they too come to my Inbox.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in the last few months how i know i am not receiving some is that&nbsp;the electric co insists they are sending me the bills in email but i never have received them?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This past week the insurance co. sent me 2 emails answering my questions and i never got them but when i went into their&nbsp;Office, they showed me proof they sent them and they did not come back to them either?&nbsp; So what gives w/ that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found other companies too that i used to get email from arent coming to my Inbox??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix or check i can do to see if all my settings for email are correct??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel after the last large Windows Update&nbsp;some things may have changed?&nbsp; Just saying......</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for ANY REPLIES ON THIS ISSUE.&nbsp; It is impt that i receive all my emails.&nbsp;

</p><p>I finally looked at Safety Settings on the Options on My Windows Live Mail 2011 and found a setting may have been changed during a Security Update? (as sometimes things seem to do w/ their updates) as it was set for Windows Live to decide what was Junk and
 deleted it automatically AND NO WAY DO I WANT THAT SETTING, as it was seeing my utility bills and receipts as junk and deleted them w/o my knowing. So since i found the setting and changed it, i receive all my bill reminders and receipts for paying&nbsp;again in
 emails.</p>

    <title>WHY CANT I GET MY EMAIL ACCOUNT BACK&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davor bozicic  say:</h3>
<h2>            WHY CANT I GET MY EMAIL ACCOUNT BACK&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will just copy what I sent to microsoft support service regarding my hotmail account that was hacked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Someone hacked my hotmail account and changed my alternate email address to his. I still can log into that account but cannot go any further (inbox etc.) because he made it that I need to get a code unless account closes on 11.9.2014.
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I know which previous alternate email address and security question i used before he changed to his.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I created that emaill account specifically for twitter usage so I barely logged into it ( only when I created it around 3 months ago) &amp; didnt send out any messages to anyone and if I received email it was probably only notifications from twitter.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Email is under my real name, birth date ( I will provide passport picture if necessary)...</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The reason why this person wanted and hacked my email address is because he hacked my twitter account with large following base so he can sell it to someone and because I have no access to my email address the twitter support cannot verify me as
 a true holder of that twitter account &amp; wont give it back to me.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please guys you are the last hope for me to get my account back.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Davor</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After I sent the email I have been in contact with microsoft support account on twitter. Today they told me that escalation team cannot give me account back unless I know my alternate email address. Like are they serious? I would not even contacted them
 in the first place if hacker didnt change my alternate email address to his own and they come out with such an unprofessional response. Why on earth would I want to close my account if I was still using it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me with this case because this is very frustating that account that I created which has all my real info on it and everythin has been hacked and now I am not getting the support I should as a user of your service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Davor&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I stop the notification of a free upgrade available to a new version of Onenote &#40;current version 2010&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I stop the notifications when I start OneNote 2010 that there is a free upgrade available to a new version of OneNote (2013)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current OneNote version is 2010. I do not want to save my files to OneDrive. I want to save them to my hard drive and I know that this new "free" upgrade to OneNote 2013 will not allow me to do that. The notification is very annoying. I do not want to
 upgrade for free or for any price as long as I am prohibited from saving my files to my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. How do I make the notification permanently stop in my Onenote 2010?</p>

            <p>Unorthodox but working solution :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open RegEdit, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\OneNote\General where you will change the hex value (whatever it is) of VersionUpgradeDisplayed to FFFFFFFF (the highest hex value possible).<br />
<br />
It's hamfisted, but it works — I haven't had that obnoxious request for upgrading from OneNote 2010 since!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Usual disclaimers: regedit blah blah blah dangerous so make backup [but you really don't need to since you're just changing one freaking value that is NONE OF MICROSOFT'S BUSINESS anyway since WE PAID for freaking 2010 and don't care for the "free upgrade"
 which is NOT an upgrade] or you could simply make a note of the original version in hex — I didn't bother. I like OneNote 2010 AS IS. Also, beware taking new so-called "security updates" from Microsoft because they might not be what they're described to be.)</p>

    <title>&#34;This is not a valid file name&#34; error in Microsoft Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dawnettedryer  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;This is not a valid file name&#34; error in Microsoft Word</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 365 and have the most updated version (as of today).&nbsp; &nbsp; I have OneDrive folders installed on my SurfacePro (running Windows 10) and certain folders are set to sync with the cloud (most of what I create and save go into one of these folders).&nbsp;
 I am also living in China and have to use a VPN for certain functions (i.e. Accessing OneDrive online requires a VPN, but I don't need one to open the synced files on my computer).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Word the most, so my references will speak directly to that program.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Current Issue: recently I'm finding that when I try to save to any of my OneDrive folders (whether the VPN in on or off) I get an error stating the "This is not a valid file name. Try one or more of the following: *Check the path to make sure it was typed
 correctly. * Select a file from the list of files and folders. (https://d.docs.live.net/a5461f1e00ed233a)."&nbsp; If I save the file directly into My Documents then physically drag it to the proper folder, it's fine; but I can't save directly.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not using special characters and I don't type the path, I choose from the currently installed folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Related (and possibly connected) Problem: I have found that if my VPN is connected, Word says I am "offline" and that I may not be able to access folders until I go online again.&nbsp; Once I disconnect the VPN, the message goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me get back on track again?</p>

<p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; We store project files on a SharePoint site.&nbsp; I can open the file with the name of 'Company&nbsp; Customer Status Report and Time Approval Request PC12345 2019 01 20'.&nbsp; Make modifications and try to save to file name of 'Company&nbsp; Customer
 Status Report and Time Approval Request PC12345 2019 01 27'.&nbsp; and get this same error.&nbsp; I can save it to local disk then copy to SharePoint Site no problem.&nbsp; Can even then open it make modifications and save it to SharePoint.&nbsp; Or I can change the SharePoint
 path from 'main site/customer name/documents/status reports/weekly status reports' to 'main site/customer name/documents' to and it saves just fine.&nbsp; Only thing different is that it is back two levels in the directory structure.</p>

<p>I encounter this problem when I have opened a file located on OneDrive and then left the file open (in Word 365) for a long period of time, often overnight.&nbsp; I have found that my work around to save the file as a different name works.&nbsp; I then save the file
 again from the save menu under the name I wanted in the first place and it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the issue is due either to a temporary path being created that no longer exists by the time I get back to the document or a locked file situation exists that is then cleared when I have saved the file.&nbsp; Regardless, using a temporary save name
 and resaving the file again has worked for me.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 720 has no signal whatsoever, at all times. But surprinsingly calling &#40;and only calling&#41; works.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I've had my Lumia 720 for about two years, now, and never had a problem before.</p>
<p>Two days ago it started doing some strange things, as in it doesn't appear to get reception, doesn't matter where I am.</p>
<p>The upper-bar would show the no-signal icon at all times, and would only change to 3 or 4 bars for a few seconds, whenever I try to choose the network provider manually. That's it, a few seconds, than back to blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very strange thing is, if I try to call someone, i would actually get a signal and make the call, but only when I'm the one calling.</p>
<p>Right now I can't receive calls, sms, or surf the web with anything else than a Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>It's like it is in constant Fly mode (and it isn't)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think nothing's wrong with my phone, since it's able to call and whatnot, but I don't really know how to approach the problem.</p>
<p>I tried soft-reset and yesterday I even used the Lumia Recovery Tool, resetting the phone and installing Lumia Denim all over again.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it had no effect at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what could have happened or how could I solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>I suggest try replace the SIM card - you have already tried everything else.</p>
<p>Your mobile operator should provide a replacement SIM for free when the trouble is explained to them, or try borrow a SIM from a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An official evaluation and repair is not economical for a two-year old phone, so I hope another SIM helps?</p>

            <p>Hi Hans,</p>
<p>thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I already tried with two different SIM cards and they all produces the same problem.</p>
<p>But on the good side I discovered the REAL problem!</p>
<p>It seems like the 3G, or whatever make the 3G connection works, stopped working. I mean, it's physically damaged, somehow.</p>
<p>That's why I could make a call: whenever calling, the phone would try to get a high-speed signal and fail, then try again with 2G (or GSM, I don't really know the difference) and actually make the call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem lied in the "use up to 3G speed" in the Network configuration.</p>
<p>I changed it to 2G and now everything is working fine. Both calls and SMS are working, sending AND receiving, so I'm happy.</p>
<p>Of course, the internet connection only achieves EDGE speed, but that's okay, lots of Wi-Fis around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least until it get worse I still have a functional phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>
