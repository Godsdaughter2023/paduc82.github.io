    <title>Creating a self-signed certificate for use with BitLocker in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating a self-signed certificate for use with BitLocker in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a self-signed for certificate for use with Bitlocker, as per&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd875530%28v=ws.10%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396#BKMK_shareefscert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this guide</a>.
 When I load the certificate onto my smart card and try to add it as an unlock method for a drive, I get the error "A certificate suitable for BitLocker can't be found on your smart card." I think this is because I wasn't able to follow the instruction in the
 guide that enables the use of self-signed certificates, because&nbsp;<strong>HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\FVE&nbsp;</strong>doesn't exist in Windows 10. Is there an equivalent entry?<br />

<h2>            Boycott Xbox until they fix drifting controller issue</h2>
                    
<p>Who is tired of dealing with drifting Xbox controllers? I suggest everyone that has had to deal with drifting controllers boycott Xbox until they fix this issue.&nbsp; It has to be something with the hardware itself.&nbsp; I don't even have to touch the controller
 for the issue to start.&nbsp; What good is the console if the main peripheral doesn't work.&nbsp; Come on this is absolutely ridiculous that a 60 dollar controller starts doing this after under 3 months.&nbsp; I thought Microsoft was respectable business that has gamers
 in mind but from the looks of this many people have the same issue stemming back over 5 yrs ago.&nbsp; I read posts that this will be addressed but it hasn't.&nbsp; I had been looking forward to the next gen Xbox coming out but I'm seriously reconsidering it due to
 this issue.&nbsp; I have purchased four xbox's one for me and my family throughout this generation of the console beginning on release day.&nbsp; I had purchased multiple Xbox 360's during its time.&nbsp; So please Microsoft explain to me why I should purchase any new Xbox's
 if you can't fix a simple issue like drifting controllers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, drifting joysticks has been a part of console gaming for a long time. It's just wear and tear. I've had some Xbox controllers do this, but they lasted years beforehand.</p>

</p><p>You should check to see if your controller is still under the 90 day warranty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe one element you're neglecting to realize is that this also happens with PlayStation controllers too. As previously said, drifting joy sticks are a sign of wear and tear. When you're joysticks drift you should be proud, that means you've been doing
 some hardcore gaming. A controller wouldn't just do that fresh out of the box unless it wasn't synced correctly when first used. A likely cause of your issue is you either bought it damaged (that can happen with shipping if you have the warranty you can return
 it), you damaged it yourself, or its just old and that's like said... a sign of use. Signs of use should be a good thing, I personally wouldn't want my Xbox to look like it doesn't get used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not always the manufacturer or the creator of the product's fault. Going straight after them because of a thing that's been around since joysticks were invented is just not cool.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes drifting has been an issue for Xbox controllers for a long time, but not every console has had this issue.&nbsp; I have been a console player since Atari 2600, never had issue with that controller and I can't tell you how many hours I played asteroids flipping
 the game, if you know what that was, never<span> had&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">issue with original Nintendo console controllers, good thing because at that time my parents wouldn't have bought
 me a replacement,&nbsp;<span>or the SNES controllers.&nbsp;<span> Oh yeah I also had original Playstation never had issue with those either.&nbsp; Even the godawful controller of the N64 but it never drifted. I have owned every single major console and
 many not so popular consoles I still own an original intellivison and that doesn't even drift I've had that since the 80's.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> I have never had these kind of issue until
 Xbox.&nbsp; What I want to know is that you guys are actually taking this serious and looking into what the issue is.&nbsp; So what you are telling me is that after 3 months of use the controller is so badly used due to wear and tear that its no longer functional and
 I should just buy a new one or hope that it may still be under warranty instead of expecting a controller to last, sound shoddy to me.</span></span></span></span>

<p>Exactly that is what I am talking about.&nbsp; It shouldn't be this bad.&nbsp; I have gone through 12 controllers since the release of the Xbox one and it's getting annoying and expensive.&nbsp; But they always start doing this just after the warranty expires, go figure
 right.&nbsp; It just seems like the issue is known but that Microsoft just doesn't want to really address it.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm stunned at how many people seem to have this complaint. I am yet to see any of my controllers fail me. And i have kids!!! They've dropped them, thrown them (accidently, in excitement of games, and sometimes purely out of anger with tantrums etc...lol),
 sat on them, kicked them, the works, and not one problem with my controllers!!! I feel for you mate, i really do, you pay the money, you expect quality. But sadly, boycotting probably wouldn't serve any justice or purpose. But as ThisGameIsSucky says, it all
 just comes down to wear and tear, and serious hardcore gaming. It's bound to happen.

            I cant say I've had this happen with any of my controllers new or worn. I dont think boycotting will get anything achieved for you unfortunately, sorry you are having this trouble.&nbsp;

<p>I tend to agree with the drift issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many different consoles like yourself, and indeed started on the 2600....agh the days of 8 bit gaming.&nbsp; *Pause for moment to reminisce....*&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some detailed DIY videos on YouTube that you can find to try and correct the drift *note this involves cracking open your controller, voiding the warranty, and doing some minor mad scientist *insert evil laugh here* stuff to the actual joysticks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this on almost all of my controllers at some point, and unfortunately it isn't a permanent fix.&nbsp; The problem isn't with over use.&nbsp; As stated before you and I both have older systems that do not have any drift issues what so ever.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is quality in these little things with in the controller.&nbsp; &nbsp;In my humble opinion these parts of the controller use the cheapest materials (why that is, I leave to the masses to decide) to make.&nbsp; Many other more tech savvy xbox players made note
 of this in videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would think that the Ellite 149 dollar controller would have fixed but apparently there is enough evidence that supports it is just as bad with the regular controllers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some have even reported drift in less than 40 hours of normal game play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until MS actually address this, you have a few options:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;send it back to be repaired </li><li>&nbsp;try to fix it yourself only to have to buy a new one shortly.</li><li>&nbsp;Buy a refurbished one</li><li>&nbsp;skip the boycott start a petition for next gen controllers</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>My personal recommendation is go third party.&nbsp; I buy wired 25 dollar controllers now due to USB (charging issues) and drift issues.&nbsp; They don't feel like 60-140 quality...but I am still playing games while others are getting salty as their avatar camera
 looks to the sky.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you are frustrated just like may others in the community regarding this issue.&nbsp; Still asking for boycott is a bit extreme (though it did make me giggle cause I feel your pain) and with as many as a couple million users it would be rather ineffective.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;What may work is starting a mass mailing to the powers that be asking for resolution.&nbsp; You could even make a "default" letter or perhaps a Virtual petition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way its a lot better then causing rise in the Ambessy part of the forums there are way to many fanboys that will get more salty then losing to a squeeker in Fortnite</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get an Unexpected_Kernel_Mode_Trap during updating my laptop. For some reason the system could not automatically update to a newer Version and I did not realize that until recently. So I downloaded the Win10 Update assistant&nbsp; and let it run, but after
 restart it broke down at 55% with a BSoD and reverted all progress to the original state. In another Forum the only solution provided was a clean slate and to reinstall the whole system. I would be very happy if I could get around that.</p>

            I do have minidump files but they are from July and earlier so I guess they have nothing to do with this latest development. Also Memory.dmp has been modified in July only. So for some reason I did not get dmp files out of this process.

            I already checked this as these steps were also included in your earlier post. The settings were all as described there, so for Win10 it was on automatic instead of small dump files, which according to your first post is as it should be. I fear this is
 not the solution. :(

            No absolutely that is not the solution- I agree.
<br />Just to confirm, do you use Ccleaner?
<br />Let us try something else.
<br />Save the event logs and System Information file and share it through Onedrive:

            Can you provide the setupmem.dmp that does exist via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />The setupmem.dmp should provide info on the BSOD that causes the rollback.

            The dump file does not blame any driver but it might indicate a hardware fault.
<br />Arg1: 0000000000000008, EXCEPTION_DOUBLE_FAULT
<br />Microsoft documentation says if Arg1 is equal to 8 it might be due to a hardware fault.
<br />First thing:
<br />Uninstall either of Avira or Avast(2 or perhaps 3 AVs should not be used on a computer)
<br />Let us first find if there is any hidden offending driver:
<br />Enable Driver verifier:

<br />Either note down the driver name when the PC crashes or Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation

<h3> markbratanov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyper V causes screen to flicker on new Dell XPS 13 &#40;9350&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new Dell XPS 13 (9350). Works flawlessly, except for when I enable Hyper-V.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen flickers at random intervals when Hyper-V is enabled. I googled this and saw that this was a problem for Surface Book Pros running Windows 10 Pro. I wonder if it has something to do with the graphics chipset used in these devices. However, the
 problem can be eliminated when Hyper-V is uninstalled from Program and Features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I am unable to use Hyper-V to work on (Though one of the reasons why I purchased this PC was to run virtualized instances on the laptop). Does any one have insight on whether there is something in the pipeline to fix this issue.</p>

    <title>Will a Dell Inspiron 531 computer be compatible with Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will a Dell Inspiron 531 computer be compatible with Windows 7&#63; Conflicting info between sources. </h2>
                    
<div><span>I have been investigating this conflicting information and here is what I have found... I'm still not sure about this.</span></div>

<div><span>I found some information that indicates that this Dell Inspiron 531 computer<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>will</strong></span> be compatible with Windows 7 on the Microsoft website and
 in the system information of the control panel of this computer.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>But then I have found some other information on the Dell website that indicates the opposite.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>Please follow me carefully here, this took a while to compile this info.</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>First lets eliminate what would be the easiest solution that I have already tried, which would be the "Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor" located at this URL:</strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>On this webpage there&nbsp;is a little program to download and install that is supposed to tell me if this computer is compatible with Windows 7 in processor speed, RAM, graphics card, etc., and attached peripherals,
 automatically... <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unfortunately, it does not work</span>... I installed it and it stopped with the message,<span><strong> "Windows 7 advisor has stopped working"</strong></span> so that program and
 this&nbsp;option&nbsp;are useless.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>So&nbsp;see the webpage at this URL:http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/system-requirements&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>This&nbsp;is the "Windows 7 system requirements" list of information... it shows that I need at least a 1 GHZ or faster processor, 32 bit... this Inspiron 531 has a 2 GHZ processor and is 32 bit. This page
 says I need 1&nbsp;GB of RAM... it has 1&nbsp;GB of RAM. It says I need 16 GB of available hard disk space, it has a 138 GB main C hard drive that will be wiped clean when Windows 7 is ready to be installed. And it says I need a<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>"DirectX
 9 graphics card (with WDDM1.0 or higher driver)"</strong></span></span> ... that last part&nbsp;in parenthesis is the only part I'm not sure of, but my system info through the control panel shows most of this information as being adequate.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Go to this URL: 
http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/inspd531/en/OM/appendix.htm#wp1149549&nbsp; to see the online Dell Inspiron 531 appendix page and click on the link near the top titled, "Specifications" or just scroll down a little bit to see the specs... there,
 in the 4th category down titled "Video" it shows the <span>
"<strong>Nvidia integrated video <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(DirectX 9.0 Shader Model 3.9 Graphics Processing Unit)"</span></strong></span><span><strong>.</strong> This seems to match the</span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>"DirectX
 9"</strong></span></span><span> info listed above from the "Windows 7 system requirements" page.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>But then there are 2 Dell webpages that indicate that this Dell Inspiron 531&nbsp;is only supported by Windows Vista and Windows XP... see this URL for that webpage...http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/osmatrix/index?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~ck=mn&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>This is&nbsp;other conflicting Dell webpage at the URL:http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;docid=360683&amp;journalid=910DD2FE57EB5496E040AC0A64E9331A#Issue0_1</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>It shows, after you scroll down just a little, a list of current Dell computers that will support Windows 7... the Inspiron 531 is<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> on that list.
</span></div>

<div><span>T<span>hat list excludes the 531 Inspiron, but it then says<span><span>,</span><strong>"Don't own a computer on these list? Click here
 to shop for a new Dell !"</strong></span>...bad grammar aside, this line that I'm pointing out may just be Dell trying to sell me a new Dell computer whether I actually need it or not!</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>And last my computer info from the Control Panel shows&nbsp;a<span><strong>2 GHZ processor, the 1 GB of RAM, or 958 MB anyway, and the 32 bit OS</strong>.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>And yes, I've run the built-in Dell PSA diagnostics test on this computer and&nbsp;when it tests the sound board and the speakers, it plays a little song in each channel and then on&nbsp;both channels, so I know
 the hardware is good on this computer.</span></div>
<div>
<div><span>I know this is a lot to go over... it took me a while to compile this info, and I've sent a version of this letter with screenshots and such to MS techs in India who I have been working with for a month
 on the phone and email to fix a "no sound" problem that just can't be beat.</span></div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>But I'm trying to make sure before I go to do a clean install of Windows 7, when the disk gets here, that I won't wipe the hard drive clean only to find out Windows 7 doesn't work on this machine.</span></div>

<div><span>I'm actually a Mac user and I don't have much trouble with those... I'm just trying to fix my mom's computer for her, and now it looks like trying to install Windows 7 is the only way to get the sound
 back so my mom can enjoy a little music again. </span></div>

<div><span>I never thought I'd know as much about troubleshooting PCs as I've learned in the last month, but I don't like it and there is still no sound on this computer and everything has been tried... I made a
 collage of about a hundred different Windows error messages that I think I'll put up for bid on ebay... I just want to go home to my trusty Macs.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Please give me your input... I'd sure appreciate it.</span></div>

<div><span>Thanks,</span></div>

<p>I'm glad you got it installed, but do you have sound?</p>
<p>I was surprised too when Windows 7 wanted to install all my device drivers for me!</p>
<p>The video driver it wanted to install was even the latest one from Nvidia. It also didn't install the Physx driver that I needed, so I had to install that one myself. The other driver it didn't install was the driver for X-Fi sound card. It did install my
 motherboard chipset drivers though, but I turned around and installed the ones that came with my motherboard.</p>
<p>Windows 7 does do a better job at installing itself over the earlier versions of Windows, but you do need to watch what it wants to installs to make sure it doesn't do something you don't want. It has come along and updated my video driver again, but when
 it does, it just installs the driver itself and not the Physx driver, and my video control panel. Now when it tells me about video drivers, I just go to Nvidia and download the complete package.</p>
<p>You have the option in there for Windows Update to choose what updates you want to allow. I'd set it to let you decide which ones you want and not let it do it on its own.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're a happy camper! I also can't see where you're coming from with Vista, I skipped over that operating system completely because of the&nbsp;horror stories I heard&nbsp;about it.</p>

<h2>            Old Windows Media Player Visualization</h2>
                    I have been searching to no end to find an old visualization for Windows Media Player. It was called " Christmas Dancer" She has kinda of a&nbsp;skimpy Santa Suit on with a Santa hat and dances around like crazy to the music just a really cool visualization.
 It was the best one ever in my opinion. I have it saved on a disk in my office somewhere but haven't been able to find the correct data disk as I have so many of them. If anyone knows where I can find her again I would be so appreciative! Thanks!

            It's actually called Holiday Dancer. Sorry for the misinformation.

<h2>            While Windows 10 is free now will there be a monthly fee later&#63;</h2>
                    Recently there has been a trend to charge customers a monthly fee for the software they use as indeed you are now doing with office etc. I have heard a rumour that windows 10 will only be free for a year and then a monthly fee will be introduced if you
 want to continue using the software. Is this correct or can we update with confidence knowing that windows 10 will be ours until we update it with a newer product when we wish to? Many thanks.

    <title>Movie Maker Cannot Locate source files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rau1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie Maker Cannot Locate source files</h2>
                    <p>I'm using version 2012 Movie Maker.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Input video clips were taken on iphone4 and iPad and are .mov files, and come from various folders located on a NAS drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the project file is re-opened, Movie Maker appears to locate only the first clip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All subsequent clips show the yellow triangle with exclamation point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can readily "fix" this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next time the project file is opened, the same thing happens
 again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the next time, etc.!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried converting the .mov files to .wmv files - however exactly the same thing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, Movie Make knows the correct folder and filename for each clip, but apparently does not find the clips (other than the first).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem does NOT occur if the source files are located on a locally attached drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is causing the problem when source files are on the NAS (a Synology box)?</p>

<p>I suppose there could be some hiccup on your network that makes it so Movie Maker thinks it can't see the files from the NAS.&nbsp; I assume if you browse to the NAS you see things without problem?&nbsp; And if you reopen a project right after doing that, do you see
 the files or yellow triangles?&nbsp; Also, what's the speed of your network, how big are the files and how long are you waiting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, this should work, so it will still take some diagnosing to figure out why you are seeing triangles instead of files.</p>

The "status" of the NAS is not the problem -&nbsp; ie I've made sure it wasn't sleeping &amp; and I've waited several minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I browsed to the&nbsp;source files with Win Explorer as you suggested, then opened moviemaker and get the yellow triangle on those files that
 are on the NAS, and all OK for those on a local drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am aware that Windows Home Server is probably unique as a NAS in that it&nbsp; supports some protocol (forget what it's called) that other servers don't.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the reason that you can add (I think) a folder on WHS to your "Documents" library, but you cannot
 if the folder is on a general NAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>HOWEVER</u>, I <u>don't</u> think this is the problem either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a test where I loaded 3 clips, all from the Synology NAS, in the following order:&nbsp;&nbsp; .avi clip, .mov clip and .wmv clip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The .wmv is a rotated vsn of the .mov, which I think I made using Movie Maker in the past.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I found is that after
 saving the project file, then reloading it, MM finds the first file&nbsp;(.avi), but not the next 2 clips.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I manually "fix" the .mov clip, and then manually fix the .wmv clip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saving the proj file and re-opening produces the same problem again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that
 even though clips 2 and 3 are in the same folder, both must be individually "fixed" - fixing clip 2 does not automatically fix clip 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then re-ordered the clips - now, it automatically resolves the first clip only, no matter what file type tht clip is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fix the remaining clips, save and re-open the file clip, and again, it only resolves the first clip!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally - I've observed that if I enter MM via Photo Gallery - eg. select a set of files in the Gallery and then choose "Create" a movie, then MM never has a problem locating the source files upon reloading the MM project.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I manually add another&nbsp;file
 from MM, it sometimes does and sometimes does not have a problem&nbsp;resolving the file.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp;never has a problem with those that were initially selected from the Gallery/Create procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is pretty bazaar.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have used MM before without this particular hassle!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I open older project files, it does resolve references to NAS based files.</p>

            Hello rau1, <br />
<br />
Just to clarify, do you recall what version of Movie Maker were you using before wherein this issue was not experienced? Furthermore, were you using the same network system as before in this case?
<br />
<br />
We would have our product specialists have a look at this case further and as such, please collect the following log files and upload them here:
<br />
<ol>
<li>dxdiag, msinfo and event viewer logs</li><li>procmon and netmon trace logs</li></ol>
<p>The procmon/netmon files may be to big to have it uploaded here in this thread. You may use your SkyDrive account to upload the log files and then share it with us so that we could investigate this matter further.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />

Thanks for giving this a go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed that .mp3 files and .jpg files never have the problem I've encountered - ie. MM always resolves their location (on the Synology).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, my video files are located in the "video" share on the Synology&nbsp;- which is a media server.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could
 this be interfering with MM's ability to resolve the location, in some cases??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The photos and music are in specific shares I created,&nbsp;ie. &nbsp;not media servers.</p>

            I created all my own folders, so it may well be this reason. Try putting your videos in your own video folder and see if that works.

<p><br />
I've shifted my video clips to a new share on the Synology NAS and all seems to be working properly - after "fixing" the MM links to the content files, MM resolves all files ok on subsequent reloads.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm inclined therefore to think that the Media Server functionality
 on the Synology NAS <strong>might</strong> have somehow impeded MM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll take a wait and see approach for a while.</p>

    <title>ThinkPad Digitizer Pen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonymeelan  say:</h3>
<h2>            ThinkPad Digitizer Pen</h2>
                    <p>I've seen several threads about this issue, but none that address my specific concern.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ThinkPad Yoga 14. It did not come with a digitizer pen included. However, I suspect that the screen does in fact have a Wacom digitizer layer. My rationale is this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Device Manager reports the following HID devices:
<ol>
<li>HID-compliant digitizer</li><li>HID-compliant pen</li><li>Wacom Device</li></ol>
</li><li>When I run the Wacom Hardware Check (available <a href="http://cdn.wacom.com/U/drivers/TabletPC/WacomHardwareCheck.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>), it reports "You have hardware compatible with&nbsp;the Wacom FEEL driver."</li></ol>
<p>However, the computer will not recognize the ThinkPad digitizer pen I purchased.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I suppose I have three questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Am I just misinterpreting what I am seeing in the Device Manager?</li><li>Is it possible that Lenovo installs the Wacom screen on all it's tablets, but disables them somehow on models not marketed as digitizer ready?</li><li>If so, is there any way for me to enable my screen to allow for digitizer use?</li></ol>

<p><span><span>If the print spooler won’t start properly make sure that any dependent services on the spooler are started and then retry starting
 the spooler. Can you try the article below and then tell us whether or not that has any effect on your problem.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>There is no guarantee that it will work but it might cleanup any software for your printer that may have corrupted during the

<h2>            Can a windows 7 theme pack file carry a virus&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have just downloaded a windows 7 theme pack from an unofficial source other than from Microsoft's personalization page and now I'm a little bit worried somebody might have enclosed/included a virus in the .themepack file, I wonder if anybody can let
 me know if a .themepack file can carry a virus at all or not just so I know if there was any risk I might have infected my PC.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance for your help.</p>

<div>Yes, any software can carry a virus.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes, there's a risk. But how great the risk is largely depends on</div>
<div>where you downloaded it from. If it's a reliable source, the risk is</div>
<div>small.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Moreover, if you have a good anti-virus program installed, the risk is</div>
<div>even smaller.</div>

<h2>            Skype demanding new download everytime I open it</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not had problems with Skype before, but now everytime I open it on Windows I am requested to download the update. I do this, install it, and go about Skyping. However, when I try to open it again (in a day or two or three), I again am prompted to download
 a new update. I've restarted after installing, so I'm not sure what the issue is. Any ideas/help? &nbsp;I am running Windows 8.1.</p>

<p>You are more than likely sporadically clicking on an old link to an outdated and retired version of the Skype App. &nbsp;As long as you continue to do that, this endless loop will occur. &nbsp;Installing the latest version simply installs Skype for Windows Desktop.
 &nbsp;This will leave you with two versions installed. &nbsp;You will simply need to uninstall that Skype App so that you are left with a singular Skype application and icon to click on. &nbsp;The image below displays the two applications when searching for "Skype" using
 the start menu on my Windows 10. &nbsp;This is similar to how it will appear and function on your Windows 8.1 machine. &nbsp;You will notice they have two distinctively different icons.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hopefully uninstalling the Skype App in this manner, will resolve your problem.</p>

<h2>            The file is corrupt, checksum error after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    The file is corrupt. The file header checksum does not match the computed checksum. I got this after Windows 10 install.&nbsp; It seems to start up normally but will randomly reboot and the error message comes up.&nbsp; I can restart the computer and continue to
 work and it will eventually reboot again with the same error message.&nbsp; I have an Acer Desktop and upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. How can I fix this?

Here's my blue stop screen. Usually after the computer has been running a while. <br />
Ha Ha, out of the "Blue".&nbsp; Windows 7 professional 64, with XP-mode loaded (which doesn't work very well by the way)<br />
This was a ground up build, Gigabyte mobo - AMD phenom II 955 3.2ghz quad core - 4 GSkill 2mb ripjaw's,<br />
2 Seagate 1.5 tb&nbsp; hdd's,&nbsp; as a DIY Kit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then also,&nbsp; firewire pci card,&nbsp; LG BD burner,&nbsp; Avermedia pci-e TV card + AV inputs,&nbsp;
<br />
PNY 1mb graphics pci-e x 16,&nbsp; Mediapac card reader + front ports.&nbsp; there you have it, the lay of the land.<br />
This seems to happen randomly.&nbsp; The last time before today was several days ago. My build has been done for about 10 days now,<br />
and this has happened about 5 -6 times. The first time it happened, very little software, if any,&nbsp; other than OS, had been loaded.<br />
XP-Mode was one of the last to be loaded.<br />
<br />
Didn't see any other responses for my specific error string, <br />
and most of the others were for Vista or server 2008.<br />
<br />
Simply put,&nbsp;&nbsp; ....Help<br />

            <p>I would open the system unit, do a thorough inspection and make sure all the system components such as video, audio, network, memory modules are seated and fitted properly.</p>
<p>You could also try removing memory modules to see if the problem is specific to one of the modules. You might also want to run a memory test:</p>
<p>1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD<br />
2. Restart your computer<br />
3. When asked if you want to boot from your DVD drive, do so.<br />
4. Choose your language, click Next.<br />
5. Click 'Repair your computer'<br />
6. Select operating system you want to repair.<br />
7. On the System Recovery window, click Memory diagnostics option</p>
<p>Restart your system, a scan of your memory of your memory modules will take place to check for any defects.<br />
</p>
<p>Also make sure the latest drivers have been updated for all your devices. </p>
<p>If you have any non-essential devices connected, disconnect them and see if the problem reappears or not.</p>

<h2>            How do I disable Windows Hello for an account&#47;profile&#63;</h2>
                    I've got a new laptop with Windows 10 installed. It uses Windows Hello. I love the feature, with one exception. For reasons I won't go into, I had to establish logins onto this laptop using 2 different Microsoft accounts that I have. Now, when I come the
 laptop it's almost always a crap shoot as to which one it will use to log me in. So, what I want to do is leave Windows Hello enabled for one of the accounts, but disabled for the other one. Is that possible? And if the answer to that question is yes, how
 do I do it?

<h2>            Qualcomm Atheros AR9002WB-1NG Wireless Network Adapter disappears from Device Manager</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite L750-1LG laptop that came with windows 7 pre-installed. After upgrading to Windows 10 I am facing serious issues with my wireless adapter. At times it disappears even from Device Manager and obviously I cannot connect to the Network
 via WiFi (Ethernet works). All attempts to detect the adapter (scanning for new hardware, troubleshooter, etc) have failed. At times, the adapter may appear after several restarts, but that may be after a few days. I cannot see any pattern to this. It seems
 pretty random.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wifi adapter is&nbsp;Qualcomm Atheros AR9002WB-1NG. Looking into the event viewer I found the following error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone that has solved this?&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for giving us an opportunity to assist you with the query.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I understand the inconvenience caused, n</span><span>ow that you have me with you let me take care of this.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>An outdated or incompatible network adapter driver can cause connection problems. If you recently upgraded to Windows&nbsp;10, it's possible that the current driver was designed for
 a previous version of Windows. Check to see if an updated driver is available.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and then select
<strong>Device Manager</strong> from the list of results.</li><li>
In Device Manager, select <strong>Network adapters </strong>&gt; the network adapter name.</li><li>
Right-click (or press and hold) the network adapter, and then select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong> &gt;
<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>. Follow the steps, then select
<strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>
After installing the updated driver, select the Start button &gt;
<strong>Power</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart</strong> if asked to restart, and see if that fixes the connection issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If Windows can’t find a new driver for your network adapter, visit the PC manufacturer’s website and download the latest network adapter driver from there. If your PC can't connect
 to the Internet, you'll need to download a driver on a different PC and save it to a USB flash drive, so you can install the driver on your PC. You’ll need to know the PC manufacturer and model name or number.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope it helps.</span></span></p>
