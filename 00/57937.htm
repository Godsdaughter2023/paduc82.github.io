<h2>            Sent emails won&#39;t sync through Mail</h2>
                    <p>I use Mail on Windows 10. My normal inbox and its organizing folders are all working/receiving emails/syncing completely fine however my sent email is not syncing at all and won't show any of my sent emails. When I try and reload it, it tries to sync and
 then comes up with the message - "Nothing has arrived yet".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sent emails come through fine over the internet Gmail but I want my sent mail to also sync up through Mail as the interface is a lot clearer than over the web. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi Gangadhar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good to know that you have checked for drivers updates. However, I would suggest you to check if the latest Synaptics Touchpad driver is installed on the computer:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/en_IN/research/hints-or-tips/detail.page?&amp;DocID=HT073553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/en_IN/research/hints-or-tips/detail.page?&amp;DocID=HT073553</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are chances that you might face this issue due to hardware. I would suggest you to try contacting Lenovo support for any hardware issues. You may refer to the link for Lenovo support forums:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/tkb/communitypage?profile.language=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/tkb/communitypage?profile.language=en</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. If you have any further issues on the computer, please post your question regarding Windows and we will be happy to help you.</p>

Means that the Windows upgrade failed after the first restart. Some of the drivers in the driver set of the image are incompatible during the PNP Specialization phase. Update the drivers and firmware on the computer to the latest versions. To do this, go to
 the computer manufacturer's website, or contact the computer manufacturer's support line. If you have any device installed that you're not regularly using, you need to remove the device drivers from the computer. To do this, open Program and Features, find
 the entries that are related to the driver, and uninstall them.</p>

            Hi Richard.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Seeing about 40% Reset failure in Windows 10 which is heavily dependent upon the underlying install as is everything else with WIndows 10.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do now is create the bootable media to wipe the drive and do the vastly superior Clean Install:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Then folllow these steps which compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, and has zero reported problems.:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello,
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot:

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB:
<br />Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.

            Hi Richard, since the Reset Image is corrupt, your best option is to clean install Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>
</p><p>Is this a security issue ? or is it something to do with the Microsoft account having two separate SKype names associated with it ? I know my private Skype account is connected but my wifes' account won't be</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8d808c29-357f-4884-97cb-5d04d9c0040a" title="keithgreen64">
<p>
</p><p>Just to reiterate the scenario and to make sure that I got your concern correctly, you sent a contact request and a test message from your Skype for Business account to your personal Skype account (account X). Skype account Y then received your message and
 replied back, is that correct? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case, I find this very odd as well. This should not be the behavior as messages directed to a specific Skype user should not reflect on another user's end. Can you confirm if you have changed your password after the incident? How many times
 did this happen? Do you still have a copy of the message you sent and the reply you got from your wife?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back so we can assist you further. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>OK, to confirm....and this is really doing my head in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an account at work with Skype for Business "me-at-work" , I also have an account not at work "me-at-home", my wife uses another account. "wife-at-home" .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made&nbsp;"me-at-home"&nbsp; searchable (it wasn't public)&nbsp; sent a contact request and message from "me-at-work"&nbsp; to "me-at-home"&nbsp; as a test&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>a few hours later "wife-at-home" replied to&nbsp;"me-at-work".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, I can't even add&nbsp;"wife-at-home" as a contact for "me-at-work" as I can't find her account when I search for it even though&nbsp;"wife-at-home" account is public and searchable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can think of is that because the Skype accounts have some sort of connection via the email addresses set up, or it's something to do with the Microsoft linked accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In any scenario, sending a message to one account should <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>NEVER</strong></span> solicit a reply from a 3rd party.</p>

<p>oh... i forgot to mention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when "wife-at-home" replied to "me-at-work", it wasn't from her account, but from her via my "me-at-home" account. Which was the bit that really screwed me up as my lap top and "me-at-home" is off-line all the time so to receive a message from that was super
 spooky</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the Skype accounts.&nbsp; &nbsp;"me-at-home" has&nbsp;"me-at-work" as a contact,&nbsp;"wife-at-home" does not have&nbsp;"me-at-work" as a contact.</p>

<p>Here's my analysis about the issue you encountered: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your wife might have logged in using your personal account "me-at-home" because it is not possible that your wife can receive and send you a message using your personal account without her having access to it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you the only one that has access to your account?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>XP os corrupted, How do I fix&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mnja  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP os corrupted, How do I fix&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Alright.&nbsp; I asked a person on the phone but they were no help, what so ever.&nbsp; So I'm trying here, in the faint hope that I'm not royally screwed over and have a dead PC sitting here (It's my older pc that I was going to use as well as this one).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First some back story.&nbsp; Abouat a year and a half ago I bought a refurbished IBM Netvista Desktop computer.&nbsp; I hadn't noticed until recently that the OEM sticker for the thing had been removed (prior to purchase)&nbsp; The Refurbishing company themselves were
 out of state, They didn't give me a CD, and I don't have their phone number.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was using WIN XP pro, and I had been on it for about a good four two to four months.&nbsp; Which meant I had Validated that it was a valid product.&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple months ago while I was
 net surfing the computer froze, I tried everything I could without hard shut down to get it to work, and it finally after some time follwed the alt+ctrl+del twice tap code for a reboot.&nbsp; It shut down to just my background, then froze and hung on me again.&nbsp;
 I finally had gotten fed up with it and hard shut the thing down.&nbsp; when I go to reboot the computer, the OS can't be found and the computer isn't booting up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month I got the important documents off of it using my friends computer.&nbsp; He was going to
 let me borrow his cd to have it repair the corrupted OS.&nbsp; which I just got a few days ago.&nbsp; He's used the CD, still uses it for solo gaming, but he figured it would work.</p>
<p><br />
NOw, without that OEM sticker I can't get my original product key, and his isn't working due to being validated already.&nbsp; I feel like the refurbishing company, as well as you lot, have royally shafted me with this predicament.&nbsp; From the Phone customer service's
 reaction to it, I get the feeling that you guys think, "Well, tough ____ dude, deal with it"&nbsp; Which is seriously making me want to stop using any microsoft/ windows applications and go to MAC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUt then I found some hope.. I remembered, and even have a link ( http://www.dantech.ca/index.php?q=11--&amp;tab=7 ) that says you guys can reset the product and activation key.&nbsp; But how can you do that if I can't even get past that on the reinstall to fix the
 OS?</p>
<p>I would be ecstatic to find that you guys aren't going to shaft a person who's just been given bad circumstances and help me out.&nbsp; but if I get the same reply here as I got on the phone, then I've had it and will take my money elsewhere.</p>

<p>Hi MNJA,</p>
<p>Getting frustrated with technology is not going to help at all. You would have to move in logical and step by step manner to get things up and running.</p>
<p>Please answer few questions below so that we can have a good understanding what's going on.</p>
<p>1. Turn off your computer completely and remove the power cord from the electricity board. Keep holding the POWER BUTTON on the main box so that all the flee power can be removed off from the machine. Turn on the computer and check if your problem is resolved
 or not.</p>
<p>2. If Step 1 fails, let us know if the you just see a black screen with no Logos, Documentation or not.</p>
<p>3. If you are able to view the Windows XP Logo, till what end does the boot process go to? Are you able to view the logon screen or not?</p>
<p>4. Do you notice any error message on the screen while turning on the computer?</p>
<p>5. If you are able to login to the computer, after how much time does it get frozen up?</p>
<p>NOTE : Re-installing Windows XP is not the only solution to the problems, infact it decreases the life of your hard drive. Troubleshooting is one of the best options for you.</p>
<p>Keep us posted!</p>

<p>Saurabh,</p>
<p>&nbsp; A tad late for that, and I wasn't even getting to the windows logo.&nbsp; it would boot, and ____ out during post.&nbsp; it couldn't even find the OS.&nbsp; I'm in college going for an IT career myself, and the teacher even had a look at it and said that a reinstall
 was the only option.&nbsp; I didn't have a back up file (no floppy's and it only had a cd Player)&nbsp; We've tried everything he knew, and being a teacher who's been in the field for quite some time, and still in the field, he knows a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I would like to mention, I've already had the corrupted parts of it repaired, I'm at the final step of the installation (product key and then validation)</p>

<p>MNJA,</p>
<p>In that case you would just have limited options.</p>
<p>1. Either your OS is corrupt or there are some issues with your Hardware.</p>
<p>2. If you need to save your data, open the CPU and take out the Hard Drive, attach the same to your friends computer as a Slave Drive and backup the data</p>
<p>3. But to fix your computer, you would certainly need a Windows XP Disc and small bit of Hardware Skill which can be earned through internet.</p>
<p>And as per your description, if it is ending up during POST, then I am damn sure that it is a hardware concern. But please try the Step 1 posted in the earlier post. I have fixed up many issues for my customer's using that step.</p>

<p>I don't see how a computer that was working fine, that freezes on shut down, could be caused by hardware.&nbsp; Basically because the hard drive worked fine on my firends computer when I slaved it so I could pull my stuff off of it (with ubuntu)and all the parts
 are working, it read the CD to REINSTALL WIN XP PRO, my motherboard lights up when I turn it on, and so does the graphic card and modem card.&nbsp; which would leave to one thing, the floppy drive, which I've told the computer in bios setup to ignore the floppy
 drive.. and, guess what?&nbsp; same thing.</p>
<p>It's definitely the OS.&nbsp; and again, I wonder why I can't just get you guys to give me a product key (via email so it's strictly given to me)&nbsp; so I can just bring it back up?&nbsp; I mean, I paid 250.00 USD for the computer/monitor combo.&nbsp; that's 125.00 for the
 computer and OS inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, I would like to mention that it seriously seemed to be a virus had infiltrated and erased the boot record and maybe some other OS portions, from the way it all went down.</p>

<p>MNJA,</p>
<p><strong>Clarification : To set your expectations, I am not a Microsoft Support Engineer and I cannot send you a Product Key.</strong></p>
<p>If you really think that it's an OS issue (which I don't think) try contacting Microsoft Technical Support and try your luck, if they can send you a new disc free of cost.</p>
<p>One more thing that you can do is - Remove the RAM from the slot, clear it out for any dust and put it back in again. If you have multiple RAM's try using all of them but one by one to check if there is a faulty one there!</p>

            Yeah.. I earlier stated that the Tech call center didn't help.&nbsp; They can't send new cd's because they pretty much don't give a frack about their customers who are still using XP Pro. due to the computer being fairly old (the HD only has like 80GB) .&nbsp; It's
 sad really, and annoying.&nbsp; But, sorry, it's hard to tell who here is a MS employee or just someone trying to be helpful.&nbsp; I've considered the RAM&gt;. but that's a pain in the ____ to get to.&nbsp; Also, I'm only with one monitor keyboard, and mouse.. hehe.&nbsp; so it
 gets tedious to keep switching.

<p>Aight.. well, I unseated it, put everything back to gether (RAM included)&nbsp; and got something new!&nbsp; Two quick, very loud beeps.&nbsp; then froze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>that may have something to do with the being in the middle of what the computer considers a reinstall.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Don't have visual due to not wanting to switch comps currently)</p>

<p>I knew it! How many RAM's are there on the Motherboard? If there are multiple, then remove one of them and then boot the computer and then check again! It's hardware issue!</p>

<p>Ehh.. I just got the one RAM.. actually.&nbsp; looks like a DDR2?&nbsp; it's got two notches in it.&nbsp; That's odd that it can handle a DDR2, being 32 bit MB and OS.&nbsp; And seriously?</p>
<p>I mean, what about the friends installation disk that literally deleted and reinstalled various files (too many to actually catch, and now that it's on the last step, I can't look back)&nbsp; wouldn't that mean that there was indeed an issue with the OS still?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT:&nbsp; nope!&nbsp; that's not it.. it just gave that due to not having a keyboard or mouse attached.&nbsp; nothing more. I switched (hot swapped) monitor cord and mouse cord.. boy that was a tad unnerving but it worked.&nbsp; oh, I used my old keyboard witch is sticky
 keyed and nearly dead, that's why I only needed to switch two things.</p>

<h2>            W10 goes to lock screen during the cutscenes for some games.</h2>
                    When i play some games (Assassin's Creed, Witcher 3, and Blade and Soul specifically), Windows 10 will go to lock screen during the cutscenes. W7 did not do this. does Microsoft have any plan to fix this bug that's existed since W8.1, or do we just have
 to disable timeout while gaming, or is there a thing i can do besides disable timeout (in case&nbsp; forget to re-enable it later)

<p>My HDMI port quit working after upgrading to Windows 10. The VGA port works fine. I have triend many of the fixes for listed for this issue for upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8/8.1. Here's whay I've done so far...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Downloaded the most recent drivers for my Intel(R) Graphics Card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outcome: It said the drivers installed were newer than the driver I was installing. Tried anyway, didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Uninstalled the driver and let windows update it.</p>
<p>Outcome: Black screen, then it restarted and installed the same driver it had before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Tried installing the Windows 7 Driver for my&nbsp;<span>Intel(R) Graphics Card.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Outcome:&nbsp;<span>Black screen, then it restarted and installed the same driver it had before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) At this point I tried the last resort. I spun around three times in a circle and spit in the corner.</p>
<p>Outcome: Wife yelled at me and kids thought I had a demon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, I use this computer in the office to connect to a 65" TV and I NEED my HDMI port.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The problem is that the computer doesn't know there is a problem. It's almost like the HDMI port doesn't even exist. It worked fine in windows 7 but after upgrading to Windows 10 it doesn't exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running the drivers for the graphics card in compatibility mode but that still didn't fix it. I thought about taking the time to downgrade back to Windows 7 but that still might not fix it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your HDMI port does not work because of the AMD driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bug and has existed since Catalyst 14.4. </p>

That didn't work for me. I just don't understand what is going on. I never had problems with HDMI on Win 8.1 and it still worked a week in with Win10 upgraded. Then all of a sudden nothing. It's Like my PC doesn't realize it even has an HDMI port anymore.

<p>

<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>AMD Radeon™ HD 4000 Series products and older are not certified to support Windows
 Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.2 or higher and therefore, do not have driver support for Windows® 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p>

            <p>Facing similar issues with Lenovo IdeaPad Y460. Have Intel Integrated graphics + AMD ATI Radeon HD 5650</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro. Everything works great, but nothing shows up on the TV screen when connecting via HDMI. Was working before upgrade to Win10, now it doesn't detect the second TV. It does work with a VGA cable connecting to a
 monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both graphic cards are seen in the device manager. EARLIER, the Radeon card used to switch ON when HDMI or VGA cable was connected OR I turn it ON using physical switch. Now it always ON and I can't turn it off. Don't see an option in the ATI command center
 to do it as well. </p>

</p><p>I've tried reinstalling all the drivers and Catalyst command center. Uninstalled the HW only to have Win10 auto install the drivers after restart. Doesn't help. I've tried updating the driver, but it say I have the latest driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, this is supposed to me our media laptop and without HDMI, I'll have to switch back to Win 7.</p>

            <p>Tried re-installing drivers again after completely removing the AMD software. It installed fine, but after restart the screen started rapidly blinking. It give me an error saying
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"LogonUI.exe Application error</p>
<p>The instruction at 0x000000000000000000 referenced memory at 0x00000000000000000. The memory could not be written.</p>
<p>Click on OK to terminate the program"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I disconnected everything including the battery and restarted. That seems to have fixed the flashing screen issue.

<p>
</p><p>But HDMI issue is still a problem.</p>

    <title>why does windows 10 suck&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_stix  say:</h3>
<h2>            why does windows 10 suck&#63;</h2>
                    <p>1. No brightness slider like the easy to use one in windows 8</p>
<p>2. WAY to confusing to get Bluetooth to connect and disconnect</p>
<p>3. Too many clicks and searching for the right thing to click to get the function you want</p>
<p>4. Tablet mode / Desktop mode is a joke and to confusing and hard to get in and out of and doesn't present a clear indication of "where I am, desktop or tablet mode"</p>
<p>5. New apps that are installed require account before you can even try them</p>
<p>6. Windows 7 was better than 8 and 8 was better than 10</p>
<p>7. All people wanted was a damn windows start menu, no need to change the whole OS. All windows had to do was add a start menu button, like in 7, to 8 and you would have satisfied many people.</p>
<p>8. The task bar is still showing when I go full screen in an App. Unless I select "hide task bar" on the desktop side....I hate a hidden task bar but hate a task bar when I'm in full screen....can you say lesser of 2 evils?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is windows 10 day one experience.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The battery percentage and battery REPORT both are stuck at 99%. HOWEVER, the Time remaining does go down as usual. It's just the battery percentage that is stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is rooted in the 1/30 firmware update. Any way to uninstall a system firmware update? I need to revert to the prior one and just leave it alone. You guys just screwed up a perfectly functioning machine.</p>

<h2>            Unable to log into Skype</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>When logging into Skype, after entering the login id and password, a verification code is sent to an email id ending with ".con" whereas mine ends with ".com". As a result, I am neither able to log in nor edit the email id so that I can receive the verification
 code and go ahead with logging into Skype. Can anyone help out on how to go about editing the email id so that I can log into Skype without any issues. Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It seems that the system is trying to send a verification code to the security information stored on your account. Can you please try to sign in using another device and see if the same email address shown. If it does and you do not have access to it, then
 you need to manually recover in the <strong><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">online recovery form</a></strong>. This will enable you to update the security information to change the email address to the correct one.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Dear Aljon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply but it actually didnt help out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened to one of my colleagues and since he is not able to log into Skype, I am taking your assistance to help&nbsp; him out.&nbsp; He has tried all options but still unable to get this issue rectified. He had no problems with Skype for quite a long time
 till this issue occurred about 3-4 days back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway he can get his mail id edited from .con to .com so that he can log in and use his Skype without anymore hassles ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoever we call at Customer support, they end up guiding us back to the Support page and if we try to get help on call, no one is able to support him. He had tried all options possible but nothing seems to be working out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He had also filled in the online recovery form but still, the verification goes to the wrong email id. He cannot log into Skype as he cannot retrieve the code from the wrong id (which he also cannot access as he doesnt have any such id). He tried opening
 a new Skype account but since his credentials are already mentioned in his previous Skype account, it doesnt go forward from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly help out anyway this issue can be sorted out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/305f059c-7643-4b88-a001-b9dc3a00a714" title="SumaSajeev">
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the inconvenience you and your colleague encountered to sort this issue out.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: </strong><em>Is there anyway he can get his mail id edited from .con to .com so that he can log in and use his Skype without anymore hassles?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Unfortunately, security information stored on the account cannot be edited. However, we can change or update all of these details for instance that we do not have access to it. And to do so, it requires access to the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Issue: </strong><em>He tried opening a new Skype account but since his credentials are already mentioned in his previous Skype account, it doesn't go forward from there.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Since your colleague unable to recover the account through
<em>account recovery</em>, our last resort is to create a new Skype account. And upon trying, he still encountered an issue above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this one, we would advise him to create new Skype account using the new Microsoft account
<em>(with Hotmail or Outlook domain) </em>or other email address that is not yet associated with other Skype accounts. Refer to this link on how to create new Skype account.

    <title>Cannot move or install apps on drive other than C&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ediblecactus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot move or install apps on drive other than C&#58;</h2>
                    <p>I have a small SSD that has windows installed, and a larger SSD and HDD that I use to store the majority of my programs/files. When I try to install a game like Sea of Thieves or Zoo Tycoon on any other drive than my C drive, it fails during the install
 step. I have tried reseting the store, double checked windows is up to date, restarted the computer multiple times (once even during the install), and ensured the date and time were correct. Even if the game is completely installed on the C drive, when I move
 it via the apps part of the control panel using the move command, it fails during the last part of the transfer. I only have one user account and it has admin privledges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had problems installing programs or games on the other two drives before. I have only had problems with Sea of Thieves and Zoo Tycoon through the Windows Store. This makes me extremely hesistant to get any other apps on the store because I am
 almost out of space to install on my C drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can try so I can move the games onto another drive?</p>

            That technique did not work. I also do not have access to the files in the folder because of the security of the windows store, like the person who posted that question. The person in the question also was able to get it to work without following the advice,
 so there must be another way<br />

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Note: The command wouldn’t appear as a message on the other end user as it is a special command. This is to ensure that it is properly connected to our

<h2>            Age Confirmation through Korean IPIN &#38;lt&#59;--- Impossible for my case</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I created hotmail account when I was a kid in Korea. Then, I moved to USA when I was 13 and now I am 28 years old.&nbsp;<br />
I also gave up the Korean Citizenship and received American Citizenship few years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe, there are lots of people are in same situation as I am and we cannot use this IPIN stuff to verify anything unless you live in Korea.&nbsp;<br />
My Korean SSN is terminated and I do not have Korea Cell Phone Number nor Address.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I was trying to change my account's region but it is not successful since it is still requesting us to do the age verification first...<br />
<br />
Please help me out.&nbsp;<br />
Thanks</p>

    <title>Navigation pane&#58; how to hide headings and create custom - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamie uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Navigation pane&#58; how to hide headings and create custom headings&#63;</h2>
                    First of all, the navigation pane contains "Libraries", Computer" and "Network"; none of which I ever use. They just sit there and make the navigation pane cluttered. How do I turn them off?<br />
<br />
But here's my main problem: In the navigation pane I've placed about 25 folders (commonly-used drives and folders). But they're all lumped under one heading: "Favourites". Not only do they look a complete mess, but they're frustratingly difficult to navigate.
 Instead of glancing at the category I want, then the sub-category (e.g., Photos &gt; Dad's Photos), I have to look through all 25 folders! It's a mess.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to organise my folders into sub-categories, or create new headings other than "Favorites"? If not, how does Microsoft expect users to navigate to their personal folders? Am I doing something wrong here?<br />
<br />
Back in XP, I had all my links to folders in Quick Launch folders on the taskbar. It was perfect: all my folders were at the tip of my fingers, neatly organised into sub-folders. But now in Windows 7, I'm not sure what to do.

<blockquote>Trek, thanks for your suggestions, although they wouldn’t work for me. I don’t use libraries, and pinning folders to Explorer on the taskbar doesn’t allow you to organise folders heirarchically (with sub-folders).<br />
<br />
However, I did find all the other information in your signature REALLY interesting.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Glad some of the info helped.</p>
<p>Where ever your data is stored you can create a subfolder hierarchy. Note that the folders in "Favorites" are actually stored somewhere else (C: D: or external drive) so you might have to make the changes there (or you might mean something else by hierarchy).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could then pin the main folder to the taskbar, and have quick access to the subfolders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>I completely (and strongly) agree with your “Most important features to fix or return to Windows Explorer”. Many of them were things that already really annoyed me, especially the way Windows now instantly sorts files into alphabetical order as
 soon as they arrive in a folder. I don’t understand how a new version of Windows could be released with some of these faults? Surely they would be spotted after just 5 minutes of user testing by one person?</blockquote>
<p>Many people noticed the Auto Arrange feature missing, and other removed options. There are two links to disable it in my previous post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>2. There’s no “Parent directory” button any more! Surely a button to take you to the parent directory is one of the most important buttons an operating system can have? They saw fit to include a “back” button… so why ditch the Parent Directory button?</blockquote>
<p>It was replaced by breadcrumbs:</p>

<p><a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell</a> will restore the up button if you want it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>6. Search results don’t actually show where the files are located! This is essential information! Again, this is outrageous!</blockquote>
To see the path of the searched files, right click on the search window, go to <strong>
View</strong> and then select&nbsp;<strong>Details.</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>10. Punctuation is still extremely difficult to enter on a PC compared with a Mac. To type apostrophes, quotation marks, em dashes, en dashes, ellipses, etc. you have to use the numberpad</blockquote>
<p>That will depend on the keyboard you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>11. “Sort by name” is now no longer alphabetical! Windows seems to have adopted Apple’s crazy way of sorting files: it sorts files first according to their length and then alphabetically… although it only seems to do this when the filenames contain
 numbers. It absolutely drives me mad! I want alphabetical sorting back! I’ve spent the last 15 years working with an alphabetical system. Why should I have to change?</blockquote>
