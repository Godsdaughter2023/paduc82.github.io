    <title>N85 Invisible Memory Card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> idodik  say:</h3>
<h2>            N85 Invisible Memory Card</h2>
                    
<p>Yeah yeah, old phone, bla bla bla. However this has some serious problem here!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original problem I had with my N85 is that it used to delete entire directories of music when using the music player. Also, when I tried to select a ringtone it would search forever and find nothing, not even the inbuilt phone tones, and when I removed
 the memory card it suddenly found all the inbuilt phone tones.</p>
<p>I've tried resetting to factory settings but the problem was not solved (it was still stuck searching forever), so I reformatted my phone using *#7370# (without the memory card - it was out of the phone when I formatted it).</p>
<p>Now the memory card's only presence is when I press the power button and select the "Remove Memory Card" option: when I'm trying to save contacts into my memory card it won't recognize it and won't put it in the list, it doesn't see my contacts that are
 all in the memory card, it doesn't see the applications I installed in the memory card, it doesn't see the themes I installed in the memory card. And it STILL gets stuck when I try to select a ringtone.</p>
<p>Any advice? Lab, hard reset, anything?</p>

<p>The Nokia-branded cards are utter rubbish, get another one, I would recommend Sandisk. Back up your current card in your PC, if it can still read it and then restore to the new card. There is nothing wrong with your handset.</p>

<p>i am trying to get it working for quite some time now. i checked my windows updates, run the fixit tool, restarted my laptop many times, tried different language, different version(32/64), switched off my firewall and antivirus. nothing helped so far, i
 always get a error message similar to this one but with the number of error being 30033-1011(0). i really don't know what to do anymore and i need the office for my school work asap. my laptop is brand new so there is plenty o free space and my internet is
 working fine.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fblogs.technet.com%2fcfs-file.ashx%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles%2f00-00-00-74-72%2finserror.png" /></p>

<p>Hi Ondrej,<br />
<br />
I’d like to confirm if you downloaded Office 2016 via ODT.<br />
<br />
If yes, the error code 30029-1007 (0) occurs when you specify a relative path in the SourcePath of the configuration.xml. To work around this issue, please specify an absolute path (UNC or Local folder) in the SourcePath attribute of the configuration.xml file.<br />
Here is an article for your reference:<br />

<p>I installed it (or tried at least) through the install it button on the main page of my Office 365 account. It downloaded an .exe file that i run. As you suggested i then tried to install the ODT, but if i extract it to the folder i choose, it won't do it,even
 if the extraction goes through correctly, nothing (exept the ODT setup) is in that folder (i can see hidden files). Maybe it has something to do with the "read only" attribute that all my folders have by default and can't be changed?</p>

<p>Hi Ondrej,<br />
<br />
To install Office clients by using ODT, here are the steps:<br />
1. Download the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 2016 Deployment Tool</a>, after the download is completed, running the OfficeDeploymentTool.exe produces a Setup.exe and a configuration.xml file<br />
<br />
2. Edit the Configuration.xml with a word editor, here is a sample for the configuration.xml, you can edit it according to your requirement.<br />
<br />
&lt;Configuration&gt;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&lt;Add SourcePath="D:\odt\" OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Product&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;/Add&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/Configuration&gt;<br />
<br />
Here is an article about configuration.xml for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219426.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reference for Click-to-Run configuration.xml file</a><br />
<br />
3. Download the media:<br />
Open a command window and change the directory to the location of your setup.exe file. Next, run Setup.exe /download configuration.xml<br />
<br />
4.Install the software. <br />
In command window, run the following command to start the install: Setup.exe /configure configuration.xml<br />
<br />
If you encounter any problems during the process, please let us know.<br />
<br />

    <title>Excel external link to a file stored in Sharepoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brainzina  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel external link to a file stored in Sharepoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two Excel sheets that are used by me and two other people. One sheet does a VLOOKUP with data from the other sheet. So they are linked.</p>
<p>Both are stored in different Sharepoint document libraries. And that seems to become a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Sharepoint URL in the link dialog in Excel so should work on every computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04cb4e62-296d-49c5-9bd6-a772e70e6212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04cb4e62-296d-49c5-9bd6-a772e70e6212" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not work.</p>
<p>For the following explanations I will use file1 as the file with the link and file2 as the file that is the external reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open both files (it makes no difference which one first) and it says #REF in all VLOOKUP cells. In the link dialog I can click on open source then it jumpes to file2 but changes nothing. If I click on check link it tells me "not found" in the status column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open file1 (#REF in the cells), I open the link dialog and click on open source - it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the formulas it says the URL correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to do it that way? Or is there another way to get my setup working for all users?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Brainzina, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better assist you, could you please provide the following information to help better understand your situation?</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur to other files with the same external link setup? If you create a new one, does the issue occur? Do you use Excel application or Excel Online to create workbooks?</p>
<p>2. Are the 2 worksheets stored in 2 different document libraries in the same site collection? What is the site collection template? Group site or other site template?</p>
<p>3. Screenshots:</p>
<p>a. Screenshots about "it says #REF in all VLOOKUP cells" in the scenarios you described.</p>
<p>b. A screenshot about "If I click on check link it tells me "not found" in the status column".</p>
<p>4. To compare and contrast, in the scenario that works,
</p>
<p>Please provide some related screenshots about how you perform the steps;
</p>
<p>Please also provide detailed steps and related screenshots about how you encounter the issue.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Your operating system version and Office version.</p>
<p>For Office version, you can find it by clicking File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information. Please capture a screenshot of the entire information under Product Information. And please mask your
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Tina!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>It also occurs on other files as well but not exactly the same. I just created to new ones with the same sort of linking and in the same document libraries. I use the Excel application on a Windows 10 computer. The #REF is the same but
 the errors in the link dialog are different. See below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> It is the same site collection. The template is the classic experience (STS#0).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3a and 3b.</strong> (Screenshot from the new file I created to answer your question 1. I also inserted the formular. In the screenshot I pressed Check Status and it says status: OK)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06688ca6-9013-4586-81d8-da6bb5ed4c9d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06688ca6-9013-4586-81d8-da6bb5ed4c9d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Screenshot from the original file. Here I also pressed status and it says status: not found)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94ddd654-d649-4fb3-b389-efc79fb668de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94ddd654-d649-4fb3-b389-efc79fb668de" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>The difference between the test file and the original one is also during opening.</p>
<p>On the original file I get the following messages:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0001976-958e-4adb-9bca-faf23470602f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0001976-958e-4adb-9bca-faf23470602f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on Next it just opens the file with the #REF error.</p>
<p>I I click edit links I get the link dialog with the not found error</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/599b2fdb-6d63-463d-98c8-96b20c5bfe7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/599b2fdb-6d63-463d-98c8-96b20c5bfe7e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on open source in this dislog it opens the right file and everything works. I used VBA to automate this opening process and then everything is fine.
</p>
<p>But if the second file is already open it does not find it correctly and I connot get it to work unless I close it and click open source in the dialog. If I click open source and the second file is already open it brings it to front but the first file does
 not change find the data.</p>
<p>That's the same on my test files and the original files.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>Windows 10 x64 all updates are installed</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/318f5397-8f74-4235-9135-b9cc1b3af7af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/318f5397-8f74-4235-9135-b9cc1b3af7af" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Brainzina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on your description, the external links update correctly if the second workbook is closed via VBA code and&nbsp; manual operation. If anything misunderstood, please clarify it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, to better assist you, could you please also provide the below information to help better understand your situation?</p>
<p>1. Do you mean classic team site template by "The template is the classic experience (STS#0)"? If not, please clarify it. Some related screenshots about how you create it will be helpful.</p>
<p>2. Does the issue occur to other workbooks in a different site collection?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. It appears the external links include data in the table from another workbook. To try reproducing the same environment, please provide detailed steps and related screenshots about how you create the 2 workbooks. As you posted the query in English community,
 if possible, could you please provide both formulas in English and German?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Tina!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The external links update correctly if:</p>
<p>- both are closed at the beginning</p>
<p>- I open the first one&nbsp;</p>
<p>- in the link dialog (that opens while opening because of the missing links) I click on "edit links" and then click "open source"</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the only way. I bypassed the clicking with VBA now and that works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. STS#0 is the classic team website. I go to SP admin, create a new site collection and then create a new document library. Do you really need screenshots?</p>
<p>2. On other site collections the issue occurs the same as with my test files as described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution with bypassing the link dialog when opening is fine for me now. So for me this case is closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

</p><p>There was an article release on&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">August 31, 2016 which advised:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">New site collection limit</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">As more and more teams embrace the breadth of capabilities offered in SharePoint Online across team sites, Office 365 Video and portal sites, their content storage requirements are growing. To address this,
 we will increase the SharePoint Online site collection storage limit in the coming weeks from 1 TB to&nbsp;<span>25 TB</span>. This increased limit will be immediately reflected in the official&nbsp;SharePoint Online boundaries and limits&nbsp;article. Note: this is an increase
 to the capacity potential of individual site collections -&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2016/08/31/new-capabilities-in-sharepoint-online-team-sites-including-integration-with-office-365-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">New Capabilities

<h2>            Windows 7 - Access 2010 - Error Message&#58; &#34;You are logged on with non-Administrative privileges. System DSNs could not be created or modified&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a new Data Source to Link to&nbsp;the Database.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On the Access 2010 External Data tab in the Import &amp; Link group, I click the ODBC Database button.</p>
<p>The Get External Data - ODBC Database Dialog Box opens.</p>
<p>I select the "Import the source data into a new table in the current database." option and click the OK button.<br />
The "Select Data Source" Dialog Box pops up.<br />
I then select the "Machine Data Source" tab and then click the "New..." button.</p>
<p>An error message box pops up with the following message: "You are logged on with non-Administrative privileges. System DSNs could not be created or modified".</p>
<p>My user id is an Administrator account, local profile.</p>
<p>I have Full permissions on the folder that contains the database that I have open.</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Ultimate installed on this computer. All updates are current.</p>
<p>Also I created a desktop shortcut to start Access 2010. When I right click this icon and chose Properties, The Microsoft Access 2010 Properties Dialog Box pops up. There is a button entitled "Advanced..." on the Shortcut tab. When I click this button the
 "Advanced properties" Dialog Box pops up.</p>
<p>It reads: "Choose the advanced properties you want for this shortcut" with two Checkbox choices below:</p>
<p>1. Run as administrator</p>
<p>2. Run in separate memory space</p>
<p>The "Run in separate memory space" is checked, however, both choices are grayed out so I am unable to select the "Run as administrator" option.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What do I need to do to fix this problem?</p>

            <p>It is not a problem if you are the only one using the machine (and thus the User DSN).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you really have to create a system dsn for the several users on the machine:</p>
<p>Outside of Access, find this file in Windows Explorer:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe</p>
<p>Right-click &gt; Run as Administrator. You can now create a system dsn that you can later use in Access.</p>

    <title>Conditional Formatting over a series of cells - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kungfumanatee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Formatting over a series of cells</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 63 rows of data with a total column at the bottom.&nbsp; I'm trying to find a way to make the total cell change color whenever it meets a certain criteria (i.e. if &gt;50 the cell turns yellow).&nbsp; However, I need this rule to apply whenever 7 CONSECUTIVE cells
 (of the 63) meet this condition.&nbsp; Not the total 63, nor just a certain range.&nbsp; It has to be a running count.&nbsp; So any time 7 cells in a row equal or exceed a certain number I want the condition to be applied.&nbsp; Is this even possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What condition? Is the&nbsp;<em>Total</em> cell supposed to change color? Are the 7 cells supposed to change color? Is the last cell of the 7 cells supposed to change color? I'm sorry, but I'm unclear on what you want to actually happen and this affects the complexity
 of the formula.</p>

            I'm thinking the easiest way is if the TOTAL cell changes color.&nbsp; As long as the TOTAL cell will change color again if the condition is no longer met.&nbsp; Hope that helps!

            <p>With your numbers starting in A2 (going down to A64) with the total in A65, select A65 and create a conditional formatting rule based upon the following formula,</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT(--(SUBTOTAL(9, OFFSET($A$2, ROW($1:$57)-1,0,7,1))&gt;50))</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will count every time the sum of every possible 7 row range from A2:A8 to A58:A64 exceeds 50. FALSE equates to a zero and TRUE is defined as anything that is not FALSE, so anytime at least one 7 row range of cells totals more than 50, the formula will
 be regarded as TRUE.</p>

</p><p>This formula works great thanks!&nbsp; One quick question.&nbsp; Is there any way to make this work so that if rows 2-8 are true, but rows 3-9 are FALSE that it will uncolor the cell?&nbsp; I'm using this as a warning so that in any 7 day period if someone is approaching
 a number too high the cell will alert me.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>Again, I'm unclear on the scope of what you are asking as the TRUE/FALSE criteria was truncated at the first two. Is this an even/odd row pair matching, e.g.</p>

</p>
<p>A6:A12 but not A6:A13</p>

<p>
</p><p>... or it it row by row like this,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A2:A8 but not A3:A9</p>
<p><span>A3:A9 but not A4:A10</span><br />
</p>
<p>A4:A10 but not A5:A11</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Addendum:</em> what happens with <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
A58:A64 when the next sequence can only possibly have 6 rows to total not 7?</span></p>

<h2>            Pre-2017 &#64;hotmail.com emails have disappeared</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of my emails have disappeared from my hotmail account (which is still a @hotmail.com one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that they can get automatically deleted if your account has been inactive for a year – which would also mean any new emails being sent to you would bounce back – and you switched from @hotmail to @outlook. However, I am not sure if this
 applies to my case as, although I have not used the account in a couple of years, it does not seem to be inactive because I have been receiving emails again since November 2017 until now. Also, I never switched from @hotmail to @outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what has happened there, but it would be good to recover the old emails and contacts. Could anyone please help me with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

            Dear Alex,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />If you remember title of the emails that are missing or email address or even domain, try use search. In this article you will find all the suggestions and tips how to search for specific email <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search-mail-and-people-in-outlook-com-88108edf-028e-4306-b87e-7400bbb40aa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you will find those emails, you will see in which folder they are. Also, please check all the folders, especially Archive <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/working-with-message-folders-in-outlook-com-6bb0723a-f39f-4a8d-bb3f-fab5dcc2510a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/workin...</a>
<br />
<br />If you cannot find them at all, than maybe they were deleted and are no longer in recovery deleted items. In order to retrieve the emails that were deleted more than 30 days you can use Email Recovery App <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380447?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/o...</a> First insert the Microsoft Account from which you want to retrieve emails (These instructions better to perform on PC in browser)
<br />For the new Outlook.com
<br />1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />2. Click the gear icon at the upper right side of the screens then click view full setting.
<br />3. Select Mail &amp;gt; Customize actions, then click “Get Add-ins” and hit save.
<br />4. In “Inbox” folder, click an email (if you don’t have an email, please try to send a test email to your own email account, then once you received the test email, please click on it.)
<br />5. Click the “Gift” icon (Get Add-ins)
<br />6. Type and enter “Email Recovery” 
<br />7. In the search result, under the “Email Recovery”, click “Add” button.
<br />8. Click “X” icon to exit.
<br />9. Go back to “Customize actions” page, click “Email Recovery” and hit save.
<br />10. Again, in “Inbox” folder, click an email, then the “Email Recovery” icon will be visible now, and click on it.
<br />11. Recover both Recoverable Items and Purges.
<br />12. Please do not do anything while the recovery is in progress.
<br />13. Once it’s finished, a folder will appear on the left pane which contains the emails that you recovered.
<br />
<br />Please note that there is no guarantee that those emails will be restored as it depends on server status and what happened to the storage space where they were stored.
<br />
<br />I hope these helped to recover your emails you’re looking for.

<p>Hi Bridgetk,<br />
<br />
What are the troubleshooting procedures you've done on the phone? Have you tried removing the battery of the phone and just let it be for around 5 - 10 seconds? If you haven't done it yet, kindly do this one first. And then, observe what will happen on the
 phone. Keep us posted regarding this concern of yours.</p>

            I see. If that is the case, what we can suggest is to have the phone physically check with our technician. You can bring it to the nearest care center within your place for assessment. Check this link:
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/</a> to find out which one is near you.

    <title>Navigation Pane settings on Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Navigation Pane settings on Word 2016</h2>
                    On Word 2016, I want the Navigation Pane to always remain at the smallest width and to always be set at Results. It won't Save to that - keeps going back to wider widths and defaults to Headings. Does anyone know how to fix this?

            Hi Phil,
<br />
<br />It will have the width last used. You can make it show results by invoking it using Ctrl+F for Find.
<br />
<br />Anything more is going to involve macros.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

            Hi Chris - Thanks for your prompt reply!&nbsp; Alas, it doesn't save the width and designation (Headings, Pages, Results) that I last used.&nbsp; It automatically reverts to Headings (I want Results) and to a wider width than I want the Navigation Pane to have since
 I often have several documents open at once.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've only had this problem since getting a new computer which came with Office 2016.&nbsp; Utterly baffling!&nbsp; Phil

            I've never had that setting (which tab) stick. If you use Ctrl+F to display the pane it will be in the Results tab. This is instead of checking it under the View tab.

            BTW, if you start using Word's Built-In headings, you'll find the Headings tab very valuable in long documents.

<p>To ensure that the Navigation pane has the width you want, make sure that only one document window is open as you (re-)size the pane. Then immediately exit and restart Word (which should write the width correctly to the Windows registry).</p>
<p>

            Alas, that doesn't help.&nbsp; I open the document, change the width to the narrowest setting, save the document, exit the document, then re-open the document and the width has reverted to the wide width again.&nbsp; I'm not sure why this solution seems to work
 for everyone but me!&nbsp; I'm guessing some setting has been changed but I have no idea how to figure out what it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I'm getting this same behavior - the navigation pane's width resets to the default size every time Word starts.&nbsp; If I resize it and then open or create a document while Word is still open, the new one has my desired size, but whenever I close all instances
 of Word, the very next time I use Word it has the default width again.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>I've had Word 2016 (Office365) for some time, and this behavior is new.&nbsp; Maybe an update broke it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edited to add that the same thing has happened to a coworker also using Office365, so it's not just my PC.</p>

    <title>SharePoint invites and sharing links expiring - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint invites and sharing links expiring</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a SharePoint subsite owner, and I am attempting to give access to a large group of both internal and external users (about 150 users of each type need to collaborate and share).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send an invite or sharing link (no autonomous links used, only authenticated users can access), symptomatically, it appears as if there is a timeout of some sort that causes those invites and sharing links to expire when they are not accepted and/or
 acted on within a timeout period that I have not been able to figure out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our SharePoint Global admins have checked available settings and there do not appear to be any that control invites and link expiration timeouts, except for when anonymous links are used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a timeout for the case of an invite or a sharing link not getting accepted and/or acted on within a defined period of time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, what is the timeout and is it configurable, either globally or at site / subsite levels?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for feedback, anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ed</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>Ed McConnell,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us, we'd like to help you troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>According to your description, it seems the issue happens to the link type is People in your organization, People with existing access and Specific people. (If not, please feel free to
 clarify the situation)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would appreciate if you let us know following information:</p>
<p>1.When the issue happens and when people try accessing the link, what error message do they get? Could you please hsare a screenshot about the error?</p>
<p>2.How long will the link get expired? We would like to test from our side as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Hi, because of the clean up that I do, I’ve deleted the handful of screenshots that I was able to get users to send me, so I will need to be more diligent going forward for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created groups with different privilege sets on 4 different subsites that I am working on where I have set up the sites to have different types of content. One site is a collaboration site where all users, except for me as an owner, are assigned the
 standard contribute privilege set so that documents can be jointly edited. On another site I have a view only profile where I place documents that I want to only be viewable online. I have set up another site for upload of files and another for download of
 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user community that I’m working with includes:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Users that have Microsoft ult**us.onmicrosoft.com accounts (on the FedRamp) GCC , and a non-microsoft **sat.com account.</li><li>Users that have a non-microsoft **sat.com account.</li><li>Users that have a Microsoft glo**.com account on the commercial O365 cloud</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>My approach to deployment is to<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>include “everyone except external users” in each of the 4 non-owner groups (1 per sub-site), then</li><li>include add all of the globecomm.com users to each for the 4 non-owner groups, then</li><li>if I can’t get 1 or 2 to work, use a sharing link to a top level folder on each site and send links to **sat.com or glo**.com addresses, using the “specific people with this link method”<span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above seems to work or not work universally. I started deploying using this method about 3 weeks ago and I’m pretty sure that some users have not yet clicked on the links yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first personally observed the issue when I sent a sharing link to my **sat.com account that had expired as soon as I sent it, and when I investigated, noticed a 3hr offset in timestamp of the error message compared to my local time, which I eventually
 found was a timezone setting on my ult**us.onmicrosoft.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will follow up again as I get more feedback from users and collect some screenshots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the questions that you have asked, it seems that you are indicating that when an invite or (non-anonymous) sharing link is sent, there should be no lifetime constraint for that invite or sharing link, even if it is days or weeks. Can you please confirm
 this to be the case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</span><span>Ed McConnell,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for sharing the detailed information with us.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes we can only set exparation time for the link type "Anyone with link" as it can be set in SharePoint admin center or OneDrive admin center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned that you use the link type "specific people" and the link expired as soon as you send it.
</p>
<p>We'd like to confirm that if you use
<strong>private mode of browsers</strong>, does the link work? Can you access the shared file/folder normally?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Usually, if we can set a exparation time for
</span><span>shar</span><span>ing link, the time would be
</span><span>at least one day. </span></p>
<p><span>So for further troubleshooting,
</span><span>we would still need to know the detailed error message when the sharing link doesn't work. Please feel free to share the related screenshot with us when you get it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In addition, we will send you a private message to collect some information to troubleshoot the issue, please access the PM via this link:
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox"><span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Tina, the private link did not work see partial capture of that message after the below comment on capturing the invite and sharing link failures (when I add users to a group to give them access to a site and a button to click for that purpose in an email),
 and when I create a sharing link to a folder on those sites when adding to a group does not work, due to them being "external" from the standpoint of microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separate question for understanding: if a user cannot be added to a group to give access to a site, after a sharing link to a folder is provided and that user has authenticated based on his email and a token exchange, can I then add that user to a group
 to give him/her access to the site so that he/she can navigate within the site or sites based on group membership?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Thanks, more comments below on my operating environment:</p>
<p>

<p>
What I will need to do is get someone who experiences the issue to work with me to collect the necessary info. But I will try to do so. Unfortunately, I don’t have a list of people who have experienced the issue, as the issue appeared to not have a pattern,
 due to the schedule and randomness of free time to test for the group of people who have other things to do. What I tended to do, before realizing there were unidentified issues, was send a 3 invites or sharing links to 100 people each, depending on whether
 I know that those people have Microsoft accounts or not.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I send invites by adding the list of individuals to a group (of which they may or may not already be a member) when I believe the individuals have Microsoft accounts to give them access to the SharePoint site, but when I believe they are external from the perspective
 of MicroSoft, I send them a sharing link to a folder on the SharePoint instead. Both using copy/paste of a list of up to 100 names.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I normally send the link from SharePoint and I didn’t realize that the same link could be copy pasted into an email and forwarded to a list of people when “specific people” is selected. I had assumed that a unique link per person is used. Can you confirm that
 I can copy / paste a “specific people” sharing link and send it separately to a distribution list ?</p>

<p>Sorry Tina, in my last reply I did not address the condition where I personally experienced an immediate failure on creating a test (don't remember whether it was an invite after adding / re-adding myself to a group for access to one of the sites or whether
 it was a sharing link to a folder on one of those sites).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On receiving the email, I clicked on it within a minute or so of sending it and got the expired message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I looked closely at the expired message I noticed that it was 3hr off from my local time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my laptop time zone to pacific time and repeated the test and was able to get to what I was attempting to access as a test</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put my timezone back to east coast, logged into my O365 account that I was using to check my settings and found that I could not view or edit the time zone setting on my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked with our global admin and we fumbled a bit, but after selecting an alternate method to get to that screen (don't remember which method that was, because we were fumbling through investigating it) but on accessing that screen via the alternate method,
 I was able to view the setting, which, without editing it was correctly set to east coast time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that the sharing link worked without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted since that time, to recreate the condition by changing my timezone setting on my laptop, but have not been able to create it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had my O365 account for quite a while, and on starting to use it, I don't remember ever specifically viewing or setting the timezone but I can't be certain, because I might not have ever sent myself a sharing link, until I started troubleshooting the
 issue that was reported by new users when I started learning about SharePoint sites and setting them up in a Site Owner role.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe that I probably didn't go through the steps of configuring the timezone specifically for me when this account was first set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that this may be as a result of getting our company business account access set up and this business account, more than a year after I had started using Office 365 with a personal home account, and that as a result of having a personal home
 account (multiple ones actually) when I, after using my home account for many months, was set up with a business account, that original set up process for the business account did not force me to specifically set the timezone for that account, and since is
 was not set specifically, there was some default setting being used that caused the weirdness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes me think that since we are introducing a lot on first time Office 365 users to Office 365, that some of the issues may be due to some part of the initial setup for those users creating a similar condition for them (we have users located all over
 the world in many time zones and some users set their laptop to display local time, while others set their laptops to display GMT or UTC, while others may set their laptop to display the timezone where their family lives since many of our users are providing
 field support on-site at customer locations around the world and it is convenient to view times at home rather than local time at our customer location)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I haven't been able to re-create the condition for myself, I'm suspicious that initial set up of timezone for users may be sometimes the reason for the timeout indications.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>Ed McConnell,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We read through the information you provided, regarding the 2 questions you mentioned, please kindly check the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the first question:</p>
<p>After the user has access to the Share folder after entering his credential, it is available to add him to the group and he will be able to access the group site. But before you add the
 user to the group, he can only access the shared folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the second question:</p>
<p>We also test it from our side, copy and paste the "specific people" type link of a file/folder, add it to an email and send the email to a distribution list. People in the distribution all
 get the email, but when they click the link in the email and try accessing the file/folder, it says this item might not exist or is no longer available. So this sharing link doesn't work for the people in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before sending the email, there is also a notification saying that<span style="font-style: italic"> Only people with the existing access can view the file/folder</span>.
</p>
<p>If there is a user in the distribution list who already has access to the file/folder, then he is able to access the file/folder via the sharing link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, thanks a lot for letting us know the issue cannot be reproduced after you set up timezone for the users. This would be helpful for other community members who come across this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to let us know if you have any concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>What we are finding, with addition of new users to our tenant, is that we had expected that having them be part of the "all users except external" group inside of a group for sites and subsites that we want to give them access to, would result them being
 able to view those sub sites on their office.com landing page, once they successfully log in and authenticate, but this is not happening. Instead they are only seeing their private area on first logging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also are finding that adding their accounts specifically to groups in advance of their first login, does not change what they see (from a navigation standpoint) on their first login. This means that our attempts to pre-deploy the group membership in bulk,
 in advance of their first attempting to log into office 365 does not result in their being able to see on their first login the sites and subsites that they have been given access to via "all users except external" as well as a specific addition to groups
 in advance of their first login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this means is that we seem to need to wait for them to first login, and then we need to specifically add them individually to each group before they can view the sites and subsites that they can navigate to on their next login (after clicking on the
 button in the invite email that is sent). Not sure if the words in parenthesis are necessary, and if on adding them to a group they will see and be able to navigate to the site / subsite on their next logout / login..... Can you advise what to expect regarding
 the need to use an invite email in order to first be able to see and navigate?</p>

<p>Hi Ed McConnell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your findings with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Everyone except external users" is a special SharePoint group. When adding a new user to Office 365 organization, the user will automatically become a member of "Everyone except external
 users".</p>
<p>After we invite "Everyone except external users" group to a private site, the user will be able to access the site.</p>
<p>However, it is expected that the site won't automatically display on user's Office 365 home page(office.com landing page).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually <span style="font-weight: bold">
Frequent sites</span> will display in Office 365 home page(on the bottom next to OneDrive).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So after the user receives the invite email and click the link to access the site, you may let the user Follow the site/subsite, then the site will appear in SharePoint home page&gt;Following
 site </p>
<p>(let user click
<p>(<a href="https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx</a>)
</p>
<p>Or after the user visits the site for many times, the site becomes a frequently visit site, it will show in the user's Office 365 home page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, as we mainly focus on one issue in each thread, If you have further concern about the issue, we kindly suggest you post a new thread for it, so that we can focus on it and help
 you do further troubleshooting. Doing this will also help other community members who have the same question seek out the thread more quickly.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This clears things up, and helps us understand the reason that attempts to do bulk deployment in advance of users first accessing sharepoint / office 365 was a big piece of our issue, since, in advance of first accessing office 365, it was not possible for
 them to receive an invite email as a result of them not having first accessed office 365 so that they could receive the invite email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that the invite email needs to be sent after users have first accessed a site and their account and authenticated appropriately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible feature change recommendations for a change that might help others in a similar situation where a bulk deployment of new users condition exists:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Develop a means that permits invite emails to be sent to "external" emails so that once the initial setup and authentication for the new user has occurred, the intended site navigation is in place, and/or</li><li>Develop a means to automatically send an invite email for each sharepoint site that he user has been given access to, at the time time of initial access to office 365, so that navigation so that users are able to see those sites / subsite within sharepoint
 at that time.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with some of the sharing links expiring, I believe, was that our (my) understanding of the distinction between links included in invite emails (only sent to internal O365 email accounts), and links included in folder or file sharing emails (can
 be sent to both internal O365 email accounts and external to O365 email accounts which can be copy pasted into an email crafted by us) was not well understood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, while we (I) was learning about how to use / administer subsites that I am an owner of, on our site collection, in a bulk deployment situation, not only of the subsites, but also new users, the different methods that were attempted to be used,
 created a great amount of confusion as various methods were used to give access to new users in different states of deployment of their O365 accounts for the primary purpose of completing some security training documents that all users of UltiSat information
 systems are required to do on first being hired, and periodically after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in my case, the training requirement and the new user setup in O365 (in bulk) for both internal and external (at the time, or maybe forever for contractors and suppliers) caused quite a bit of confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, we still haven't resolved the link expiring condition, but due to the confusion and our (my) understanding of how things work in a combined bulk new user plus new subsite deployment environment, I would suggest closing the link expiring support
 issue and I will re-open a support case if the condition recurs in a non-bulk, less confusing environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for you diligent response to my questions.</p>

            <p>Earlier I read that there would be an ISO so you could do a clean install.</p>
<p>Thinking about what you have quoted, is the ISO program going to be included with the upgrade including the unique key for that computer?&nbsp; This would need some instructions to be included for the general public., those not included in the Insider Program.</p>
<p>Part of my thinking is because my wife got the reserve notice today on her laptop with her updates even though she should have had it 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; I told her not to upgrade right away until we see how things are going.&nbsp; I may let her load a bunch of her
 stuff on one of my test laptops to see if she thinks it is OK.&nbsp; She was a Fortran programmer and one of the first females to go through a computer class at San Diego State.</p>

            <p>Based on the way a current&nbsp;ISO for Build 10240 works (I created my own) I suspect that there may not be any unique Product Keys issued to those who upgrade from a qualifying Windows OS.&nbsp; If this is the case, Microsoft can make the same&nbsp;ISO available for
 download to everyone, as they do today for Windows 8.1.&nbsp; But for Windows 10 no unique Product Key will be required for those who have upgraded from a qualifying OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this will happen is uncertain, as making the upgrade only available via Windows Update might reduce the overall bandwidth needs for the rollout of Windows 10 to the Public, compared to just telling everyone to download the ISO on the same day.&nbsp; They
 could produce an ISO from the Windows Update files instead (which is how ISO's for Build 10240 have been made) but I have doubts that they will do it that way.&nbsp; I think they will make the ISO available soon, as not every Windows Update upgrade will succeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only those with an activated Windows 7 or 8 could use a Windows 10 ISO to <em>
upgrade </em>to an auto-activated Windows 10.&nbsp; All upgrades could use the same Product Key (per Windows version) which is how Build 10240 works today.&nbsp; For anyone without a qualifying, activated Windows 7 or 8 install, they would have to purchase a Retail Product
 Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a computer has been successfully activated with Windows 10, it can be clean-installed using a Windows 10 install disk or bootable install flash drive.&nbsp; The hardware has been registered, during the upgrade, as licensed for Windows 10, based on the prior
 activated OS.&nbsp; This is how it is working today with a Build 10240 install disk/ISO.&nbsp; A clean install auto-activates as soon as an Internet connection is made from a computer that has at some time activated an upgrade install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As is the case today, hardware changes, such as a new motherboard or hard disk, still leave enough identifiable hardware to not deactivate Windows.&nbsp; I have replaced my motherboard and video card at the same time and not lost Windows activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Software License Terms allow for transfer to another device if it is removed from the first device.&nbsp; Without a unique Product Key, I don't know how that will be accomplished, although I also do not know how it is done today even with a Product Key.</p>

            <p>ISO could be provided to MSDN subscribers after 29th July.</p>
<p>But the FAQ was for those who will be upgrading from Genuine Windows 7, 8.1 PC. So once they upgrade to Windows 10, they'll be able to create their own installation media like a USB drive or DVD that is an ISO. SO that they could do a clean install also
 on the same PC.</p>
<p>Yes instructions will be provided once Free upgrade is available to public for creating ISO.</p>
<p>Yes, one can wait a bit instead of doing the upgrade right away.</p>

            <p>Is this a silly question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have upgraded and created the Windows 10 installation media, using the facility provided within the upgrade, then why go to all the trouble of downloading the ISO as well. Surely the contents of the ISO, are identical to the media created using the
 provided utility?</p>

<p>As you have already removed everything do a soft reset. Dial *#7370# followed by 12345 the phone will resort to 'out of the box condition' . Restore your contacts and calendar ONLY !!! NOT settings as these may be causing the problem, then set up your phone
 manually, including going into messaging-options-settings-other-memory in use E/F (Mass Memory) NOT C (phone memory) Also install any application you can on E/F and clear the privacy data in phone browser on a regular basis. This will sort your problem.</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<p><span>I run Windows Defender only on my Win 10.&nbsp; Occasional checks with an independent on demand scanner to see if Defender missed anything have not found any malware issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But other users prefer a third party antivirus program which should disable the real time protection component of Defender.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you curtail the number of antivirus programs you’re using and see if that helps.&nbsp; Be sure you run the appropriate removal tools for such programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/2bcb53f7-7ab4-4ef9-ab3a-6aebfa322f75" title="This document is intended for assisting those using Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.

<p>Hello there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've been browsing, with no luck, a lot of folders on my 5800 phone trying to locate some ringtone files. The thing is that they do appear when assigning sounds in the "personalize profile" option but I cannot locate them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the files I can see on profiles but cannot locate are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>optimus.acc</p>
<p>marbles.acc</p>
<p>glare.acc</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where are those files located??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help!&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</p>

    <title>2 Version of Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zs4800  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 Version of Skype</h2>
                    <p>Dear all:<br />
<br />
As I recently activated my Skype for business account when I upgraded my office to office 365 ... however, I realized this version is different from the version that I previously installed in our laptop for a while and I clashed whenever I opened the old Skype...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I started to remove the whole office 2010 and see how things going, the old skype looks better but I still cannot use it even if I typed in some short words or it's NOT shown on the screen ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pls advise whether I should reinstall the old one, or just choose ONE to use and which one is more suitable for a casual user like me, thx</p>
<p>
</p><p>BR<br />

                    <p>Skype has an incorrect birthdate for me and thinks I was born in 2005, not 1945.&nbsp; As a result it seeks parental permission for me to log in.&nbsp; When I try to correct the birthdate, it says it needs a credit card and immediately the following error message
 appears:&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Error</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try that again. Something happened on our end.
</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem persists, please contact customer support.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If Skype would look, it already has a credit card, and has had it for a long time.</p>
