            Hi Stewart
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Because Linx tablets tend to have micro-USB ports, you will likely have to get a micro OTG USB adapter, a USB A thumb drive, go to a work computer download and make a bootable copy of Windows 10 1607 and reinstall Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Micro OTG USB adapter
<br />Micro USB to USB OTG Adapter Cable CNE94281: Cell ... - Amazon.com

<br />
<br />Make a bootable copy:
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1607  from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1607 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

            Hi Jose, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a Product Key  and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Can&#39;t Install Update to Version 1709, Can&#39;t Keep it From - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim soholt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Install Update to Version 1709, Can&#39;t Keep it From Trying to Install</h2>
                    <p>I have tried everything I could find. Clean boot, restarting the update services, installing from the Media Library, uninstalling the Windows Update Assistant (it reinstalled), even reinstalling Windows. 1709 keeps trying to install, but it never succeeds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone give me advice that is *NOT* one of the things I have already tried? I am not kidding, I don't want to read some so-called "expert" telling me to do the things I have just stated I have already done. I've read enough of these things to realize
 that this is the usual response to a question and I am very much not in the mood. So again, I HAVE DONE the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 1. Tried to install after a clean boot</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2. Tried to install after resetting the update services</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3. Tried to install a download from the Windows Media Library</p>
<p>&nbsp; 4. Tried uninstalling the Windows Update Assistant and telling Windows Updates to ignore this update</p>
<p>&nbsp; 5. Reinstalled Windows and run through the updates from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVERY TIME it either gets to a certain point in the final update (usually 82%) and then freezes, it just shuts down and resets to the previous installation when I restart the machine, or Windows Update Assistant fails. The last time it gave me error code
0xc1900107, but I'm not sure if that's the code it's always given me when Windows Update Assistant failed.</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better manage this thread about Windows 10, we'd like to know if you still need assistance on your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, we'd recommend performing an in-place upgrade on your device to facilitate your concern. This essentially reinstalls Windows 10 through the use of an installation media. Using this process will install the latest iteration of Windows 10 version 1709
 on your device. To do this, <span>we'd recommend checking the post of<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Andre Da Costa</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>on this<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">link</a><span>.

            I attempted to reinstall windows. I could not upgrade from the flash drive, and I could not install to my hard drive, getting the message "Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can
 only be installed to GPT disks." on every partition.

<p>I just figured out how to run an upgrade directly from the ISO I downloaded. The installation stalled out at around 50%, with the screen going black except for an unmoving cursor. At this point I'm wondering if I can get a reinstallation medium for Windows
 7 and upgrade again from there. </p>

<p>Thank you for updating us.&nbsp; The error message that you've received that pertains to GPT and MBR is usually related to the process of installing Windows by booting from an installation media. The in-place upgrade procedure that we've shared above, lets users
 reinstall Windows 10 directly from your desktop which usually does not involve setting up a partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've received the error code&nbsp;0xC1900101 - 0x40017 while performing an in-place upgrade, we'd recommend resetting your device. Performing this procedure usually rectify corrupted files that resulted to the error and reverts your device back to the manufacturer's
 default configuration. To do this, we'd recommend checking the post of Andre Da Costa on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-using-reset-this-pc/6f6335fc-8d15-4598-af16-033d1d8c16bf">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This procedure usually wipes data on your device. In Windows 10, we've provided you the option to keep your files. Screenshots are also available in the article to aid you in completing the process. In case you'd like to secure data prior to the procedure,
 you can perform the steps posted on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Once done, you can proceed with the download of the Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some computers, Restore factory settings option is available that lets you reinstall the version of Windows that came with your device when you purchased it. This process takes you back to Windows 7 or 8/8.1 from Windows 10 if they originally came with
 it. </p>

<p>Resetting restored me to version 1607 with the Windows Update Assistant still there. Running the Windows Update Assistant caused the computer to hang on a black screen at some point; when I turned it off and turned it back on again, it restored to the previous
 version (1607). I don't seem to be able to restore factory settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will advise on reverting to Windows 7 and re-upgrading when I get a chance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To better manage this thread about Windows 10, we'd like to know if you still need assistance on your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, we'd recommend performing an in-place upgrade on your device to facilitate your concern. This essentially reinstalls Windows 10 through the use of an installation media. Using this process will install the latest iteration of Windows 10 version 1709

    <title>How to save View settings for Windows Firewall with Advanced Security - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to save View settings for Windows Firewall with Advanced Security</h2>
                    I found it impossible to save the column customization and the window size for WFAS, and for other MMC apps, e.g. the Services. Every time I restart those MMC apps, all the View settings are reset. I can't keep it maximized or keep the columns customized.<br />
<br />
I like WFAS a lot because it's the lightest and never causes a trouble. But this visual imperfection really bothers my frequent use of it. Could someone help with this? Thank you!<br />

<h2>            Error 0x207 when using MS remote desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use Microsoft LABs using&nbsp; pre-set "filename.rdp" files in Microsoft Remote Desktop Ver 10.1.7 on macOS: Sierra 10.12.6 but get an error 0x207.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically my macOS version is the latest one and also my Microsoft Remote Desktop version is the latest one but after establishing the connection it returns the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should run rdp files which is generated randomly by Microsoft leaning LABs at the beginning of signing to any LAB and that rdp file launches the Microsoft Remote Desktop automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it makes sense. please let me know if there is any solution to fix the 0x207 error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks guys,</p>

</p><p>It is possible that the issue you're experiencing is caused by misconfigured settings with Remote Desktop. Since your Windows question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience
 on TechNet. Please post your question in the <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=winserverTS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet Windows 10 forum</a></strong>.</p>

    <title>Network driver update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> utterlybaffled  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network driver update.</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new desk top computer a couple of weeks ago - built by the shop, not&nbsp; proprietary brand. Windows 7 worked fine. I upgraded to Windows 10 and couldn't access the net - apparently an ethernet cable was unplugged. It wasn't because when I went back
 to Windows 7 everything worked again. The shop suggested I update the drivers, but according to Windows there are no updates available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Where do I go from here? I'm happy with Windows 7, but obviously this isn't a long term solution.</p>

<p>Looks like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/a182143/saw-that-one-coming-achievement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">trueachievements</a>&nbsp;states you will need to wait for the cut-scene at the end of the credits before this achievement will pop for you. If you haven't done that yet, I suggest giving it a try and then letting us know if that worked for you.<br /><br />If it doesn't work, or you have already watched all the way through the end credits and the cut scene prior to me posting this, then give it about 48 hours after you should have earned the achievement. If you don't see it pop then, please post back! We'll want to work on getting you the gamerscore you've earned. :3</p>

            <p>Well, that's no good! I have a few more suggestions to see if we might be able to see if this achievement isn't working at all, or if it's only on your account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you been able to try it on another account on the same Xbox?</li>
<li>Have you attempted it on a different internet connection (be it on another console at someone else's house, or brought yours to a friends)?</li>
<li>Have you tried deleting your saved data and starting the game over?</li>
</ul>
<p>Trying one of these, if you haven't already, may force that achievement to pop once you attempt it again.<br /><br />Give any of those a try and post back your results. Hopefully these will help get you the achievement you've earned. :)</p>

<p>I see that you have tried it at a friend's house. Have you tried deleting the save data as well? Doing that and starting the game over would be the last step I have for you to see if we can get that to pop. Please do post back and let us know how that works. :D </p>

    <title>Building a new rig to transfer Windows 10 but not sure if it&#39;s OEM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas cave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Building a new rig to transfer Windows 10 but not sure if it&#39;s OEM or Retail</h2>
                    <p>Apologies if this is in the wrong category.<br />
<br />
So, I built my PC quite some time back now and I'm looking at building a new rig.<br />
The issue I'm having is I want to transfer my Windows 10 onto the new rig but I need to know if my version of Windows is classed as retail.<br />
I seemed to have misplaced my Windows 7 install disk/box and apparently (according to other threads) after a previous Windows 10 update the
<strong>Product Key Channel</strong> is useless as it will just say Retail regardless.<br />
<br />
<strong>Is there any other way to tell if the version of Windows I bought is OEM or Retail?</strong></p>

    <title>Problems with unresponsive launchers in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amet decrypt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with unresponsive launchers in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>so for the most part, I'm able to run the programs I want, but I'm having troubles with third party launchers like steam or glyph. About half the programs on steam will run an error message because the program started in the background but never booted,
 or they'll appear to start but it will just be a black screen that freezes up instantly, glyph on the other hand refuses to even install. I'm able to solve the problem temporarily by deleting some log files and rebooting, but only once, and this only works
 on a few programs. I had no troubles in windows 7, and am considering reverting to that for the time being, but I love the new features 10 brings so much I'm reluctant to do so without trying to find a solution.</p>
<p>things I have tried include:<br />
rebooting</p>
<p>reinstalling (the programs)</p>
<p>verifying the files and force updating (drivers, the programs, and my windows version)</p>
<p>deleting the cache (the programs)</p>
<p>running absolutely EVERYTHING as administrator (everything)</p>
<p>and some custom installer updates recommended by some guys at glyph (glyph)</p>
<p>and frustratedly glaring at my computer screen. (computer)</p>
<p>any suggestions?</p>

            <p>hello, bit late in reply. had to dig through some spam folders.</p>
<p>no I don't have any antivirus other than the base windows defender, and my router's firewall is entirely nonintrusive. There doesn't seem to be any consistency to the programs as to what kind don't work. whether it be graphics incompatability, initial third
 party launchers failing, or frequency of maintenance. earlier today I clicked on one of the problem programs and it happened to open immediately, but when I closed out now refuses to start once again, and certain ones that used to work once on reboot now fail
 to even do that. clean boot didn't change much, though I don't have much experience in utilising it. the most I could do to show what's happening is record me booting up a program, then opening the task manager to show it running and taking up resources, but
 never appearing anywhere on the screen, and not stopping until I force it to close.</p>

            <p>trying this out for a bit, but I just can't get anything to work, and a lot of other people on forums generally agree, the problem is windows 10 just is too different to be compatible with some games. All of my problems as well revolved around that upgrade.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is something the developers of the games need to work on or if microsoft can put out a solution, but compatibility troubleshooting doesn't help anything.&nbsp;</p>

This is not the first time this happened, I actually had the SAME problem with a previous model SAMSUNG RF511 I changed that 3 times. This Asus N53S is currently the 4th notebook i replaced from the vendor. I hope someone can help me with this problem. I don't
 think changing the NB again would help, since changing to an entire different brand &amp; model didn't help. Obviously it's the OS.</div>
<div><br />
Thanks for any help provided.</div>

<div>Regards</div>

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the<em>inc</em> directory of<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the
</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the
</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be
</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,
</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files that<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

<p>i have had this problem since around 3/11/2014 and it still has not been resolved, if my battery dies, battery pack is removed or i am idle for the pad to turn off. then when i return and try to switch the pad back on i rather CANT
 MOVE ANYTHING but can clearly see my xbox one has not frozen, or i can move but my headphones dont work. i no for sure this is not my xbox one because all my friends online are having the exact same problem...(QUICK FIX IS HARD RESETING THE XBOX) i have to
 do this sometimes 3 to 5x a day and its rather annoying and im guessing could cause damage to my xbox consistantly hard reseting the device has to be bad news. i think its XBOX problem once again and to be honest microsoft has plagued us with so much problems
 since day one on the xbox one im starting to think if i have wasted my money, the memory can only save 5/6 games before being full and thanks for sorting all the day one problems out but now we have these major problems. PLEASE FIX ASAP WE DID PAY YOU ALOT
 OF CASH FOR THESE CONSOLES SO SPEND IT ON A UPDATE!! OVERAL YOUR SYSTEM IS AWSOME BUT WE NEED A RELIABLE SYSTEM not one that interferes with our entertainment, i didnt spend over £500 to watch tv cos its not working properly.</p>

<p>Ok well yes i have tried all these things and the only one that works is turning the console off i did say in my first message. It turns on when i replace da batterys but just dny let me do anythinh so i have to end my sessions by hard reseting my xbox.
 Dont worry anyway i have posted my xbox one on ebay these problems are a persistant problem and its not my end its been happening ever since call of duty was released. Plz dont copy and paste to me iver and actualy aknowledge there is a problem here with many
 customers not just me. Your answrr is basically continue yo hard reset my console? Yh that sounds like it was pointless me even messaging on here BECAUSE THATS WHAT IM DOING 5x a day to play a game?

You'll need to remove these apps yourself, and then select refresh.<br />

These programs need to be uninstalled because they aren't compatible with the upgrade (Windows 10 - version 1709)<br />

<p>If you cannot get Windows 10 through get windows 10 app,<span>&nbsp;you always have the ISO option to upgrade.</span></p>

<p>After downloading the setup files of Windows 10 using this tool, you can upgrade your existing OS to Windows 10 or you can create bootable USB drive or DVD to install Windows 10 later. You can also save the setup files in offline ISO file format

                    <p>Update: I found a work around, the User Control Account Notification was preventing the Change Product Key program from running. It would pop up asking yes or no for security, but would not show on top of the windows, hiding behind the program window itself.
 So I just turned off the security notifications on the User Control Account which now allows me to buy the key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have the free upgrade to Windows 10 from a Windows 7 Home. </p>
<p>I am trying to buy the Pro Upgrade but every time I go to <strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Go to Store &gt; $99.99</strong> the Store just freezes and it can't be moved, clicked, or minimized. The $99.99 will stay grey and nothing will happen
 or anything will be charged. Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the <strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change product key</strong> will also freeze but with an notification sound and then act just like the store page freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also won't mind an alternative link or place to buy this upgrade if there isn't a fix for this.</p>

            I tried all three of these methods, but none of them worked. The only thing that worked for me was to change "User Account Control Settings" to "Never Notify". Kind of shocked I had to jump through so many hoops. I'm trying to give Microsoft my money after
 all. ;)

    <title>Return from &#39;Sleep&#39; or &#39;Hibernation&#39;&#58; Windows does - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riandmac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Return from &#39;Sleep&#39; or &#39;Hibernation&#39;&#58; Windows does not check for authorisation to use USB external drive</h2>
                    <p>When using Windows 10 in sleep or hibernation and I leave my computer so that it falls asleep or hibernates, and I return, Windows 10 still thinks everything is OK and the 'red' (external drive) icon is displayed (as normal) on the file explorer window but
 the light on the drive has changed from the normal green to red.<br />
To change the situation (so that I can use the drive) I have to unplug the drive momentarily in order that Windows 10 gets the hint and now paints the 'locked'&nbsp;(external drive) icon in the file explorer window. Clicking on this 'locked' icon will ask for the
 password/authentication as usual.<br />
<br />
I just don't want to unplug and replug the drive each time I return to the computer after going and making a cup of tea!<br />
<br />
Alternatively if Windows 10 changes back from 'sleep' or 'hibernation' can the external drive sense this via the USB interface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment it appears that, on return from 'Sleep' or 'Hibernation', Windows 10 thinks that everything is OK, but the external drive wants authorisation before it can be used and there is no dialogue going on between the two.</p>

            Hi Karthicka<br />
<br />
I've been in computing over 50 years and from the very start if there was a problem with dialogue between two pieces of kit, each manufacturer blamed the other side - does this still have to happen?<br />
<br />
I have e-mailled the problem to the drive manufacturer's support team and I have to say I have some sympathy with their response.
<br />
<br />
Their USB external drive "<em>does not require to download any drivers as this is a plug and play device: it utilizes generic Windows drivers</em>" (quote from their response).<br />
<br />
Their kit needs reassurance from Windows that on awaking from the 'Sleep' or 'Hibernation' state, any intruder could be operating the computer and so it is right that their driver keeps the shutters up until the proper authentication process is worked through
 in Windows.<br />
<br />
However I still have an open mind and I would like to hear the Windows take on this.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>So I have run this three times with system Restarts in between each and each time I get the message 'We've made some changes' and then 'Troubleshooting has completed' and then I restart and check using the same procedure and with the same messages - and
 still have the same problem:-</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b924567-f4de-462c-a822-6eedc56b2938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b924567-f4de-462c-a822-6eedc56b2938" /></a></p>
<p>At this point the hard-drive's light has been switched on after the return from 'Sleep' and it starts as a 'Red' light, which indicates to me that it is looking for assurance that the user has been cleared by Windows 10 for using the drive.&nbsp; This authentication
 process did not take place after the return from 'Sleep'.&nbsp; Notice that the drive's icon is painted by Windows 10 as the normal (ie already authenticated) icon for the drive (in this case F:) and Windows 10 is calling this state an I/O device error.&nbsp; Please
 could you fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two Troublshooting messages follow for completeness:-</p>
