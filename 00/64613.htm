<h2>            Your network does not have a sufficient MTU setting.</h2>
                    
<p>If you’re encountering an MTU error when you run an Xbox Live connection test, then you’ve come to the right place! Here are a few quick things to try to get you back on Live!</p>
<p><strong>Restart your network equipment</strong></p>
<p><em>Power cycle your console and network hardware</em><br />
Turn off your Xbox 360 console, and then unplug your modem and router. Wait 5 minutes before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p>Plug the modem back in, and be sure to give it at least a full minute to come back online. When it’s up to speed, do the same with your router, and repeat this step for any additional piece of network hardware you‘re using. When all of your network hardware
 is running, turn on your console.</p>
<p><em>Run an Xbox Live connection test</em><br />
Go to the ‘Settings’ hub on the dashboard (the dashboard is the main menu in your console), select the ‘System’ tile in the upper left, and then ‘Network Settings'. Select the appropriate network (wired or wireless), and then select ‘Test Xbox Live Connection'.</p>
<p>If you still receive an MTU error, try the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Improve your wireless connection</strong></p>
<p>If you’re on a wireless connection, there are a few things to consider for improving your connection. If you’re not on a wireless connection, you can skip ahead to the next section.</p>
<p><em>Bring the console and your wireless device closer together</em><br />
Some things to think about when you’re placing your router are the position of the device and its position relative to the console. Make sure your router isn’t on the floor, near any large metal objects (such as kitchen items or a bathroom), or any other wireless
 devices, namely 2.4 gigahertz band devices.</p>
<p>You can also try moving the router closer to the console, and make sure that there are no obstructions between the router and the console, if possible. If you are unable to move the router, we suggest moving the console closer to the router/gateway, like
 up to the same floor or in the same room.</p>
<p><em>Change/boost your signal</em><br />
You can try changing the channel on which your router or gateway broadcasts, as well as switch signal bands if you’re on a dual-band router (for instructions on how to do so on your particular router, be sure to check out our
Networking Hardware Information forums, the hardware manual for your device, or check the manufacturer’s website).</p>
<p>If that doesn't work for you, try out the steps below to simplify your connection.</p>
<p><strong>Simplify your setup</strong></p>
<p><em>Remove other connections</em><br />
Unplug everything from your router besides the cables going from your router and modem (or if you’re on a wireless network, turn off all other wireless devices). Your Xbox 360 should be the only thing connected to the router. Make sure the cable running from
 your wall jack to your modem is not interrupted by a splitter or other connector.</p>
<p><em>Run a Live connection test</em><br />
Go to the ‘Settings’ hub on the dashboard, select the ‘System’ tile and then ‘Network Settings’. Select the appropriate network (wired or wireless), and then select ‘Test Xbox Live Connection'.</p>
<p>If you don’t receive an MTU error after simplifying your setup, it suggests your hardware is having issues managing multiple connections. These next steps should resolve that issue.</p>
<p><strong>Change your router settings</strong></p>
<p><em>Log into your router settings</em><br />
We’re almost there! Start your web browser, and in the address bar, type the default IP address for your router or gateway, and press ENTER (be sure to check our
Networking Hardware Information forums, the device's hardware manual, or the manufacturer’s website for this info). IP addresses for popular router and gateway manufacturers are listed
 below:</p>
<p>Belkin: 192.168.2.1<br />
Linksys: 192.168.1.1<br />
D-Link: 192.168.0.1<br />
NETGEAR: 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1</p>
<p>Enter the user name and password for your router, and then press okay. You can find this in the resources listed above if you do not know the user name and password.</p>
<p><em>Change your MTU setting to at least 1400</em><br />
If you’re unsure how to check or change your MTU setting within your router settings, you can check the resources above for them. If you change the MTU setting, be sure to run another Live connection test. If you still encounter an MTU error, move on to the
 next step.</p>
<p>Open network ports<br />
For the best results with Xbox Live, you’ll want to ensure the following ports are open:</p>
<p>Port 88 (UDP)<br />
Port 3074 (UDP &amp; TCP)<br />
Port 53 (UDP &amp; TCP)<br />
Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>For detailed instructions on how to open your network ports, be sure to check out Manual Port Forwarding in
this sticky. If you still encounter an MTU error after forwarding your ports, please move on to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Determine if your router or gateway need replacing</strong></p>
<p>Okay, you’ve tried all the steps, and you’re still getting MTU errors. At this point we’ll want to check that your router or gateway is compatible with Xbox Live.</p>
<p><em>Try a direct modem connection</em><br />
For right now, use an ethernet cord to hook your Xbox 360 console to your modem, bypassing the router entirely. Run a Live connection test, as described earlier in this guide. If you no longer encounter the MTU issue, it indicates your router is not compatible.</p>
<p><em>Check for hardware compatibility</em><br />
If a direct modem connection resolves the MTU error, then you’ll want to consider purchasing a new router or gateway. Our
Networking Hardware Information forums have an extensive list of supported hardware.</p>
<p><strong>I’m still getting an MTU error. What do I do now?</strong></p>
<p>You may want to give your Internet Service provider a call, to see if they have a resolution for the error on their end. Also, feel free to make a post in the forums, though please be sure to check the questions at the bottom of
this post, to better help us help you!</p>

            I was having the same issue, and just removing it from the device manager didn't fix the problem. Just go to:<span>
<p>http://www.geforce.com/drivers</p>
<p>In there you can download the GeForce experience, is a installer for drivers, the nice thing it has a option for clean install, basically it will remove the drivers and add the correct ones. If you just remove it from device manager it loads the bad drivers
 again.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

            I agree.&nbsp; Rolling back to windows 7 might be my best option as well.&nbsp; I cant even watch a youtube video that is 6 minutes long without my computer locking up 4 times.&nbsp; Windows 10, even given the free option for me, has been a huge waste of my time.&nbsp; I
 thought I gave it long enough before upgrading for these bugs to be worked out.&nbsp; Guess not.&nbsp; Next time an upgrade comes out, I'll wait a year instead of a few months.&nbsp; Sigh.

            <p>With the Nvidia Experience software, it is allowing me to update drivers without crashing my computer (which is a good progress) also they released a new driver 358.91&nbsp;Nov 9. So far no crashes but had not time to really test it.</p>

</p><p>Best thing you could all try is to download the latest driver from Nvidia.com and execute a clean install with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start the installer</li><li>Choose Custom</li><li>Check the box "Perform a clean install"</li></ol>
<p>In most cases this should solve the problem. Also read <a href="https://windowsinstructed.com/fix-nvidia-windows-kernel-mode-driver-version-358-87-stopped-responding-successfully-recovered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I got the same problme. After a fresh install of Windows 10, everything was fine couple days (I would say 3 or 4). Suddenly, Playing the wicher 3, game crashed and since then I cannot play it more then 2 seconds... As soon as it lauch the game after loading
 a saved game, it crashes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice also&nbsp;wierd display artefact in the desktop as well as on Microsoft edge or whatever text on screen. I tried many workaroud like reinstalling, updating drivers. At the end, I reinstalled the computer completly with my windows 10 licence. I suffer
 still the same problem ! I noticed that before installing Nvidia drivers (via windows automatic updates or the driver on Nvidia website), screen artefact were gone,&nbsp;text looked cleared with no artefacts. As soos as Nvidia driver is loaded, problem starts.
 That why I really think of a driver issue... Actually a windows 10 issue with Nvidia drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will re-install the computer with Windows 8.1 and check what happen. I never had any problems like that, play computer games for 20 years, the first time I have so many issues with an nvidia card...</p>

<p>It's just the start menu and basically all the menus in the new windows 10.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that's it shows me the little mark that's get showed when you actually do scroll, but nothing happens.</p>
<p>I'm using Samsung 9 series, with Syntaptics drivers which are installed.</p>
<p>Any suggestions??</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the query, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. When you say "scroll in start menu", are you saying the scroll functions do not work when you click the start menu and click on "all apps"?</p>
<p>2. What exactly is the "little mark" that you are referring to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the information provided, we are unable to analyze the exact issue, do get back to us with more details about the issue for further assistance.

            <p>Sorry, i'll be more accurate this time, But basically that's exactly what i meant.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, i'm talking about two finger scrolling on a touch pad. It's not that i cannot scroll all together. If i click the scroll bar and drag it, everything is fine. Same goes for using the up and down arrows on the keyboard.</p>
<p>So when i say Scrolling doesn't work i mean that kind of scrolling.</p>
<p>I can scroll in Google Chrome for example, and also when i'm using the Windows file explorer.</p>
<p>But when i try to scroll anything in the start menu nothing happens.</p>
<p>Another example are all of the settings windows, and the Windows store app, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>"little mark" i meant the scrolling icon which normally appears when scrolling is in progress. You know, the little mouse pointer between&nbsp;up and down arrows, like a tiny scroll bar.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So that icon appears but yet nothing happens. No scrolling.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I tried looking for some new drivers from&nbsp;Samsung or an update, but the only thing i could find were old 2011 drivers which&nbsp;came out with the laptop itself.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I tried installing the latest Synaptics drivers that are&nbsp;available, but when i do nothing&nbsp;happens.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>The computer acts like no driver has ever been&nbsp;installed, and if i go to mouse settings i don't have&nbsp;the
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Synaptics&nbsp;</span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>tab anymore.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>So for now i went back to the 2011 driver which at least i have the
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Synaptics&nbsp;</span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>tab in the mouse settings, and the computer&nbsp;acknowledges&nbsp;that driver were installed.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Now, Can you please help me?? it's driving me crazy! crazy enough to go back to windows 7&nbsp;despite&nbsp;the fact that i&nbsp;truly&nbsp;love the new windows!</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>There are other usability defects in that menu.&nbsp; E.g. why does the mouse wheel not work there?&nbsp; Why can't we navigate by first letter?&nbsp; FWIW now I see on my Surface screen cover that the best I can do with it is wait for drag lock to occur and then I can
 move the All Apps list with one finger.&nbsp; Thanks for making me find that.&nbsp; It will be less annoying to go down in that list that way than by only clicking on the scroll bar.&nbsp; Otherwise, if you have a Touch screen, Touch scrolling works--provided you take care
 not to accidentally launch something while doing it imprecisely.</p>

            I am also having this problem. I have two finger scrolling capable touch pad on my laptop. If I am in the start menu and attempt to scroll threw using the touch pad, the icon(the touch pad with blue arrows and a finger)&nbsp;indicating that its trying to scroll
 appears but the menu does not move. I was able to have the single finger scroll work for a few seconds once but since searching for a known problem I have been unsuccessful in making it work again.
<br />
<br />
How can we fix this glitch?

</p><p>It seems to be "working as designed".&nbsp; As I mentioned you could use Drag lock to effect a single finger scroll.&nbsp; So, if you know you have Drag lock set at two seconds, just press and hold, count slowly to two and drag.</p>

<p>I would love an explanation why it works on my ASUS and not my Fujitsu... The two finger scroll works on one but not the other. That is not acceptable in my eyes.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't say what type of License you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only legal Windows 7 download available&nbsp;is now from Microsoft, as Microsoft has stopped DigitalRiver Windows 7 ISO downloads.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But Microsoft only provides these downloads for Windows 7 Retail Product Keys, not OEM preinstalled Product Keys (Dell, HP, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Retail Windows 7 License and are having troubles at the above website, contact Microsoft using the Support option there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a preinstalled OEM License (Dell, HP, etc), contact your Computer Manufacturer to order Recovery Media which they should supply for a small cost, IF they still have them available (which is highly doubtful)..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can also borrow the exact same Retail Windows 7 Edition&nbsp;DVD and use your Product Key to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The COA sticker with the Product Key&nbsp;is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>With a Desktop it is either on the side, rear or top of the Computer Case.</p>

<p>No, we don't have any drivers here.&nbsp; This is a peer-supported tech support forum for Microsoft products (hosted by Microsoft).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) merged into HP in 2002, and some of its printers are supported by HP.&nbsp; As near as I can tell the DEClaser 5100 is from the early 1990s -- at least, this User Guide is copyright 1994:&nbsp;
<a href="http://manx-docs.org/collections/mds-199909/cd3/printer/dl510ina.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://manx-docs.org/collections/mds-199909/cd3/printer/dl510ina.pdf</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That User Guide says</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">PCL users can use any of the following drivers that come with or are available for Windows 3.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>HP LaserJet 4</li><li>HP LaserJet IIIP, III, IIP</li></ul>
<p>It also says:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">A PostScript printer driver is supplied with the DEClaser 5100 printer and should be used as the first choice.&nbsp; Although other PostScript drivers may work with the DEClaser 5100 printer, you should install the driver included with
 the printer, which takes maximum advantage of the DEClaser 5100 printer features and performance.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>And in a section discussing "drivers for MS-DOS" is says:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">To access as many features of the DEClaser 5100 printer as possible you should use one of the PostScript drivers included with the application.&nbsp; Some typical PostScript drivers are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><ul>
<li>DEClaser 1152</li><li>LaserJet 4M</li><li>LaserWriter IIg</li><li>LaserWriter IIf</li><li>LaserWriter Plus</li><li>LaserWriter<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">There are also a number of PCL drivers included with the application if you require them.&nbsp; Typical PCL drivers are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>LaserJet 4</li><li>LaserJet III</li><li>LaserJet II</li><li>PCL5 and PCL4</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Putting that all together, I suggest that you try one or more of the following drivers, all of which are available through the "Add a printer" wizard.&nbsp; Some of these drivers will probably work.&nbsp; Whether you'll get "all the features" of your printer is another
 story.&nbsp; And, of course, you'll probably have to get a USB to parallel converter unless your printer has a network interface.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>LaserJet 4</li><li>LaserJet 4/4M PS</li><li>or another of the LaserJet 4x drivers, some of which are PS (PostScript) drivers</li><li>LaserJet III</li><li>LaserJet IIIp</li><li>there are some LaserJet IIIp PS drivers, also</li><li>LaserJet IIp</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!&nbsp; I think you'll need it.</p>

    <title>Audio and USB problems after Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miketak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio and USB problems after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>One of my 4 usb ports on my ASUS Republic&nbsp;of Gamers laptop has failed recently and I believe it mat be related to a Windows Update. Also, my audio stopped functioning at roughly the same time (both speakers and headphones).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two updates I am suspicious of were installed on August 9 and 15th respectively. On Aug 9th an 'ASUS driver update for Asus Support Device' was successfully installed and on Aug 15 'Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3081438)'
 was successfully installed. I have tried doing a system restore to the state before each of these and both times the restore failed.&nbsp;There are no problems evident when viewing device manager. When I tried to test and roll back audio settings I got a message
 saying 'Test sound failed to play'. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound may have quit on August 9 but since I don't use audio that often I may not have noticed it. The usb port didn't fail until after the 15th update. I noticed it right away because I had to plug a hub into one of the other ports to get my mouse working
 again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was able to correct the sound issue using the provided link. Windows failed to detect, download or update the driver for my VIA HD Audio(Win10) card (there were 2 audio source options-one by NVidia, the other VIA). Once I installed the driver the sound
 is back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one USB port is still not working, although the Device Manager does not indicate any problems. The Hardware Troubleshooter says some changes were made but the port is still not working. It said "Problems found: Hardware changes may not have been detected
 - Fixed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system file check did not return any issues. It said, "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what my next step(s) should be. Thanks.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. Though, I am on the low end 360 slim w/4gb. &nbsp;I experience random freezing while playing Skyrim. I too am using a new disk (pristine) as well as my friends. Still, the console freezes usually during the loading screens though it's
 happened elsewhere in non reproducible world/dungeons. &nbsp;It's odd. I had the first 360 that was released and it lasted almost 5 years and the only time it froze was when it finally bit the dust. &nbsp;This, brand new, and has already frozen about a dozen times in
 the month I've had it. </p>

<p>I keep having the same problem, quite a lot of buildings and caves are just inaccessible to me because as soon as i try to enter them, the simple loading screen comes up (the one with just the smoke and your level bar) and freezes, i can't do anything. Just
 recently, it started freezing even in open areas, just casually walking over the hills and down paths. I've tried deleting unwanted saves (over 100 of them) and installing the game onto my hard-drive (250GB in a 4GB slim). Really don't know what else to do,
 other than deleting the cache, but i doubt that'll do much</p>

<p>I myself have Skyrim and also have the newest and latest updates\console for my Xbox 360, and I haven't received any glitches, sure it may stop to save the game...but other than that, it's fine. Try clearing your system cache again and make sure the game
 isn't scratch.</p>

            <p>Hi Harsh,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This issue might occur due to corrupt Windows Update components. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you check if you are able to install updates offered from Windows Update?</li><li>Is the issue specific for a particular app in Store?</li></ol>
<p>If you haven't checked, refer to the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

If they are already running, stop the services, restart the computer and the restart the respective services again.
<br />
</li><li>Click on <b>Apply </b>and then on <b>OK</b>.</li></ul>
<p>Try to downloading or purchasing the apps again from the app store and check if you get the same error message. If so, you can follow the methods to further troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Refer to the link and run the Windows update troubleshooter:</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>New at this Xbox live world! Our kids participated in a conversation that got their account flagged and suspended. They did not tell or will not tell us what was wrong so I'm wondering if the trasncript would be available for us parents, to better educate
 them on the course of action to take when they see hear this?</p>

<p>I don't believe that the Enforcement team sends a transcript of what went on, however all reports are 100% fully investigated and appropriate action taken against accounts found to violate the code of conduct for all players.&nbsp; My general rule of thumb is
 usually to say that if you wouldn't say it to a judge, your boss or a priest, don't say it on Xbox!&nbsp; That's purely because the terms considered against that code of conduct change so often that it'd be impossible to keep a 100% up-to-date record &amp; what is
 offensive in the one part of the world might not be so in another part of the world.

            The enforcement team will not give you information on which account reported your son for privacy issues and so there could be no retaliation against the other party.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Forums. As stated above, unfortunately not us or the Enforcement team would be able to provide any of this information. It might be possible to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/xbox-live/send-text-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
View the Messages</a> through the Xbox One (If unable to view messages while suspended go ahead and wait until the suspension is gone) and then see if you can find the correct message and at that point simply
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/xbox-live/block-or-mute-other-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mute or Block The other Player</a> so that there is no communication with them in the future.

<p>
</p><p>We will be locking this thread as there is no further solutions to this situation, If you have any other questions for us feel free to come back to the Forums and start a new thread so that we may continue to assist you.

<h2>            Computer automatically goes to sleep mode and does not wake up</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: PC GOES TO SLEEP, WILL NOT WAKE UP WITHOUT A REBOOT</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Hello, all</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve been haunting this site for over a week now, trying to resolve a major sleep issue with my computer.&nbsp; (Now it’s to the point where it’s given ME a sleep issue—I can’t sleep!)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Without warning (and no discernible triggering activity), the display goes dark, and the computer appears to go to sleep.&nbsp; Although I have set the mouse and/or keyboard to wake it, that doesn’t do the trick.&nbsp; Hitting the power button on the
 front of the PC—even though I have the power button set to reboot—does nothing.&nbsp; It stays in sleep mode—or what I call “coma mode.”&nbsp; My only option is turn off the power to the PC, then hit the power button on the computer to restart it.&nbsp; This is pretty time-consuming,
 especially when it happens 12-15 times a day!&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here’s something to consider (those of you who are more tech-savvy than I):&nbsp; In the a.m., the computer seems to go steadily with no sleep mode for up to 2 to 2-1/2 hours before a sleep mode cycle strikes.&nbsp; Once that occurs, it continues throughout
 the day.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried many of the suggestions here and elsewhere:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Uninstalled Win 7 Service Pack 1</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Downloaded the latest driver for my PCI Communications at the manufacturer’s site, which identifies it as specifically for Win 7.&nbsp; (Even Windows troubleshooting says the driver is up-to-date.)</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Have reduced the screen resolution to nearly bare minimum.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Have deleted any superfluous programs or files and taken the extra out of my Start Menu.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Have run ckdsk (spelling?) with no errors found.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Have tried changing the power plan for power management, in Balanced mode currently.&nbsp; (Putting it in high performance made no difference.)</em></strong></li></ul>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m at a loss on what else to try.&nbsp; I’m ready to just go back to Windows XP!&nbsp; I would appreciate any ideas/suggestions you may have.&nbsp; Thanks.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; This is a hybrid computer built for me by very reputable local folks, have bought other PCs from them.&nbsp; I have Intel, NIVIDIA PCI Communications, using a Samsung plug-and-play monitor.</em></strong></p>

            <p>Hello Sandi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that your computer automatically goes to sleep mode very frequently and does not wakeup. You have already tried a number of troubleshooting steps like uninstalling Win 7 SP1, updating drivers, reducing screen resolution,
 running Checkdisk, changing power plan settings, but none of them helped you enough to get this problem resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Were there any significant hardware or software changes made prior to this issue?</li><li>Were you able to put the computer in sleep mode and wake it through input devices earlier?</li><li>You mentioned that you tried to change the power plan settings? Have you checked deleting the existing (non-default) power plan and creating a new one?
</li></ol>
<p>Sometimes, this problem appears when <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The Basic Input/output System (BIOS) system that is installed on the computer reduces power to the port to which the input device is connected, or your computer may have encountered a system
 problem, or sleep key on input devices are configured incorrectly. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The ability to recover from sleep mode by pressing a key on the keyboard or by moving the mouse on a computer that supports ACPI is dependent on the computer's motherboard. This ability is disabled in older Intel motherboards,
 and the only way to wake the computer from sleep mode is to press the Power button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ACPI support is necessary to take full advantage of the power management and Plug and Play features in Windows. If you are not sure whether your computer is ACPI-compliant, please see the printed documentation for your computer
 or motherboard, or contact the manufacturer of your computer or motherboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s try these methods below and check if that solves the problem.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">First, I would suggest you to run Windows inbuilt power troubleshooter to get the problem automatically diagnosed and fixed.
</span>The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep mode. Adjusting these settings can help us to get this problem resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Follow the steps in the article below to run power troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open the Power troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/open-the-power-troubleshooterMethod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/open-the-power-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Examine the BIOS settings of your computer for power features that disable or reduce power to ports that are used for your keyboard or mouse.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Because BIOS access varies by computer, to resolve this issue, see the documentation that is included with your computer. Alternatively, contact your computer manufacturer for information about how to configure the BIOS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of
 BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</em><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">On addition to this, you may also check deleting the existing non default power plan (if any) and creating a new one, just for the diagnostic purpose and see if that makes any difference.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also see: Sleep and hibernation: frequently asked questions, please refer the section “<strong>How can I prevent my computer from automatically sleeping or hibernating?</strong></span></p>

    <title>Surface Dock not recognizing my Samsung S29E790C Ultra Wide Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rali1120  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Dock not recognizing my Samsung S29E790C Ultra Wide Monitor</h2>
                    <p>So here is the low down. I purchased an entire set up for my office, it is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) i5/8GB/256GB Surface Books with dGPU</p>
<p>(1) i7/8GB/256GB Surface Book with dGPU &nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) New Surface Docks&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) Microsoft branded Mini Display to HDMI Adapter</p>
<p>(3) HDMI Cables that came with the Samsung monitors&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) Samsung 29" Ultrawide Monitors (S29E790C)</p>
<p>(3) Microsoft Designer Keyboard and Mice set</p>
<p>-all are hardwired in with Cat-6 to our companies Local Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these units (which if you do the math are 3 complete setups) worked perfectly when first purchased back in late January/early February up until beginning April. That's when the problems started. mainly an issue with the monitors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1: The monitor shows up in device manager list as a Generic PnP Monitor when connected via the surface dock with the Microsoft Mini Display to HDMI adapter but the monitors fail to pick up a signal. It flashes the input a couple times then goes black.
 No image what so ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution Microsoft gave me was to try a new surface dock which they were kind enough to send one out.&nbsp;<br />
once received and hooked up the same way, everything worked fine but only for ONE work day. when i came into the office the next day after setting it up and using it all day the previous day, it did the same thing again and didn't display an image at all. i
 was back to square one. i was confused thinking maybe it was the computer and that it forgets its display setting when its turned off and rebooted again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2: The monitor only gets a signal when i disconnect the Mini Display port from the back of the Surface Dock and plug it directly into the surface book. However, it only displays an image with the black bars on either side of the screen and does not
 fill up the entire 21:9 display like it used to, using all the available pixels for the resolution. This again was confusing as i cannot even use my ultra wide monitor in the aspect ratio it was intended for. Again, as i had mentioned before i was able to
 do this perfectly before April regardless of it was plugged directly to my Surface Book or plugged in via the Surface Dock. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when i plug the Dock to my Surface Book, the monitor (as stated before) doesn't display a signal but i can still access everything else, such as the USB's when i have something plugged in and i can access the internet with the Cat-6 which is plugged
 in also and it still charges my Surface Book! The only thing is this gosh darn monitor that seems to get a signal and the computer knows its hooked up, but it will not get a signal regardless of what i do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way i get a signal is if i keep installing new Docks to my Surface Book (or ones it has never previously connected to) and even when i do that it stops responding the next day. (i basically turn on my computer at the beginning of the work day and
 once shut down it doesn't get turned back on until the start of the next work day).</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have also tried leaving my Surface Book at the office for a couple days when my 2nd replacement Dock came in and as long as its plugged into the dock forever it works fine but once i removed it, as i did for a business trip and came back to it, boom it
 stops working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem across all three of my setups and yes i have tried everything from moving the monitors to different setups and shuffling the computers and docks around. i know it seems dumb since everything is the same across setups but it was worth a
 shot.</p>
<p>basically i need help getting this thing to work and i know it possible because i have gotten all of them to work flawlessly in the past for days on end by connecting and reconnecting to the dock multiple time a day. it just worked before. i don't know if
 i did something, but for it to not work across all 3 setups is not coincidence.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft or anyone, HELP!</p>

            <p>The only thing that I can think of is that a firmware update for the Surface Dock has broken the compatibility with your monitor.&nbsp; This might explain why a replacement dock, which is not likely to have the current firmware loaded into it, works for a day
 until the Surface Book updates it and you power the system on and off.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if there is a way to get hold of past firmware versions for the Surface Dock, but the following link will give you information on how to check them and update them manually if necessary:</p>

</p><p>One other thing that you might try, but I doubt it will help, is to load the manufacturer's monitor configuration file onto the Surface Books.&nbsp; Most monitors come with a CD, or you could likely find the file on their website, that has a .inf file (if I remember
 correctly) that will ensure that the PC knows what the monitor's capabilities are.&nbsp; This usually occurs automatically nowadays over the video connection, but this might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go this route, you can place the config file on a USB memory stick or an SD card (or on the computer's SSD if you want to) and then right-click on the .INF and select Install.&nbsp; This will load the necessary information onto your system.&nbsp; If you do
 this, I would recommend unplugging the monitor first, installing the config file, and then reconnecting the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that one of these methods will help you out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Unable to upgrade from Windows 7 SP1 to Windows 10, get error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike in southern nh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to upgrade from Windows 7 SP1 to Windows 10, get error &#34;WindowsUpdate_80004005&#34; &#34;WindowsUpdate_dt000&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have made multiple attempts to upgrade from Windows 7 SP1 to Windows 10 with no success yet.&nbsp; The Windows 10 version is 1511, 10586.&nbsp; I have attempted to upgrade using&nbsp;Windows Update, the Windows 10 Upgrade Application, and the Media Creation Tool (Without&nbsp;media
 and also with a DVD created by the tool).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When upgrading with Windows Update or the Windows 10 Upgrade Application, the download completes, and I get the prompt to complete the upgrade.&nbsp; Upon selecting Upgrade Now, 86% of the configuration completes prior to the system shutdown.&nbsp;The system completes
 the shutdown, and then&nbsp;restarts Windows 7.&nbsp; Upon logging in,&nbsp;I get a notification that the update failed. The error code is "WindowsUpdate_80004005" "WindowsUpdate_dt000".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When upgrading with the Media Creation Tool (Upgrade this PC) or using the DVD created by the tool, the Windows 10 files are loaded, updates applied, and I am presented with the items that will be saved from the current Windows 7 system, and then prompted
 to start the Windows 10&nbsp;installation.&nbsp; Once started,&nbsp;the installation gets to the point where it indicates that "Your PC will restart in a few moments", then it fails, and&nbsp;a dialogue box is presented&nbsp;indicating that the installation failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted a number&nbsp;of the solutions that I have found in the Microsoft Community with no success.
</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<p>1) Verifying PC hardware and installed applications compatibility using the Windows 10 Upgrade Application.</p>
<p>2) Verifying CPU compatibility with the CPUID CPU-Z application.</p>
<p>3) Verifying that I am running as an Administrator.</p>
<p>4) Verifying that update KB3112343 is installed.</p>
<p>5) Checking the integrity of the system files using sfc /scannow in the DOS window.</p>
<p>6) Removing (Renaming)&nbsp;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution and C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 directories with wuauserv, cryptSvc, bits, and msiserver all stopped, then restarted after directories were renamed.</p>
<p>7) Disabling all installed services and programs using msconfig in Run box (Invoked by Windows key and R key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike S.</p>

</p><p>A hard drive isn't enough of a hardware change to&nbsp; trigger reactivation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a motherboard requires reactivation following

</p><p>Then if the problem persists you'll know to test your hard drive with Seagate's disk diagnostics scan for the model.&nbsp; I would also read the disk's Manual on the Seagate Downloads page for the model because certain Hybrid's have a 32gb caching and boot partition
 that requires special handling.&nbsp; If the drive is less than a year old, you have included tech support from Seagate to call on.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the upgrade process somehow doesn't understand the partitioning of the SSHD... Not that you altered it, but the fact that it is in reality TWO separate drives...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A small SSD and a normal HDD combination... The Seagates randomly switch the most used files around to the SSD part of the drive... which may or may not be the issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your key was invalid, you would be getting a notice to that effect... But if you right click on Computer\ThisPC and select Properties, the Activation Status will be shown near the bottom of the Window...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I routinely do what you describe with Macrium with the exception that I use Acronis...</p>
<p>Acronis will actually resize the partitions as part of reloading an image to a larger drive automatically if you select that option...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think that if Macrium or any modifications you have made were a problem, the machine would not boot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess a worst case scenario might be to do the upgrade to the 320GB HDD.. make a new Image, and reload that to the SSHD like before...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... I would recommend that you didn't expand Windows to take up the remainder of the free space on the larger drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Primarily to make the use of Macrium more effective... Just Imaging the OS Partition for instance, and leaving all your personal files on a newly created partition...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are much easier to backup manually, and you will have less clutter with your Imaging...</p>

    <title>ROBOCOPY&#58; Copy CHANGED files only &#42;WIN10 U&#47;I bug&#42; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> youngc21  say:</h3>
<h2>            ROBOCOPY&#58; Copy CHANGED files only &#42;WIN10 U&#47;I bug&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Currently Windows 10 has a bug where you cannot skip files with the same name, file size, and date if the destination is a different volume or drive. This is because of a 2 second granularity between different file systems (NTFS and FAT32). I've currently
 found some threads where this issue can be remedied with a robocopy command.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can however skip files with the same file size and date if being done locally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following steps provide a good workaround to the bug until Microsoft releases a solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a Back-up folder locally (e.g. on your C:\ drive)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Copy all non-system files (i.e. photos, documents, etc.) that you wish to back-up. I have not tested this for files that require additional permissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Copy the Back-up folder to desired volume, disk, drive etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Update your back-up folder locally and transfer to drives on whatever schedule you choose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drawbacks:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You have to constantly rewrite the back-up folder on your drive, which can take a lot of time depending on the size and quantity of files&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Local storage is limited by having 2 copies of all non-sys files at all times on your local drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a robocopy solution that can bypass the Windows 10 U/I bug?</p>
