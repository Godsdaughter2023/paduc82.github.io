<h2>            License Activation &#40;slui.exe&#41; failed with the following error code&#58; 0x8002801D</h2>
                    Folks:

Any help with this problem would be greatly appreciated. 

I am working on a friend's computer, running Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; The computer has been running incredibly slowly.&nbsp; I uninstalled a number of no longer used programs and utilities.&nbsp; I also fixed Windows update, which was not working properly.&nbsp;


The last problem was an error screen saying that Windows was not Genuine.&nbsp; I have tried a number of fixes, which have generally improved things, but I still cannot activate Windows.&nbsp; The last fix that I tried was at the bottom of this thread:

https://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/0a2f1dd2-dc40-40db-9500-d127696ed0c2/error-0x8004fe22-on-windows-7-pro-mga-report-included?forum=genuinewindows7

If I run Slui.exe either manually, or by clicking on the "Activate Now" link on the Control Panel Systems page, I get the error message (in the Application Event Log) shown in the title of this thread.


Here is the last run of the Microsoft Genuine Advanta

</p><p><span>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer,&nbsp;</span><span>how do I find the product key?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system
 unit.&nbsp;It looks like the following:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.</li></ul>
<span>
<ul>
<li>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</li></ul>

<h2>            Cant file a Case Review</h2>
                    <p>I am very disappointed in the xbox one "How Do I" support.&nbsp;I am currently in a 7 day ban because I messaged someone saying "u suc" and as harmful as it must have been got suspended for it. Obviously a 7 day ban is 110% not deserving so I try to get my suspension shortened or erased completely. After some 30+ minutes I get to a "How Do I"&nbsp;tab that apparently can help me. As I follow the steps one in particular says&nbsp;to access my Enforcement History by "simply" (not simple what so ever) hitting the link on the step. Well I did that and then I find out that my "Child Account" (The one suspended) cannot file a case review... WHY!!! Now I am very angry and follow another set of steps to get my problem solved (hasn't solved anything yet...) From my knowledge after dealing with this for 2+ hours is that in order for me to file a case review I must log into the adult account which I have done. On the adult account it shows the record on the adult account to be perfectly clean. Whe

<p>HEY IM IN A SIMilar situation except my person hassled me for 3 days (i couldnt block them for some reason, or i could but they kept getting around and removing it somehow) this person thinks im 12 (im 40) and has offered to f@#k me in a park. he is a ****.
 (i still have all the messages).</p>
<p>
</p><p>i finally reacted badly after 3 days of bull and called him a bi t ch and said i would kill him for being a ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i instantly got banned for 7 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried to create a topic about it here and it never materialised (maybe cause i named him and i have a feeling he is a microsoft employee).</p>
<p>
</p><p>i dont know if i should pass this info onto police? about the **** that is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did break the terms so i aint arguing that, but how can this person get away with this with no penalty unless microsoft condone his actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>very disapointed and upset about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>your case bro sucks as the 2k community has become toxic this season trash messages are everywhere (always from trash players though hence the toxic) how do they not get banned?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what i can take from this is moicrosoft supports and protects ****'s, scary. i was just about to buy my 11 year old boy his own xbox. no way that is happening now.</p>

<h2>            Snipping tool window resizes for snip</h2>
                    <p>When connected to my external monitor and I try to take a snip, the screen available to capture shrinks into a corner leaving a black border all around a miniature picture of what my screen should look like. I am still able to snip the area I need, but the
 quality is extremely grainy and hard to read. Is there a way to keep the snipping tool from resizing my screen for snips when connected to an external monitor? Thanks.</p>

    <title>continual harassment from a fellow gamer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vert hustler  say:</h3>
<h2>            continual harassment from a fellow gamer</h2>
                    
<p>Can you please help me with some advice on how to handle a fellow gamer who continuously harasses me?&nbsp;<br />
I have blocked all communications with him, but, he has found a way of being able to keep sending me messages!<br />
He always boasted how he could hack into anyone's account, and drain their microsoft points. He also gets people to do whatever he wants through the promise of free points.<br />
I have left him bad feedback and reported him , but it's still not enough to keep him away from me. While everything he says is mostly rubbish, it's still a &nbsp;nuisance having to deal with him everyday. The latest threat is that if I don't unmute him he'll have
 me banned from Xbox. (As if this would ever happen, but I'm so over him and his nutty games- I just want him to knock off the intimidation and the threats.<br />
Can anyone give me some advice how to handle this matter so that he's dealt with once and for all&gt;</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>WHY oh why is it so hard to get one of the largest companies to communicate with you when you have a problem.&nbsp; Its ok when they want your money, but after that forget it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no XBox&nbsp; and I am being charged each year for XBox LIve!!!&nbsp; I discovered a credit card charge from a couple of days ago and my credit card company said that Microsoft doesn't talk to credit card companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am putting in a fraud report.&nbsp; Apparently the credit card company said that a new card won't help as they will just charge the new card too.&nbsp; I have to contact XBox, BUT guess what. Can't get past the wall of 'COMPUTER' FORUMS... AND VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS
 THAT DONT ASSIST!&nbsp; Just waste your time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't XBox pay some people to answer the [<strong>Mod removed- Profanity]</strong> phone like a company that cares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am considering getting a lawyer so I can take back control of my credit card.&nbsp; Has anyone else had a problem with not being able to get a charge cancelled?</p>

    <title>Restore default location in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mommat90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore default location in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new computer.&nbsp; Everything was automatically downloading and saving into the OneDrive.&nbsp; I looked up how to change the location and did just that.&nbsp; However, it replaced other folders.&nbsp; My main question is:&nbsp; If I restore the default location, will
 I lose any of my downloads or files that I have since put in those new locations?&nbsp; Some files will show a location that, if you look, doesn't even appear to exist anymore as the folder was renamed when I changed the location of another folder.&nbsp; For instance,
 when I went to change the location of the Contacts folder to D Drive under amtid, it renamed the amtid folder as Contacts.&nbsp; As you can see in the first screenshot, it says the location of Contacts is under D:\amtid, but amtid does not seem to exist on the
 left under the D drive.&nbsp; This seems extremely confusing.&nbsp; I have waited several days to even ask this as it doesn't even make sense to try to explain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66380102-bf38-4178-b13b-1a6cd665ff32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66380102-bf38-4178-b13b-1a6cd665ff32" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I then tried to rename the folder as mdt which worked until I went to move the location of the Documents folder and it renamed the mdt folder as Documents.&nbsp; As you can see in this screenshot, it shows the location in D:\mdt, but that folder does not appear
 to exist over on the left under the D drive.&nbsp; The Documents folder under Desktop is the one that used to be mdt and changed when I changed the Documents folder location.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If I restore these locations, will I lose my files or any paths for downloading, saving, etc.?&nbsp; And will my original amtid folder start showing again?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
When restoring a default folder location the files will not be deleted, a prompt will appear to confirm whether or not you want to move all the contents of the old location to a new one. It will also offer you to create a new folder if the location doesn't
 exist anymore. As a good practice, we recommend <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backing up your files</a></strong> before you perform this to be safe from any file
 losses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you need further help.</p>

    <title>Monitor will not turn on, but computer boots - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fishystuff00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor will not turn on, but computer boots</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>So basically the title is my problem; the computer boots fine, but the monitor does not turn on.&nbsp; I have to sit here for about half an hour on this desktop (which is at least 5 years old), and turn it off and then back on every five minutes or so.&nbsp; You always
 have to run the mouse back and forth, slowly (not fast, that never works), and eventually it will turn on.</p>
<p>I have checked the video card visually, it looks fine, but we all know that doesn't mean anything.&nbsp; I have also updated to all of the latest drivers, etc.&nbsp; I believe the brand is NVIDIA (did I spell that right?).&nbsp; I also believe it's in the GeoForce line.&nbsp;
 But, I could be way off.</p>
<p>If you plug the mouse into a different USB port, it never turns on.&nbsp; There are two types of cables for the video card; VGA and DVI.&nbsp; I have tried both (separately), and this does not make a difference either.</p>
<p>This is driving me nuts, please help!</p>
<p>-fishy</p>
<p>*EDIT*</p>
<p>I just had a thought.&nbsp; I use Teamviewer to log onto this desktop using my laptop to use its DVD burner.&nbsp; So, I booted the computer up, waited for it to get to the log on screen (I pushed the usual F1 and then enter, it always asks me to push F1 to continue
 after POST and then enter to resume boot normally.&nbsp; I was able to log on using Teamviewer, which tells me that it made it to the log on screen, but the screen was black.&nbsp; Granted, I don't know much about video cards, but my thought was that the video card
 would only effect the monitor plugged into the computer, not mine as well.&nbsp; Interesting...</p>
<p>*SECOND EDIT*</p>
<p>It just turned on.&nbsp; Any diagnostics I can run while it's on?&nbsp; It never has problems when the monitor turns on, it's just if you have to reboot is when the problem starts.&nbsp; I will look for diagnostics myself, and post a third edit if I find anything interesting.&nbsp;
 LOL- I may solve the problem myself, or at least figure out what the problem is, but at least somebody with a similar problem may find this useful.&nbsp; And, BTW, when the monitor turned on, Teamviewer worked too, it's no longer black, I can see the log on screen.&nbsp;
 *Scratches head*</p>
<p>*THIRD EDIT*</p>
<p>I updated the bios to the most recent version.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; I'm officially out of ideas.&nbsp; Help!</p>

            Would generally indicate a failing Vid.card or a bad internal connection, or even failing monitor.&nbsp;Shut the PC down, switch off pwr, pull your vid card, then reseat it, pwr back on and boot, see if that helps

    <title>Exe. Not launching, all signs point to fault with MS Systems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjrdhorn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exe. Not launching, all signs point to fault with MS Systems</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, I know this sounds like a Game issue and thus not necessarily a Microsoft matter but please bare with me as I could do with any assistance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having a very frustrating issue for the last 3 days with a game called Grand Theft Auto 5. WIth this game you can get mods, a user developed modification of the game changing how it works or adding more to the base game. I have been after one
 called LSPDFR. This requires a application known as RAGE Plugin Hook, aptly named as all it has done has cause me rage. It is in the developers own words, "<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">&nbsp;a library enabling developers to write
 plugins for games powered by the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Advanced_Game_Engine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RAGE engine</a><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;To
 run it you require:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A legal copy of Grand Theft Auto V or other supported game.</li><li>Either of the following operating systems:
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 with Service Pack 1</li><li>Windows 8</li><li>Windows 8.1</li><li>Windows 10</li></ul>
</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6</a>, or higher.</li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13523" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (x64)</a></li></ul>
<p>Now when I installed it all correctly the first time, the Application opened fine, however something went wrong upon attempting to launch the game. From there it then Un-dated itself to a previous version, and no matter how many times i over-wrote the files
 it remained an older version for some uinknown reason. Then it broke entirely. Then whenever I started it, it would come up with the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'The application could not be started. Do you want to view information about this issue?'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon clicking yes, it takes you to this page: --&gt;&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2715633</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which, if you scroll down to the appropriate area, states that this error is because it is 'N<span>ot configured
 in a way that makes it possible to determine the appropriate version of the .NET Framework runtime. The corresponding shim code is&nbsp;</span><span>SHIM_NOVERSION_FOUND</span><span>.'
 It then goes on to say that the resolution is this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>'</span><span>You
 can't fix the configuration problem yourself. Contact the app vendor to resolve the issue.'</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I contacted the team who made it. We went through every possible thing it could be. I am not new
 to modding so uninstalled my game and all mods, reinstalled clean and then went through the process perfectly, still the same error. I then double checked my Comodo Internet Security,excluded the GTA V folder, along with checking all Microsoft Software is
 up to date, which it is. I even unistalled it and reinstalled it, still to no avail. I updated to the latest Windows 10 update, i checked background MS software. Myself and the developers are stumped as to what the problem is. The developer asked me to post
 in the Microsoft Forum about my issue as he reckons it is an OS failure. It sure looks that way as to me it seems Framework is the issue, judging by the error code. I have no idea what to do and am desperate for help!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any of your help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,&nbsp;</p>
<p>

                    <p>Even after following the instructions to unplug all external drives, etc., I have attempted 3 times to install Windows 10 on my desktop computer (which is attached to a scanner, printer, and 2 external hard drives) and continue to get an error message: C1900101-30018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to do this with the online download so as to not have to go through the hassle of reinstalling all of my programs again.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>The "Installing features and drivers" phase is the trickiest part of upgrade. If you see a failure c1900101 x300xx, it means we failed during this phase. The most common failure is x30018, which generally means a driver crashed when we loaded it for the
 first time. Any driver could cause the failure, but it may not crash 100 percent of the time. If you try again, it may just work.</p>

    <title>My laptop keyboard layout has changed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louism123  say:</h3>
<h2>            My laptop keyboard layout has changed.</h2>
                    My 2 year old had changed my keyboard layout somehow and I don't know how to reset it.<br />
Several keys now need the Fn key pressed at the same time to bring up the correct letter. If the Fn key is not used then a number will appear instead i.e&nbsp; pressing the 'i' key without the Fn key returns '5'. The number keys still appear to work normally. Is
 there a way to reset the keyboard layout to a default setting?. The problem pc is a laptop.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like the fn key is stuck. You can try rapping on it to loosen it or pry the cap off and pull it up. If it fails to release, you may need to have it replaced. If it's under warranty, it's best to have the manufacturer do it.

<h3> fbarker  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 not recognising nvidia GeForce 8600M GS graphics card</h2>
                    <p>I would very much like some help please. The problem is this:-</p>
<p>I have a Pegasus 655 laptop from Rock (now in administration with Stone group)</p>
<p>It has a Nividia GeForce 8600M GS graphics installed.</p>
<p>I have just upgraded the laptop to run Windows 7 HP from Win Vista HP.</p>
<p>Installation was a clean install and went without any problems, and have Win 7 SP1 installed.</p>
<p>I have managed to find most drivers, which are working ok, except the driver for my graphics card which is not recognised.</p>
<p>The one pointed to is 285.62. &nbsp;I have tried different drivers from Nvidia but to no avail.</p>
<p>All I get is this:- "Nvidia installer can not continue. The graphics driver could not find compatible graphics hardware."</p>
<p>I run my laptop on a cooler, so don't think temperature is a problem.</p>
<p>Has anyone got a solution? any help appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SORRY - The model of laptop is a Pegasus 665 not 655.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>That appears to be the latest driver for that device in Windows 7?</p>
<p>If this is not working, I would recommend contacting the computer manufacturer or ask this question on the nVidia Forums. They should be aware of any issues with the device.</p>

SORRY - The model of laptop is a Pegasus 665 not 655. 


I have the drivers for when my laptop was running vista HP. and the Windows upgrade advisor didn't raise the Nvidia graphics as an issue. I have tried running the driver in compatibility mode for Win7 HP SP1 but with no success. 



I have phoned Rock support but they say since my laptop was originally speced with vista HPand have since upgraded to win7 HP, they can't offer me any support! - how **** is that !! :-( 



Have looked on the Nvidia site also, but alot of people are reporting problems with this card and also the GT version.  Even when people seem to get the card working they are reporting things ranging from blue screening, freezing issues and problems during gaming sessions. 


Some people have pointed to moded drivers as a solution, but am not that computer savy to understand what they do or how they work, or indeed if they could damage my computer. (as I've read in several forums.) 


If there is no solution without risk to

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Yeah, I would highly recommend against trying any modified drivers ever. Of course there is a chance they could work. There's also an equal chance it could do some damage.
<br />
<br />
I've also noticed on the Rock support page that the supported OS is only listed as Windows XP. That would explain a lot, since the supported range for this computer spans two generations of Windows operating systems.
<br />
<br />
At this point, I think the <span style="font-style: italic">easiest</span> thing to do is to revert back to Vista. However, that is clearly not ideal, so if you want to continue the search for the correct drivers, your best bet will probably be with NVIDIA themselves.
 Perhaps there is a generic driver that will do the trick, if not one specific for your computer. Either way, that's where I'd be asking.

            <p>Hi Josh - thanks for your advice. I feel very disapointed at both Rock and Nvidia about the lack of support and solutions. Looking at Nvidea forums in general, alot&nbsp;Nvidea drivers seem&nbsp;to have problems installing.</p>
<p>However I would rather have a computer that works albeit a little slow than one that's been fried&nbsp; due to an incorrect or moded driver, that could prove rather expensive.</p>
<p>And I feel disapointed that potentially the only way to get windows 7 working properly would be to purchase a new computer, despite the spec on my&nbsp;laptop being more than adequate, and windows upgrade advisor&nbsp;not raising this problem as an issue.</p>
<p>I hate the disposable consumerist society!&nbsp; Of course if anyone knows anything different, please enlighten me, and the hundreds of other people struggling with this or similar Nvidea&nbsp;issues!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help Josh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Nvidia, direct, do not support drivers created by PC makers, Nvidia provides the chipset and the PC maker creates their own drivers, which are specific to their individual PC's</p>
<p>Usually the Vista 8600 driver that rock provides would function under win7 - but no guarentees.</p>

            <p>Fraid not in this case at any rate. - Had a real battle with Rock over this. they will not support this laptop with win 7. Said the computer was not tested with win7. spent over 600 quid with them and not impressed at their customer service over this issue.</p>
<p>No - &nbsp;in any case I would expect Nvidea driver that I'd been directed to to work!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm a 3D Builder engineer. In the most recent update of 3D Builder we added a light theme. 3D Builder used to only have a dark theme, but now 3D Builder reflects your systems default theme selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to Settings -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Colors -&gt; Choose your default app mode -&gt; Dark you will see the old 3D Builder theme that you are used to and seem to prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>

<h2>            Siemens Solid Edge 2019 does not work on Windows 1903</h2>
                    <p>I am using the professional CAD program Solid Edge of Siemens version 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is specially designed to run on Windows 10.</p>
<p>However up to Windows version 1809 I was able to run it without any problems.</p>
<p>Then the 1903 update came and it suddenly won't start anymore with the message that the application environment cannot be started.</p>
<p>I know that the program is very precise in its software environtment to operate well. But i cannot find a reason why it doesnt work.</p>
<p>I am having a Nvidia Quadro 600 video card as well which is good enough.</p>
<p>The support of SE does also not know the reason for this problem.</p>
<p>Is there a way to set all the graphical software and other supporting (Direct X or whatever) back to the situation of 1809 or earlier?</p>
<p>Windows is pushing to update to 1903 on other computers as well but now I know I have to block it for installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know the Windows environmental settings that are required to run Solid edge 2019 propperly?</p>
<p>thanks in advance.</p>

<p>The most recent version of Solid Edge is particular about it's system requirements, which you can find
<a href="https://solidedge.siemens.com/en/resources/system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. As you'll see, it won't run on Windows 10 Home and it won't run on Microsoft Edge. It won't run on a 32-bit computer. You'll need 6.5 GB of free disk space to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer meets the system requirements and yet you still cannot run the application, you should post in the
<a href="https://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Solid-Edge-Forum/bd-p/solid-edge-forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thank you for your suggestion to look at the graphics driver.</p>
<p>However the current driver is of January 2018 so it was already there with 1803 and 1809.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- it does not happen with other applications. Solid edge is a sensitive program when it comes to the graphical environment. It is a 3D CAD program.</p>
<p>- It has nothing to do with microsoft Edge, only for help information it calls for Microsoft Edge.<br />
- I have HP desktop PC with an Intel Core to Quad 64 bit with 4GB of memory. This has never been a problem and the program was not updated after Windows 10 was upgraded to 1903.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No, talking to Siemens, although their agency, they state that they are aware of the problem. Some machines did not have problems after the upgrade to 1903 others, like mine and yours, do have a problem.</p>
<p>Currently there is no maintenance pack after 7 that would cope with this problem. So they say, roll back to 1809 if you can or reinstall Windows 10 with 1809.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried several settings inside windows 10 regarding graphics or desktop settings and changing settings in my Nvidia configuration panel of the graphics card. But actually I am just guessing as I have no indication at all what causes the problem.</p>
<p>It would be great if there was some kind of error log inside Solid edge that would give a direction where to find the cause.....</p>
<p>I made the stupid mistake to remove the previous version 1809 before I tested to start Solid edge 2019, so I cannot go back. Reinstalling 1809 is a lot of work with all the other programs and settings I made. So for now I work on my laptop with 1809 and
 Solid Edge.</p>
<p>Siemens would keep me informed if there is any progress in solving this issue.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Jeroen, good to see you here.</p>
<p>I believe your issue has been solved lately, but for others who might have the same problem and stumble upon this page:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avast and AVG Antivirus (/Internet Security) seem to conflict with Solid Edge on Windows 10 1903. Removing these programs seem to instantly fix the problem. Disabling is not enough, you WILL have to remove it. From that moment, you will fall back to the
 built-in Windows Defender (pretty good and free).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until there's an official fix, I would propose this as a workaround. This way, a re-install to 1809 is not necessarry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, please use the Solid Edge Community Forum or open a call with your&nbsp;<span>Solid Edge reseller.</span> Also, if you are running a different AV than AVG or Avast, and removal of that software fixed your issue, then please let
 your Solid Edge reseller know. They will pass it on to Siemens. It helps troubleshooting. And: check regularly for the latest Solid Edge Maintenance Pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Douwe</p>

<p>Hello Douwe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this update and you are one step ahead with notifying me about this because I was the one who found out, after the tip of Siemens about AVG, that Avast was the problem, as I was running that AV application. And I informed Siemens last week about
 it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried several settings but the only solution seems to be a total uninstall of Avast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who is to blame for this problem is hard to say; Microsoft's change to 1903, Avast or Solid Edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your input on this matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can close this discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeroen.</p>

    <title>WildTangent Game Console problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melmiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            WildTangent Game Console problem</h2>
                    
<p>This is how my problem started.&nbsp; My Wildtangent game console (the current version) was stuck finalizing install on one of the games.&nbsp; Because of this I could not install any other game from the console.&nbsp; I could play installed games but nothing else.&nbsp; I
 contacted Wildtangent and after updating and reinstalling Internet explorer, adobe flash, all of my drivers nothing worked.&nbsp; So we tried uninstalling the console and reinstalling.&nbsp; Now the game console will not install from their website.&nbsp; The box comes up
 to install but it is blank and nothing happens.&nbsp; The last effort was to update my security features.&nbsp; Did that and no go.&nbsp; They assured me it was a security problem on my computer and to contact the provider for help. I have no other problems.&nbsp; Can anyone
 help?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Have you tried cleaning out your Temporary Internet Files, Cookies, and browsing history, in your Browser?&nbsp; The same question concerning your Temp folder too, you can do it by typing %temp% in the Start Menu RUN box.&nbsp; This will open your Temp folder, there
 you can delete everything that Windows will allow you to do so.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to show Both Hidden and System Files, and also to uncheck "Hide known file types" in Control Panel/ Folder Options/ View, to navigate to the mentioned Temp location.</p>
<p>On the WildTangent download is there any Setup.exe?&nbsp; &nbsp; Try right-clicking on the actual Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>
<p>Have you tried using another user to check if you are seeing a corrupt user profile type of problem?</p>
<p>Disabling temporarily running anti virus software might be worth a try?</p>

<p>Try running ChkDsk to check your drive for errors. Right-click your Drive icon/ Properties/ Tools/ Error Checking.&nbsp; Try it first by not checking either box (Read-only mode) to see if it flags any hard drive or file problems.&nbsp; If it does, start by ticking
 both boxes, in any further rerun.</p>
