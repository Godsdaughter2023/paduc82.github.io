    <title>Is it impossible to run file explorer as administrator under Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is it impossible to run file explorer as administrator under Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>After install Windows 10, it seems that I lost the ability to run explorer.exe as administrator with a user in administrator group.
</p>
<p>For example, start command prompt under administrator mode and subst a drive. The substed drive is not visible within the file explorer since it is run not as administrator.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e4f0e91-84c0-4932-a794-1a3676213013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e4f0e91-84c0-4932-a794-1a3676213013" /></a></p>
<p>I was able to run explorer.exe from task manager with the option "create with privileges" checked and then I can see all the drives in explorer. But now this is not working anymore.
</p>
<p>I knew there are other options to workaround it, but just want to make sure that if it is now totally impossible under Windows 10?</p>
<p>Any comment is appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can run Explorer as admin in a couple of ways.&nbsp; You can set a short cut to run as Admin, etc</p>

            <p>Hi Shinjind,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how I did this...</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the .\Windows folder</li><li>Search for "explorer.exe"</li><li>When found, right click and select "copy"</li><li>On the desktop right click and select "Paste shortcut"</li><li>Close the Windows Explorer window</li><li>Right click the shortcut and select "Advanced..."</li><li>On Advanced Properties, check the box "Run as administrator"</li><li>Click OK</li><li>Click OK</li></ol>
<p>You will now have a shortcut on your desktop that will run Windows Explorer as Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>When I run that ADVANCED option as described the Run as administrator choice is grayed out (not available to choose) and the box is unchecked. The same is true for the Run in separate memory space option but that on is checked already. I am the only user
 on my system which is a standalone, not-networked device. I'm pretty certain the HOMEGROUP icon is in my tree but I don't use HOMEGROUP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This system is up to date as of today 14Feb2017 and the updates include all microsoft product like my Office Student Suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous help screen tell me I have to check that Run as administrator box, which I cannot do because it is grey out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've paced back and forth between the two help sheet and cannot find any hints or tips to overcome the grey out Run as Administrator limitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So before I get out the light fluid and torches to send this thing to Hades can anyone offer me the correct workaround. I am told I need to run File Explorer as administrator in order to correct a problem with document and setting that are claimed to be
 part of a problem set which is causing my Excel 2007 to corrupt my 2003 files. (The opened twice quiet well but as I saved and re-saved and saved backjup that data corrupted each time &nbsp;I've go a twelve sheet wide collection of lists and table upon which functions
 are to operate on their respective range names (The range names are easily within the 255 character length and are mostly full column reference i.e. =(Sumif(newpartsreceived,$A:$4, newpartsinbins)) expecting Excel to check newpartrsreceied for the cells with
 the value in stored in $A$$, and then sum the values in newpartsinbins &nbsp;I wrote this as a =SUMIFS( &nbsp;as well and get the VALUE# ERROR IN THE CELL WITH THAT FORMULA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what go me headed down this path was a Microsoft Community help sheet that was helping to deal with a constant, chronic, unrelenting excel 2007 startup crash every time I tried to opened a 2003 compatible &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now, here I am, nearly blind from working the screen for twelve hours and I am now I'm at the point in that procedural steps that tell me &nbsp;to open the advanced properties in the after opening the Shortcut tab in File Explorer Properties. Like I said I
 cannot put a check mark in the Run as administrator because it is grey out (as in not available to chose) &nbsp;I'm stuck in this tiny closet of the digital maze. ANY IDEAS?What I am missing? What is the idiot checks I need to reexamine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help! It's not a small project as it will interrelate with two separate workbooks once it[s running cherry. I really need to revover the last workable worksheet I had at 9am today (Tues, Feb 14 2017)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong>Are you setting the
<strong><span>Peer Name Resolution Protocol services (PNRPsvc) or the Peer Networking Identity Manager services (p2pimsvc) to manual or automatic?</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are setting the services to Manual then I would suggest you to set the service to Automatic and check whether that helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Click
 on Start button and type Services in the Start search box and press Enter.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Locate
 the Peer Name Resolution Protocol services (PNRPsvc) or the Peer Networking Identity Manager services (p2pimsvc), set it to Automatic by right clicking the
<span>&nbsp;</span>service and selecting properties and changing the Startup type to Automatic.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to try a clean boot and check whether the issue persists in clean boot.</span></strong></p>
<p>It might be some background process that is running on the system is causing this problem. I would suggest you to do a clean boot and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration
 Utility.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password or click Continue&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the General tab, click Selective Startup and then click to clear the Load startup items check box.
 (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box and then click Disable
 all</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Note: </strong>Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may
 permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.</p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Click start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</p>
<p><span>If the issue is resolved check which third party program is causing this issue</span>. For further reference check the article mentioned below.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>It might be that the PNRP svc and p2pimsvc is corrupt, deleting the entry might help you resolve your query. Check in the following location and delete the file idstore.sst</p>
<p>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking\idstore.sst</p>

<h2>            Realtek HD Audio Manager doesn&#39;t work after resetting my Windows 10 laptop back to factory status</h2>
                    <p>A few weeks ago I had to restore my laptop (which came with Win10 already installed) back to factory state because of problems with an update.&nbsp; My laptop is now back to full working condition, except for my audio drivers. Basically, my windows audio manager
 only shows my speakers on playback devices, and my laptop mic on recording. When I connect my headset, no devices are added to the list, although the headset still works. I tried installing the Realtek HD Audio Manager through their website (because it wasn't
 installed after the reset) but even after installing it, I couldn't get it to open and after I unplugged my headset once, it stopped being recognised as my laptop and working. Help, please? I want to be able to switch between my laptop and headset mic like
 I could before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo IdeaPad 320-15IKB, Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They're in spanish, but this is how my audio tabs look now. I used to have my headset mic always showing up underneath the laptop one on the second screenshot but now it just takes it's place when it's plugged in. Also, I didn't use to have that second icon,
 which reads "Stereo Mix", whatever that is. From what I've been able to see, it just plays back my computer sounds.</p>

            Hi,
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />1. Check all the Volume Controls:
<br />First, check every volume control for programs. There are usually other volume controls that will override the Windows 10 speaker. 
<br />
<br />Right-click the speaker icon on the system tray and select Open Volume Mixer to open the window directly below. Then you can raise the audio slider for third-party software open on the task bar if the volume is too low.
<br />
<br />Run the Windows Audio Troubleshooter
<br />If you’ve increased all the volume controls and the sound is still too low, open the Playing Audio troubleshooter. Windows 10 includes the Playing Audio troubleshooter that can resolve numerous volume issues 
<br />
<br />Click the Cortana button to open Windows 10’s search box.
<br />Enter the keyword ‘troubleshooter’ in the search box.
<br />Click Troubleshoot to open the Settings window
<br />
<br />Select the listed Playing Audio troubleshooter, and press the Run the troubleshooter button to open the window.
<br />
<br />Then the troubleshooter might detect and fix the audio issue. If the troubleshooter fixes something, you might also need to restart Windows for the changes to take effect.
<br />
<br />2. Check the Selected Playback Device:
<br />If you have multiple playback devices, check the one you need sound on is the default device. You can do that by right-clicking the speaker icon on the system tray and selecting Playback devices. That will open the window directly below that lists playback devices. Right-click the one that needs to be the default playback device and select Set as Default Device.
<br />
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />3. Select the Equalization Setting
<br />If the volume level is inconsistent in Windows, some software sound will be somewhat lower than what it could be. The Loudness Equalization setting can make a difference. This option ensures more consistent volume across all programs, which will increase the average audio level. 
<br />
<br />Right-click the speaker system tray icon and select Playback devices.
<br />Then right-click your default speakers and select Properties to open the window and then, Select the Enhancements tab &gt;&gt; Select the Loudness Equalization option.
<br />Click the Apply and OK buttons to close the window.
<br />
<br />4. Restart the Sound Controller:
<br />Restarting the sound controller might help resolve volume that’s too low in Windows. You can restart the sound controller (or card) by pressing the Win key + X hotkey to open the Win + X menu.
<br />Select Device Manager on the Win + X menu.
<br />Double-click Sound, video and game controllers to expand the list of audio devices
<br />Right-click your active sound controller and select Disable device.
<br />Press the Yes button on the dialog box window to confirm the selected option.
<br />Wait .a few minutes, and right-click the disabled sound controller and select Enable.
<br />Then restart the Windows OS.
<br />
<br />5. Update the Audio Driver:
<br />May your sound card’s driver needs updating. Updating an antiquated sound card driver can resolve numerous audio issues. This is how you can update an audio driver in Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Open the Win + X menu with the Win + X hotkey.
<br />Click Device Manager to open the Device Manager window.
<br />Double-click Sound, video and game controllers to expand its pertinent devices.
<br />Right-click the listed sound card and select Update driver. 
<br />Click Search automatically for updated driver software to automatically update the audio driver.
<br />Reboot your laptop or desktop if Windows updates the driver.
<br />Even if Windows doesn’t update the driver, you might still find a more update driver on the sound card manufacturer’s website. Right-click the sound card listed in Device Manager and select Properties to open the window.
<br />Open the website of the manufacturer listed on the General tab shown directly above.
<br />Click a Download hyperlink on the site or enter your sound card in a driver search box to find a compatible audio driver.
<br />Select to download an update audio driver that’s compatible with your 32 or 64-bit Windows platform.
<br />Add the update audio driver to Windows by opening the folder you saved it to and launching its setup wizard.
<br />Restart Windows after updating the driver.

<p>It's not a volume problem, that works perfectly. My problem is that my headset doesn't work unless i have it plugged in from the moment I start my computer up, and if I unplug it it won't work again until the next boot up. Also, I can't change which microphone
 I'm using, Windows decides that for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The circle indicates that you PC is working on something - this used to be a hour-glass on previous versions of Windows (you can select what the pointer looks like in Control Panel-&gt;Mouse.</p>
<p>The fact that your page is moving up and down (and sometimes it can be other things too) is just a symptom of your PC lagging behind on previous instructions you have given to it via or mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>Basically when this happens, just wait a moment without touching either mouse or keyboard for your PC to catch-up with itself - patience is a virtue.</p>
<p>If the cursor stays busy for a protracted period of time then either the program or Windows may have crashed. Press CTRL + ALT + DEL and try ending the offending program. NOTE: If you end the program this way you will lose any unsaved data in that program.
 If your system is completely unresponsive, even to a CTRL + ALT + DEL then you will have to power down and reboot your PC. NOTE: If you do this you will lose all unsaved data in all programs. Hopefully your PC will reboot - if it doesn't then you will be into
 Startup Repair territory.</p>

            It could also be the case that you have pressed the mouse wheel (or the middle mouse button) by accident. When this happens, a circle appears where the mouse cursor was, and now you can move the page up and down by moving your mouse up and down. To make
 it to go away, simply click any&nbsp;blank area of the page with any button.

            NO, I don't think this is the&nbsp;correct answer. I have the same problem, a grey circle with 4 darker grey crescents inside. It apears on the curser and causes the page to scroll rather than move the curser.

<h2>            Wifi Tab not showing in settings</h2>
                    Hi, I am having a problem with my desktop computer, I had this computer connected through an Ethernet cable earlier today but we needed to move the router to a different location so I was planning on using the Wi-Fi from that router on my windows 10 computer,
 but for some reason it does not show up anywhere on my computer. I know there is Wi-Fi on the router because I can connect to it with my phone and a laptop as well. For whatever reason there is no Wi-Fi tab under settings or even the networking and sharing
 center. Is there any possible way to connect to Wi-Fi from this computer without reinstalling windows 10 and hoping it shows up?

            Thanks for replying, fortunately i have figured out what was causing the issue, apparently when i had the computer built, they did not add the hardware for me to access wifi, so i went out and bought a wifi stick and now i can connect to the internet.

<h2>            Windows 7 sound and video glitches</h2>
                    Whenever I try to watch a video, whether it be online or a DVD I put right into the DVD drive, about every 5 minutes the picture and sound will stop and repeat the same sound/picture over and over again for a few seconds then keep on going normally.&nbsp; This
 just started to happen a couple weeks ago.&nbsp; It isn't just videos it's also my music files on ITunes that are doing it too!&nbsp; It has nothing to do with my internet connection, my anti-virus is up to date and my computer is clean, and my drives don't need to
 be defraged.&nbsp; I'm not sure what is causing the problem and I would like to fix it!

<p>I believe all versions since XP have had telemetry, though, as you've seen in 10 it can use your CPU a lot while it is running. There's not a lot you can do about it.
</p>
<p>There are settings in the All Settings, Privacy, and Feedback &amp; Diagnostics where you can reduce the amount of sharing it does which may (or may not) decrease its use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I still get it at pretty much every cold boot, but it seems to have eased up a bit??</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Not sure why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is pretty much answered though, I have been doing some reading and there is a way to deactivate it but, I'll just let it ride for awhile and see what happens. IF it gets worse I'll be sure and let you know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Ya see that's what I was trying to say in my first post, this should not be doing this at EVERY cold boot?? I have 15 computers at work that I maintain and we use them EVERY day, most have winds 10 some windows 7, and NONE of them do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I was starting to just ignore it BUT It just did it again tonight when I came home from work,&nbsp; I started up my rig and MCT ran my CPU at about 20 to 40% for the first 15 minutes my system was on!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I knew this wasn't normal, I have had windows Vista, windows 7, windows 8, 8.1 and now 10 and THIS has never happened before just starting about a month ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I'd like to know exactly what the hell is this taking from my PC??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have to give MS a call!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: I do have my MS account (and Cortana) tied to my phone and set to download any pictures I take on my phone to my OneDrive and then sync it to my PC and that picture folder is getting kind of full, maybe this is it?</p>

<p>&nbsp;This is what I see at almost every cold boot for about the last month, actually I don't know when it exactly started, but sometime in Jan 2018:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It does this for/from about 10 to 15 to 20 mins max, does this look normal?</p>

            Hi  TheExiledDraco 
<br />
<br />Sorry for the difficult time you are having.
<br />
<br />First check if you have Focus Assist in the system tray area of the Taskbar turned on. If it is, this might be blocking notifications. Turn it off.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Microphone
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />Still not working? Try uninstall then reinstall Skype again:
<br />
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.34.0.78.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.

First make a restore point and a backup. Because I'm not 100 percent but this may be the issues.
<br />
<br />
After you have backed your stuff up delete this folder \users\xxx\Appdata\Roaming\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA (you will need to show hidden files and folders for this) ..<br />
<br />
Got this from this link,, soooooooo do so at your own risk, I've never deleted it<br />

<p>Since you forgot to tell us anything about your computer, I can only speculate. Before anything else:</p>
<p>The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?</p>
<p>1. I'm assuming this is a laptop, but of course I could be wrong. If my CrystalBall(tm) was cloudy and this is a desktop computer, try a different keyboard.</p>
<p>2. Reinstall the keyboard drivers. If this is a laptop, get them from the laptop mftr.'s website. Some OEMs have specialized keyboard software like HP's QuickLaunch and Dell's Quick Set which affect the FN function. Make sure all utilities like that are
 installed.</p>
<p>3. Perhaps you have a specialized keyboard with the F-lock function? Is Numlock on? This doesn't usually affect the FN keys but it's worth a mention.</p>
<p>4. If drivers/utilities are up-to-date and this is a laptop, connect a USB external keyboard. If the problem goes away, contact the laptop mftr. for a keyboard replacement.</p>
<p>If this doesn't help or you have more questions:</p>

    <title>Hard drive failed&#47;reinstall windows 10 on new hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william akers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard drive failed&#47;reinstall windows 10 on new hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 Home from Windows 7 Home. I've had it installed for a little over a year now, and recently my hard drive failed due to a corrupted boot sector. I don't have the recovery discs for Windows 7, but I do have a product key. My question
 is do I use the Win 7 product key so I can upgrade to Win 10, or do I need the Win 10 product key? I've also backed up my files, documents, etc. on an external hard drive, but unfortunately it only went to 96% when the hard drive failed. Any advice is greatly
 appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks....</p>

<p>Thank you for your prompt response. It does answer my question, but how do I get/retrieve the digital license, since I have a Product key for Windows 7 (original windows os) AND Windows 10? Also, just to let you know, this is Suzanne, William's wife. I am
 the one with the issue on my pc, so I'm on my husband's desktop...I'm unable to even boot up. I have a Repair Disc for Windows 10 CD which &nbsp;isn't helping since I need to replace the hard drive...Just wanted a heads up on what I must do to get Windows 10 reinstalled
 and back up running...</p>

<p>I wish to send emails from an alias address, different than my Gmail or Microsoft accounts,</p>
<p>but I can't figure out how to enter that new address into Windows 10 Mail's "From" field.</p>
<p>The email address I want to use as an alias is forwarded, so I can't set up POP or IMAP.</p>

            I really want to drop my gmail, so I changed my Microsoft account alias to be my outlook account.&nbsp; But, in the Windows 10 Mail it is still sending email from my "gmail" account despite it being connecting to my outlook account.&nbsp; How can I force it to use
 my primary alias which is my outlook.com account instead of my gmail.com account?

            I haven't figured out a way to change the from address in the email app. You can still use this feature if you sign into email using the browser. The browser version of Outlook will allow you to choose from any of the alias's listed, and use them as a
 from address when sending an email.

            <p>Same Here. I actually created new 'aliases'; but in Gmail which lets you set up several independent 'addresses' so W10-Mail can set them up as different 'accounts' within a linked inbox. Voila, 4 'aliases' within my 'inbox' any of which can be selected when
 clicking 'New Mail'. (An automatic dropdown to choose which account the mail is coming from.) - Obviously this will not work for people with established aliases. I was 'fortunate' I hadn't been using aliases for&nbsp;long so there was little cost to the change.
 (And, hypothetically, any email to the old aliases should still get to my primary Outlook account.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that we have to jump through this many hoops to get W10-MS-Apps to work as well as W8-MS-Apps is utterly ridiculous. Their Mail-aliases backstep&nbsp;is only surpassed by their OneDrive Dis-Integration (where there are also inelegant inadequate change-how-you-work
 work-arounds), and their truly bizarre inability to cut-and-paste from/to Edge/Mail/etc.

            <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just recently decided to join the Win10 wagon and have finally finished setting up and synchronizing my accounts. Was also wondering where the drop-down button for account/aliases went...but after going through this thread, I suppose this issue with
 the Win10 Mail app&nbsp;has yet to be resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Gmail&nbsp;work account and an Outlook&nbsp;personal account, all managed through my Outlook account using the Win10 Mail app.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;Win8,&nbsp;I have&nbsp;set my work address as the primary From address (seeing as&nbsp;email traffic is heavier there) and had no trouble
 switching around, but this time with&nbsp;the Win10 Mail&nbsp;app&nbsp;I was unable to locate that drop-down button and&nbsp;I find&nbsp;this to be unnecessarily frustrating as I am therefore required to go and open my account via
<em>browser </em>just so I could switch From addresses. This problem is also ever present within the Win10 Phone Mail app,
<em>sigh</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on whether or not Microsoft is doing anything about this? Or is the Win10 Mail app meant to be mega basic as opposed to the Ms Outlook 2016 program? I mean, the Win10 Mail app goes as far as allowing you to play around with text format and&nbsp;everything
 (except for formatting your signature, which...c'mon now?), so I suppose Microsoft&nbsp;should also give us that drop-down button back...</p>

            <p>P.Morley, I'm not understanding you. Are your gmail and outlook accounts both linked in to one 'linked inbox'? If so, when you click 'New Mail' doesn't it make you choose which email account you want to send the mail from? (And extra step when we're used
 to having a default 'from' address but at least you get to choose the from account.) - Can't help with W10 phone as I don't use it.</p>

            <p>Hi JB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, my Gmail and&nbsp;Outlook email&nbsp;accounts are linked; my Gmail messages are forwarded to my Outlook, all managed&nbsp;using the Win10 Mail app. With Outlook.com browser and the Win8.1 Mail app, I was able to choose&nbsp;which email account I would like to send the
 email from,&nbsp;by clicking the drop-down button located right by the email address. I can't do this with the&nbsp;Win10 Mail app, no matter if I'm writing a New Email or responding; the button is not there and I can't seem to find it anywhere.</p>

            <p>Try setting up both the Outlook and Gmail accounts as separate/independent email accounts in the Win10 Mail app. Then in the app you create what it calls a linked inbox, i.e., emails to both accounts&nbsp;being displayed in a single inbox. For me after doing
 that whenever I click 'new mail' the 'choose account' option automatically pops up. The difference (I think) is that the app is now 'integrating' your emails not Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above should only take a few minutes to try and shouldn't mess with any of your settings in either account (online).</p>

            <p>Sorry Harshvardhan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>but your answer is completely unhelpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want to be able to set up an alias, or "From" address for an account in Win 10 mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I'm using a gmail account, which grabs email via POP from my office. (Gmail also has this set up as an alias).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gmail email address (also used as login credentials) is different from my office address, and I would like to set up a custom "from" address in my Mail app to send as my "office account".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could the Win10 client either grab Gmail aliases or let us set up a custom alias?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just the way it was possible years ago in win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            Win10 removed my XP, Vista, 7 &#38; 8 files plus my Compaq presario v5000 drivers &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a old Compaq Presario V5000 laptop that I use out in the shop sure its a tank but its built tough and is a irreplaceable sentimental gift&nbsp; . Here's my problem I really got attached to win 10 inside the house and on my business laptop so I decided
 to install 10 on my presario , OUCH.. unlike my others the win install wiped out my pre-installed XP, and my Vista, 7 &amp; 8 ( I won't miss 8)&nbsp; files including sys drivers all 4 windows.old folders are empty, all my personal back ups are good but none have a
 shadow copies . HP has no driver support and all the third party driver suppliers are crooked , so questions I got , are there special drivers needed for 10 on presario v5000 and thats why it wiped them ? and if not who sells original driver disks for it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>On a PC that was designed for XP the Windows 10 install would have been a clean install, wiping all data on the hard drive. What was the operating system running when you installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP are responsible for drivers and windows will try to install basic drivers but on hardware designed for XP they probably don't work as they should/if at all. If HP have Windows 7/8 drivers they may work in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You really should have checked for driver support before installing Windows 10. The drivers supplied only support hardware designed for Windows 7/8.</p>

<h2>            Movie trailers gone&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    Though every update seems to adulterate my xbox experience in some way, this one has threatened my devotion to xbox. What is up with removing the movie trailers section? Honestly, that is what got me to start exploring the marketplace and got me to spend
 tons of money on other apps and games. What a terrible marketing decision. Whoever approved that should be fired. And what's up with the Netflix app not having a "play from beginning" option? Are you guys just testing us to see if we will put up with undeserved
 punishment? I understand updates to seek out and ban people with illegally modified sustems, but stop pulling a "windows 8" on us (yes that's an insult). The cbox is not a smart phone and doesn't need to be over-simplified into a "one-touch" app system. Netflix
 was a great app... 2 years ago. You brought back the information promt screen but removed play from beginning. Do you want us to wear down the LT button on our controllers to gain and extra 0.01% revenue a year? Put the tr

<p>MS has no control over the Netflix app. All changes are made by Netflix themselves. So complaining here on the Xbox community forums, will get you absolutley no where.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And whether or not removing movie trailers was an MS call or not, who really cares. They are movie trailers/ Considering you could watch the same exact movie trailers on the youtube app through Xbox, BEFORE Xbox had the trailers on their video service, just
 makes it all asinine.</p>

<p>I feel you - I liked watching my trailers there because the video and sound quality was awesome, where as going through YouTube had been a headache getting low / mid quality cell phone trailers and fan trailers especially for the newest trailers released.
 I use You Tube as a last resort. In Xbox Video, they were there right before Halloween, then after advertising their Halloween movie sale (where they used to be) they just... disappeared. Ironic?</p>

<p>I think what people are interested in are the trailers for upcoming movies... not movies you can buy or rent in the store. I for one loved having the movie trailer section. It was very easy to just jump on Xbox Live and watch trailers for future movies that
 I may or may not have known about. I didn't have to go sit in front of a computer looking for the best quality version and watch it on a small screen with crappy speakers, not I could sit in front of my TV with surround sound with all these awesome trailers
 and just kill some time. Wish they would bring it back</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">As mentioned already, and I'm pretty sure the OP is talking about
<em>upcoming</em> movie trailers, they are removed in XBox Video.&nbsp; I for 1 am also very disapointed by this and would also like to see them return again.&nbsp; As for Vudu, I've rarely used it and see no reason why Vudu would have this type of movie section onsidering
 Vudu is for rentals last time&nbsp;I checked, and also from what I've seen not the best picture quality, either.&nbsp; Just saying.</span></p>

<p>Hi, well its certainly a router issue but I've had a look through the documentation for your router and its &nbsp;only very basic . I cannot see any settings that you could change to try to help resolve this. You could check to see if there is a later version
 of firmware available for the router, apart from that you may be looking at swapping out the router for one that supports multiple Xboxes with no issues (i.e. certified by Xbox Live)</p>

<p>DarksalkerBr =&gt; Sim. Para qualquer compra via site Xbox Live, tem que ser cartão internacional pois TODAS as "compras", são feitas nos EUA, mesmo que seja a Live Br.</p>
<p>Hrtz =&gt; Já vi várias pessoas relatando o mesmo problema. Pode ser algum problema no site da MS, mas em todos os casos, tenta verificar com a empresa do seu cartão de crédito, se ele não tem algum filtro para compras internacionais.</p>
<p>Muitos cartões colocam quando o cartão não é muito usado para compras internacionais.</p>
<p>Agora se não for isso, é problema com o site mesmo...</p>

It is highly doubtful that any Microsoft support representative would be calling you at home unless you called them first and requested assistance. Even in that case, they would only be calling you if you gave them your phone number and if your conversation
 was disconnected for some reason, or if they indeed had some need to terminate the conversation so they could spend time researching your issue, in which case they certainly would have told you that they will call you back. Those two scenarios are the only
 circumstances I can think of as to why Microsoft support folks would be calling you.<br />
<br />
I am also amused that this would even be an issue with a Windows XP update, unless there were some other underlying issues that either you are not aware of or including in your posting above. "Slow" is relative. A turtle is slow compared to a rabbit. However,
 the turtle is fast compared to a snail. See? <br />
<br />
In your case, you state that the support folks wanted to access your computer to assist you in fixing some issue that you believe was related to one of the automatic updates. Something like this would not happen at all unless you initiated contact with Microsoft
 Support folks in the first place. <br />
<br />
Considering the information you provided, and the way in which you constructed your thread here, it may very well be that the issue you were experiencing was too complicated for you to fix on your own. Regardless, in all of this, you have not really stated
 what you issue is beyond "slowing down".<br />
<br />
If you would like someone here to help you, please include in your next reply, a detailed description of your issue including the automatic update that you suspect is causing your system to slow down. I should also advise you that malicious software that you
 might have unknowingly encountered, could also be a culprit...and, your own maintenance habits could come into play especially if you were to tell us that you know nothing of how to run your cleanmgr or defrag utility.<br />

            I had the same call twice. &nbsp;Each time the call seems to be East Indian decent men and there is lots of noise in the background of other calls going on. &nbsp;The guy said &nbsp;that my operating system is slow because of an email. &nbsp; He said that I may have noticed
 some "blinking". &nbsp;Then he said I would have to speak to his supervisor. &nbsp;He asked me to go to my START button and press it to see if it said "computer" or "my computer". &nbsp;They asked if I had XP or Windows 7. &nbsp;Then they started to ask me to press keys on my
 keyboard - something to do with an "r". &nbsp;At which point I told them I would contact my Microsoft specialist. &nbsp;They were very insistent that I not hang up, but I did. &nbsp;On the first occasion, I told them my husband was a Microsoft specialist (not true but I
 do have a friend who is certified Microsoft). &nbsp;This did not deter them. &nbsp;I told them I would have to call them back and they gave me a phone number, which unfortunately I have

    <title>Video editor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allenbrodsky1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video editor</h2>
                    The new Windows 10 video editor no longer has blending. One cannot fade or perform other ways to visually move from one video or image into another without just bluntly from one to the next. Am I missing something or can I get back the previous video editor
 so I can be able to blend sequences together?

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />May I ask what app you are using to edit videos currently? The Photos app? 
<br />
<br />What was the previous video editor you used?

            I believe it was Windows 8, or perhaps it was Windows 10 and an update changed the video editor, the entire process is different now.

<h2>            How do I create a Shortcut or Macro to type my &#40;purposely lengthy&#41; machine &#40;Windows 7&#41; account password&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I purposely designed my personal "machine/account" password for our largest desktop PC to be&nbsp;long and&nbsp;not easily entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both my husband and I have administrative priveleges on this machine. &nbsp;He built this PC for his video business, (2 internal TB, one
 external TB drive), and it's&nbsp;his workhorse.&nbsp; I went onto the Windows 7 HELP - which is designed to go on-line if nothing pops up, to ask about creating&nbsp;a shortcut to enter the password, or if I should instead write a macro,&nbsp; but&nbsp;not one answer came back!&nbsp;
 There is no "native" help at all on this subject.&nbsp; I am retired now, but 10-12 years ago, writing a macro was a simple matter, and with the system I used at work, the start/stop macro keys were on the main menu!&nbsp; Why such a huge problem?&nbsp; Do macros require
 Java in Windows?&nbsp; It's only a matter of "keystroke recall", correct?</p>
<p>I could set my account so that it wouldn't even require a password to get onto the machine, but don't&nbsp;want to start that&nbsp;practice! I don't want to make my account available to just anyone, but find that this wicked password is a headache, and wish to write
 a shortcut instead of typing it each time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp; Knitallnighter</p>

            If you're thinking of creating a shortcut to supply your password while logging on to Windows - there isn't one because this would defeat the whole purpose of the password. Why have a long password if it can be generated by pressing Ctrl+Alt+P, for example?
 It then becomes a single-letter password!<br />
<br />
If you're thinking of a different password, please explain where exactly you would use it and why a shorter password would not have the same effect.<br />

<h2>            Too many tiles covering my dashboard image</h2>
                    <p>Is there anyway to remove the extra crap covering my screen? I do not need store adds or anything like that, I just want to be able to actually see my picture that I put in the background. &nbsp;I know that you can change tile transparency, but its just not doing it for me. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can I re-install Windows 7 Home Premium without losing my programs and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I re-install Windows 7 Home Premium without losing my programs and data&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my HP Pavilion DV9535us from its original Vista OS using a Retail Version of Windows 7 Home Premium versus HP's version and removed thier backup petition due to so many of their programs being replaced with new ones. Also, they claim their version
 is different than Window's version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something happened causing me to loose everything around 2/11/10 and Microsoft Technical Support reloaded it and all my programs and worked fine for a long time. Somewhere along the way in doing some Windows Updates (maybe the SP1, Microsoft Server 2008
 R2, or something caused my system not to be able to Windows Security Updates or Windows 7 Updates but allows me to do some updates, i.e. Office 7 updates, netframe updates, and an occasional security update.&nbsp; I get an error code of 80070643 each time on the
 updates it can't do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was advised to do the following: 1. Remove Microsoft Server 2008 R2 and was successful in doing so.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Remove SP1 and try installing a downloaded Home Premium w/o SP1.&nbsp; Could not remove SP1 in regular or safe mode getting error code 0X80071s91 stating
 "Transaction support resource manager not started or was shut down due to error".&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Ran sfc /scannow twice and both time said everything was working fine and no problems.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; I was told a repair could not be done until I have my operating system like the
 downloaded Home Premium Version w/o SP1 using program ImgBurn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want to do a "clean install" wiping out everything and having to load all the programs, updates, finding drivers, loosing some of my HP features, etc.&nbsp; This would take days to do and I probably would not get everything back to the way it was before
 the clean install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have a Restore Point that goes back to my problems when they first occurred.&nbsp; My next to last Restore point is 12/11 and the one before that is 12/10, which is so old it will drastically change programs, drivers, etc. and may not be able to retore
 everything or this restore point may not work at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions.</p>

<p><span>An in-place upgrade is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system.<br />
Note that it takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade as to reinstall the operating system. Also, some of your customized Windows settings may be lost through this process.</span></p>

            <p>I did the "Fix-It" you mentioned in Method 1-KB/976982.&nbsp; I have tried twice to do the method you mentioned for #2 and both times it gets to loading up all the programs and then says it was not successful and rolled back to the previous version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told the reason it didn't work was that I had to remove Windows Server 2008 R2 (which I did), but could not remove SP1 due to error code 0X80071a91.&nbsp; I was told these two had to be removed and dowload a "full version WIndows 7 Home Premium w/o SP1
 provided me that both the system and the DVD had to be the same OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was never able to remove SP1 to try the above repair or in-place upgrade due to the error above.&nbsp; How can I remove the SP1 with this error code?&nbsp; Also, my Home Premium is a "Upgrade Version" that I bought.&nbsp; I also have a "Full Retail Version of Home Premium
 w/SP1".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The previuos supporter seem to insist that I needed to use the Windows 7 Home Premium w/o SP1 and remove SP1 from my computer and Windows Server 2008 R2 first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since i have already tried the just mentioned, I am confused as to why you want me to do the Method 2 above until I can successfully remove SP1?&nbsp; I have also tried to install a the Full Version Home Premium w/SP1, while SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were
 both on my system and I still got the same roll-back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you suggest?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            When you reinstall windows it will move your User files to windows.old, but it will not move your programs, so you will have to manually reinstall all of your programs, but you can move their setup folders and files to your user folder. Windows.old will
 also contain the Windows system folder.

            <p>I have some more recent restory points dated only back to Dec. 2011, which was after I had all my problems with my computer and which appears to keep me from doing a repair install or an inplace install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a Dec. 2010, which is the only old restore for some reason I have that may be before I had problems described above.&nbsp; If this restore does not work or for some reason is not a good restore, will it mess up my computer or will I be able to return
 it to my current point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, I am sure there are several programs, drivers, updates, etc. that are on my current system and will they all be lost or have to be re-installed after it reverts to the old restore point? and also should it not work, will all these programs, drivers,
 updates, etc. function fine should I have to go back to my current restore point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what all changes going to a restore point and whether the corrupt Windows files will be corrected, allowing me to do the WIndows 7 Updates and Windows Security Updates&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>

            <p>only your personal files and folders are kept after a system restore so drivers, etc. will be lost, it tells you what programs you will lose in a table form.</p>
