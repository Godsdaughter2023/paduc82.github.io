    <title>Windows 10 installation keeps rebooting every few minutes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 installation keeps rebooting every few minutes</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Win 7 32 bit machine that is in the process of upgrading to Win 10. Everything downloaded, prepared etc without any problems. Installation ran smoothly up to about 97% when there was a brief error "KMODE EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED" without any additional
 information or code. The installation appeared to continue regardless but shortly after started a reboot loop. Every two minutes or so the machine restarts and has some disk activity before restarting again. This has gone on for many hours already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me either move on with the installation or move back to Win 7 with all my data and programs still there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frank</p>

<div>You must boot with a Vista installation media disk and not try to format the drive from within Vista in any manner.&nbsp; You would be cutting off the branch that you are sitting on and Vista won't allow that.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;As this is a new hard drive you had to have some way to install Vista onto it originally and that is the only way to reformat the drive and reinstall Vista.</div>

                    Picture thumbnails - these are o.k. on my computer but when I copy/burn them to a cd and try to view from<br />
the cd I only get the red flower or scene thumbnail.&nbsp; Initially my pictures show and then all the thumbnails<br />
revert to the flower etc.&nbsp; I can view these in the windows live picture gallery but this is rather a laborious way<br />
of viewing them.&nbsp; How can I change the&nbsp; settings to view my actual pictures please?&nbsp; I have tried all the methods<br />
suggested by various people but nothing works.

<p><span><span>Check with the Step 1 (Perform a clean boot):- if everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that

    <title>When&#47;how does netsh update its signal strength value&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexander gough  say:</h3>
<h2>            When&#47;how does netsh update its signal strength value&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm writing a Python script that collects the wifi signal strength from the shell using "netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid". This works nicely once, but then every successive time, the value gets stuck at the first value that was queried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't an issue with my scripting: when using the command in an actual command prompt, the same thing happens: each time the command is fired off, the same value is returned, even if the machine is taken very close/far away from the access point. Even
 closing and reloading the command prompt doesn't change the strength value. (this happens on both a Win8.1 laptop and a Win10 tablet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I've found to get a new reading is by clicking/tapping on the wifi icon in the notification tray. Each time I do this, the Python script or new command prompt command gets a new/different reading. What does clicking that icon actually do? Is
 there some netsh function that has the same effect? All of the netsh scan/list network functions have no effect on the signal strength reading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

    <title>Skype for Mac never starts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cnam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Mac never starts</h2>
                    <p>I tried to upgrade to the latest version of Skype for Mac a few months ago.&nbsp; After trying to solve a problem based on a number of suggestions here, the final advice after all those attempts was to go back to Skype Classic, since Skype for Mac didn't seem
 to be really ready for prime time.&nbsp; Now I cannot get logged in from Skype Classic, so I thought maybe by now the "new" Skype for Mac is more stable.&nbsp; Unfortunately it's still not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing the new Skype for Mac, I restarted my Mac and tried to start Skype.&nbsp; The window below comes up, with a spinning circle "loading" type symbol.&nbsp; That spinner just keeps spinning, and Skype never fully starts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the most recent version of macOS, Mojave 10.14.3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the version for Mac available from this page&nbsp;https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/, so I assume it's the latest version of Skype for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have also tried&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/contact-us/&nbsp; but the page never fully loads, so I can't contact anyone via that route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the Skype menu for "About Skype" to get the specific version.&nbsp; Nothing appears, other than just the window already open in the screenshot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on "Help - Go to support" from the Skype menu.&nbsp; Nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on "Help - Report a problem..." from the Skype.&nbsp; Nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi cnam
<br />
<br />Have you tried updating the software? To do so, follow the steps here <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541</a>
<br />
<br />Then uninstall Skype and reset your computer. After that try instaling the last version of Skype <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/</a>

<p>I have the most recent version of the OS: macOS Mojave 10.14.3 (18D109).&nbsp; I did go ahead and check System Preferences - Software Update and confirmed this is the most recent version and no update is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Skype itself from&nbsp;https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/&nbsp; just today.&nbsp; I assume that the version available from&nbsp;https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/ is the most recent version.&nbsp;</p>

            Ok but did you remove Skype completely and then reset your device? Then you can install Skype again. That happened to me around three days before.

<p>I have not removed Skype completely.&nbsp; I would not want to lose any of my chat history or contacts or anything else that might be local to my computer that would be lost if I removed Skype completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another route you are supposed to take to "upgrade" rather than "start all over"?</p>

            Sorry. I meant three days ago.<br /><br />You shouldn’t lose your chat history because that is all stored in your account on Skype. I did it and I found all my chats and contacts when I opened the new version.

            I found out the hard way that the chat history I was afraid of losing with a complete removal was in fact on the local hard-drive as I feared.&nbsp; Only one year of history is kept in the cloud.&nbsp;

<p>The upgrade process does not remove any local history. It simply does not utilize it. You can export any older 7.x history into web format using the export tool in the latest versions of Skype. The cloud retains ~2 years of history. I believe that history
 is around mid-April 2017 for the majority. You simply continue scrolling up periodically to view older history to that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many issues are due to current MacOS permissions or other faults that are negatively affecting Skype and other programs (lag/improper execution); not necessarily Skype itself. Here are a few possible solutions that can resolve this type of issue and other
 issues (not the authentication issue). Many people are successful with #2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a new macOS user, log into that account, try to use Skype. If this works, this proves an issue exists with the other account, possibly permissions or a startup program.</p>
<p>2. Attempt to repair any permission problem in the failing user's account home folder.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/HT203538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolve issues caused by changing the permissions of items in your home folder [apple.com]</a></p>
<p><span>Once repaired, try to use the latest version of Skype.</span></p>
<p>3. Attempt to remove every trace of Skype so that the latest version could be reinstalled without permission or other issues. This would include trashing and emptying any Skype named files located in the Application folder, ~/Library/Preferences, and what
 Finder could find. Be sure to retain a copy of any history files (main.db file and its folder), if you want to ensure exportation of older history.</p>
<p>4. Manually Install the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skype.com/mac.preview.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Preview version of Skype for Mac</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skype.com/mac.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Standard version of Skype
 for Mac</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes a scrolling blue window is due to firewall/antivirus settings. If that is the case try re-adding Skype on the list of accepted applications/exclusions to see if that rectifies the problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Actually, upon further investigation, Skype does NOT work in the newly created test user account.&nbsp; At first I thought it did only because when I clicked on it, instead of the loading spinner, there was a log in dialog, but I didn't try logging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just now switched back to the new account and actually tried to log in in that initial Skype window, and it's the same experience there at that point.&nbsp; After entering user id and password, there's still just the same spinner like the original screenshot.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> peter parslow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 automatic updates - can I use an external drive for the temporary space, and how&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have an Asus netbook ("flip") with a 32Gb SSD, which (given this is a new machine, trying it's first automatic update), basically only has Windows on it - so has about 10 Gb of free space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Update stops &amp; says it needs 20 Gb. I've read suggestions that the update can use an external drive - and in fact, my store's software support people advised this. My question is, how? I've attached a 1 Terrabyte NTFS USB disk, but the update
 "wizard" doesn't notice it.</p>

            <p>I can't see that this response bears any relationship to my query. Just in case, I ran the trouble shooter - no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, technical support at the store who sold me the little computer tell me that they've only had success using a USB "thumb drive", not a USB connected hard disk. Can't imagine why this should be. Now to find a 20 Gb+ thumb drive - or send the new
 machine back, as unable to run Windows (given that automatic updates is a built in feature, and hardly one I'd live without!)</p>

            <p>As usual, I've sorted it out myself (I'm not a Chartered Software Engineer for nothing!). In case anyone else has this problem, here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. use the Microsoft Update tool (from https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10) to build an ISO image, on the attached external hard drive. This took a while - hour or more?</p>
<p>2. use Windows' ability to mount the ISO image, and run the update from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this actually does in an entire re-install of Windows, so it takes hours &amp; involves several re-boots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shortly afterwards, Windows advised me to delete the old version, because I was running out of space. That done I now have slightly more space than before (10 Gb out of the 28.3 Gb that my "32 Gb SSD" actually presents to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem solved.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately Windows keeps growing - the Windows folder itself is now &gt; 15Gb!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now the problem is back with avengeance, because now the 'clean up tool' can only make 5.9 GB, and the Update tool says it needs 8 Gb free even just to make the ISO image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how to get the Windows Update tool to use temporary space somewhere other than on the C drive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's netbook has a little SSD as C drive, and half a Terabyte spare on D - why won't these programs use that automatically? Or at least have an option telling them to!</p>

<h2>            Date&#47;Time keeps going wrong.</h2>
                    I use Windows 7, 64 bit version, and recently the clock time keeps going wrong and sometimes the date also. I reset the date/time manually and by Updating the Internet Time option but the time soon falls behind and is wrong again. I cannot change the default
 setting which updates the Internet Time weekly. Can you help please?

<p>Auto time set only works if the current time in your system is close to actual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is likely the small coin cell battery (usually a 2032) has failed.&nbsp; They are constantly being recharged but last from 5 to 7 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a laptop, changing that battery is usually quite difficult (requires a lot of disassembly) and a special part from the OEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
There is a small shiny coin cell battery in your computer.&nbsp; It is almost always the standard 2032 .&nbsp; This battery is recharged by your computer but has a life of about 5 to 8 years.&nbsp; This battery keeps constant power to the memory that contains today’s date
 &amp; time as well as a lot of the features in your system.&nbsp; When it starts to fail, it commonly will start asking you to re-enter the date each time you startup.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
For Notebook PCs it is likely going to be difficult to find the battery and will require a special part, requiring the services of a technician.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
For Desktop computers, this is an easy change:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Unplug the power to your computer</li><li>
Hold the ON button in for 7 seconds</li><li>
Lay the computer on its side with the side where the wires are, down</li><li>
Remove the side panel</li><li>
Peer in there and you will see a shiny silver battery about 1/2″ in diameter.&nbsp; It looks like a quarter. &nbsp;That’s the battery</li><li>
Go to just about any store and buy a 2032 coin cell battery.&nbsp; They cost less than $5</li><li>
Find a very tiny flat bladed screw driver (like one used for your eyeglasses)</li><li>
Very carefully pry the battery loose.&nbsp; It will pop up so be prepared to catch it.</li><li>
Press the new battery in with the embossed markings on the up-side facing you.</li><li>
Close the side panel</li><li>
Turn it up vertical again</li><li>
Start up the computer</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Your computer&nbsp;will now need to have the date and time set but only once more — at least for this 5 years.&nbsp; You need to enter the BIOS, which you do by pressing F2 &nbsp;immediately on startup&nbsp;&nbsp;in most systems to get to the place where the date and time is stored.&nbsp;
 Put in current time and date.&nbsp; Close this the way it tells you to save what you did.&nbsp; You may hear more whirring and chugging while some of the stuff is again set up.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Once Windows is up and running again</p>
<ol>
<li>
Click once on the time/date in the bottom right corner</li><li>
Click on Change date and time settings</li><li>
Click Internet time</li><li>
Click change settings</li><li>
Select time.b.nist.gov and click the Update button — this will synchronize the computer clock with the US govt time labs system</li><li>

<p>Hi Canadian Tech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for taking the time to post such a comprehensive reply. Unfortunately, I do have a laptop and it seems probable that it would be very difficult to replace the 2032 battery. The system does not ask me to re-enter tha date on start-up and it does
 not affect the date/time shown on incoming or outgoing emails. However, filed emails pick up the date/time which is in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen and, as this is usually, wrong, these emails are not filed in date/time order (but I can live with
 that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>David (in England but owning a German laptop).</p>

<p>Hey ccprincess,<br />
<br />
Pressing the shift key 5 times triggers you whether you want to turn on Sticky Keys.</p>
<p>This option sets Sticky Keys to run when you log on to Windows. Instead of having to press three keys at once (such as when you must press the Ctrl, Alt, and Delete keys together to log on to Windows), you can use one key by turning on Sticky Keys and adjusting
 the settings.</p>
<p>Seems like you have enabled the same. This shouldn't possibly lock up the keyboard. Do the Fuction keys work?
<br />
<br />
You may try disabling sticky keys and other keyboard filters such as Toggle keys, Filter Keys from Ease of Access Center and see where it takes.</p>
<p>Refer:<br />
<br />
<strong>Make the keyboard easier to use<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Make-the-keyboard-easier-to-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Make-the-keyboard-easier-to-use</strong></a></p>
<p>If disabling those shortcut keys doesn’t solve your problem, try removing the battery from your laptop for few seconds.
<br />
<br />
Insert it back and start your laptop. This trick seems to have resolved most of the issues related to keyboard lockup. Hopefully this fixes yours as well.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Please do this at your own risk. If you are not convenient with the process, please contact your manufacturer or a technician for the same. Also, please check with your manufacturer if this voids the warranty.</p>

<h2>            Genius results can&#39;t be updated right now.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, this issue is related to Apple's iTunes and Windows 7.</p>
<p>I have my iTunes in 2 different PCs. One runs Vista Ultimate (no bitlocker) and the other 7 Enterprise (bitlocker).</p>
<p>When I try to turn Genius (an online playlits available in iTunes) on the W7 PC, it returns this message:&nbsp; Genius results can't be updated right now. The required file cannot be found. Please try again later.</p>
<p>When I perform the same task in the Vista PC, it works like a charm, no issues at all.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, this should be related to some kind of read/write protection that we have in W7 that we don't have in Vista.</p>
<p>I already tried to change the permissions in iTunes folders to "Full Control", but it did not help.</p>
<p>Is anyone facing the same problem? Can someone help? This is very annoying and could be a simple fix.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's try the below steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click on <strong>start </strong>button, Click on the userprofile name.<br />
b. Open <strong>My Music</strong> folder.<br />
c. Open <strong>iTunes</strong> folder.<br />
d. Make a copy of "<strong>iTunes Music Library.xml</strong>" on the desktop.<br />
e. Validate the XML file. The easiest way to do this is to open the "<strong>iTunes Music Library.xml</strong>" in<strong>Internet explorer
</strong>(right-click on that file&gt;Open with&gt; Choose default program&gt; Internet Explorer). At this point, you will get an error message saying that there was an XML Parsing Error.<br />
f. Find the song that is causing the problem. If you can't tell which song it is, you may have to open up the file in a text editor (right-click on that file&gt;Open with&gt; Choose default program&gt; notepad), and navigate to the line number specified.<br />
g. Go into <strong>iTunes</strong>, find the song, right click it, and Selet "<strong>Delete</strong>".<br />
h. Once you've done that, re-load the file into Internet Explorer and correct all the songs until there are no more errors.<br />
i. When Internet Explorer parses the file correctly, quit iTunes.<br />
j. Delete "<strong>iTunes Library Extras.itdb</strong>" and "i<strong>Tunes Library Genius.itdb</strong>" files in iTunes folder (Follow the step from a to c to open iTunes folder)<br />
k. Restart iTunes, enable Genius (To enable Genius check for the setting in iTunes).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also post your issue on apple discussion group.<br />

            To those users with Windows 7 and iTunes that cannot turn on Genius due to a 'required file cannot be found' or have begun getting the error stated above and can't find the solution.<br />
<br />
Well the solution is on this post: <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=10554450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span>http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=10554450</span></strong></a> (Windows 7 RTM (Build 7600) and iTunes 9.0), but is more complex to put into practice than the mere command given on the post.<br />
<br />
<strong>You must disable (not just stop) the Branchcache service on windows <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
and reboot</span></strong> the machine for it to take effect, after that Genius will update without any problems.<br />
<br />
If you like me and have a corporate notebook with Group Policy setting this service to run then you must disable it from the services menu within Administrative Tools in the Control Panel (rather than the command in the previous post).<br />
<br />
If you don't have administrator access then you must speak with your IT department and have them disable it for you.

<h3> daniel walter &#40;dwalter&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse is overly sensitive to movement during double-click on a 4k display</h2>
                    <p>Mouse clicks appear to be interpreted differently if the mouse is moving while the click events occur.&nbsp; This interpretation seems to be based on pixels and not some more standard scaling factor such as a percentage of the default font size.&nbsp; This can make
 it difficult to double-click when using a high resolution 4k monitor.&nbsp; I have tried various mouse settings such as reducing the double click speed and changing the mouse pointer speed.&nbsp; Reducing the mouse pointer speed improves the situations but it also means
 that I need to make big sweeping motions with the mouse for it to move across the screen.&nbsp; Changing the mouse double-click speed does not help at all.&nbsp; I have an easy time creating double-clicks with the mouse double-click speed set all the way to fast, but
 only if the mouse pointer speed is slow.&nbsp; Is there some other setting that can be used to help with this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>changing the two settings:</p>
<p>DoubleClickHeight</p>
<p>DoubleClickWidth</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate that these settings are in pixels because this does not scale with monitor resolution and the default value of 4 is difficult to use on a high resolution monitor.</p>

 I am getting the error message that reads, "Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file.&nbsp; You may not have the appropriate permission to access the file."&nbsp; I have uploaded pictures from this same camera just fine as recently as this week, so why
 is it suddenly not able to upload my photos??&nbsp; I have unplugged and re-plugged in both ends of the USB cable, tried restarting my laptop, also have switched from one USB drive (?) to another.&nbsp; I get the same error message for both.&nbsp; By the way, it apparently
 is not a problem with my camera or cable, as it works just fine with my PC, which I just recently deleted Windows 10 and went back to Windows 8, because of problems with it recognizing my printe

 when you start to expand the files, it seems repetitive.&nbsp; For instance, the same files are under This PC&gt;Documents and Libraries&gt;Documents.&nbsp; Shouldn't Libraries be under This PC?&nbsp; And I'm confused between This PC and Windows (C).&nbsp; Shouldn't&nbsp; Windows be under
 This PC?&nbsp; I don't understand where it fits in the hierarchy.&nbsp; Thank you for your time.</p>

</p><p>I recently created a Skype account but used my google email address. My Skype name is now a long number (beginning with CID)@outlook....</p>
<p>It doesn't give me the option to change this. Can you advise how this can be done please? I've updated my email address to my Microsoft&nbsp;one but it hasn't enabled me to solve the problem.</p>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is not possible to change a Skype Name on Skype. In your case, seems that the account was created using the mobile number since you’ve mentioned that it has a long number. What you can only do is to change your
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA110/how-do-i-change-my-skype-display-name?q=change+display+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
display name</a>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only way for you to have a new Skype account username is by creating a new account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

<h2>            &#34;WiFi invalid IP configuration&#34; Error message &#40;windows 10&#41; - cant find anything to fix the error&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Good morning</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 laptop that i have been using on my wireless network with no problems, then out of the blue i cannot access the internet.&nbsp; Initially i thought it was a router problem so turned it off and on, but had no joy.&nbsp; I then realised my iPhone
 was using the WiFi so tried an old windows vista laptop i had and this worked fine to...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i look at the wifi connection it states connected but no internet connect and cant send/receive any information.&nbsp; I ran the diagnostic tool and it stated "WiFi invalid IP configuration", but was unable to fix the problem, i have ran it a number of times
 since but just had the same.&nbsp; I searched the internet and found a number of suggestion as to how to fix the issue, so far i have tried:</p>
<ul>
&nbsp;
<li><em><span>netsh winsock reset&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;</em><em><span>netsh int ip reset reset.log hit</span></em></li><li><span>Ipconfig release, renew &amp; dnsflush</span></li><li><span>Windows Clean Boot</span></li><li><span>Reserved a set IP on the router for the laptop</span></li><li><span>Check the number of DCHP users (254)</span></li></ul>
<p>None of the above has worked.&nbsp; I did try to manually set the IP but wasn't really sure what i was doing was correct.&nbsp; The only other thing i can think to try is to uninstall the WiFi network adapter and restart,
 but am not hopeful that will work!&nbsp; I don't understand how this has suddenly happen when it was working fine, i use it regularly and other devises are working on the WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions/ help would be greatly appreciated, i did have a little look around on here but it all seems to be the same advice as i have already tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good morning Sher Amo</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, I have now tried all of the suggestions on the link you provided.&nbsp; Unfortunately this has not fixed the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have taken the laptop to another wifi network I use occasionally and it connected no problem. But when I took it&nbsp;back home, same issue again!&nbsp; It also works when I connect it with a network cable to&nbsp;my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm back to&nbsp;square one&nbsp;with the same "WiFi invalid IP configuration" and the wifi not working.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions, that I haven't already tried? It appears I may be running out of options and done know what else to do???</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi Troy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that there were changes made to the configuration settings of the network that's why the error has occurred. Regarding your concern, you've encountered the result after performing all the troubleshooting steps provided on the link above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, may we know if you've also reached out to your <strong>Internet Service Provider</strong> to check its configuration? If you haven't done it yet, we suggest that you get in touch with them so we can isolate it if it has something to do
 with the managing the settings and have them reconfigured it at the same time.</p>
