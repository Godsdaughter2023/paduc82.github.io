    <title>Mail Merge Tables - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mail Merge Tables</h2>
                    <p>Good day, I am currently experiencing some issues with Mail Merge. So here is the scenario: We have 13 different insurance policies, one customer can have more than one policy with us. At year end, we send letters to each client to update them on their current
 policies with us and also the increase in premiums. The policies that the client has with us are shown in a table. one client may have 3 policies and another have 6.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to use Mail Merge to be able to show the different policies that different clients have. client 01 has 3 policies and should be shown in a table, and client 02 has 6 policies and they should be shown on the table as well. The table must
 be able to expand and contract according to the number of policies each client has. Is this possible with Mail Merge???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance!!!</p>

            <p>You can do that with the Many to One Facility on my Merge Tools Add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can download the MergeTools – 20150422.dotm Add-in
 that I created from the following page of my One Drive: </span></span><a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><br />
The MergeTools – 20150422.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.&nbsp; In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, and 10, the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8,&nbsp; 8.1 or 10, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box
 for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
&nbsp;When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e37d626c-98de-4293-ab2b-01895c5e3340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e37d626c-98de-4293-ab2b-01895c5e3340" /></a><span>
<span>
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span><span><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letter type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook.
 If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.
<span>&nbsp;</span>For the Chart Merge utility, download the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page of my OneDrive for additional requirements of the data source for use with that utility</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the data must start in the second row of the worksheet and there should be no empty rows within the range of data that is to be processed.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span><span>NOTE: The MergeTools applications cannot handle “Compound” MergeFields such as the «AddressBlock» or «GreetingLine».</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Instead of using those fields, you will need to insert the individual merge fields.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also want to download:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachments, either as the body of the message itself or in the form of Word files or .pdf files.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page.<span>&nbsp; </span>
That document explains how you must set up the Excel Data Source and the Mail Merge Main document to be able to execute a merge with a Chart that is unique to each record in the data source.<br />
<br />

                    Hello. I accidentally pressed a button on Microsoft word 2013, and I don't know what it does. Can someone tell me real quick what it's function is? Picture is attached below with arrow pointing to button. It's in the top left corner and on top of the ruler.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1) Contact the police and file a report.&nbsp; This will cover you for insurance claims.</p>
<p>#2) Contact Network Operator who can block your SIM card.&nbsp; They won't be able to make calls or use other services at your expense.</p>
<p>#3) Change passwords on all accounts for security purposes</p>
<p>#4) You should receive a crime report of which you can provide a copy to your network operator. If your operator participates in IMEI blacklisting, the phone’s IMEI can be prevented from accessing your or any other participating network – this does not recover
 your phone, but at least it could help to thwart the thieves who will be looking to sell your phone for personal gain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important tip: IMEI blacklisting is permanent, so please do not consider this if there is a chance your phone has simply fallen down the back of the sofa!</p>

    <title>Microsoft Edge Only Previews and Prints Blank Pages in Local Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Only Previews and Prints Blank Pages in Local Account</h2>
                    <p>After I upgrading to Windows 10 I was able to preview and print web pages in Microsoft Edge from my Local Accounts. Now logged into&nbsp;a Local Accounts I get no error messages and one blank page prints from Edge. This may have begun with Build 10586. I am able
 to print from Edge if logged into a Windows Account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Logged into a local account&nbsp;Edge is only showing a blank page in Preview and only prints a blank page on my HP printer. I have changed printers. I am not sure if this began after I installed the new printer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;preview and print from Office 2013 Word, Excel, etc. and from other programs and apps. It is only Edge that seems to have this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this supposed to motivate us to use only Windows Accounts? It is likely to discourage people from using Microsoft Edge. This seems like the same MS attitude that brought&nbsp;on the Windows 8 UI disaster.</p>

            Microsoft has offered no fix for this that I have found that actually works! All other browsers work fine except edge. Canon tech support could not help ether.

            I agree! Microsoft is completely ignoring this issue. I have an Epson Workforce Pro 4530 printer that is installed correctly and prints from all browsers except Edge. Edge is the problem. Wake up Microsoft or you will lose more customers to Apple.

<h2>            How do temporary Internet files like cookies become corrupted&#63;</h2>
                    I have a problem where I have a lot of users are losing cookie settings.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is a problem where cookies are being randomly deleted some how. :).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did a search and some research on support.microsoft.com and discovered many people have this problem and looked at various threads and KB articles.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have heard the abstract term, "corruption". It is my understanding that cookies are "text files" with written information by a scripting language. If files are written and read, how is there room for corruption? Can someone help me understand, "corruption"
 in this context?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a bunch in advanced.</div>

Microsoft forum users express dismay, with some claiming their accounts have been switched without permission.
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Hotmail users have been left fuming at Microsoft after being automatically upgraded to an Outlook.com email address without asking.</p>
<p>There have been over 55 pages worth of complaints in the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail-email/where-can-i-report-my-problem-with-outlookcom-mail/0f5936a7-c038-4085-a681-5644109504a6?page=1&amp;tm=1344005369378">
<font color="#2c6db0">Microsoft Answers forum</font></a> and <em>IT Pro</em> readers have also been in touch to confirm they are having problems.
</p>
<p>There are four major issues being reported: </p>
<p>1) Some users have been upgraded without their permission. The “Go Back to Hotmail” option does not seem to work for everyone.
</p>
<p>Microsoft has confirmed once an email is switched to Outlook, it cannot be changed back.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately there is no way to rename to an existing account. This is something we're investigating for future improvements,” Microsoft said in the forum.</p>
<p>2) Not everyone has been able to upgrade to Outlook.com – with some users being greeted with a blank screen and others with error messages.</p>
<p>3) Most worryingly, some users have been unable to see their old emails from their Hotmail account after upgrading.</p>
<p>4) Problems are also being reported with the Hotmail Human Interactive Proof (HIP) validation process. Errors are appearing saying the characters don't match with the ones in the 'picture'. Microsoft has recognised this problem in the forum and is working
 to fix this issue. </p>
<p><em>IT Pro</em> readers have been complaining that there is no way to return to their old email.</p>
<p>“I tried backing out, but have found my old Hotmail account - which I have had for over twenty years - has been de-activated so that I can’t send or receive email from it in Windows Live," noted Obray.</p>
<p>“Even after I clicked on Go Back to Hotmail, it has still left my Hotmail account email in a subfolder to the inbox. This is really disappointing. I think MS needed to think this out a bit more before sending people down this path."</p>
<p>Members of the <em>IT Pro</em> team have had similar experiences. Our Editor and Technical Editor had their Hotmail and Live accounts upgraded automatically. However, old emails have been transferred over to the new inbox and any messages sent to the old
 addresses do appear, which isn't the case for everyone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the News Editor’s attempts to revert back to Hotmail resulted in her machine crashing. The Editor on our sister title
<em>Cloud Pro</em> managed to log into Hotmail and was given the choice of whether or not to upgrade.
</p>
<p>It appears that if you are logged into any of your Microsoft email accounts and go to the Outlook.com website, your ID will automatically be converted.
</p>
<p>The safest way to keep your existing account appears to be to log out of all accounts, then proceed to Outlook.com to sign up as a new user.</p>
<p>Although, readers concerned about any of the issues raised above, might want to consider holding off on upgrading for now.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been informed of these issues, but is yet to respond.</p>

Microsoft forum users express dismay, with some claiming their accounts have been switched without permission.
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Hotmail users have been left fuming at Microsoft after being automatically upgraded to an Outlook.com email address without asking.</p>
<p>There have been over 55 pages worth of complaints in the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail-email/where-can-i-report-my-problem-with-outlookcom-mail/0f5936a7-c038-4085-a681-5644109504a6?page=1&amp;tm=1344005369378">
<font color="#2c6db0">Microsoft Answers forum</font></a> and <em>IT Pro</em> readers have also been in touch to confirm they are having problems.
</p>
<p>There are four major issues being reported: </p>
<p>1) Some users have been upgraded without their permission. The “Go Back to Hotmail” option does not seem to work for everyone.
</p>
<p>Microsoft has confirmed once an email is switched to Outlook, it cannot be changed back.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately there is no way to rename to an existing account. This is something we're investigating for future improvements,” Microsoft said in the forum.</p>
<p>2) Not everyone has been able to upgrade to Outlook.com – with some users being greeted with a blank screen and others with error messages.</p>
<p>3) Most worryingly, some users have been unable to see their old emails from their Hotmail account after upgrading.</p>
<p>4) Problems are also being reported with the Hotmail Human Interactive Proof (HIP) validation process. Errors are appearing saying the characters don't match with the ones in the 'picture'. Microsoft has recognised this problem in the forum and is working
 to fix this issue. </p>
<p><em>IT Pro</em> readers have been complaining that there is no way to return to their old email.</p>
<p>“I tried backing out, but have found my old Hotmail account - which I have had for over twenty years - has been de-activated so that I can’t send or receive email from it in Windows Live," noted Obray.</p>
<p>“Even after I clicked on Go Back to Hotmail, it has still left my Hotmail account email in a subfolder to the inbox. This is really disappointing. I think MS needed to think this out a bit more before sending people down this path."</p>
<p>Members of the <em>IT Pro</em> team have had similar experiences. Our Editor and Technical Editor had their Hotmail and Live accounts upgraded automatically. However, old emails have been transferred over to the new inbox and any messages sent to the old
 addresses do appear, which isn't the case for everyone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the News Editor’s attempts to revert back to Hotmail resulted in her machine crashing. The Editor on our sister title
<em>Cloud Pro</em> managed to log into Hotmail and was given the choice of whether or not to upgrade.
</p>
<p>It appears that if you are logged into any of your Microsoft email accounts and go to the Outlook.com website, your ID will automatically be converted.
</p>
<p>The safest way to keep your existing account appears to be to log out of all accounts, then proceed to Outlook.com to sign up as a new user.</p>
<p>Although, readers concerned about any of the issues raised above, might want to consider holding off on upgrading for now.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been informed of these issues, but is yet to respond.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure what the question is? The Hotmail to outlook.com upgrade happened many months ago - this was an issue that needed to be addressed soon after the upgrade.&nbsp; Plus... this forum is for Outlook, the desktop email client that comes with Office, not
 outlook.com. </p>

            <p>This post contains at least two inaccuracies.&nbsp; The first is the phrase "THE UNANNOUNCED UPGRADE TO OUTLOOK.COM".&nbsp; The switch from the Hotmail.com interface to the Outlook.com interface was announced MONTHS before it took place.&nbsp; Here's one article published
 August 3, 2012: <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2012/08/03/upgrade-from-hotmail-to-outlook-com.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2012/08/03/upgrade-from-hotmail-to-outlook-com.aspx</a>.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;during this trial prior to the switchover, everyone&nbsp;was given a link where they could switch to the new interface, try it for a while, then
 switch back if they chose.&nbsp; Eventually, the Outlook.com interface was made permanent.&nbsp; Note, though, that the "upgrade" was nothing more than an interface change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second inaccuracy is this sentence: "Hotmail users have been left fuming at Microsoft after being automatically upgraded to an Outlook.com email address without asking."&nbsp; No one, NO ONE had their addresses changed unannounced.&nbsp; In fact, Microsoft has
 said that you should continue to use your existing address, be it @live.com, @hotmail.com, @msn.com, or even @webtv.net.&nbsp; See the same article I cited.&nbsp; All continued to work even after the change to the Outlook.com interface.&nbsp; I can attest to this.&nbsp; I still
 have and use my @hotmail address every single day. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where I think accidents started happening, however.&nbsp; If desired, everyone was given the opportunity to rename their address to one ending in @outlook.com.&nbsp; The process was supposed to create the new address and, additionally, make the old address
 an alias of the mailbox so that both addresses would delivery messages to that same mailbox.&nbsp; For many, this worked just as advertised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people created new @outlook.com accounts, but not by renaming their old account.&nbsp; This gave them a brand-new, empty mailbox, which confused them and made them believe they had lost their messages.&nbsp; Their mail was stll in their old mailboxes, they just
 didn't realize the now had two mailboxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, and this is the bad part, some (many, judging from messages here) did have trouble when they renamed their account.&nbsp; This is where Microsoft fell (and continues to fall) because the renaming process has, in fact, lost part or all of
 some people's mailbox and it has been extremely rare to see someone posting that Microsoft has recovered the data, although it has happened on occasion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, take this article with a grain of salt.&nbsp; There are elements of truth in it, but it also contains inaccuracies meant to inflame people's emotions.</p>

</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you have issues&nbsp;with&nbsp;Outlook.com.&nbsp; I guess <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c0cc8435-c1d2-484b-a548-31f271f1c695">
<font color="#0072c6">Brian Tillman [MVP-Outlook</font></a>&nbsp;had answered some of the issues that the article has pointed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;to help you with your issue&nbsp;with lost/missing emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#000000">
</font><span><font color="#000000"><font>I understand that your Inbox were empty after the upgrade. Please be informed that by upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should
 still stay in your Inbox. Here are the possible reasons why some emails are missing from one’s account:</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A. Messages were manually deleted either due to accidental deletion or they were moved to a folder. Please check if emails are being moved to a POP folder, and/or other personal folders that can be due to your Email rules.<br />
<br />
It is also possible that they were deleted due to your account filter settings. Kindly check if Schedule Cleanup is set to automatically delete emails. You may refer to the link below for more information about the feature:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/conquergraymail/automate-your-inbox/scheduled-cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/conquergraymail/automate-your-inbox/scheduled-cleanup</a>
<br />
<br />
B. Messages can also be deleted if you are using a mail client or a third party spam filtering software to access your account. This often happens when using the Pop3 protocol to retrieve your mail and the option Always leave a copy of the message on the server
 is not selected.<br />
<br />
C. Emails got deleted due to Inactivity.<br />
When users don't sign in for more than 365 days or within the first 10 days after signing up for an account, the system will flag it as Inactive. After an account becomes inactive, all messages, folders, and contacts are deleted. Incoming messages will be sent
 back to the sender as undeliverable.<br />
<br />
Also, if you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn’t log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails due to inactivity in web account.<br />
<br />
D. Account has been hacked or compromised.<br />
You may lose emails if your account was hacked and the hacker had already deleted emails in your account.<br />
<br />
E. Conversation threading is enabled.<br />
If the feature Conversation threading is turned on wherein all emails with the same subject line are grouped together. You can visit the link below to know more about this feature:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/auto-upgrade-outlook-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/auto-upgrade-outlook-faq</a>
<br />
<br />
Please be informed that you can use the recover deleted or lost emails feature in Outlook.com to bring back your lost emails. However, when Outlook.com recovers missing or deleted emails, our system restores as many emails as it could regardless of its dates.
 There is also no guarantee that the messages that you are looking for will all be recovered. You can refer to the Solution Article below for the steps to retrieve your lost or deleted emails:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages</a>
<br />
<br />
Note: Please copy the URL and paste it in your browser's address bar. Regarding the self-recovery feature, the system can recover messages but not the folder itself. Recovered messages will be presented in your Deleted folder. Also, emails will not be recovered
 via recovery link if they were deleted from email clients like Windows Live Mail, Microsoft Office Outlook, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>If self-help recovery will not retrieve your emails you need to provide us the following information:</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you rename your account? If so, please provide the old and new account name with the estimated date and time you renamed it. If you are unsure if you indeed renamed your account or just added an alias, you can refer to these links:<br />

<br />
- Did you try to close/deactivate the account before the issue occurred?<br />
- When was the last time you logged into your account?<br />
- Did the data loss occur right after Outlook.com upgrade or was the data still there for a brief time?<br />
- Are you seeing the missing mails on a mobile device or the web UI, or a mail client program?<br />
- What is the account that you’re having issues with?</p>

    <title>Printing from an Access database to an Avery form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cebusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing from an Access database to an Avery form</h2>
                    <p>I am in the process of printing badges from an Access database I use for members of our high school graduation class.&nbsp; Time for another reunion and I have to print the badges.&nbsp; I have done this in the past, and the results were good, but the printing process
 could be more professional.&nbsp; I basically print three badges on an Avery 74536 form.&nbsp; This form allows for six badges to be print on their form, three on the left and three on the right.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The output looks nice, but I cheat.&nbsp; I do not know how to get six badges on the form, so I end up print three along the left side, and then flip the form and print three more.&nbsp; I end up with three badges on the left, and three on the right upside down.&nbsp;
 It doesn't look pretty but the badges are all going to be pulled apart and put in a single badge holders, so the results look good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get Access to print out the badges three on the left and three on the right without me flipping them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Does this margin and width work take place when using the Create Report capability of Access?&nbsp; Right now when I print, three labels or ID badge information is printed in the three left boxes, another piece of paper loads and then the same printing repeats.&nbsp;
 I never get the fourth, fifth, and sixth label or ID badge information printed on the right side of the paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I, or is there some way to tell Access print ID badge #1 in the upper left hand box, label #2 in the right hand box, label #3 print on the left, middle box, and etc.?</p>

            You need to set the Columns in the page setup/layout to 2. This is done in the report design view. You might need to play around with the margins to make them as small as possible for your printer. Use the Column Layout of Across, then Down.

<p>How do I get to this Avery Label function in Access?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started to play around with what I have, and I can get the standard stuff like Title, Date, and an Image to print on the paper I am using.&nbsp; If fits nice and would fit on Avery form 74536, which is the form to print on to put your labels you print
 into the Avery badge holders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Avery product has space for six labels per page, and I am printing the generic stuff okay.&nbsp; The problem comes when the name and picture are printed.&nbsp; The right and left badge are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Query to generate the data, i.e. name and picture, to print out.&nbsp; This is working fine, except, in position one on the form I get the correct name and picture, in position two I get the same name an picture.&nbsp; Would like the name and picture in position
 two (which is to the right of the badge in position one), to be the second person in the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sort of like zig zag back and forth. First person in the query has their badge printed in position one on the form, second person's information is printed in position two, and so forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I saw on the Avery site, they can print the badges, but the badges will all contain the same information, i.e. like business cards.&nbsp; Unless I missed something on the site which shows me how to accomplish what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be something within Access to do what I want.&nbsp; I can't be the first person to try something like this. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Well I have good news and bad news.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Access has an Avery label function, and it works, sort of. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has numerous Avery labels listed.&nbsp; Some by number some by dimensions.&nbsp; Only problem you might have to scroll through forty, fifty, maybe seventy to find what you want.&nbsp; No, I want a template for a 4" x 3" label, so I type in the number 4, and a bunch
 are listed. &nbsp; Reminds me of a jigsaw puzzle and you are looking for one piece.&nbsp; But at least&nbsp; I found the piece I was looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of printing three labels on a page, I was able to print six, and they were in order the query put them in, so that was nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bad news, none of the labels had any picture with them.&nbsp; Have compared the properties of for the block where the photo is suppose to go, and the Control Source is listed as "Photo" in both. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first three properties for the report where the photo appears are:</p>
<p>Name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Attachment26</p>
<p>Control Source &nbsp;&nbsp; Photo</p>
<p>Display As &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Image/Icon</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first three properties for the report where the photo does not appear are:</p>
<p>Name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Attachment</p>
<p>label Name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; is blank</p>
<p>Control Source&nbsp; Photo</p>
<p>There is no Display As</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why the properties related to the photo are different, from one report to the other?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Data Type for the photos I am using is listed as Attachment.</p>

    <title>Windows phone 10 Alarm bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshfbell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows phone 10 Alarm bug</h2>
                    Hi, The alarm function in Windows phone 10 has a bizarre bug (or quirk), making it dreadfully unreliable until one works out how to reproduce the problem..<br />
<br />
Repro: while the alarm is ringing or snoozing, grab the notification bar. This will completely dismiss the alarm.<br />
<br />
I nearly lost my job before I figured out what was happening - very uncool.<br />
<br />
The last several builds have not addressed this issue -&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>We can define custom flags by right click on the flag, choose "custom", give it a new name, and finally assign it to a message. This works fine.&nbsp;

<div>What we need to do if i wish to define user define flag (want to define day count like 2 days) and after counting 2 days from the day i flagged the email outlook remind me??&nbsp;

<h2>            SharePoint Admin Center Access in SharePoint Online</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Myself and another user are set up with administrator rights in SharePoint Online.&nbsp; So both of use can see everything that pertains to the SharePoint Online site.&nbsp; The problem comes when this other administrator tries to access&nbsp;the SharePoint Admin Center
 in SharePoint Online and the cannot access it but I have no trouble&nbsp;accessing that site.&nbsp; Where could I look to see where the difference might be between the access/rights I have and this other user has?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the assistance.</p>

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>we wonder how you set up administrator rights for this user. could you describe it briefly?</p>
<p>also, can this user see the <strong>sharepoint</strong> under <strong>admin</strong> in office 365 admin center?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=8a32f5fb-49ad-44c8-9c01-b2533847964e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d8a32f5fb-49ad-44c8-9c01-b2533847964e" /></a></p>
<p>generally, to access sharepoint admin center, we need to be at least a sharepoint admin. please check if this user is granted to be a sharepoint administrator:</p>
<p>in office 365 admin center, select <strong>users</strong>&gt; <a href="https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx#activeuserspage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
active users</a>. select this user, click <strong>edit user roles</strong> and then given him customized administrator role like
<em>sharepoint administrator</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>if you just did this and the user still cannot access the sharepoint admin center, then please share the error message when he accesses the admin center with us, try some different browsers, and re-assigning this admin right to him. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,</p>

<h3> skisgurl  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA Code in Mac Excel 2016</h2>
                    I have been attempting to create drop down menus that will allow multiple selections in a cell. &nbsp;I have reviewed available instructions and VBA codes online and attempted to implement them. &nbsp;I am successful at creating the validation i.e. menu for my column.
 &nbsp;However, after adding the VBA code, it has no affect on the function of that list. &nbsp;Each selection still overwrites the previous. &nbsp;I am likely amateur in this area, so figure I am leaving out a step or, at the least, missing something. &nbsp;I would genuinely

 be able to have a drop-down for the headings Ferrous, Non-Ferrous, and Process, for the 50 states. &nbsp;This is for business and there are some companies that have several metals and several processes. &nbsp;It gets ridiculous trying to have a column for each that
 you put an "x" in, so this drop-down, multiple choice feature seemed ideal. &nbsp;I truly appreciate your assistance. &nbsp;I would be so pleased to be able to have this feature in my worksheet. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Well you have your hands full with me. &nbsp;I must apologize. &nbsp;First, when we use the term "Macro," are we referring to the VBA coding or something else. &nbsp;Also, hopefully you saw that I am working in the Mac 2016 version of Excel. &nbsp;When following the initial
 instructions for creating this type of drop-down, while in the sheet, I could go back and forth to the VBA and see the pasted code. &nbsp;After saving the sheet and now reopening it, there's nothing there, as you stated. &nbsp;So, in the event that we are talking about
 the actual pasted code, I pasted it to a Word Doc so that you could see what I was using. &nbsp;Is there an additional set to activate this code for my entire worksheet? Was I overlooking a step or two? It is frustrating that something that seems to be a step by
 step process is so difficult for me. &nbsp;I am a pretty quick study learning a new task or feature in Office, but this one is a real doozie. &nbsp;I appreciate your patience with me.</p>

<h2>            defaults for custom sort dialog</h2>
                    <p>9 times out of 10 when I'm performing a sort in Excel I want to sort by Largest to Smallest. Is there a way to set this as the default in the sort dialog box?</p>
<p>Even if I have to write a macro I will do that. It would be a huge time saver for me and my company.</p>

            There is no way of changing the defaults that I know of. There are some other options described at a high level in this tip:
https://excelribbon.tips.net/T008346_Storing_Sorting_Criteria.html

You could define a view with the sort:
https://excelribbon.tips.net/T007217_Understanding_Views.html

https://excelribbon.tips.net/T007218_Using_Stored_Views.html

Or you can use macros.   this article describes a macro you could use
https://excelribbon.tips.net/T010091_Remembering_Workbook_Position_and_Size.html
 
https://excelribbon.tips.net/T012586_Remembering_Workbook_Settings_from_Session_to_Session.html

https://excelribbon.tips.net/T009006_Automatically_Sorting_as_You_Enter_Information.html

Or you could use the macro recorder to save the commands you use to setup the workbook the way you want, If the macro is workbook specific, you may want to change the workbook format from XLSX to XLSM so you can save the macro in just this one workbook. If you use the macro often enough you may want to put the mac

<br />You can try to select the cell first, and then press Ctrl+1 and check under Number tab if you selected "Date" as category (and whether it is the desired format which is mm/dd).
<br />
<br />You are welcomed to upload the file to the cloud and post a link, and I would be happy to check that out for you.

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be a feature request, but is it possible to show the additional time zone in Outlook in another format? &nbsp;For example I'd like to have two columns on the left, both the local time zone but one in 24 hour format. &nbsp; &nbsp;We do testing with another group
 and some of the staff need help converting from military time to AM/PM. &nbsp;It would be nice to have the flexibility to change the format of the column independent of the system time which the staff want to keep in local AM/PM. &nbsp;Another good example would be
 to have one column in local time and the other in UTC but 24 hour format and not AM/PM.</p>

<h2>            No longer able to view active time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It looks like a recent update to the Health App removed the ability to see "Active Time." It is now replaced by "Total Cardio Minutes."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to view the old data? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unhappy because I found the "Active Time" very useful. The new cardio minutes is nice, but does not show the information in near the same helpful way. I am much more interested in trying to make each hour active instead of just a sum total of my cardio
 minutes during the day.</p>

<h2>            Live Tiles not Working Correctly in Windows 10 TP</h2>
                    <p>Dear Users,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Windows 10 Tech Preview a month before. It was all working fine till yesterday (14/12/14) But then some update went on system day before night and suddenly it started. All my live tiles in Bing Weather/Windows Live Mail are not working (App
 itself is not working). Windows Store doesn't even open. I am not able to install or uninstall the app from store or not even able to update the apps that are not working. Are anyone finding the similar the type of problem and if so any one found issues please
 let me know. Thanks.</p>

                    I'm trying to fix my printer and on the HP website they have a program that will try to figure out what is wrong.&nbsp; Windows 7 won't allow it.&nbsp; It says "Internet Explorer Add On Installer Security Warning - Windows has blocked this software because it can
 not verify the publisher"&nbsp; I've gone into internet options and the security tab and unchecked the thing that says download anyway if no valid certificate but it doesnt' help.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp; It makes me feel like a child.&nbsp; I like to be
 warned but to have no recourse but to accept that is frustrating.&nbsp; Thanks for your time in reading this rant.

 on my computer.&nbsp; Is the user id and password specific to the computer I'm using or to any computer I might be using that has Outlook on it.. Does each computer have to have my user id and password installed before using that computer?

            You mean your email account username and password? That will need configured in Outlook before you can send and recieve email. You can go to Control panel, Mail and open you existing profile to see what account you used or to create a new profile.

    <title>Outlook 2010 Trying to Connect error. Only with one Windows profile. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> urvaitguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Trying to Connect error. Only with one Windows profile.</h2>
                    <p>A user recently began getting the dreaded "Trying to Connect" message in Outlook 2010. &nbsp;No software had been installed as of late (except for windows updates); &nbsp;the problem "appeared" one day. &nbsp;Tried deleting the Outlook profile and creating a new one, but
 with it unable to connect, it could not rebuild the Outlook profile. &nbsp;Nothing changed on the Exchange server side as far as settings. &nbsp;This is not a remote connection either; the client and server are on the same network in the same building. &nbsp;Also checked
 all network settings, pinged the exchange server successfully under its DNS name and its internal IP addresses. &nbsp;Checked Windows Firewall, nothing changed there either.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tried a system restore. &nbsp;No luck. &nbsp;Put the machine back to the current state.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now here's the rub...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I created a new windows profile on the machine and Outlook 2010 is able to connect. &nbsp;So you'd think our problem is solved, but this user's profile has a ton of data, and while it would only involve copying all of that data to a flash drive, then repopulating
 the new profile with it, I would like to know if anyone knows what particular files (or registry keys) were corrupted to cause this problem. &nbsp; Getting this person back with email required a machine swap and a couple hours of data copying. &nbsp;I would hate to
 have to go through such a time-consuming process if this occurs again. &nbsp;If there's a hotfix for this (or just some tweak that's already known) I'd love to hear it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
