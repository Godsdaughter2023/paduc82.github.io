<h2>            In Internet Explorer getting &#34;Navigation to the web page was cancelled&#34;</h2>
                    <p>What does this mean: Navigation to the web page was cancelled. This is a section of lower right page and I cannot remove it. Also, my connectivity is poor, and I cannot improve it. Thank you.</p>

Fixed. Toggled off and on how updates are installed and a few other settings on the same&nbsp;screen. Can't say for sure which one or combination reset it but started the insider builds waiting / working animated icon, rebooted and was able to start and complete
 the transition to insider builds.

<p>Has MS come up with a permanent solution for this short of clean reinstalling the OS? I have had this issue for several weeks now...since the official ver of Windows 10. I seem to be fine with Windows Phone it's just PC/Tablet.</p>

            What is the point of these error messages if there is no-one on forum like this who can tell us what they mean? I have this same problem but I am not about to go through yet another clean install just to see if that fixes my problem. I want someone to
 tell me what this error means and give me a fix.

<h2>            Phone Replacement - Sync Order</h2>
                    I just activated my new HTC, which was simply replaced due to a mechanical malfuntion of my old one.&nbsp; Last week I set up 'My Phone' to back up my text messages, pics, etc.&nbsp; Now that I have the new phone, I am afraid to set up the My Phone servie for fear
 it will sync from my new phone and wipe everything out&nbsp; that I have saved in 'My Phone'&nbsp;.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
How do I direct it as to which data I want because what I am looking to do is put the stuff from 'My Phone' back on to my newly activated phone?<br />
<br />
Thanks so much

<p>anyway, my question is how do i link the info on "myphone" to my new phone?&nbsp; is this done by simply going to the Microsoft my phone feature on my new phone and click sync or do i need to connect a usb to my pc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Download and install the application if needed.&nbsp; Most new devices come with the application installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start the MyPhone program, choose the options you want to sync and when you sign in with your<span>Windows Live</span> ID and sync, the information stored in your
<span>My Phone</span> account will be downloaded to your new phone.</p>

            Hi there!<br /><br />I could find this testimony from another user “I had the same problem but I found out that it only stores your last 5 or so passwords. If you change your password 6 times it will let you reuse the old one. At least that’s how long it took me maybe it was more but you get the idea. Now I have my old password again”<br /><br />You can see it in this link <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_accountms-skype_privacyms/i-want-to-reuse-an-old-password-for-my-microsoft/54a7d1df-61b9-4e30-a7f3-c1cc8c02ea83">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a> <br /><br />Look for the answer given by gilito345

    <title>Nokia N97 &#61; eBay&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skywatcher77---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N97 &#61; eBay&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Ive had this awful phone now for 6 months, and as much fun as ive had with this handset (NONE) its going on ebay as of today. Ive pretty much been in these forums daily since i got this phone which is a first for me, and im sure thousands of others have.
 I find it amazing that theres an actual forum to deal with peoples problems with this phone. Sure if your not sure how to do something on a phone its great to look up some help, but for thousands of people to be in the same boat over one phone is laughable,
 certainly when Nokia is supposed to be the biggest phone retailer in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually feel sort of sorry for the person and persons that will be bidding on this phone to win it thinking that its the amazing phone its advertised as. Thus why none of my friends would buy it off me lol because they've had to hear the problems with
 it over the last 6 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be sort of sad to see it go, it is technically a good phone in some aspects, but the cons far out weigh the pro's. I will also miss the forums, after all, ive used them almost daily since i got this phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm either going for an iphone 3gs or the new HTC HD2, both of which will have there problems im sure, but at least i will know they will have different problems to the N97, theres only so many times you can listen to that Nokia tune before your head actually
 explodes lol&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nobody wanted to listen to me. That is why I got banned... For expressing my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I've read few posts about seeling n97, I sold both my n97s. First was sold for £260 in 30 minutes on ebay, and the second one was sold in literally 5 minutes for £259!! I paid twice more for both...</p>

<p>I too sold my first one and got £320 for it, but that was 6 months ago, fingers crossed this one can manage a sale of at least £250, thankfully i got them both free through contract. But the endless problems and nokia tune have became tooooo much to deal
 with from a phone. Im also sure there are many N97 owners that are going to get the N900 as soon as they can. True this handset looks set to be everything the N97 should have been, but for me, i couldnt care if it had 4 times the power/memory of the N97, Nokia
 have lost any chance of ever getting my custom again due to burying there heads in the sand with this product.</p>

<hr />
I checked some of these sites a few months back when i thought about selling, unfortunately the N97 wasnt listed on any of them, ive just checked a few however and can see that this phone is now listed in them. The downside of course to this is that they dont
 offer you very much money for your phone, approx was £200-£230. Fair enough you get to keep the charger, headphones etc etc which i have no need for. £247 was the best deal i could find though, which im currently thinking about taking, this site requires the
 box and charger etc for this price which i am more than happy to supply.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;The downside is the possibility of making a little more from the handset on ebay, as i have a near perfect phone, the box and all accessories plus 10 spare anti-scratch screens. There is also paid for downloaded content included with the phone.
 This would hopefully push the phone to over £300, however, ebay and paypal would of course be taking their share from this so i am thinking very carefully about this now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;Does anyone have any info on these sites, are they trustworthy etc?</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;Btw j2001m, were you hinting at selling the box on ebay without the phone actually inside and listing it as being a brand new phone in a sealed box?&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>Nope, i mean you can then sell the box and all the things in it apart from the phone and the bat.&nbsp; (about £20)</p>

<p>Please note you may find that you get no mony and no phone when using ebay!!!!!</p>

            lol just checking, yeah i guess i could try selling those things on ebay and try and make £20-30 along with the £200ish from the sites that just want the phone. I know ebay can be a dodgy place so perhaps these recycling sites are the way to go, certainly
 from a guarantee point of view that you would either see the cash, or your phone again.&nbsp;

            Market? As in a sunday market? I dont think anyone at my local market would even entertain buying a phone from a punter, especially at this price.

<p>Yes, seriously!&nbsp; Maybe more the indoor market type or proper second hand mobile phone shops often located nearby markets.</p>
<p>I have done this before and got good money (admittedly for a less expensive phone"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure if you still have the receipt to prove you are the rightful owner, I am sure you will not have a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, Cash Converters is another good option.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for getting back to us with the relevant information regarding this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to open an attachment from an email received from Apple Air on your Outlook.com email account and it displays a message which says something about “<strong><em>afx.ms</em></strong>”.
 The issue is still not very clear. Please reply to this thread with the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) How do you access your Outlook.com email account on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2) If you are using Internet Explorer browser to access your Outlook.com account, then what is its version?</span></p>
<p><span>3) What is the exact message displayed on the opening notice that comes up when you click on the attached file on the email?</span></p>
<p><span>4) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not using the latest browser version on the computer, then I suggest you to upgrade it to the latest version and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For additional troubleshooting on this issue, I suggest you to refer to the thread link given below and try the troubleshooting steps given in it:</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2013 will not open.</h2>
                    Microsoft Outlook 2013 will not open. The error message is that it cannot open the OST file. Prior to this Outlook had frozen while viewing an email, and clicked shutdown, and I clicked cancel while it was attempting recovery. Have a Telstra bigpond internet
 service and email account. Followed MS online instructions to recreate a new OST file (suspecting corruption)&nbsp;by&nbsp;firstly delete the original file (kept a copy elsewhere) and have Outlook recreate it. It created a new zero content file, but that did not work,
 still got the same error message when trying to open outlook.&nbsp; Tried SCANPST.exe to repair the original OST file.&nbsp; It found errors and repaired the file, but&nbsp;still&nbsp;got the same error message when I tried to open outlook. Any&nbsp;help would be appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Phillip,<br />
<br />
Most common reasons why you cannot open <strong>.ost</strong> files in Outlook are some corrupted system files or the file is damaged. Since you've done using the Inbox Repair tool (<strong>SCANPST.exe</strong>), we recommend following the steps provided on
 this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to repair Outlook Data files.<br />

Let us know if the above solutions work for you or if you need additional assistance.

<p>Hi Justine,</p>
<p>Thank you for responding, it has been a very frustrating time. I had read that article and performed inbox repair on the ost file, but that did not work.&nbsp;Deleted the ost file,&nbsp;and a&nbsp;new one was created, but with zero content and still would not permit outlook
 to start. Reset the navigation pane, but that did not work. Finally created a new profile (via control panel /mail/profiles), switched to it, and that worked, pointing to a corrupted profile. All my inbox emails were restored from the Telstra bigpond server.
 Great!&nbsp;I had to re-establish links to my data (pst) files under the new profile after changing the name of the file to break the links to the old profile. The only thing left to do is to re-establish my contacts file in the new profile from the old profile.
 Any help with that would be appreciated. Regards Phil</p>

<h2>            Distribution lists not working, outlook will not open properly and email stuck in outbox.</h2>
                    
<p>I actually have a few problems right now and would appreciated any insight.&nbsp; I am running office 2007 on Win 7 using Outlook, not Express.&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp; I have a distribution list of about 150 email addresses, well below the max for outlook I believe.&nbsp; I transferred it over in .pst when I purchased this new laptop a few months ago.&nbsp; Distibution list worked fine on old system, xp and office 2003.&nbsp; Can't
 get any distribution lists to work properly on new system, even with only 2 or 3 recipients, it fails.&nbsp; I get a message that says too many recipients.<br />
2.&nbsp; Sent an email with a large attachment over a week ago and it is still stuck in my outbox and won't delete.&nbsp; Slowing things down drastically.&nbsp; Distribution list problem was occurring prior to the outbox issue so I don't think they are related.<br />
3.&nbsp; I can open outlook from any of my icons or from the start menu when the computer starts up, but if I close it and try to reopen, it doesn't open.&nbsp; Also does not show up in taskmanager so it's not running in the background somewhere.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.&nbsp;&nbsp; These problems are seriously affecting my work right now.</p>

<p>State exactly how you transferred your old PST to the new machine and how you connected it with the mail profile.&nbsp; Did you use export/import at all?</p>
<p>If you receive a message about too many recipients, that's likely a server-side limit because Outlook doesn't have limits on how many addresses you can include on a message.&nbsp; Can you include the exact text of the error and describe exactly when and where
 it appears?</p>
<p>Large messages stuck in the Outbox are usually the result of an antivirus scanning messages.&nbsp; AV programs should always be configured to exclude any mai lscanning feature.&nbsp; I don't know enough about MSE to say if it can be installed without the mai lscanner,
 but if it can, uninstall it and reinstallit without the mail scanner.</p>
<p>Outlook not restarting after you think it's closed is a sign it's still running.&nbsp; Did you examine the Processes tab in Task Manager (not the Applications tab) to make sure OUTLOOK.EXE doesn't show?</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; When I purchased the new laptop,I loaded office and I copied my .pst from the old laptop and imported it into the new.&nbsp; I have done this several times before due to restores after system crashes, thusly the new laptop.&nbsp; I've made
 a habit of backing up the .pst on a regular basis.</p>
<p><span>Exact text of error message:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>552 too many recipients</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The bottom two lines are repeated for almost every repient on my distribution list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I said, worked fine on my old laptop with the same distribution list.</span></p>
<p>As for the stuck message, I have tried working offline and I have tried turning off my Norton Firewall.&nbsp; Neither has worked.&nbsp; I have looked in Norton and I don't readily see how to turn off just the outgoing mail scan.&nbsp; Any ideas other than creating a new
 profile.&nbsp; I don't want to go through that extra work if I can find another work around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are correct that outlook is running in processes, I failed to check there as well when I checked the task manager.&nbsp; I think it is waiting for the last send to complete which is taking forever because of the hung message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The error you include is a message from your mail server and is not controllable from Outlook's side.&nbsp; You'll have to get your mail service support people involved.</p>
<p>It's not a good idea to use export/import to move data from one Outlook instance to another.&nbsp; It's best to use the Mail applet in Control Panel to add the PST(s) you want to the mail profile.</p>
<p>Symantec products are particularly truculent when combined with Outlook.&nbsp; You must completely uninstall the Norton product and reinstall it with a custom install to remove the mail scanner.&nbsp; The Norton support website has a "Norton Removal Tool" you will
 need to completely remove it before you can reinstall it without the mail scanner.</p>
<p>Outlook still running indicates that an add-in is interfering with Outlook's shutdown process.&nbsp; See if something here helps:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/outlookdoesntclose.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/outlookdoesntclose.htm</a></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Check these settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Options&gt; General&gt; Tabs&gt; Settings:<br />
* Always open pop-ups in a new tab<br />
* Open links from other programs in a new tab<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Options&gt; Advanced&gt; Browsing:<br />
* Uncheck "Reuse windows for launching shortcuts (when tabbed browsing is off.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, this problem is nearly always caused by a pop-up blocker. Turn off the IE pop-up from IE&gt; Tools&gt; pop-up blocker. From IE&gt; Tools&gt; Manage add-ons (Show: All add-ons) disable toolbars which have a pop-up blocker feature (google, yahoo, earthlink, aol,
 etc.) until the problem goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the guilty program or add-on will have to be uninstalled, not just disabled to stop this. This is occasionally the case with the Yahoo toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen it posted that nwiz.exe has caused this behavior. Nwiz.exe can be disabled from Start&gt; Run&gt; (type in)
<em>msconfig</em> then hit Enter. Uncheck nwiz.exe on the Startup tab, then restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,<br />
Don</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Casual Games on Android Smartphone all days with Error Code 101</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a smartphone Android 6.0 for playing Microsoft Casual Games. At home it works very well using my WLAN. But when I leave my home Microsoft is not able to connect to the Internet whereas it's no problem for Google and all other web services. Also
 a restart doesn't not help. It seems as if the Internet is something unknown for Microsoft Games. I get the code 101 and should visit https://aka.ms/mssolitairefaq for that code but there is no help, no answer, merely nothing.</p>

<p>I am trying to download office applications via glow and I am getting the following error just after I click 'run' - The procedure entry point K32GetmodulefilenameExw could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll.</p>

<p>Any ideas? My system is windows vista.</p>

<p>Did you say Windows VIsta? Office 2013 or 2016 will not run on vista. Vista isn't even supported anymore. I'd recommend an upgrade if at all possible or use the online versions of Office 365. To be honest, I am not even sure that will work on vista.</p>

<p>hi hayley,<br />

just as bryan said, windows vista is not supported to install office 2013 and office 2016, you may have a look at this article:

                    <p>My network connection has been interrupted While I was providing my insider program survey. Then I couldn’t continue to fill survey for now and wasted of my time. You could ask email address of insider program participant and register survey result of every

<p>I believe there is no blaming here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point the O.P. is trying to make is, as I understand, alongside the survey questions there must be a
<strong>SAVE</strong> button. When you want to temporarily stop answering the questions, you must be able to save your work up to that point. When you return to the questionnaire, you must be able to continue where you left off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if there is a network connection failure, you must be able to continue the survey from the point where you have last saved your your work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember, in old times, there were download managers promising that you would not lose your download up to to the point of network disruption and that you would continue your download from that point when the network connection resumed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if such a <strong>SAVE</strong> button can be designed and integrated into the survey pages, that will be nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a wish of the O.P. as I understand his post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be wrong, though.</p>

            Yes, your understanding and clarification are correct. I didn’t want to blame. I just wanted Microsoft to improve their survey program through our comments. Meantime, I think no need to add any save button there, Microsoft can use next button with this
 function and save automatically. It seems the main reason was Microsoft didn’t ask any log in before survey.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi Cheebase,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, we can migrate from Gmail to Office 365 via IMAP migration, which is based on the IMAP protocol. Besides Office 365, there are numerous 3rd email providers &nbsp;It’s almost impossible for Office 365 to define methods to migrate emails to these email
 providers respectively, not to say that this process is also restricted by the target email service provider. &nbsp;So we need to consult the target email service provider to see if we can migrate emails to it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In your situation, we suggest you contact the Gmail support for further assistance. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
By the way, you can use the export and import PST files method as a workaround in case you can’t migrate emails from Office 365 to Gmail directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Monique</p>

    <title>WP 8 - Messenger Keeps Signing Out After Phone is Idle or Locked for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WP 8 - Messenger Keeps Signing Out After Phone is Idle or Locked for Long Time</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues with Messenger keeps signing out on its own after I leave the phone idle or not in use for some time. After long idle time, when I click on the Messaging Tile, I will see that the Messenger will start "Connecting" / "Checking who is online"
 .. which should mean that the Messenger is reestablishing connection. I have ensured that my data connection is on and battery saver is turned off.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also double checked this, as I have a Desktop Messenger program which allows me to see how many places I am signed&nbsp;in to. I noticed something was wrong when I had NOT signed out on Messenger on my phone, and my Desktop Messenger only showed me as signed
 in on desktop on not phone. Once I start the WP8 Messaging app, it started "Connecting" again, and my Desktop Messenger will show that I am signed on m Windows Phone too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to WP 8, I am a user of the WP 7 &amp; 7.5. The Messenger will always keep signed in as long as data connection is left on. And even in times when data connection is off for a while, I never encountered instances where Messenger will only start "Connecting"
 when I start the App.. I assume in WP 7 / 7.5, if connection is lost, Messenger will always reconnect on its own without having me starting the Messaging app again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to be clicking on the WP 8 Messenger App all the time to ensure that I am signed in to my Messenger or keep re-signing in again&nbsp;throughout the day. It should be signed on at ALL times even if phone is idle or locked.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did anyone encounter the same issue? and also can team help fixed this pls? Thanks! &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi WeiM,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this issue only happen with Messenger, does it happen with other data connections?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried in a WiFi zore to see if it happens there as well?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

            I'm having a similar issue.&nbsp; While the phone is in use, I can chat normally and appear as online.&nbsp; But if I go to idle, my contacts say I am offline.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Sometimes I set my status to offline and phone has to reconnect to set it, even though I'm on 4G with four or five bars.&nbsp; On WP7, I could set my status and it would update instantly, but on WP8, I can update it, but it may not "stick" after reconnecting, thus
 requiring me to set my status again.<br />

            <p>Same problem. I`ve Tried everything, on wlan-&gt;no difference, on charger-&gt;no difference. It seems&nbsp;messenger signs out after 2 min idle. Sometimes it drops while changing chat window. I guess this problem has something to do with energy saving. The messenger
 application is not listed as allowed background process in the settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can´t add it as one, so it seems it depends&nbsp; if the&nbsp;software delevoleper, in this case microsoft, has designed it as allowed background process...Hopefully software update will fix
 this annoying issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: Btw my friends phone works just fine and stays online when idle, only difference is that the last eight digits in firmware version are 1244.3001 as mine are 1246.0001.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT2: It´s not only with messenger, I tried nimbuzz and&nbsp;the situation was same.</p>

            I am having the same issues on my Nokia Lumia 920. My friends who have the same phone do not have this problem. When I go into the messaging app thats when it reconnects me and i receive all the messages that was send to me ages ago.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I checked the settings and there is no options to leave the messenger on. I went in to the wifi settings and the remain connected to wifi is turned on too. So what's the problem here?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would appreciate if anyone can help me solve this. &nbsp;I have a lot of friends on messenger and do a lot of chatting but this problem has been really annoying as i get signed out everytime the phone goes to idle.</div>

            Same issue here, extremely annoying. Resorting to use Facebook chat as that one stays signed in, although would prefer messenger as you can send photos and videos. Lumia 920 on Rogers with all latest updates.

            <p>I have to say I think I have "solved" it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you and the person you are talking to have to always be appearing as "available". if this is so then it works pretty well. nothing is perfect as it is obviously a complex system but I have to say it now works pretty well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can now message through text, facebook or messanger seamlessly and switch between Windows 8 messanger (on metro) and the phone and it all works as hoped.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but yes, you have to be "available"</p>

            Okey now, i noticed&nbsp; that it´s possible that the problem is in microsoft account. After I tried to use messenger in ipad imo, i started to appear as offline to everybody and everybody appeared offline also to me. I was wondering wtf? I signed in web messenger/hotmail
 and went to the contacts. I removed some of my messenger friends contacts and added them again and requested them to be my messenger friends. That helped and they came back visible to me and I to them.<br />
<br />
Now, I assume that swapping&nbsp; between windows live messenger app on computer, ebuddy on my ex phone galaxy s, web messenger(hotmail) and lumia´s messenger will mess up the situation! Now when i use lumia´s messenger and occasionally sign in hotmail to chat,
 i´ve noticed that everytime couple of my friends is "appear offline to this person"-state. I click "appear online to this person" and everything works fine. Still, I have to sometimes remove and add some friends again in contacts because they have disappeard
 from my messenger and i know they suppose to be online :D annoying..<br />
<br />
How ever, I´ve also noticed that as long as I use ONLY lumia´s messenger and do not swap between other messengers like hotmail or windows live messenger on computer everything works fine and lumias´s messenger stays online. How ever, IF I use other messenger
 apps and swap back to lumia´s messenger it keeps signing out,,BUT if I boot the phone everything works fine AGAIN.<br />
<br />
At least I have my microsoft account in various applications, like xbox live, hotmail, wp8, nimbuzz, ebuddy so on....So it is possible the account gets messed up.<br />
<br />
sorry for this complicated reply, but the situation with this issue, indeed seems to be quite complicated :)<br />
<br />
Shortly put:<br />
Try this,<br />
1.Remove/add your contacts&nbsp; in microsoft account, and reguest them to be your messenger friends(this works without your friend has to click accept to this)<br />
2. Boot your lumia. Dont´t use any other messenger apps than lumia´s.<br />
3. Follow up, and u propably notice that messengers stays online all the time, hopefully :)<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Creating Calendars Oddity</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a new calendar. &nbsp;Here is what I am doing:</p>
<p>1. Click&nbsp;on "calendar view" within OL</p>
<p>2. Click on "folder."</p>
<p>3. Click on "new calendar."</p>
<p>4. I name the calendar "Bill - Personal" (w/o quotes)</p>
<p>5. I click on "Folder Contains" &gt;&gt; Calendar Items&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. I select the location.</p>
<p>7. I hit "OK."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendar DOES NOT show up in the Calendar list in the Calendar View. &nbsp;However, if I go to the MAIL view, it is listed under that folder (without the calendar icon). &nbsp;When I check the properties of that item, it states "folder containing calendar items."
 &nbsp;If I click on it, the calendar shows up as it should. &nbsp;However, I am unable to view it side-by-side with my other calendars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repeated these steps&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-additional-calendars-35A192DD-6501-4E79-8415-15B67A09E17E numerous times. &nbsp;SOMETIMES (1 out of 20 tries) the newly created calendar shows up in the calendar view list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10</p>
<p>Office Version1702 (Build 7870.2031)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what am I missing?</p>

<p>Things just got weirder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have TWO machines that are having this problem (laptop and desktop).&nbsp;</p>
<p>On ONE machine (a laptop) I ran the repair tool. &nbsp;Everything came back. &nbsp;I rebooted and then started OL and the calendars that I made prior (that were not showing up in the calendar view) were showing in the proper place.<br />
</p>
<p>I logged on to my other machine (a desktop). &nbsp;I decided to skip the repair option and reboot. &nbsp;After rebooting that machine, the calendars I had created (that were not showing up in the calendar view) were showing in the proper place.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>That doesn't make sense to me, but it works. &nbsp;What is most odd is that any new calendar I create will likely need a reboot of the machine, which should not be the case. The fact that it is happening on TWO different machines make me wonder if there is not
 a sneak bug somewhere.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            How to play wmv file &#40;Windows Menia Video for PC&#41; in Nokia 5800XM</h2>
                    Can anyone tell me how can I play wmv file (Windows Menia Video for PC, resolution: 320x240) in Nokia 5800XM. I've tried with real player. It only plays audio but no video. SmartMovie does not play anything. Is there any other MEDIA PLAYER for Nokia 5800XM
 to play *.wmv file. Thanks in advance.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue that you are experiencing could be software-related concern. To figure this out, can you tell us the model and OS of the phone that you are using? When did the issue start?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to perform a factory or hard reset to your phone, the stored contacts are automatically saved to your Microsoft account once it connects to a Wi-Fi or data connection. You can also check if the contacts are in your account by signing in to

<h2>            I keep getting reminders about calendar items and the calendar has been deleted. How do I stop the reminders&#63;</h2>
                    When I click on the link "View Details" in the email I get this message on the web page, "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Calendar error</span>

When I click on the link "Stop Getting Notifications", I get "</div>

Outlook Calendar has new and improved reminders
</div>
<div>
We've listened to your feedback and know you'd like better reminders with more flexibility. So, now you can:
<ul>
<li>Set up multiple reminders for each event and send them to your email address.</li><li>Set up different reminders for each one of your calendars. New events that you create on each calendar will get those reminders by default. (Don't worry, you can still set different reminders for individual events.)</li><li>Get notified when someone updates an event or task on a shared calendar.</li></ul>
To get started, click&nbsp;<span>Start using new reminders,&nbsp;</span>then set them up the way you want them. Once you've clicked it, we'll also save any changes you've made on this page.

<span>Note:&nbsp;</span>In the next few months, all Calendar users will automatically start using new reminders. So, once you click&nbsp;<span>Start using new reminders,&nbsp;</span>you can't go back to the old reminders."</div>

I think that Microsoft has a back up somewhere from an old calendar and the sync didn't happen when I deleted that calendar.&nbsp;</div>

            It's been 4 months since I sent in the information on specific emails that I keep receiving to the Microsoft staff monitoring this post and still not any resolution. In fact, it's been about two months since anyone has responded to my private post. I still
 keep receiving the automated emails and no way to stop them. Somewhere on a Microsoft server is a back up copy of my calendar that they can''t find and delete it. I wish someone would respond to me with a resolution.

    <title>ROUNDUP and Multiply within the same cell - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ROUNDUP and Multiply within the same cell</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to round up within a cell and use this rounded up value to then multiply. However, Excel seems to be using the actual value and not the rounded up value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to achieve the following: £19,049 + £115 for each additional 75m2 in excess of 3,750m2 to a maximum of £250,000</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming a value of 3792m2 the additional m2 is only 42m2, however, the full £115 charge still applies and is not proportionally applied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The total payable should be £19,049 + £115 = 19,164</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have used the following formula in excel:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>=19049+((ROUNDUP(((B8+B9)-3750)/75,1))*115)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this gives the answer as £19,118</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone help me with, how I tell Excel to use the ROUNDUP VALE i.e. 1 and not 0.56??</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANK YOU<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <p>In your formula, instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,1&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to use&nbsp;&nbsp; ,0</p>
<p>so, your formula should be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =19049+((ROUNDUP(((B8+B9)-3750)/75,0))*115)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is Helpful.</p>

            <p>Hi JP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very true.&nbsp; I fully agree with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the formula suggested by me was with the assumption that the user would take care of&nbsp;the input values such that the output is never negative.</p>
<p>Secondly, the user had not indicated any such possibility and hence I felt it not necessary to complicate the formula.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good defensive programming.&nbsp; But if that's your only intent, the following should be a sufficient tweak to Rajesh's suggestion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=19049 + <strong>MAX(0,</strong> ROUNDUP((B8+B9-3750)/75, 0)*115<strong>)</strong></p>
