<h2>            Disconnected from LIVE when I am using any up&#47;downstream bandwidth through the console.</h2>
                    
<p>I can connect to LIVE fine, but as soon as I join a match, try to download a video or anything other than idling or browsing the marketplace, I am immediately disconnected from LIVE.&nbsp; I am able to reconnect almost instantly and it will stay connected until
 I actually use the service.</p>
<p>Also, I had no issues downloading the update.&nbsp; I just redownloaded it to see if that was the cause, but it updated just fine.&nbsp; So I know it isn't the Xbox's network adapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is going on here?&nbsp; Is anyone else having a similar issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>soubnds like a router problem, &nbsp;sometimes routers ports can go bad and cause this. &nbsp;try a different port on the router.</p>

<p>All ports are opened, even those not listed on the run-of-the-mill port forwarding sites.</p>
<p>My Residential Gateway and all it's components are in top condition, as is my entire network, physical or otherwise. &nbsp;I ensure this on a daily basis.</p>
<p>My consoles network adapter is also in working order, as I am able to download (and re-download after maintenance) the latest update in the blink of an eye, with out a catch.</p>
<p>This issue began occurring immediately after updating to the latest dashboard version.</p>
<p>As soon as I begin to use any bandwidth (sans updating from the MS servers), eg: joining a match, downloading content, etc, I am disconnected from LIVE.</p>
<p>Thanks for the helpful advice, but I am still experiencing this issue. &nbsp;So, any further advice is definitely appreciated.</p>

<p>Well you can try to delete the system update and re-download it to make sure it's not corrupt. Follow this link on how to deleteL:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's still giving you issues try connecting the xbox360 directly to your modem. If the problem persists then it's most likely an issue with the ISP. If you find it clears up, there's probably a setting on the router causing the issue.</p>

                    <p>I have looked around and tried many of the other solutions across these forums and elsewhere but I have had no luck. I recently build this computer and I can get windows to activate or to do anything else related to it without getting error 0x80070005. I

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Communities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue may occur due to lack of permissions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One of more of these registry keys may be missing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to refer to the following article and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2008385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2008385</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back
 up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</div>

            <p>I've already tried downloading other registry fixes, but they did not work (I had been messing with this issue for 3 days before I finally made a post here) and I also tried the GPO/Plug and Play fixes, but (at least from what I read) they don't apply or
 at least aren't changeable in the version of Windows 7 that I have (Home Premium).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have already tried both potential solutions you gave but with no luck at fixing my problem. Unless there is another way to disable the GPO/Plug and Play stuff on Windows 7 Home Premium.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do get the 0x80070005 when I try to activate windows normally, but when I try the slmgr.vbs /dlv command in the command prompt (running as admin as well) I do not get this error like in your suggested fix:
<span><em>Error: 0x80070005 Access denied: the requested action requires elevated privileges
</em></span></p>
<p>Instead I get: </p>
<p><em>Script: C:\Windows\s</em><em>ystem32\slmgr.vbs </em></p>
<p><em>Line: 1333 </em></p>
<p><em>Char: 5: </em></p>
<p><em>Error: Permission denied </em></p>

<h2>            Wifi disconnects every few minutes</h2>
                    <p>I've read a lot of similar quarries, though didn't find an exact match, nor a working solution.<br />
<br />
I have a Windows7 desktop PC with a wifi dongle - netgear n3400v3<br />
It's been working fine for 2 months.<br />
<br />
A few days ago it started to randomly disconnect for no reason, I need to run trouble shoot, then reconnect<br />
manually to my router, even though its set to auto connect.<br />
If I unplug=replug the dongle, it will reconnect automatic, but drop again in a minute or 2.<br />
<br />
tried so far:<br />
I've tested the dongle and driver on 2 other windows 7 machines, plus a windows 8. All fine, nothing wrong with the router, hardware,&nbsp;<br />
drivers and USB ports. </p>
<p>I've deleted an reinstalled all wifi and usb and LAN drivers just to be sure, and made sure power settings are good.<br />
I've tried disabling Antivirus software too.<br />
<br />
some things I've noticed. When I updated my motherboard drivers and disabled the antivirus.<br />
I noticed that while data was transfering rapidly the connection was more stable, while watching a Youtube clip for example.<br />
as soon as the data slowed the connection dropped.<br />
I've tried to replicate this, but it seems to have stopped.<br />
The longest I can connect now is about 1-2 minutes before it drops off.<br />
<br />
I also notice that I have 2 connections, one is labelled for my Netgear wifi dongle,<br />
the other is named, Microsoft virtual Wifi Miniport ...<br />
<br />
If anybody has any clue what can cause this I'd be most appreciative,<br />
thanks<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the internet connection drops after a minute or two and I will be happy to answer your query. Also, I appreciate the effort made towards trying to fix the issue. Let's try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Reset TCP/IP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reset command is available in the IP context of the NetShell utility. Follow these steps to use the reset command to reset TCP/IP manually:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Open Command prompt in admin mode (press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>
X</strong> and click<strong> Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
b. When the User Account Control box pop up, click <strong>Yes</strong>.<br />
c. At the command prompt, copy and paste (or type) the following command and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not want to specify a directory path for the log file, use the following command and press
<strong>Enter</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. Reboot the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Connect to your router (by typing 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 in the address bar) and log in. Check your user manual or documentation if you do not know the log-in credentials.<br />
b. Make sure you are in the Setup -&gt; Basic Setup category.<br />
c. Scroll down until you see 'DHCP Server' - if it is disabled, select <strong>'Enable'</strong>.<br />
d. Enable DHCP If you want, you can change the number that the DHCP IP assigning starts. (this is optional)<br />
e. Use the DNS servers provided to you by your ISP. There are many DNS servers out there. It's best to use your ISP's if possible.<br />
f. Scroll down and click 'Save Settings'.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
b. Go to Networking and sharing center and then click on Change adapter settings.<br />
c. Right click on <strong>Local Area Connection </strong>and choose <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
d. Highlight <strong>Internet Protocol Version 6</strong> and click on <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
e. Choose <strong>Obtain DNS server address automatically </strong>and press <strong>
Ok</strong>.<br />
f. Choose <strong>Obtain IP address automatically</strong>.<br />
g. Repeat the steps for Internet Protocol version 4 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>In my experience, what you describe tells me it's a router problem.&nbsp; I suggest you reset the router to factory settings and re-install it as if new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Small hole in the back of the router that may be labeled reset.&nbsp; Straighten a paper clip and press it into that hole hard and for at least 15 seconds.&nbsp; Your router will re-boot and be back where it was when you took it out of the box.&nbsp; Now go through the
 same setup procedure you followed when it was new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If resetting does not solve the problem, consider a replacement.&nbsp; They are not that expensive and maybe superior to the one you are replacing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also possible that wireless interference is the cause, but that is far less likely from what you describe.&nbsp; Consider exactly where that wireless dongle is situated on your computer and with the other equipment in your office.</p>

            <p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p>I tried method 1 and 3, unfortunately they didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and I tried 2, but it asked for a password and unser, which I'm not sure of.</p>
<p>Though I don't think the router is the problem anyway, because there are currently 3 phones, 2 tablets, and 3 other computers in this house, and they all connect fine, and have not been affected at all.</p>
<p>Only my workstation PC is affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This evening I've not been able to connect for longer than 1 minute at a time, it's hell :(</p>
<p>the error windows tells me is - reset your wireless network controller</p>
<p>I've reset my router already, that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p>I tried a reset, but it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it's any of the hardware. Because I've tested all of it, and had no issues with it.</p>
<p>Currently there are 4 computes, 2 tablets, and 4 phones in the house which all have constant connection, and are %100 fine. I can use the dongle on any other computer and it works perfect.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>The only machine affected is my workstation PC.&nbsp;<br />
any thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's get your Surface RT start up issue resolved. A way to have this fixed is by using a
<strong>recovery USB drive</strong>. You can do this by downloading a recovery image for your Surface from this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, and creating a
<strong>Bootable USB</strong> <strong>drive</strong> by following the steps in this

</p><p>Keep us updated with the result, we'll look out for your reply.<br />

<p>Thank you for the update. Let's try another method. Check out this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023533/surface-restore-or-reset-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> about
<strong>restoring or resetting Surface devices</strong>. Click on the hyperlink that says
<strong>Use a recovery drive to reinstall Windows</strong> and follow the given steps. You need to reinstall Windows on the device to get away from the automatic repair loop.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail emails all of sudden give errors when trying to send or receive on both Live Mail 2012 PC and Android 6.01</h2>
                    <p>After I changed my password on my Microsoft Account I can no longer send or receive emails using Live Mail 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made sure there were no emails in the outgoing folder</p>
<p>Deleted my Hotmail account from Live Mail 2012 and my Galaxy S7 and tried to add it to both. On the PC I could add the email account but on the Galaxy S7 it would not allow it. &nbsp;On my PC it allowed the addition of the email account but would still not send
 or receive.</p>
<p>I can access my Hotmail emails by going to the appropriate Microsoft's web page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message I get is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Unable to send or receive messages for the Hotmail (*********) account.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Server Error: 3219</strong></p>
<p><strong>Server: 'https://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/Sync.aspx'</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x8DE00005</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said above everything was fine until I changed my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated as I use the Hotmail emails on a regular basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers Kym</p>

            <p>Thank you for your quick reply but I should have mentioned that I have already tried the IMAP configuration as my Hotmail account has been upgraded (Outlook Mail) as you have shown above (the black background one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter all of the parameters as per your instructions it concludes and then tries to download the folders and then fails giving the below error message</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>AUTHENTICATE failed.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Configuration:</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Account: Hotmail (**********)</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Server: imap-mail.outlook.com</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Username: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Protocol: IMAP</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port: 993</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Secure(SSL): 1</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Code: 800ccc0f</strong><br />
</p>
<p>The folders in the recently setup hotmail account are exactly the same as the ones in the web Hotmail email account page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I still can't setup my Hotmail email account on either my PC (running Win 10 64 byte) or my Samsung Galaxy S7 Dual.</p>

<p>This is a known server problem which started a few days ago. Outlook engineers are working on a fix, but there's no ETA yet for a solution. Please use webmail meanwhile.

<p>
</p><p>This is funny because a mate of mine here in Australia also suddenly lost (stopped working) his Hotmail account on his PC and Samsung S5. &nbsp;We went for a ride yesterday evening (he has a Harley and I an Indian) and had dinner. &nbsp;Over dinner we discussed our
 Hotmail problem and I was able to set up his Hotmail email account using IMAP on his Samsung S5 no problems. &nbsp;Yet mine still will not setup. &nbsp;Why is this I wonder?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two different situations, not necessarily related:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Your mate's account had probably just been migrated&nbsp; to Outlook Mail. This migration started in May 2015 and is only now drawing to its close - there were, after all, of the order of 500,000,000 accounts to be migrated to new servers, with all their folders,
 messages, contacts and calendar events. That is an unimaginable amount of data to be shifted. Anyway, once migrated, the account will in most cases have to be set up again to refresh the sync relationship with the server.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>You were facing a particular server error that has affected a small number of Hotmail accounts in the past few days. This is the error that's being worked on.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You would both be well advised to use the Outlook for Android app for your mail handling on the Samsung (assuming it's an Android device). I'm told it's much better than the built-in mail app, and even better than the equivalent that we Windows 10 Mobile
 users have to put up with.</p>

<h2>            Printer driver is unavailable</h2>
                    I have an HP Officejet Pro 8610 and a laptop that's running Win 10, 64 bit. I reloaded windows 10 on my pc and now I can't print. I get a message that says the print driver is unavailable. I worked before I reloaded Windows 10. Also, I can't join the homegroup.
 I don't know if the two are connected.

            I have downloaded the newest driver, three times! I have downloaded and used HP Print and Scan Doctor. I have gone to every site I can found and tried their suggestions. I have used the Print Troubleshooter, Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall, and
 I checked out a couple of sites that blame it on an issue between Windows 10 and the HP Print driver. This is why I've reached out to you. There's a bigger problem here than what can be easily fixed with troubleshooter.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removed Contact status</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to see a contact skype status if you do not add them or they have not add you ? I am using skype mobile on iphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, a friend of mine have removed me from his skype. Previously, you will know you have been removed from one skype account when you get the “ You haven’t Chatter on skype” screen and you won’t be able to see their skype status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But lately, I am able to see his skype status eventhough his ID is not added on my skype account. &nbsp;I tried on my other contacts. If I removed their ID, I can only see their status as “ last seen days ago”. Why is that only his ID I am</p>
<p>able to see his status ? Is that mean he added my ID back ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I login using Skype Classic on desktop, I can see a grey “?” which means he had deleted/blocked me. But when login using latest version skype, there is no indication of him deleted/blocked me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What went wrong ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>TQ</p>
<p>

<h2>            usb camera and bluetooth not working</h2>
                    Hi, I m an IT guy that has run out of ideas.&nbsp; I would like to ask you some questions about a (probably hardware realted)&nbsp; problem that i have. All started suddenly , from one day to another all usb ports, camera and bluetooth stoped working. I dont really
 care about the bluetooth and the camera, the only thing i care about are the usb ports. I 've checked them with a multimeter (only the pins that provide power) and the strange thing is that they do provide power. If i connect something like a usb flash drive
 , the led flashes (stays on , doesnt flickers) but nothing happens. I am sure that's not a drivers problem because the laptop doesnt even recognize them in UEFI nor CSM.&nbsp; My UEFI does not have an option to completely disable usb ports, only to change from
 usb 2 to 3 (no change at all). I m sure it's now a power problem, i ve reseted the bios even by the motherboard jumper.So the question is , what it may be? is it a motherboard malfuction ? Can it be fixed? Also , is there any possibility that for example the
 camera is faulty , or the camera cable , and shortcutting something? (i mean if i disconnect the camera and the bluetooth, is there any possibility that it will be fixed? ) thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
p.s. also on the motherboard there isnt anything strange like a blown up resistor or something.<br />

<h2>            Logitech USB Headset H540 and Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    I have read on the Logitech forum that some people have problems with the H540 and then again some do not. A general Google search is equally vague. Can someone answer the&nbsp;question once and for all. Does Windows 10 Pro support the H540 and does anything&nbsp;need
 to be done to the settings?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I will probably return the Logitech H540 where I bought it from and look for something else. I have had the chance to listen to the recording and the noise made when you touch the microphone to adjust it, even when you do so carefully, the recorded noise
 is very bad. I would certainly appreciate advice if anyone knows of a better product.&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox One X Kinect Compatibilty Breaks the Consumer Law - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> insipidcjs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One X Kinect Compatibilty Breaks the Consumer Law</h2>
                    <p>Sup Guys,

</p><p><br /></p><p>Essentially the way Xbox has advertised and presented the compatibility of the Kinect is in breach of the consumer law and due to that, actually legally entitles everyone to either a refund of the X or reimbursement of the cost of the adapter or an adapter free of charge. The ACCC are aware of this and agree with said claim. The only way they could remove this legal requirement is to remove an misleading parts of the ad, which they have not. And even if done, it only applies to people who purchased the X after removal.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Have of read of the claim I've sent to Eb Games below comment or even send a version to Xbox/Eb Games if you think Xbox shouldn't get away with this and offer adapters free of charge to owners with proof of purchase and ownership. You can legally ask of this of either the company you purchased it from or the manufacturer, it's your choice and they must deal with that.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>"To Eb Games Australia,</p><p><br /></p>

<p>On 07/11/2017, I purchased the Xbox One X from Eb Games Australia.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Many months before the Xbox One X's launch and to exactly prior, both you (Eb Games) and Xbox Australia (and all other English speaking countries that sell Xbox products) have been displaying an advertisement that states "All the Xbox One accessories you have now (or have got your eye on) work with Xbox One X. No adapters, No hassle. Just play."</p><p><br /></p>

<p>That seems like a fairly blatant and straight forward statement (no asterisks or special conditions/policies were included with any of said advertisement iterations). Which essentially tell the consumer that the X will support all accessories for the Xbox One, which, of course, includes the Kinect. The Kinect is advertised and sold under the accessories title in both the Eb Games and Microsoft stores, meaning that under the consumer law, it must be deemed as an accessory.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Based on this advertisement, the Kinect should be fully compatible with the X and require no adapters, however this is not case. It requires an adapter and at a cost, this is where the breach in consumer law has occurred, the direct consumer guarantees that have been breached are listed below. No mention of requiring an adapter (or at a cost) are mentioned anywhere on your website or Xbox's website. There is a difficult to find page (on Xbox.com.au) that states the S needs an adapter, however no mention is made of the X.</p>

<p>The steps I've taken to resolve this have been two online support chats with Xbox Australia and one phone call, all having led to the same answer (including direct from the hardware department): "that I will have to buy an adapter, if I want to use the Kinect accessory".<br />This is not only a breach of consumer law but a refusal to adhere to it, which is openly breaking Australian Law.</p>

<p>Subsequently after my initial email, Xbox Australia altered the advertisement to not include the "no adapters" line, however said edit still breaks the consumer law. You, Eb Games, also removed said advertisement at the same time on your social media and Xbox One X page, as well as many other companies, which is highly coincidental. However, at the time of writing this, you still have an iteration of said advertisement displayed on your social media page.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Even if said advertisement was retracted, I purchased the X with the understanding, from that advertisement, that I would be able to use the Kinect. Therefore, even retracted it is still valid in this claim, as it was retracted after my purchases and after being given the understanding/guarantee from the advertisement. Meaning retracting/removing is not a valid form of removal of liability.<br />Please note, that as sellers of Microsoft products, you both represent their advertisements and are responsible for adhering to them (and yours) or clearly correcting your version of the advertisements (which was never done).</p>

<p>I understand that under the Australian Consumer Law, when I buy products and services they come with automatic guarantees that they will work and do what I asked for.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>I will be providing screenshots of the advertisement in question, including a direct image of it being advertised on Eb Game's social media page. As well as a copy of text correspondence from Microsoft.</p><p><br />To support the breach in consumer law: "fitness for disclosed purpose/be fit for the purpose the business told you it would be fit for and for any purpose that you made known to the business before purchasing/match descriptions made by the salesperson, on packaging and labels, and in promotions or advertising/not carry any hidden debts or extra charges/meet any extra promises made about performance, condition and quality, such as life time guarantees and money back offers".</p><p><br />These direct quotes apply to how the advertisements in question have breached different aspects of consumer guarantees.</p>

<p>In order for this matter to be resolved, it is my expectation that EB Games adhere to the consumer law by providing a suitable remedy to the breaches and either a) reimburse myself for the cost of a Kinect adapter ($54.95 AUD, not including postage cost) or b) provide a Kinect adapter without cost. Please note, that as the consumer, I have the right to request this of you over or, as well as, the manufacturer and it is your responsibility to liaison with the manufacturer, if you need do so.</p><p><br />If the steps outlined above and below are not successful, I am willing to take the case to the small claims court.</p>

<p>If I do not hear from you within 5 working days, I will lodge a formal complaint with Office of Fair Trading Queensland and/or report my issue to the ACCC."</p>

            <p>An update, within a day EB Games replied and obliged with a new adapter, obviously they know how to run a business.&nbsp;They updated their advertisements too, so buying one from them after the 11/11/2017 will make a claim invalid, but if you bought from them prior or bought from or do from any retailers who haven't updated their advertisements, under law, you're still required compensation.&nbsp;</p>

I've tried to install Works Suite 2003 on my laptop using Windows 7, 64 bit. It has a problem loading and wants to run a clean boot. The clean boot instructions do not apply to windows 7, so how do I get this Microsoft program on this machine running a Microsoft
 OS?

<p>You can try to run the program in the XP Mode:</p>

    <title>Problems with Xbox one since buying an elite controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vanishingghosts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Xbox one since buying an elite controller</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox One X and the Elite controller since updating it the xbox menu doesnt work. During games all buttons work as they should, but on the home screen I have to press and hold the A button for a long time or keep tapping it for it to make a selection.
 My joysticks are also acting like they're stuck in the up position. As if i go to configure on the controller section it shows the right stick being pushed up on multiple controllers. I've reset the Xbox via Hard Reset, changed power outlets, changed Controller
 from Elite to Regular and even did a full factory reset. Nothing fixes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS SINCE THE ELITE CONTROLLER UPDATE IT NEEDS FIXING!</p>

            You need to change the settings for the controller , there should be a section under configure controller that allows to change the dead spaces on the joy sticks make sure that they are turned down and centered also when you turn on the xbox try from the
 console itself and dont touch the controller. Take tha battries out , put new ones in. And then resnyc the controller to the xbox , do not touch the joy sticks when you do this&nbsp;

    <title>Windows is in a crash dump loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardmiller51  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows is in a crash dump loop</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had windows 7 home premium that had been upgraded from vista with an upgrade disc that came from the Microsoft store (gift).&nbsp; It was registered and I'd been using windows 7 for some time.&nbsp; Just before the crash when it had almost updated to windows
 10 it said "your version of windows 7 is not genuine and did a crash dump and offered me the chance to repair windows. I said yes, and it kept almost going into windows but crash dumping and asking me if I wanted to try to repair or start windows normally.&nbsp;
 After trying both a few times I got out the windows 7 32 bit repair disk.&nbsp; Wasn't any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a Compaq CQ60 and I had Linux operating system with dual boot.&nbsp; The Linux still works but the windows is shot.&nbsp; I never requested an upgrade to windows 10 from this computer, I&nbsp;did the install off a friend's jump drive he made specifically
 for my Compaq.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm hoping to do a clean install with the jump drive, how possible is this given the above information?&nbsp; I'm planning on formatting the entire drive and getting rid of the Linux.&nbsp; My friend says this is feasible but I should ask Microsoft to check my
 windows 7 upgrade registration and give them the serial number of my Compaq.&nbsp; Can I be steered a little on this?</p>

            hello again, I got through to microsoft support and they had some bad news...&nbsp; it seems there is no way to verify the genuineness of my windows 7 upgrade or that my computer is registered with microsoft.&nbsp; I was informed that I couldn't get the free upgrade
 and would have to purchase windows 7 again and do a clean install and try to upgrade again to windows10.&nbsp; I haven't given up on fixing this without buying another windows 7.&nbsp; A friend sent me a link to an article on repairing the "windows is not genuine" error
 but the method didn't work, I could get a command prompt up but the command wasn't recognised.&nbsp; I'm going to get in touch with the person that bought me my windows 7 upgrade and see what he says.&nbsp; Thanks,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard

            <p>Further news...</p>
<p>I found the disc I used to upgrade and did a fresh install.&nbsp; Some of many updates are causing it to do the crash dump loop, not sure which ones but I can revive the windows by going back a restore point now.&nbsp; I am downloading only the important updates now
 and it's going okay...&nbsp; so far.&nbsp; I will try to update to windows 10 again if I can get it updated enough.&nbsp; Am not through with this problem yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>most recently...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reformatted the hard drive and did a clean install with windows 7.&nbsp; Over 200 updates later...I think I'm ready to try again.&nbsp; I have the get windows 10 app and it tells me that I'm registered for the upgrade but it won't tell me if my computer is ready.&nbsp;
 I will try again to do the windows 10 upgrade.</p>

</p><p>2.&nbsp; Computer is a Compaq Presario CQ60-210US, it came with vistaq and I upgraded it to windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; This is happening at this moment, we shall see if it crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Windows 7 is activated, I just reinstalled it and used the Product Key at the aqppropriate time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I turn on power it Starts going into Windows.&nbsp; Before it gets into windows it does a crash dump (blue screen).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It then goes into an options screen and restarts windows again after a time out, only to crash dump again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the options screen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; It means windows is no good, it won't start or repair it's starting problems.&nbsp; I had to reinstall it.</p>

    <title>Error 0xc0000185 stuck at boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mskid08544  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0xc0000185 stuck at boot</h2>
                    <p>While I was using the computer for internet browsing, it suddenly blacked out. And then when I tried turning it on again. It doesn't boot at all, instead shows only the Windows Boot Manager black screen with error 0xc0000185 and message of "An unexpected
 error has occurred."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried booting with a recovery drive I created, unfortunately it still goes back to that screen with the same error message.</p>
<p>I also tried accessing the BIOS by keying F8 and checked for the boot devices, I can see only one hard drive (HGST HTS545050A....). The device I'm using is the Asus T100TA with Keyboard Dock (64 GB SSD + 500 GB HD on the dock). Now, I am guessing that 0xc0000185
 means that it the boot manager has troubles connecting to the internal disk where Windows is installed. I wanted to know if my assumptions are correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks guys for your help in advance. :)</p>

            <p>However, I tried booting a UEFI Windows 8.1 64 bit installer. But it doesn't boot to the drive where the Windows 8.1 installer is located. And as I read into the other forums, I believe that I have a 32bit UEFI BIOS.
</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll try booting a 32bit Windows 8.1 installer and will update you if it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - I called ASUS Support and apparently it's a hardware issue. Thanks for your help</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>LG GSA-E50N external DVD Multi Slim Rewriter may or may not be compatible with WIndows 7. On some websites, the information states that it is compatibile with only Windows Vista.</p>
<p>I'd have you install the vista drivers for LG GSAE50N External Portable DVD Rewriter and check.</p>
<p>If that does not help, please get in touch with <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/support/product/support-product.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>How do I disable power save mode&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lorenh.  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable power save mode&#63;</h2>
                    I own a dell desktop running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. Lately, whenever I start up a game, it will allow me to play for a limited amount of time before switching without warning to "Power Save Mode." Keep in mind that this can happen at any time,
 in the middle of anything, not just if I leave the computer alone for a while. I'm not sure if it's supposed to work this way, but it does: In power save mode the computer stays on, and goes into sleep mode, except that shaking the mouse, tapping keyboard
 keys or any other effort to turn it back have no effect. It's as good as crashing, since there is no way to escape it without manually restarting the computer. I have searched the options in the control panel but have found nothing which would enable me to
 disable power save mode.<br />

            Running both the power troubleshooter and the hardware troubleshooter did not fix the problem, and my video driver was already updated. As for event viewer, I made note of the time it crashed (5:25 PM), however nothing was noted in the event log.&nbsp; Also,
 I do not want to disable sleep mode overall, simply disable random events such as this. If it helps at all, I've discovered that this event only occurs during multi-player games. Nonetheless, if someone could give me good advice on how to fix this it would
 be fantastic, and thanks for all the support already.<br />
