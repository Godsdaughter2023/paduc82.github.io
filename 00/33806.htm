<h2>            Sound stops working after sleep mode in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have just installed Windows 7, Xonar HDAV 1.3 Slim audio card, ASUS M4a78 Pro motherboard with ASUS quad core processor.&nbsp; Works great until it goes into sleep mode.&nbsp; When it wakes up, the sound doesn't work.&nbsp; When I test the various devices, the sound
 bar registers output, but no sound appears.&nbsp; Updated BIOS and drivers and that didn't help.&nbsp; All system sounds and any MCE sounds or anything do not work until I restart.&nbsp; I've seen hotfixes for this problem in Vista, but it won't even install into my computer
 because I have Windows 7.&nbsp; Thanks for any help!

    <title>Western Digital My Passport authentication - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curtiswollam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Western Digital My Passport authentication</h2>
                    <p>I had upgraded my last computer to Windows 10.&nbsp; My hard drive crashed, now I have a new laptop with Windows 7.&nbsp; My last computer, as it had Windows 7, would run the external with no problems.&nbsp; Now, with the new laptop with Windows 7, I have to authenticate
 my external every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a guy take my old computer and copy the files I needed from it to the Passport.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to authenticate this passport so it will quit asking me to authenticate.&nbsp; I need some to help me authenticate the authentication, because it's not authenticating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, guys.</p>

            Hey there Curtis,<br />
<br />
Can you post a screenshot of how the OS is asking you to authenticate the drive? I believe this can be of help to you: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=cokGFW<br />
In short: check the ownership of the portable drive and the permissions for it. :) Post back with the results.<br />
<br />

            How did you create your password? Have you checked if there are any settings there that would require this frequent authentication?<br />
Try disabling the password protection and see if it again requires authentication.<br />

            Does this happen on other computers when you operate with the drive? check if the OS itself has some security option that forces you to authenticate the drive every 15 minutes. Also try contacting MS's support and see what the guys can offer as a solution.
 :)<br />

            Few KB updates do cause problems on various systems. You can do 2 things -
<br />
<br />1. Right click on the graphics card driver in Device Manager &gt; Properties &gt; Driver &gt; Roll back if roll back is enabled (I think you are already doing it)
<br />OR
<br />2. You can uninstall this KB update and hide so that it doesn't happen in future. You should uninstall this update and block it from happening again. If you block it, it doesn't install on its own. 
<br />
<br />A. Type appwiz.cpl in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Click appwiz.cpl &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Under Microsoft Windows, look if KB4103721 is installed &gt; If yes, right click on it and Uninstall 
<br />
<br />B. Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update. Download the tool from below link 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />When you run this, it will search for available updates and list them 
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions

            I would recommend that you should consider rolling back 1803 to 1709 and defer it from happening as there seem to be issues. Try to install this after a month or two when more cum packs are released stabilizing 1803 further. (Roll back can be done only if you were upgraded during last 10 days i.e. you are within 10 days roll back window)
<br />
<br />Roll Back - Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Under Go back to previous version of Windows 10, Get Started &gt; Follow onscreen directions

    <title>Duplicate pictures after copying and pasting from on folder to another - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Duplicate pictures after copying and pasting from on folder to another</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Mick Dowdeswell and I would like to know how I can move pictures fro the gallery into a new folder in the folder lists side. By copying and pasting a photo from one folder to another, a duplicate copy appears next to the original, resulting in
 many unwanted photos in the gallery. If I try to drag and drop, a 'banned' sign appears i.e. a red circle with diagonal line appears. Any replies would be most welcome. Thanks.</p>

            <p>When you drag and drop photos to another folder on the same drive, they are moved. Note the little message balloon that says "Move to xxx". When you drag and drop to a folder in another drive, the operation makes a copy. The little balloon will say "Copy
 to xxx". You can specify moving the files, rather than copying, by holding down the Shift key. Again check the little advisory note so you know for sure what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, copying and pasting to another folder does just that, makes a copy and places it into the other folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that Photo Gallery shows the thumbnails of the photos in a folder and all those in sub-folders. So if you move a photo from a folder to a sub-folder (in the same folder) the thumbnail will continue to show.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under what condition do you see the red circle indicating that an operation is not valid? usually you see this only if you do not have access rights to a folder.</p>

            <p>Hello Ludwig. Thanks for your reply. It's much appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All photos in my folders are from me, so I should have access rights to them all.</p>
<p>I've just tried moving a photo into&nbsp;the new&nbsp;folder by holding down the Shift key and the left mouse key, but the same thing happens in that the invalid icon appears and it will not be moved by that method.</p>
<p>Pressing the right key and clicking on Copy and Pasting into the new folder works, but immediately puts another photo alongside the original.</p>
<p>I don't get a balloon saying "Copy to xxx" as you describe. My sister has the same system, i.e. Photo Gallery and I've seen her move photos ok, with the balloon message attached, but for some reason, I don't.</p>
<p>Still a mystery I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Should I be in "My Pictures" or "Pictures" when I try these operations? I have tried both ways though and I get the same results.</p>

            <p>Sorry that we didn't get your question resolved, Mick. </p>
<p>I would like to duplicate your problem, to do so I need to know a lot more details. What version of Windows are you running? Which build of Photo Gallery do you have (File tab &gt; About Photo Gallery)? Do you have a folder selected when you try to move photos
 or a tag or date? When you get the slashed circle what does it say after "You can't add file to" in the little tooltip balloon? You are welcome to get in touch with me via email, that might be easier so we can share screen clips and more. If you wish to do
 that go to <a href="http://askludwig.com/ask/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ask Ludwig</a>.</p>

<h2>            Toshiba Tecra R850 Locks up after Upgrade to Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Toshiba Tecra R850 from win7 Pro64 to Win 8 pro64 and it locks up without fail, sometimes after about 30 minutes and some time longer. The fan comes on when it does lockup.</p>
<p>I looked at the Toshiba web site and unfortunately for me their upgrade assistant is only due on the 21 Nov 2012. Any clues on resolving this irritation.</p>

<p><span>Firstly there is no error message and secondly when it locks, cannot do anything except power off by holding down the power
 button.</span></p>
<p><span>With regards to the solution, the “</span><strong><span>On

<h2>            Unable to open wps files</h2>
                    I have a new desktop with 64 bit Windows 10. It does not have MS Works installed as my Windows 7 did. Now I am not able to open wps files I saved with old computer. This is unacceptable !! Several years of work are unavailable to me. I can not find a solution
 online.

<p>MS Works was discontinued many years ago and is not supported on Windows 10.&nbsp;However, if you have Microsoft Office installed on your computer you can get a free converter from Microsoft that will convert the .wps file to Word's .doc or .docx format.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you don't have Word it may be possible to open your .wps file in one of the other office suites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be familiar with the expression "nothing lasts forever." In the world of technology, 'forever' has a remarkably short time span.</p>

    <title>Problems with Microsoft Money Plus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeepermann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Microsoft Money Plus</h2>
                    <p>I've already read that Microsoft does not support Money Plus, but it's on my computer and I like &amp; use it all the time. Recently had some issues with a security update. Had a tech through a remote access fix my PC some, but still having problems. Whenever
 I open Money plus I get this message. "Money requires access to certain files such as My Documents. Log in to Windows as an adminstrator or user with access to these files and then run Money again".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this Dell desktop PC as a used machine a few years (2-3 yrs) ago from a computer repair shop. That shop is no longer in business. Whenever I try to log in as an adminstrator it ask for a password. I have no clue as to what that password is. Because
 when I bought this Dell I never had to set it up in my name in the registration process - like I had done before with a brand new machine. I plugged it in, turned it on and right away was using the PC. I'm thinking that the tech that worked on this Dell did
 not properly clean the hard drive of all personal data when reinstalling Windows 7 before selling it as a used machine. I've upgraded (without added cost) to Windows 10. It never did ask me to purchase Windows 10. It simply downloaded and installed Windows
 10.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Detail specs of Surface pro 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sunahjeong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Detail specs of Surface pro 4</h2>
                    <p>I'm an architecture student and as &nbsp;a sub computer I'm considering buying a <strong>
Surface Pro 4 (Core i7,256gssd, 16g ram, $1699)</strong></p>
<p>even it will be a sub computer, i need it to run auto-cad, rendering programs, Photoshop and etc perfectly.</p>
<p>One of my colleague has said it runs most of the programs we need with no difficulty. and since it's super light,</p>
<p>I am kinda really into buying that one. but before I jump into conclusion, there are several things to make sure.</p>
<p>I hope I could get clear answers for these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>1. There are no specific detail specs for surface pro 4.</strong></p>
<p>on this website, I only find that its CPU is i7 with 256g SSD and 16g ram.</p>
<p>I want to know what generation of i7 is being used, how's the clock speed, what graphic card is being used and etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume those will be quite good enough to run the programs that i need but as a buyer, and as a person who is trying to compare many different kinds of laptop including surface, i really need to know these information. with same amount of money, why not
 buy the ones with better specs? checked on several other web pages for laptops and i can't simply give some comparison!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Personally I give more priority on specs than lightness.</p>
<p>I want my laptop to be light but it should pass my expectation. yes, performance is number 1 thing to consider for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. Monitor compatibility</strong></p>
<p>I was told that I can connect my monitor to surface. But I'm concerned about the resolution it can support and if there is any specific monitor that fits/runs perfectly with the surface.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>3. Weight</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I am thinking of buying <strong>Su</strong><strong>rface Pro 4 (Core i7,256gssd, 16g ram, $1699).&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p>How much does it weigh?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. Windows/ MS Office installed?</strong></p>
<p>Are windows/ ms office already installed? is additional purchase needed? <strong>
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading my post and for the reply!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>This is the error I constantly get while playing minecraft on my windows 10 laptop. it says "recovered" except it doesn't actually recover anything. It just freezes my screen and I have to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10 back in November and ever since then I have gotten this error, I only just started recently gaming heavily so I notice it much more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, before everyone tells me to update my driver software, uninstall and reboot or restore my computer...I have done all of that and still nothing. I just want to go back to windows 8 if it will solve it because it has gotten unbearable except I can't figure
 out how to go back to windows 8!</p>
<p>

            <p>To answer your question, yes I have tried to reinstall the graphics drivers multiple times. I have a 2014 HP envy, I don't know much else about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My processor is a Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-4700MQ CPU @ 2.40 GHz&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 4600 and Nvidia GeForce GT 740m</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea if I have a windows 10 graphics driver installed on my computer, I do not know how to do that. I did what you said with going to the manufacturers website and it won't even install. Do I even have the right link?&nbsp;https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25188/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10-15-33-</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, could you please show me what I exactly need to download because when I select compatibility, there is not even a windows 10 option. When I install it with windows 8 compatibility it says that my driver is not validated for my computer.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for helping, I am installing the GeForce graphics drivers now. My question is though, since the error message I originally got mentioned the intel HD graphics card, shouldn't that one be the problem? Why do I have two graphics cards?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for sounding so stupid but I never thought the GeForce graphics card was the issue.</p>

<h2>            computer shuts off by itself in the middle of work</h2>
                    My computer has all of a sudden decided to shut itself off all by itself. I ran tests on it and all came back saying the system is running 'just fine'. I'm thinking it just got too hot. Does that make sense? It's only a little over 2 years old and it runs
 great, but this shut down is new. Any help &amp; suggestions will be greatly appreciated since I can't afford to kill this laptop &amp; can't figure out what else it could be. It's on a stand too, so it has ventilation.

                    Can I use xbox adaptive controller as a supportive device for normal windows navigation? I basically work in supporting children with disability and would be very grateful if this device could also be used for usual navigational purpose other than gaming.
 I already have one and want to know if its functionality can be extended?

    <title>windows 7 reinstall to different partition than the boot part. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 7 reinstall to different partition than the boot part.</h2>
                    I have a dual boot machine. XP and windows 7. Windows 7 is having problems and will no longer boot. Is there anyway to specify the windows 7 partition to reinstall to without doing clean boot. Every other microsoft OS has this capability except windows
 7. Running the repair option does not work. In other words my XP is on c: and windows 7 is on D:. My machine will only boot to xp now so I can't boot to windows 7 and do anything. There should be a way to do the upgrade option as with other Microsoft OS's
 without doing a clean boot.<br />

<p>It is a dual boot machine and I can get to the desktop albeit only the windows XP desktop. I should be able to be on the XP desktop and insert the windows 7 CD and specify to upgrade my windows 7 install on a different partition but it seems Microsoft no
 longer offers this option. Is that true? if it is which it appears to be why does the Windows 7 install not offer that option like all of the other Microsoft OS's did in the past.</p>

<p>Yes, you can do that, but you will need to ensure the drive where the Windows 7 installation is formatted. You won't be able to do a custom install to drive if installation files are already there if you start setup from within Windows XP.</p>

            <p>Andre, I understand all of that. Again my question is why does Windows 7 not allow me to what all of their other OS's allow. All I want to do is fix my broken unbootable copy of windows 7. I do not want to do a clean install and loose the software I have
 already loaded and had working. I just want to repair my old copy without loosing everything.</p>
<p>So I am guessing no one knows how to do this or it can't be done. So we just have to pray Microsoft fixes this bug.</p>

            <p>I guess I was hoping this would cause Microsoft to have a look at this. It is a major issue for some of us who get tired of the clean boot scenerio. I like to fix my problems and not just keep starting over from scratch.</p>

<h2>            LACK OF STORAGE FOR UPDATES&#47;ACER CLOUDBOOK 11</h2>
                    I have a Acer Aspire One Cloud book 11 and it has no space although I have taken everything I can out of it . I need to update my Synaptics Mouse but update has failed. I keep a 32 GB memory card in it at all times and have it set in storage to download
 all to the card however it will not let me change where apps can be stored . Is there a way that I can set it where&nbsp;any needed storage would automatically go to SD card especially updates.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows</strong> does not allow installation of drivers on external storage. To update your Sypnatics Mouse, we suggest re-installing it's driver. To do so,
<span><span>open<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Device
 Manager</strong></span></span><span><span><strong>,</strong> right-click (or tap and hold)&nbsp;the
<strong>name of the device</strong>, and select<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Uninstall</strong></span></span><span><span>.
 Restart your <strong>PC</strong> and Windows will now install the latest driver of your mouse.</span></span></p>

            I have managed to download my synaptics mouse pad to SD card and install it from there. However that was not the question I am trying to fine a way to add space in C drive 14.3 GB of the 14.5 GB is used I had it down to 13.5 GB used but every time I get
 an update it pushes it closer and eventually will be out of space . I keep dumping files and trying to get C drive to use the SD card that I formatted to NTFS as I was told that it can be used as external hard drive and if left in permanently that it could
 back C drive. Well it will not let the SD have the updates as it putting them on C drive. Any ideas to solve my space problem . It's a lot of work just to keep using this Cloudbook&nbsp; and surely it should not be that way. I mean I have stripped this thing to
 the bare bones I am starting to believe it cannot run Windows 10 it can't handle the updates and the OS used to much of its storage from the start, I had to hide the 1511 update it kept trying to update but not enough space and this com

            This helped me free up more space on this Cloudbook but I have disabled updates to make sure I don't run out of space . I will check manually and try to put what I can on memory card. Just don't know what else I can do at this point . I think Acer should
 be ashamed of this computer and take any Windows 10 installed units off the market.

            I am wondering if there are other files I can copy to SD card and then delete to create more space. For example C: $SysReset file I copied it to SD card but I am afraid to delete it from C drive but it would free up 40 MB of space and OEM file that is
 392 MB can these files be copied to SD and then deleted ?

            <p>Deleting important files might affect the performance of your device. Instead of deleting/copying the files from your drive C to your SD card, we suggest that you move your other files like pictures, videos, and movies to your SD card. You can also move
 some of your downloaded apps. This is to avoid system failures and corrupted files.</p>

<h2>            Quick VPN Compatibility with Windows 7 and Windows 7 VPN Connection configuration. </h2>
                    
<p>Is Cisco Quick VPN compatible with Windows 7 or Not? I have researched several documents that claim their fix works however non of which actually work. I do not understand how Quick VPN installs without problems and connects all the way up to the "Verifying
 Network". Win7 must have some issues with the way it process echo request because non of the online suggestions work. It also can not be a firewall issue because when the firewall is disabled the same issue occurs.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One other question, will the VPN Utility in Windows 7 work with Cisco VPN routers? What are the compatibility requirements or settings to make it work?</p>
<p>Any specific feedback would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Headset Adapter Support &#40;Live Chat&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Headset Adapter Support &#40;Live Chat&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently chatted with Xbox Support Personnel regarding multiple failures with the new official MS Headset adapter. &nbsp;To say that I was surprised by their response would be an understatement. &nbsp;I have retained a copy of this chat I will provide it to anyone
 who wishes to review it with one request, pass it on to others. &nbsp;After providing detailed information of the issues I am having along with detailed troubleshooting steps (this was my second attempt to correct all the problems I and my friends have been having)
 that the only solution was to purchase a Microsoft manufactured headset. &nbsp;This is despite the multiple advertisements indicating the headset adapter will support aftermarket products. &nbsp;Deceptive business practice?</p>

<p>Kim: Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. My name is Kim. How can I help you today?</p>
<p>Steven: I am having significant, on-going issues with the new headset adapter. There should be notes on my account that will detail the troubleshooting efforts I have made with the assistance of support.</p>
<p>Kim: Thank you so much for the info.</p>
<p>Kim: May I please know what happened to your Headset?</p>
<p>Steven: Nothing happened to my headset. The game sound is audible, however the chat sound it at the same lvl as the game sound. Also game sounds bleed over chat sound.
</p>
<p>Steven: I also receive a notification indicating I need to update controller despite the fact the controller has been updated.</p>
<p>Kim: May I please have your MS account email?</p>
<p>Steven: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Kim: Thank you so much for the info.</p>
<p>Kim: Steven just a heads up, in case we are having issue with your headset, we can have it repaired or replaced.</p>
<p>Steven: It is not the MS Headset, is an aftermarket headset and I am using the newly released headset adapter.</p>
<p>Kim: I understand that you have issues with the sound that you hear on your headset, is that correct?</p>
<p>Steven: I can hear game sound.</p>
<p>Steven: When in a party, the game sound bleeds over to the chat. Therefore sound quality is seriously degraded. Also party members sound over chat is equal to, or less than the sound coming from the game.</p>
<p>Kim: Thank you so much for the info. Since that is not the MS headset we cant guarantee its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Steven: Can you gaurantee the effectiveness of the headset adapter?</p>
<p>Steven: I would imagine due to the numerous reported problems that it could easily be inferred that the problem not be with the old equipment but rather with a piece of equipment that obviously flawed.</p>
<p>Steven: Also prior to the release the only headsets that were advertised as non-functional with the headset adapter was those that had 2mm connector</p>
<p>Kim: Here is the thing, if you think that the problem is with the headset, my suggestion is to take it back to the store where you purchased it and have it replaced.</p>
<p>Steven: It is not the headset that is the problem. It is my headset adapter as well as the headset adapter my friend has. He has had the exact same problem with the adapter.</p>
<p>Steven: I would hope that with all the sales problems that the XB1 has had vs. the PS4 that MS would make every effort to correct errors they created to ensure the continued loyalty of their customer base. As of yet you have not provided me with a useful
 piece of troubleshooting information. Is there another patch coming up? Is there some additional troubleshooting ideas I can try? Why did my controller not register as being connected despite the fact I followed the update instructions to the letter? Why does
 my controller still ask me to update it, but when I attempt to do so the update screen indicates that it already has been updated? Why does my controller disconnect when the adapter is plugged in and the only way I can get it to reconnect is to remove/replace
 the batteries?</p>
<p>Steven: Not to mention the terrible disconnections or game freezes I get while playing Battlefield 4. But that is a whole other failure that I could save for another chat session.</p>
<p>Kim: I am sorry for the inconvenience that you had to go thru.</p>
<p>Steven: I understand this is new technology and I am willing to be patient with it, but at some point there is simply too much ineptitude to deal with. Not to mention the slap in the face to Day One purchasers that Forza 5 is now free.</p>
<p>Steven: While I appreciate the apology the inconvenience is not something I "had" to go through it is something I and other XB1 purchasers are "GOING" through.</p>
<p>Kim: As for the headset, i recommend having the MS headset so as to ensure a perfect performance.</p>
<p>Steven: . . . so what you are saying is purchase another wireless headset that is of MS manufacturing?</p>
<p>Kim: I understand that this will cost you but that is the only way we can ensure that you wont be having the same issues.</p>
<p>Steven: I think you need to refer this chat to a customer service supervisor. I for one will be maintaining a record of this chat to show the poor customer service actions. So, I purchased an official MS Headset adapter and now I need to spend more money
 to get functionality that was promised from the headset literature? Talk about deceptive business practices.</p>
<p>info: Your chat transcript will be sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** at the end of your chat.</p>
<p>Kim: I can provide you the contact number for you to call.</p>
<p>Kim: This is the contact number 800 4699269. PLease call us for the best resolution to your concern.</p>
<p>Steven: I also need you to connect this chat to your supervisor as well as your name and employee identification number
</p>
<p>Kim: I am sorry but we are not allowed to disclose our ID numbers. You can reach our supervisors at the number &nbsp;I provided you.</p>
<p>Kim: I have not heard from you for a while. &nbsp;Do you still need assistance? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steven: So to be clear you have no additional support to provide other than to tell to purchase an MS Headset</p>
<p>Kim: Steven ac you mentioned, nothing happened to your headset and that you can also try to adjust the volume of the headset.</p>
<p>Steven: I think you need to review the lengthy posts I have made here today as well as the lengthy troubleshooting attempts that are detailed in the notes of my account.</p>
<p>Kim: Steven, I understand that you have done the trouble shooting steps and I do appreciate it.</p>
<p>Kim: I have not heard from you for a while. &nbsp;Do you still need assistance? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim: I have not heard from you for a while. &nbsp;Do you still need assistance? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steven: Ok at this point I have spent more time than I have available to spend on this. I will re-contact your company and make a 3rd attempt at a later date.</p>
<p>Kim: I totally understand you on this.</p>
<p>Kim: Is there anything else I can assist you with aside from this?</p>
<p>Steven: Nope</p>
<p>Kim: IF that was everything, I would like to thank you for contacting Xbox customer support. Have a wonderful rest of your day!</p>

<p>Unfortunately this isn't really that uncommon. Customer support chats aren't always prepared to troubleshoot every possible problem that comes up. In this case the Rep you spoke with seemed to have little to no knowledge about the headset adapter. As recommending
 you buy a MS headset for an adapter made to use other headsets is just beyond silly.</p>
<p>All that aside though. As I understand your problem as you described it. You were having trouble distinguishing chat sound, and game sound. This is to be expected when you have those sounds combined in the same channel. This is something that's been around
 for a long time in PC gaming. The only way around it, is to turn down game sound to a level, where you can hear chat sound. Or you can have the game sound played through a different source, such as your TV. This issue is actually a primary reason you have
 separate controls on the adapter to adjust game audio volume, and chat audio volume.</p>
<p>There really isn't a way around fixing this other than the suggestions above, turn game volume down and chat volume up, or play game audio through a separate source. Sometimes it sucks since you can miss audible queues from the game, but that's something
 you have to accept when combining game and chat sound into one source.</p>
<p>Also, I recommend removing your email address from your post.</p>

<p>To supplement what Vegito said, to turn up the chat volume and turn down the game volume tap on the microphone icon on the headset adapter. To turn the game volume back up press the controller icon on the adapter. It defaults to a 50/50 split. It will beep
 at you if you get to 100% of either game or chat audio so that you know you will only be hearing either the game or chat and not the other.</p>

<p>So what about the in-line controller that is attached via the Turtle Beach (TB) x41 cord? &nbsp;Should you only use the controls on the adapter and disregard the controls on the wireless headset itself and the inline headset connector cord?</p>

<p>I found I was having problems with the audio there was a sort of echo/reverb on the game audio. I found out if I turned the volume on the turtle beach headset 100% down and then just used the audio controls on the stereo adapter it fixed the issue.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be I was getting game audio from the TV into the head phones which was going via the volume control on the TB headset wire, and previously on the 360 just the chat was coming from the pad. With the new adapter on the Xbox One it pulls
 the game audio and the chat audio via the pad, and I was also getting the game audio from the TV with a slight delay causing the distorted sound.</p>
<p>Basically turn the game volume on the wire control thing on the TB headset fully down and it sorts the distorted game audio.</p>
<p>The way the chat adapter volumes work is the 2 buttons on the left control the balance between game and chat audio, the middle is mute and the two on the right are master volume. This can be confusing as the two on the right used to be chat volume on the
 adapter that came with the original Xbox One headset/mic thing.</p>
<p>Hope that helps in some way.</p>

<p>On any headset that has its own volume controller, you should set that controller to max volume. Then use the adapters controls to set your chat, and game audio volume to more suitable levels.</p>
<p>Adjusting both controls can lead to odd audio problems as StainableDog describes.</p>

<p>In fact the other option is to use the volume control on the wire then hold down the bottom left volume control until it beeps (thats the one with the player and the + sign) that will turn the balance from the pad so its 100% chat audio and no game audio,
 then use the volume control on the TB wire to control game audio.</p>
<p>Not sure which will give better audio quality for in game audio or if theres any diff.</p>

<h2>            Official Xbox Magazine Review</h2>
                    
<p>WORDS BY: Francesca Reyes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can approach this axe-wielding, boogeyman-dodging thriller in two ways: as a literate, sophisticated mystery told in the form of a videogame, or as a frantic, pulse-pounding actioner about rationing ammo and light sources. The two paths sometimes cross
 with great effect, but in a game that’s all about balance — light and dark, choice and fate, literal and figurative — for one of them to succeed, the other has to stumble a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fuser-17834%2fAlanWake_01_nightsprings_720p.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, meet Alan Wake. A wildly successful fiction writer with a penchant for dipping into darker territory like crime novels, Alan’s also madly in love with his wife, Alice — even if he’s sometimes too big of a crank to show it with any consistency. With
 Alan facing a bout of writer’s block, the couple toodle off to the scenic smalltown-ville of Bright Falls to take a break; and maybe in the meantime, the author can get his money-making, novel-penning mojo back as well. Bonus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://oxmonline.com/files/user-17834/AlanWake_03_stage_720p.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fuser-17834%2fAlanWake_03_stage_720p.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, their best-laid plans go crazy-wrong. Alice vanishes under what can only be described as very mysterious circumstances, and Alan blacks out, only to wake up in a wrecked car several days later. What happened? Where’s Alice? And why the hell are
 black-cloaked lumberjacks trying to decapitate you in Bright Falls’ forest at night? Oh, and could someone please explain why pages of a manuscript you don’t remember writing are scattered across town…and even worse, why the events covered therein are coming
 true?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it all seems strangely familiar, we can see why. Pop-culture-y, psycho-thriller flicks like Flatliners and Jacob’s Ladder have explored plot-twisty, “Is it all a dream?” terrain like this before, so it’s to developer Remedy’s credit that their immensely
 talented writers do the exact opposite of phoning it in. Alan Wake goes deep into surprisingly literary territory, pulling from a dizzying grab bag of influences: David Lynch’s cinematic dream-logic, Mark Z. Danielewski’s meta-meta House of Leaves, the brain-teasing
 TV series Twilight Zone, and even…wait for it…a little Faust? Wake lovingly wears its references on its sleeve, but it ends up delivering a slam-bang stunner of a tale that’s compelling yet deliciously original. It’s also a clever and exacting mystery that’s
 as much about the craft of writing as it is about…well, whatever you want to read into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fuser-17834%2fAlanWake_04_page_720p.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Alan Wake’s dreamworld, there are no red herrings. Nothing’s left to chance — only interpretation. From every poster in town to the very specific licensed songs that cap each in-game “episode” to the choice of words in Alan’s voice-over narrations, Remedy
 leaves you very deliberate, very purposeful clues for unraveling the question at the heart of Alan’s dark, sometimes comical (yes, it’s really funny in parts!) fairy tale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fuser-17834%2fAlanWake_02_chest_720p.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But games aren’t books or movies. They’re not static; they’re packed full of movement, interaction, and player involvement. And Alan Wake delivers a heavy helping of breathless, sweaty-palmed thrills that leave you fumbling to reload flare guns and flashlight
 batteries between mad dashes from faulty light source to light source. Using light to banish darkness-tainted enemies, called Taken, works two ways: Daylight and any area bathed in light keep them at bay, and so does your trusty flashlight, whose blazing beam
 you’ll need to focus on Taken to “burn” the darkness off of them. Until you do this, they’re invulnerable. The same applies to pretty much any of the inanimate objects that become possessed by darkness (Wake calls it the Dark Presence): you’ll have to hold
 back lunging barrels and airborne cars with only a flashlight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The constant, white-knuckle juggling act between weakening some enemies and finishing others off makes for moments of pure panic. The minute you hear menacing whispers circling around you in the shadows of Bright Falls’ forest or some abandoned farmhouse,
 it’s smart to start eyeing your ammo and battery stash. You need both to survive, and you can’t always count on those islands of light coming from some random streetlamp or dilapidated shack to stay illuminated. You can duck and dodge the Taken all you like
 — in nifty slow-motion if you time it right — but they attack in droves, so where there’s one, more are probably lurking just outside the periphery of your limited vision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fuser-17834%2fAlanWake_05_alice_720p.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one area, you’re sent scrambling to follow a floodlight from a police helicopter along a darkened path. Trying to keep up with the light while fending off Taken? Hairy. It’s during these moments that Alan Wake’s light/dark gimmick really hums. But it’s
 a feat that waxes and wanes over the course of the game. The house-of-horrors atmosphere remains effective from start to finish, but the variety of these thrills plateaus after a while. Your nemeses never really change much apart from size, speed, and number
 — a fact that isn’t helped by how linear the game plays out. If you sometimes feel like you’re thrashing through Taken just to connect the dots between plot points, you aren’t alone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, how much you enjoy Alan Wake’s rollercoaster ride depends on how invested you become in its sophisticated yarn. And it’s one hell of a story, capped off by a quiet, breathtaking denouement that makes good on the opening lines of Alan’s initial
 descent. Everything in between is just a trail of breadcrumbs leading you back to what you slowly realize you already knew. Accomplishing this narrative sleight of hand is rare in videogames, and Remedy’s success at it is a testament to what imaginative storytellers
 can do with the medium.</p>

<p>I would just like to add that I just started playing this game yesterday and I finished Episode 1. I absolutely love it so far!! Eerie atmosphere, strong narrative, haunting music, great voice acting…it also doesn’t hurt that the game looks absolutely stunning!</p>

    <title>Surface RT Microphone defect&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> netboi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT Microphone defect&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got a Surface for Christmas and before I consider this defective I would like some input.&nbsp; When I record a video on the Surface cam there is a really over powering background noise that sounds like static or cricket noises. If I lower the recording volume
 to 42 it's not bad bit noticeable but I can't hear my voice.&nbsp; When I push it to 72 it's really annoying. Not sure if this is hardware or software issue.&nbsp; I hope there is a fix because everything works fine and the last thing I need is a replacement.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attached a link to the video. Let me know if there is a solution would greatly appreciate it.

            <p>Yes I have done all that, and I did replace it with the new one, and it is slightly better. But If I put the recording to 100 percent you can really here the static background. I think what it lacks is the option to have noise suppression to clean the background
 static. I think that is one thing that is lacking on the drivers and/or the camera software.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had different cams and also laptop cams. All of them have the noise suppression option. It's a bit annoying not for me but for users on Skype that hear it, and keep telling me to fix my microphone. But overall I love my Surface RT. The microphone,
 and the cam not so much. I hope there will be 3rd party cameras that will work on surface and also having flash to allow&nbsp; the use of mic/cam.&nbsp; If there was more support this tablet would have dominated. I guess I just have to wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
