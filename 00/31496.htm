<h2>            Skype connection issue - call cuts out and so does my internet</h2>
                    <p>I have a weird problem. This has been going on for a few months now. I am located in Canada and I have a mac (yosemite) and my family is located in Turkey and they all have different windows devices (2 windows 7's and one windows 10). When I talk with any
 of them (mother, father and brother) the call cuts out either in a few seconds of talking or 2-3 minutes of talking and then my internet cuts out as well so I have to plug out and plug in the cord to get internet again. Also when the call cuts out, I am completly
 cut on my families end but I can still see them and hear them live for like 10 more seconds and see/hear them complaining that I got cut out again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been EXTREMELY frustrating and because of this we've only been using Skype to talk for a few seconds to let each other know that we'll go to this other link with a website named appear.in but now on that platform there my whole familie's mics started
 not working so now I want to go back to Skype again but it just doesn't let me talk with my family and I don't know what to do. I've tried using the updated version of skype and the older versions, the same story. I made my family update their skype, the same
 story. I have no clue what's going on and here I am searching online for a better alternative and it's hard to find free convinient alternatives like skype and appear.in that my non-tech savvy parents can use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a cry for help and I feel like this problem won't be solved and I will never be able to use Skype again to talk with my family which is just sad...</p>

    <title>Stop Code&#58; System Service Exception - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stop Code&#58; System Service Exception</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
A few weeks ago, my computer was having blue screen messages saying system service exception. I am not sure what to do about it.<br />
It mostly happens when I start up my computer, but then it continues to run like normal after it loads. Also, sometimes if I am playing a game on my computer, it would freeze, and I would need to restart the game launcher in order to get back in.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am unsure of the problem and I also keep getting a blue screen saying Stop Code: System Service Exception.&nbsp;<br />
I have Windows Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.523).<br />
And my drivers update automatically with windows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help,<br />
Anika<br />

            Hi Anika_P
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused. 
<br />
<br />Blue screens are often caused by driver issues. 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>

            Hi Anika, please check to see if your system had created any minidump files:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Anika, sorry that is just a shortcut to the minidump file . . .
<br />
<br />In the minidump folder, right click the file and choose 'Copy, then on your Desktop, right click and choose 'Paste', you should then be able to upload that file form your Desktop  . ..

            Hi Anika
<br />
<br />The minidump files all point to your video card device driver as the cause fo your crashes . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I went to my NVIDIA GeForce GTX 550 Ti under the Display Adapters Section. I was unable to "Roll back Driver." I clicked update instead. It updated and installed. Should I still roll back driver and restart my PC or should I just restart the PC without rolling
 back the driver? Please let me know.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 No Network Found on Start Up</h2>
                    Upon start up of PC, there is no connection to the internet or network. I have to go into Device Manager and disable and then enable the Atheros AR8121 PCI-E Ethernet controller. Once that is done, I am then re- connected to the network and internet. I
 have the newest Atheros drivers and all Win 7 updates. I have a Linksys WRT54GX2 Router. The odd thing is the other PC's with wireless connected to the router do not lose&nbsp; connection to the network or internet. My ISP is Bellsouth. Could the network adapter
 be bad ??? Please help.<br />
Thanks

<p><span><span>Hi,<br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
Did you make any recent changes?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to check if any options under power management for the network drivers are selected, if yes, then
 I suggest you to deselect.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>1. Click on start, type Device Manager in the search box.<br />
2. Click on network Adapter, It will show your Network Adapter right click on it.<br />
3. Click on properties, go to Power Management and uncheck the options, hit ok and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to run Network Troubleshooter and check if it helps, here is the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to boot the computer in the Safe Mode with Networling and cheeck if the same problem occurs, here
 are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see drivers loading, and then Please wait.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should then be at the Welcome Screen.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that does not help try uninstalling and re installing the network drivers and check if that helps</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps for uninstalling and then re install the drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type Device Manager in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Continue. The Device Manager dialog box is displayed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list of device types, click the kind of device, and then locate the specific device that is not functioning.
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the device, and then click Properties. <br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Driver tab. <br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Uninstall. <br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK. <br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Device Manager dialog box, click the Action menu, and then click Scan for hardware changes.
<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may receive a message that states that Windows has to install driver software for your unknown device. If you receive this message, click Locate and install driver software (recommended).
<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also receive a message that states that a hardware device is being installed and that the uninstalled device is now present in Device Manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I also suggest you to refer thius link for similar issues.</span></span></p>

<h2>            No more &#34;Found New Hardware&#34; dialog for newly added device in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I am just curious if there is a hidden setting somewhere for this.&nbsp; I added my joystick to Windows 7 RC and expected to see the dialog "Found New Hardware" to install the device driver for this device but I don't see it.&nbsp; I only get the notification at bottom
 right corner saying "Device driver software was not successfully install".&nbsp; Off course I get the yellow bang on my joystick in the device manager.&nbsp; I can install the driver only if I click "Update Driver" in the properties in the device manager.&nbsp; Is this an
 expected behavior?

            Nope.
<br />Controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro version, Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.

                    I recently noticed the community tab wasn't updating. Many of posts that were on there are gone, none of my achievements or clips are showing up. I do have it set to auto upload. Has anyone else noticed this or has anyone had this issue in the past?&nbsp;

<p>Hello Obbur San,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums.&nbsp;We&nbsp;understand that the community&nbsp;tab&nbsp;is not displaying your achievements, clips or messages.&nbsp; We suggest
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycling the console </a>by holding down the power button on the console for ten seconds. If this solution does not resolve the issue, we recommend
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
removing the account from the console and downloading it back</a>. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>

            Thanks for the reply, i have tried these methods multiple times with no success. &nbsp;Its updating with the posts from games i follow, just not clips, achievements, or screenshots that i or others have posted. 90% of the ones that were there before are also
 now gone. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us about this peculiar&nbsp;issue you're dealing with. </p>
<p>This kind of thing could be due to your connection to the internet. </p>
<p>What do you get if you test the network or multiplayer settings?</p>
<p>Have you by any chance tried resetting your router/network hardware device while you power cycled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, try those things out and let us know. I'm confident that provided enough info we can get to the bottom of this.

<p>Hey there Obbur San, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response, In this case being that the troubleshooting provided has not helped, and the network settings seem fine then we can definitely try and Factory Reset the console. Go ahead and click on the following link and follow the steps to
 Factory Reset Keeping Games &amp; Apps, </p>

<li><a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to reset your console to factory defaults on Xbox One</a></li></ul>
<p>Make sure that you have your account information (email &amp; password) as you will need to add your account back on the Xbox One. All your games and applications will remain on the Hard Drive
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give this a try and let us know if it has helped. </p>

<p>Hello Obbur San,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering that the home screen and other tabs rely mainly on the network, it is interesting that the network is reading perfectly fine while experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to use a previously provided troubleshooting step, we recommend a <strong>
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">power cycle</a></strong> precisely like this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hold the power button on the front of the console for approximately 10 seconds</li><li>Once the console is completely off, unplug the power cord and leave the console off and unplugged for 2 minutes</li><li>Once the 2 minutes are up, use only the power button on the front of the console to turn the console on</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try this for us and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>Can you try going through your old captures and try deleting some posts?&nbsp; You can save backup copies to OneDrive if you would like to keep them in perpetuity, but I am curious if it's not updating because of your profiles cloud storage limitations? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding, and I could be wrong, is that the amount of cloud storage you have with your profile is in correlation to the number of games you own on the platform, and that storage is across clips, screenshots, saves, etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend try to clean up the historical items and see if that helps resolve your feed issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck!</p>

            Thanks for the suggestion, i deleted around 130 game clips, the problem persists. A few posts from games i follow show up. I can also manually share an achievement and it will show up on my console feed. Things are fine on the app it will show the achievement
 when i unlock it and the manual upload as well as my friends posts. &nbsp;Seems to me like it could be a bug. &nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 dead after modifying partitions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesusfreak1380  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 dead after modifying partitions</h2>
                    <p>(NOTE: This is a long question post, but that is only because I am supplying each and every detail that might have something to do with the problem. I would really appreciate it if you read this and try to help. In general, my computer wont boot up after
 modifying its partitions.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So recently I have been interested in Kali Linux. I own two clones of the same computer, a modified HP Compaq 8510p, and I use one for school and work and one for gaming. Each has 250GB storage, 4GB RAM, Intel Centrino (Duo on the work computer) processor,
 and Windows 10 (Enterprise on the work computer and I think Pro on the gaming). So one day, I looked up how to modify the partitions of the hard drive of my Gaming computer so that I could make one for Kali Linux, because booting from a DVD is SO SLOW. I came
 across MiniTool Partition Wizard while searching on some trustworthy sites. I downloaded that program and created a partition of 30GB for Kali Linux. MiniTool said that too many background processes were going on within the hard drive, so I would have to reboot
 to complete the process. I was hesitant at first, but it rebooted into a terminal that partitioned the drive exactly how I had asked. I rebooted the computer to be safe, and it booted up successfully. Kali Linux installed from the DVD successfully, and it
 seemed to have installed the Grub bootloader, so I could choose which operating system to boot up from at startup. Well, one day, Grub failed. I used an Ubuntu 17.10 Live CD to fix it, using the terminal and some commands (The website that I found the commands
 on I have lost) to help troubleshoot problems. It apparently removed the bootloader, so I went on with my life, thinking this was a sign that Kali Linux wasn't for me. (I rebooted here; successful boot. I tend to reboot after making changes to my computer
 to be safe.) Some time later, I discovered Windows ReadyBoost on an old computer. I thought that maybe I could use the 30GB partition for Windows ReadyBoost (since this is my Gaming computer) to make the applications run faster. I looked on the Computer section
 of the File Explorer, but it was not there! The command "Diskpart" was no help, because it only saw the drive. Not the partitions. (Actually it does, if you Select Disk and List Partition or something, but I did not know this at the time.) I ended up using
 MiniTool to partition again, and it listed the partition letter as ".", as was the same with two other partitions named System and System Reserved. I set the partition as active, and assigned a drive letter. MiniTool popped up with a warning, saying that "This
 partition has System Files on it - Modifying this partition could render your computer unbootable! Would you like to proceed?" I clicked yes (My big mistake, most likely) thinking that these "System Files" were just remnants of the Kali Linux. What I failed
 to consciously notice was that only 300MB of space was being used of the drive, when Kali takes at least 8. My guess is that the Grub troubleshooter wiped Kali and Grub and used the partition as System Reserved or something. MiniTool ended up running THREE
 tasks: Mark partition as inactive, Mark partition as active, and Assign drive letter E:. After MiniTool finished, the partition was still not showing up on the Computer. I assigned Drive letter F:, and when it still didn't show up, I rebooted. That was the
 last time I ever saw the Start Menu on that computer. It rebooted, made it past the Low-Definition HP logo with the "F9 to select boot device, F10 to enter Setup, F12 to start online boot helper somethingorother", then had the normal "Starting Intel Boot Agent"
 text screen, then where the blue Windows 10 logo and the Loading GIF should be, there is a black screen with a blinking "_" in the top left corner of the screen. This is how it has been ever since. I have retrieved all of my World Saves via the Ubuntu 17.10
 File Explorer, so I have everything that I will need from that computer. I can wipe it and reinstall. The System Restore Disc that I have made from my Work computer wont work, probably because it was made on an Enterprise computer and the Gaming computer is
 a Pro one. Whenever I have clicked the "Restore from Restore Point" it says that I need to reboot and select an Operating System, but doesn't give me an option to do so when I reboot. I have not made a backup of that computer because I don't have the money
 to buy an external drive of 500 GB or more for two 250GB computers. I am attempting to use the Windows 10 USB tool from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;to restore the computer, but it takes so long and has failed twice because I forgot to run as Administrator. I can't restore to factory state - It has a Windows Vista sticker on the bottom. I need to either figure out a way to reinstall Windows 10
 or recover the product key from the dead computer and then use a different option to reinstall Windows 10. Can someone help?&nbsp;</p>

            UPDATE: I have used DiskPart on the Terminal on my Windows 10 Recovery Disc. The volume that is supposed to be named C: is named D:, and C: is the System Reserved volume. Only one volume has any info (boot, hidden, etc.) and that is an unnamed volume without
 a drive letter. It has 500MB of space and has the "hidden" attribute. I am unable to edit the drive letters with the Recovery Disc (via the DiskPart command) for some reason - it will not save the edits.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovering your Windows 10 is possible with the use of product key or a recovery disc. Since your system came from Windows Vista, you also need to consider the system requirements of Windows 10. You can check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028142/windows-windows-10-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for detailed specifications of Windows 10 system requirements. Also, aside from using ISO files in
 recovering that did not work to restore the system, and factory reset did not do the trick as well, even the product key and recovery disc are missing, then you might have to consider buying a new unit again to match Windows 10 specifications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need anything else. We're here to help. </p>

<p>My computer exceeds all of those expectations. My computer was (apparently) one of the best Vista computers there were. Would recovering with
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this tool</a> require a product key if the computer already has an online-activated version of Windows 10 on it? From what I found from a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000735/windows-10-reinstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
different article</a> it seems like it will take the key from the previous version of Windows 10 for the reinstallation.&nbsp;</p>

            Sorry for the delayed response. If you have an online-activated version of Windows 10 and you have the copy of the product key, then you can go ahead and continue using the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a> to reinstall Windows. However, if it wont accept the product key and you were still unable to reinstall Windows 10, you might have to consider buying a new device.<br />

            Windows was activated, but I don't have a product key. The computer was given to me by a friend before he moved, and it was already activated. From what I know, Windows 10 does not give you an option to view your Product Key just like that, and unless
 there is a file on the computer that contains the Key, I might not be able to get it. Also, the partitions are completely screwed, and it wont recognize it as a re-installation. I know because I started to reinstall with the Media Creation tool, and I selected
 "Keep all folders and files", and it said "This operating system is not supported. Would you like to continue?" and something about how my computer "doesn't have windows installed". I can access the folders and files via Ubuntu Live CD, because Linux doesn't
 care that you need a password to access the computer. I also don't have the money to buy a new computer.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for the update. This error occurs since you don't have the product key of Windows. Since it was given by your friend, you might consider contacting him and ask for the product key so you can reinstall Windows. If it was activated online, then the
 product key should be tied to his email address that he used when he activated Windows. Once you have it, try reinstalling Windows again and see if the same error will occur.</p>

<p>So I just got my xbox 360 about a few months ago and xbox live account about a month and a half ago. I've been trying to add friends to play with but its just gettin' awkward. Anyways I have been playing Assassin's Creed Multiplayer ( I love the AC series).
 If you want to become friends and play I'm so up for it. I love meeting new players and people.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Igor L. Kravchenko,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers</span></p>
<p><span>Check if your system is tpm compatible, if yes</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Follow this link to turn on the tpm</span></strong><span>:</span><span>
</span><strong><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749022(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749022(WS.10).aspx</span></a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>To turn on BitLocker Drive Encryption on an operating system drive
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1:Click Start, click Control Panel, click System and Security, and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.</span></p>
<p><span>2:Click Turn On BitLocker for the operating system drive. BitLocker will scan your computer to make sure that it meets the BitLocker system requirements.
 If your computer meets the requirements, BitLocker will inform you of the next steps that need to be taken to turn on BitLocker, such as drive preparation, turning on the TPM, and encrypting the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>3:</span><span>
</span><span>After the TPM is initialized, the BitLocker setup wizard prompts you to choose how to store the recovery key. You can choose from the following options:</span></p>
<p><span>Save the recovery key to a USB flash drive. Saves the recovery key to a USB flash drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Save the recovery key to a file. Saves the recovery key to a network drive or other location.</span></p>
<p><span>Print the recovery key. Prints the recovery key.</span></p>
<p><span>4:</span><span>
</span><span>The BitLocker setup wizard asks if you are ready to encrypt the drive. Confirm that the Run BitLocker system check check box is selected, and then click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>5:</span><span>
</span><span>Confirm that you want to restart the computer by clicking Restart now. The computer restarts, and BitLocker checks if the computer meets BitLocker requirements and is
 ready for encryption. If it is not, you will see an error message alerting you to the problem after you have logged on.</span></p>
<p><span>6:</span><span>
</span><span>If it is ready for encryption, the Encrypting status bar is displayed, which shows the progress of the drive encryption. You can monitor the ongoing completion status
 of the disk drive encryption by moving the mouse pointer over the BitLocker Drive Encryption icon in the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar. Encrypting the drive will take some time. You can use your computer during encryption, but performance
 might be slower. A completion message is displayed when encryption is finished.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            How can we stop the nightmare of unallowed auto-restarts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
Almost once a week Windows 10 wants to perform a restart against our will (after updates).</p>
<p>
If you are "lucky", you get the options to restart "now" or in a number of minutes. There is no way to cancel that or to postpone it according to your own needs. You have to suspend anything you were working on.</p>
<p>
If you aren't lucky (such as leaving the computer for a while), the restart will take you by surprise and you lose all your hard work.</p>
<p>
Is there a way to stop these stupid auto-restarts?</p>

            No. Not all the problems are solved, because the system only provides you a limited interval of time in which you should restart. Surely, 5 days should be reasonable, but why don't they give us the simple indefinite option of
<em>"Restart Later"</em>??

<h2>            Start Menu &#47; Taskbar unresponsive after 20 seconds - Anniversary update</h2>
                    <p>I've updated to the new 'anniversary' update twice, once using windows update, the second time from an ISO DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time the system boots up after the update, it works flawlessly. &nbsp;The next time you boot it up, the start menu and task bar will work for about 20 seconds, and lock up. &nbsp;You cannot run task manager, click the start menu, use any icons, keyboard
 shortcuts....NOTHING. &nbsp;You cannot even shut down the computer properly....it has to be powered off manually holding the power switch. &nbsp;A box comes up saying the application has become unresponsive with a 'Cancel, or End Task' Button, neither of which works
 when you click on it with a spinning circle that never goes away...eventually the screen goes 'grey'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system was working perfectly before the update was installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The taskbar and start menu work correctly when in safe mode, which is where I am now typing this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please....I use this system for video and audio at live events and cannot have windows updating and breaking the system on me in the middle of show (happened last year after windows decided to update all by itself the night before a major event and
 broke all my ASIO audio drivers)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to restore back (again) to the previous build and defer updates, but I don't know how long I have until this thing updates all by itself again. &nbsp;At the date this update came out, it's looking like it's going to force itself into my system the
 evening of my next major event. &nbsp;I CANNOT have it doing this! &nbsp; Aside from not plugging the computer into the Internet, something not possible as it's set up for live streaming, I don't know how I can prevent this update from going in until December when I
 have more time to look into it further.</p>

<h2>            keyboard and mouse not working no mouse point on screen</h2>
                    okay it started yesterday, i uninstalled windows dvd tool and then restarted my pc. once windows 8 started my mouse and keyboard did not work. i have tried lots of different ports and unplugged them and tried a wired mouse and still no luck i know my wireless
 keyboard and mouse work as they work in the bois menu and my mac os&nbsp; and my asus splash os.<br />
when i connect my wacom pen pad that at times works but i have no pointer on the screen so when i am navigating the os is a little bit of guessing.
<br />
i cant go in to safe mode as the keyboard dont work what so ever unless the safe mode has changed from f8 to something else in windows 8.<br />
<br />
when i look at the device manager it shows there's and error on the mouse and keyboard.
<br />
<br />
i tried to do a system restore and this came up<br />
<br />
system restore failed to replace the file (C:`dvmexp`VAECONF`vaeconf.ini) with its oringinal copy from the restore point.<br />
an unspedified error occurred during system restore (0x80070002)<br />
<br />
if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you have issues with Keyboard and mouse on Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply to the question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>How did you navigate to Device Manager since the mouse and keyboard are not working?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>How you were able to attempt System Restore since the mouse and keyboard are not working?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: </b>Update drivers for the mouse and keyboard from the manufacturer’s website using the
<span>Wacom pen pad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: </b><span>I would suggest you to refresh Windows 8 and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press “Windows Key + w”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “Refresh” in the search box and hit “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select “Get started” option under “Refresh your PC without affecting your files” section.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important: </span></b><span>Refreshing Windows 8 will remove all third party applications installed and it will reset all the Microsoft applications to default.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:<span>&nbsp; </span></b><span>I would suggest you to perform a Startup Repair from Windows Recovery Environment and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned below to perform Startup Repair:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select “Troubleshooting” from the first Window and then select “Advanced Options”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Then select “Automatic Repair” from “Advanced options” window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps. Reply to assist you further. We are happy to help you.</p>

            okay i managed to get to the keyboard and mouse properties and under the hardware tab.<br />
under device status it says:<br />
<br />
windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (code19)
<br />
<br />
so what does this mean?<br />
<br />
if i was just to replace the registry would that solve the problem.<br />
<br />
please help me sort this out as soon as<br />

<p><b>Hi,</b></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting your query in the <b>Microsoft Community Forums</b>. </span>
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Error code 19 can occur when more than one service is defined for a device, if there is a failure opening the service subkey, or if the driver name cannot be obtained from the service subkey.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue can be fixed by un-installing and re-installing the drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following methods:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Drag the mouse to bottom left corner and right-click on the “Start icon”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select “Device manager”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand “keyboards”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click on the keyboard driver and click on “Uninstall’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat the same for the mouse by expanding mouse and other pointing devices.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Screen resizes when monitor unplug or turn off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gotabug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen resizes when monitor unplug or turn off</h2>
                    <p>Similar to posts about Vista or 7 I have a monitor issue on Windows 8.1 on an Intel NUC 54250 with Intel HD5000 graphics and an LG IPS277 monitor. Whenever I turn off the monitor during operation or once the monitor goes to standby, one of the following
 two scenarios happens each time after wake-up:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A) the main screen (I have only one anyway) shifts all windows to the upper left corner and re-sizes them to 1024 x 768. The mouse pointer is then located in the middle of the screen regardless where it was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) rarely the monitor is set to be #2 and some virtual non existent monitor takes the focus and more importantly the start menu and all the windows move to that invisible screen! Scenario B) is bad. &nbsp;As a temporary workaround I figured out it helps sometimes
 to unplug from HDMI port one of the monitor and plug into port two. Then I have my start menu back and all the windows. Still this is pretty annoying and kills the connector over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here the debug steps I took and the results they yielded. I checked device manager with show hidden devices 'on'. Then I can see that there is my PNP monitor (IPS277) and also some other monitor with 1024 x 768 non-PNP but not active. I delete all inactive
 monitors in device manager. Then unplug and re-plug the active main HDMI monitor. TADA - the inactive non-PNP monitor is back in device manager. (BTW installing the LG monitor driver doesn't help ...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads to the conclusion that when I unplug or turn off my monitor then the system installs a non-PNP monitor driver and moves all stuff to this invisible monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My big question is now: is it normal and intended that my system "invents" a non existent monitor as soon as I unplug or turn off my main monitor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would assume that the best one to answer here is Microsoft but if someone else has an answer and/or a solution I'd happily accept that as well ...</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the graphics driver as proposed and selected the option to delete all driver files. After reboot my PC came up in VGA resolution which changed to the native monitor resolution (HD) after about 20 seconds once Windows 8.1 installed its own drivers.
 For now it seems that szenario A) is solved. Size and position of the windows don't change anymore when turning off the monitor. Even unplugging causes no change. Also the mysterious PnP or non PnP monitors don't appear in device manager any longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For scenario B) I can't tell yet as it happened anyway very infrequent. I'll know in a couple of days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must admitt that I wanted to have everything clean so I also deleted ALL keys and subkeys under following two registy keys:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Configuration</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Connectivity</p>
<p>
</p><p>This eliminated all interinm monitor configurations. After reboot Windows re-created exactly and only the keys corresponding with my current monitor configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working driver version is:</p>
<p>Driver: Intel(R) HD Graphics 5000</p>
<p>Driver date:&nbsp;29.09.2014</p>
<p>Driver version: 10.18.10.3960</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I once installed my NUC I also installed the very latest graphics drivers from Intel released on Jan-9, 2015. Maybe they caused the issue popping up. The probably older driver from Intel via Microsoft above seems to be OK so I'll stay with that for
 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for help<br />
</p>

                    Hey!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've built my computer myself and I bought windows 8 OEM version from amazon. I recently booted my computer and it gives me the blue screen of death with the error code 0xc000021a. Then it tries to automatically repair it but fails. I can't get into safe
 mode and I have no idea what to do now.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

            Hey again!
<div><br />
<div>Here is what the computer does when I turn it on without touching anything else:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>How did you perform system refresh, sytem restore and sfc/scan when you are unable to boot to the desktop?</b></div>
<div>- Ok, when I turn on my computer it automatically goes to the windows icon with the black background, then the blue screen with the sadface appears. Then it gives me the error 0xc000021a with some info.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After that it restarts the computer, and goes back to the windows logo with the black background. And then it says
<i>preparing automatic repair</i>. Then it says <i>diagnosing your PC,</i> still in the black background. Then the blue background comes back but it says:</div>
<div>Automatic repair couldn't repair your PC...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then it gives me two options:</div>
<div><i>Shut down</i> or <i>Advanced options</i></div>
<div><br />
<div>If I go to advanced options the familiar troubleshoot screen comes up. Same screen as if I were to press F8 or use the installation media and click on "Repair your computer".From there I can access system refresh, system restore, the command prompt and
 many things else.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Did you try the above steps using the installation media?</b></div>
<div>Yes, but it doesn't help me because it automatically tries to repair my PC when I boot it anyways.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And the OEM version I bought came with a DVD of windows 8. But my computer has no DVD slot, so I inserted the DVD into another computer and made it a ISO file. Then I put it in a bootable USB stick to install windows 8 on my computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>I would also suggest you to check if all the hardware are working fine. You can also check if all the drivers have been installed properly.</b></div>
<div>-How can I do that when I can't boot to the desktop? And I've not noticed any hardware errors. It was a while ago I installed any drivers so I don't think that's the problem. I haven't overclocked anything so I don't think my CPU/GPU has melted...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>-Gilbert-</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Is there anything I can do, or do I just have to do a reset?</div>

            Hi again,
<div><br />
<div>Here are the answers to your questions:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>I would like to know if the computer was working fine earlier</b></div>
<div>- Lately yes, but I had to reset it once due to virus problems, and I think I refreshed it once too. I also had a problem with when I logged in, the screen turned black with just the cursor. But I pressed F8 and used the
<i>sfc /scannow</i> command, and it fixed it. I've gotten the blue screen once before but when that happened it restarted, and maybe the automatic repair fixed it? I'm not sure, it was a while ago. And I don't remember the error code for that blue screen either,
 but I'm sure it wasn't the 0xc000021a error.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Could you please confirm if you have the system builder version of Windows Operating System</b></div>
<div>- The package says with a small font: Windows 8 OEM System Builder</div>
<div>So I think I have the system builder version. But here is a link anyways to the item that I bought
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-Windows-Standard-WN7-00403-English/dp/B009HI2W66/ref=sr_1_1?s=software&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378985555&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=windows+8+oem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>When I type in the last command you told me to do, I have no idea what the Value should be. Sorry, but I don't understand what you're telling me that the value should be. What is "step 1"? Is it step "a" or what is it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried setting the value to 5 and then to 30, but when it boots, the screen is black with a small white stripe blinking. Just like a terminal window. But I can't type anything..</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for all the help!</div>

<h2>            Restore browsing history</h2>
                    I ran system restore in order to recover my deleted browsing history however it did not work. The system did not restore the deleted browsing history. Is there another way I can tackle the issue of recovering my deleted browsing history?

            Let me assure you with 100% certaintly that System Restore doesn't know or care about the browsing history on your system on unspecified make and model with unspecified XP version and Service Pack and unspecified browser.<br />
<br />
I don't know how to recover deleted browser history but you can perform some Google searches and see what you can come up with or somebody else might know.<br />
<br />
The reason SR doesn't care about this stuff is that those would be considered "personal" files and SR doesn't know or care about your personal files.&nbsp; Actually, the SR documentation even says that SR "protects" your personal files by not paying attention to
 them.<br />
<br />
Curiously,&nbsp; there are many Google searches on this topic that suggest SR as Step 1, but I would say that those people have never tried it and don't know how SR works - and you already tried it and confirmed that it does not work.&nbsp; I would say these folks have
 never tried their own ideas to see if they work or not.<br />
<br />
Even a Microsoft Engaged Forum Moderator "expert" suggests in this "Answer" that System Restore is the way (or might be) to recover deleted browsing history, so that means they have not tried it either.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Do you want to try something that might work?&nbsp; "Try" and "might work" do not show much confidence or experience.&nbsp; You either know how to fix something or you don't.&nbsp; You have verified your idea works or you are just guessing.&nbsp; And of course the reply was marked
 as the "Answer" by another forum moderator who probably also has not tried SR to see if it works or not (but...&nbsp; such is life in the MS Answers forums).<br />

    <title>&#91;eSIM Management&#93; Surface Pro LTE - Windows 10 - eSIM using a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> micfranc  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;eSIM Management&#93; Surface Pro LTE - Windows 10 - eSIM using a QR code, is it mandatory to register the operator in the app during the process &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello ! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Question related to the eSIM management in a Microsoft Windows 10 Surface Pro with LTE Advanced.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, we can select an operator if it's registered as an eSIM operator available in the Windows app managing the networks. However,&nbsp;Microsoft support&nbsp;mentions it's also possible to scan a QR code (containing the operator's information) to start the
 connectivity to this operator with eSIM. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question :</strong> If the operator is NOT registered in&nbsp;the Windows Networks app, and that we want to enable eSIM connectivity using a QR code provided by the operator, is it mandatory somewhere in the process to register the operator if we use
 the QR code method ? The goal is to NOT have to register the operator, and therefore simply use a QR code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help !</p>

<p>Hello Barb, </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, thank you for your reply !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, I don't think I could get more help on the Microsoft Business side.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking to get a Surface Pro LTE tablet&nbsp;because it's compatible with eSIM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My operator (where I already have another mobile with them)&nbsp;is providing eSIM connectivity by providing a QR code. I checked with them and they confirm they are not registered in the Microsoft Windows 10 app managing eSIM. They support eSIM connectivity,
 but only by providing a QR code to connect the device to the network.&nbsp; Therefore, if, somewhere during the eSIM process&nbsp;using a QR code, the Windows app&nbsp;asks to select an operator in&nbsp;a pre-defined list of&nbsp;operators&nbsp;(so the operator must be registered in the
 app), then I won't be able to conclude the whole esim connectivity process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the eSIM connectivity could have the QR code as the only requirement, then I will be fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for the help !</p>
